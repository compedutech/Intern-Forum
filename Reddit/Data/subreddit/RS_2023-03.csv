11eom0r,1,2023-02-28,What is my best option as someone with a degree in BIS?,Runah,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11eom0r/what_is_my_best_option_as_someone_with_a_degree/,"Hello! 

Short background: I pivoted majors as a Junior (Pharmacy) and Business was one of the few options that would allow me to graduate on time (2021). Was able to double major in Business Information Systems and Supply Chain Management, though if I could have afforded to take extra semesters I would have pursued CS. 

My first job out of college was as a Scrum Master (solely coaching, no actual technical work). Wasn't feeling fulfilled after a year and took an opportunity to join Salesforce and be a salesperson in software sales. The culture is terrible and I am trying to get back into the technical field. I get so drained I can't even focus on self-studying in the evenings/weekends. 

As someone who is approaching close to two years of being removed from graduation, what paths would you recommend I try?

 I've applied to companies like Dev10, Revature, etc, and have a Data Engineering offer. This would make me move but allow me to work at the same company I previously was a Scrum Master at. Would be a contract worker at a lower salary and then eventually get converted (have to pay an exit fee if I leave beforehand, typical body-shop deal). I'd plan to take evening classes to obtain a post-bacc in CS or a Masters in Cyber Security and get certifications in AWS, Comptia, etc. 

The other option I am considering is to just go back to school entirely and obtain a post-bacc in CS to allow me to apply to internships and new grad roles. Is there a difference between doing an online degree vs in person one from the view of career opportunities/networking events? 

If you have any other opinions please let me know! I only have some knowledge in python but nothing that I think would allow me to get jobs anywhere. Are there any types of roles I could consider with just a BIS degree? It seems that BIS is honestly a terrible return on investment for career paths. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any opinions/advice is appreciated."

11es5th,2,2023-02-28,Final Thoughts In My Head,Final_Solution_92,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11es5th/final_thoughts_in_my_head/,"I finally ordered everything I need to get the job done and the plan is completely finished. It'll arrive in about 3 weeks and I'll do it the following day. Living is painful, full of torment, and just all around a bad time. Yet I still feel sad that I'm going out like this. 

I've spent the last few hours just thinking of the past, the present, and what could have been my future. Overall, the past wasn't too bad, but I wish I had done more things, enjoyed my childhood more. Growing up I was told that school was my job so I took it seriously, I focused on that and nothing else. I managed to get into a good university with a full-ride scholarship which I should be proud of, but I'm not happy. I missed out on childhood, on making memories with friends, forming relationships. I can't go back to the past, what's done is done, nothing will change that.

In the present I'm at my lowest, except instead of only being able to go up I'm just infinitely approaching the limit of my absolute low. Just a constant down, everything in every field just absolutely fails miserably. Class work? Barely passing. Internships? Overwhelming amounts of rejections. Relationships? Absolute train wreck. Even with all this failure I know it's still possible to persevere, to pass my classes with good enough grades, eventually get some career opportunity, finally connect with someone. These failures aren't constant, if I continue to try I will eventually find some form of victory, but I'm tired of trying. I can't keep going. I need to rest. 

I've come to the realization that this desire for rest has overtaken any other desire I might've had. Even if I do accomplish something in life I don't think I'll desire to live anymore. Even if all my problems are solved and I'm given anything and everything I want, I don't think I can live in this world anymore. Any positive outcome will suddenly be overruled by five more negatives, making it negligible. As such, the only thing I can do is to get it over with. I've attempted before, but after some thinking I realized that I didn't want to die, I just preferred to die compared to the alternative of living my current life. Right now, I want to die, I don't know if this mad obsession with finding the perfect method has made me insane or if I am just not thinking right at the moment, but I desire death. The one thing that was stopping me is that I don't want to hurt my family, they don't actually love me, but I still don't want to hurt them. Nonetheless, nowadays I don't care as much, they'll get over it after some time.

With nothing left to stop me I'm ready to finally give myself some peace, but a part of me is just disappointed in me. It's not like I have any regrets in this decision, I can 100% confirm I want to die, but I thought I'd get more out of life before I did. With my planned death day around the corner I can't help but think of what could have been. Had I lived maybe I would have found something or someone that I love enough to overcome my own obsession with death. Maybe I could have made some dreams of mine a reality. Maybe I could have actually enjoyed my life. I wish that in an alternate universe a different me lives that life that I imagined, one where I'm happy. Regardless of what could have been, what matters is what it truly is. I know I won't be able to accomplish much, maybe if I decide not to go through with it I'll eventually find some sort of miniscule accomplishment... maybe.

My preferred method is a fucked up one, best case scenario It'll make me sick to the point I'm bedridden and die without anyone knowing it was a suicide, worst case scenario It'll mess up several systems of my body too fast resulting in a slow and painful death with small evidence of foul play. I'm terrified of putting my body through something like that but I'm willing to endure any pain so long as I can have a death that the people around me will accept, only way to do that is with a natural-looking death. Part of me still wishes to be saved unrealistically but I've tried everything and nothing works, if I had a genuine reason to live maybe I'd care enough about it to keep going, but that won't happen.

9/10 suicides are made on impulse and had the right personnel/resources were available to them they could have been saved. There are many cases of this happening and people successfully persevering and managing to live a happy life. My death won't be part of that statistic, this has been carefully planned over a long period of time. Nonetheless, I would have liked to experience some genuine and happy moments in my life before I die. It's a shame I won't get to experience that, but I'll at least find some peace in my life. 

I doubt anyone actually read this long mess of thoughts but if you did then thank you, I hope you can find some happiness in your life if you haven't already."

I’m looking at getting into software engineering, cyber security or something else in ICT (haven’t fully decided yet)

Here is my situation, I’m hoping someone can give me some advice.

Im currently supporting a family as a full time retail manager, I need to have a job ready to go if I intend to leave this one one day as my priority is putting food on the table and keeping a roof above our heads. This means I can’t follow a pathway that involves casual hours, unpaid internship etc, so ideally I’d like to pursue the study option.

If I wanted to study and gain a qualification that gets me straight into a decent paying position in the field, what would you recommend choosing?

Am I better doing something like a Bachelor degree or a Cert IV?"

11eudgo,1,2023-02-28,Chance Incoming Junior Transfer,Neoliberalshill_,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/11eudgo/chance_incoming_junior_transfer/,"I am currently a Sophomore Finance major at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I have completed 3 semesters. Here are my stats:

Demographics: Just turned 20 y/o male.

College GPA: 3 semesters 59 completed credits. 4.0 GPA (straight As).

High School GPA/Transcript: 3.3 weighted on a 5 scale, string upward trend (C's &amp; D's during my freshman year and semester one of sophomore year, B's and B-'s during my second semester, I finished semester 1 of my junior year with B's, B+s and one or two A's, I finished semester 2 of my junior year and both semesters of my senior year with near straight A's. I also frequented the Dean's List/ Honour Roll during each quarter AND semester from the beginning of my junior year through the end of my senior year.)

SAT: Attempt 1: 660 English &amp; 670 Math. Attempt 2: 710 Math &amp; 540 English. Superscore: 1370 with a 710 Math and 660 English.

ECs: Consulting/M&amp;A intern at a middle market consulting firm on Chicago's S LaSalle St. President of a Quant club. I am also the first student at my school for the class of 2025 to be the president of a student org. I'm on the executive board of two other finance clubs. I am also in the honors college and a business scholar. I was also invited to an exclusive networking event that the top 1-2 percent of each graduating class was invited to. Ongoing volunteer at FMSC to pack meals, and involved in a pre-law society as a regular fellow.

Rec Letters: Strong rec letters, My compu-sci professor attended Northwestern as an MBA student and received an MBA in Finance -- the exact MBA plan I plan on implementing at NU. The other professor is an accounting professor. Both are professors from my first and second semesters at university, respectively. Additionally, one from my family friend/therapist/career coach who has been with me though my low points in life through now and has offered to write a rec letter for me. He has helped me significantly and has seen me grow. Maybe another rec letter from my mentor at my internship as he transferred during his undergrad as well.

Essays: strong essays including a 650 word common app non-school-specific personal statement that doubles as a ""why transfer from your current institution"" essay. In regards to my supplemental essays and my ""why this major essay"", I was very specific about my career and why I am a finance major, the whole nine yards. That is, the whole nine yards for every other essay I submitted as well.

Misc: In the additional information section I wrote about how I went through domestic violence and bullying from 8th grade up until the 2nd semester of my sophomore year. In my covid statement I also explained to them why I didn't join clubs during my junior &amp; senior years of high school.

School specific misc: My professor didn't mention he was a Kellogg alum who obtained the same degree I plan on obtaining at the graduate level so I plan on uploading a ""other document"" on the NU-specific common app section purveying my gratitude for his teachings and time to write me a rec letter while mentioning that he obtained an MBA in Finance from Kellogg.

Those were my stats, here are the programs I am applying to. One note, I will be applying to the finance/business programs of each of these schools. However, some schools like Northwestern don't have undergrad business programs. So for schools like those I will be applying to their Econ programs. So here are the schools I plan on applying to for finance/econ/business:

UIUC Geis, Northwestern, washu Olin, UMich Ross direct OOS, usc Marshall, Cornell Dyson, uchicago, vandy, northeastern, NYU Stern, Penn Wharton.

What are my chances at a lot of these top 25 schools including Urbana? Also, which tier of schools should I shoot for? Would it be worth it for me to apply to HYPSM? I would greatly appreciate your feedback. PM me or comment, which ever is easier for you. The more feedback, the better! If the information provided is insufficient in aiding your decision-making then by all means inform me on the matter."

I have some experience with programming courses, but nothing practical. All the words like AJAX and SQL scare me bc I'm completely unfamiliar with them, and I've never used GitHub. 

I definitely won't be getting an internship this summer('23). but like are there any courses, certifications, programs, activities, etc that I could do? Looking back, what do you wish you had done before college or during high school? That could maybe guarantee I land something in summer '24. Any languages you recommend learning? I feel like knowing a few languages and having a few projects won't be enough, so I'm wondering what I could do to give myself an edge over everyone else.

I was posting here in hopes that someone could provide so much-needed wisdom. I recently applied and got an offer letter for a Comp-Scie internship for the summer of 2023. I did the resume, interviews, etc. and now I was doing the pre-employment process. This is where my issue occurred, they did a background check on me and I received it today with a reported flag for employment history for one of my previous employers. I was certain my dates were correct or within a reasonable time span. The flag says I started working at my previous company roughly a year and a month later than what I mentioned. After searching through old photos, I found my 1099 tax form for my previous employer for 2020 when I stated I began working. I emailed the background company with this hoping I could fix this issue. After this, I realized what the issue could possibly be when I first started at my previous employer I was considered a self-employed contract worker and later down the line they had a project which required me to be paid hourly which I recall doing normal work paperwork. This is where I believe my discrepancy occurred. Should I reach out to my contact at my upcoming internship before they reach out to me? Do you think they will rescind my offer? How should I go about fixing this?"

1. DECA advisor: 8/10, was my entrepreneurship teacher + she originally rejected me from my school's DECA leadership team during applications, but personally asked to me join again after 2 months and I wanted her to show her side of the story for that since I briefly mentioned it in a few essays
2. English Teacher: 9/10, he manages the magazine club previously mentioned, had him for 11th grade, super helpful and kind, according to my counselor this was the best LOR I've received
3. STEM teacher: 8/10, I had her for bio and anatomy, always interested in my extracurriculars and very eager to help when I ask her questions, I've always struggled with stem subjects so I hope she can showcase my grit and creativity when it came to difficult situations
4. Counselor: 6/10? tbh not too sure, I usually spend lunches in counseling center at my school if I don't have a club meeting + my friends and I help out there sometimes as well, but I don't see my counselor often

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview**

USC: Messed up in my video interview for 1 question, didn't really know how to answer -&gt; gave a somewhat generic answer :/ did not like the format at all and didn't vibe with how there was no human interviewer

Babson: Went really well, interviewed for a lil over 1 hr, talked about college and life after college and then about interviewers children lmao

Northwestern: Messed up a bit on a question bc I didn't completely understand the question + he was in a car for some reason, but interviewer was pretty interested in my ECs, Talked for around 50 mins? also talked about his son for a bit lmfao

UPenn: Interviewer was really nice, talked for maybe 1.5 hrs, he had around 15 questions or so, talked about college application process + ECs + friend groups + life after college

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

Common app main essay  (7/10): theme of self-improvement connected to a form of ancient cultural art, tbh i've read my essays too much to properly judge them, but I think it represented me pretty well but the writing was choppy

Supplements (7/10): idk what to say, but pretty much same as my main essay

UC: i did not like my UC essays.

11ew01j,1,2023-03-01,What are some good Udemy courses that teach popular tech stacks for someone that is already experienced with programming?,KiesAgent,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/11ew01j/what_are_some_good_udemy_courses_that_teach/,"Background: I just graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in December 2022 and I'm having a hard time looking for a job. I am aware that my resume/experience is absolutely terrible for two main reasons: no internships and not having projects with high in demand tech stacks.

Well, since I can't fix not having internships, imo the only thing I can do is to improve on the latter.

While browsing entry-level/new grad job postings, I notice that a lot of them ask for experience in these technologies/frameworks:

\- jQuery.

\- React.

\- Angular.

\- Django.

\- Node.js

\- Spring/Spring Boot

\- C# / .NET

\- Docker / Kubernetes.

\- REST API.

So, what are some good Udemy courses that would cover these and give me a good foundation of them? I'm fine with taking multiple courses since I'm using their Personal Plan, which would give me unlimited access to the majority of courses on Udemy.

My goal is to take the recommended courses, build projects with the acquired knowledge and put them on my resume and portfolio. Feel free to suggest other frameworks that you also think a lot of employers are looking for. Thanks a lot!"

I am looking to pursue a Masters degree in either Software Engineering or Computer Science, in order to get a better job. I passed a lot of interviews for various prestigious companies like Bloomberg, CrowdStrike and Amazon, but got ghosted in the end. Until now, I only worked in outsourcing, on very old and badly designed applications, which pursued me to make the choice of studying abroad.

Now that the context's clear, here are my views of studying in US vs EU

United States (Pros):

* Way better market, way more opportunities for personal growth
* Salaries are double, taxes are half compared to EU, while CoL is similar
* English speaking country
* Shorter MS programs, 1 year

United States (Cons):

* Visa problems: Failing to secure a job with OPT means I'll have to live US, and most likely work in my own country 3 years just to pay the tuition
* $40k-60k/year just for the tuition (I am not brilliant enough to secure a scholarship)
* Way more competition than in EU
* Very far from home

European Union (Pros):

* Tuition is almost free, at max is $3k/year
* Low risk, no visa problem

European Union (Cons):

* Almost any country has it's own language, only speaking EU country left is Ireland
* Almost all programs are 2 years here
* A lot of internships require the applicant to speak the country in which the job is located at business level

Based on this, feel free to add anything to pros and cons and cast your vote on what would you choose if you were in my situation.

# Alien-Nation Chapter 157: Over a Barrel

******

Amilita told Borzun to *never* mention the barrels, to anyone, and had her swear it on her father’s virtue. While the Lieutenant Colonel wasn’t *sure* they were the same, the inquiry could be damaging enough. She’d stalled by requisitioning the captured railgun for ‘evidential analysis,’ but knew she couldn’t keep it out of the hands of the base’s quartermistress forever. The woman could weld together a bicycle on short notice, so she could probably tell the exact grade and whether it matched the shipment Goshen had requisitioned in Maryland.

“What do you think?”

Lieutenant Goshen crouched, knees popping audibly. “I think it looks familiar,” she confessed. “It’s the same diameter. Though, it’s a *fairly* standard diameter.”

“Not standard enough,” Amilita grumbled unhappily, placing both hands on her desk as she leaned back against the desk and pushed against it, stretching. “If that gets out…”

“Then it’s the fault of someone who let go of non-blacklisted items, knowing full well where they were headed. We don’t know for certain what happened to them. It’s not like there are serials on something this commonplace.”

“You said he disappeared,” Amilita recalled. Of course it had to happen on an under-the-table op she’d requested Goshen leave on. Ultimately, then, the blame rested at her feet for this.

“And Lesha told me to stop moping that I’d gotten ‘ghosted,’ instead of chasing leads,” Goshen shot back. “Eventually, you’ll learn to trust my instincts.”

“Look at where they’ve gotten us!” Snapped Amilita, waving a hand. She’d hoped a close brush with death might have taught some hesitation, but it seemed the Lieutenant’s behavior was ingrained. “I’m going to have to advise *against* your promotion.”

Goshen’s jaw dropped. “What!?” she all but shrieked.

“How many marines would still be alive now, if you hadn’t done what you did? Would the building still be standing!? Trading them to that ‘Garm’ man for information that they probably *knew* we’d soon find out, given Ministriva was murdered within the week and his calling card left behind. The name cost them *nothing* , and look at what they gained for it.” Amilita stopped stretching to stare down the lanky Goshen.

“We got confirmation,” Goshen countered angrily. “It’s not *my* fault Bal’shir was a useless governess. She took bribes to let *anyone* with the credits to get a pass to come visit her ‘green zone’ on phony work and internship contracts. She’d pocket the credits herself, and kept trying to keep up the facade that ‘everything’s fine,’ so she could keep up the lucrative racket, I bet. She’d made a whole career out of burying every problem that came her way, handing them off to the next person. Meanwhile, Emperor used that leniency to grow. If we’d just *jumped* on him-”

“Jumped on *who* , Goshen? We didn’t have any real leads on who he was back then, and we *still* don’t. The sting teams keep getting compromised, turned, or otherwise sent in circles. The *only* win this week was finding that garage making bows-and-arrows, and that *may* have just been an unregistered cottage industry that didn’t want to bother with regulations. That new tip to check out a few old warehouses hasn’t produced much of anything. They turned out to be full of *literal* crap, and the one along the river smelled so bad that the Rakiri passed out when she tried to sniff for suspects!”

Amilita pounded the desk beside her hip in fury for emphasis. While the sound and sensation was satisfactory, she immediately remembered how fragile human goods were. Slowly, she unclenched her fists, expecting to feel the pain of splinters in her palm, only to see the Chestnut had remained strong. She let out a sigh of relief, then glared up at Goshen, who looked surprisingly vulnerable.

“You’re *really* going to do this? I’m…depths, Amilita. I know the ranks don’t move like they did in our parents’ time, let alone like it did in *their* parents’ time. But I want to buy a house, I want to start a family, how am I going to afford a ticket to a ball on a Lieutenant’s salary? I’m a bit over twenty six in human years. They call women ‘old maids’ down here if they’re unmarried by twenty three!” There was real pain on her face, spliced with a bit of panic. Goshen could take incoming mortar rounds, but not another year of being a Lieutenant, or so it seemed.

Amilita was torn. She could try to protect herself, and throw Goshen under the bus. But then, Goshen knew about the plot to stop Azraea if she ever enacted her plan to bombard the state, if ever she felt her intel was good enough to avoid killing the noblewomen. Denied her promotion, Goshen might then flip sides. What would Azraea do, once presented with the news? Probably boot *both* of their careers out of a metaphorical airlock, given her general dislike of the interior as a ‘giant sorority of professional backstabbers.’

“...Goshen, you’re on thin ice,” Amilita warned. “I’ve already told you that if you do anything wrong, one last slip up, and it’s…‘ *three strikes and you’re out* ,’ clear?” Goshen bobbed her head obediently. Even if Amilita doubted she understood the meaning of the words, the threat was clear enough. Just to be sure, she added: “Last chance.” 

She reached down and pulled her omni-pad out of her desk, and then groaned as yet *another* Emperor vid had apparently dropped onto the old human network. “A good start of something productive to do would be for you to find out where these are broadcasting from-” as the old nation’s opening theme notes ended, displaying the masked Emperor.

Her translator kicked on, Goshen leaning in to watch. “Today we struck a blow for democracy, itself under threat by our occupying forces. Within the building, they planned to monitor the election. Every which way a person voted, donated, and then they were going to arrest anyone who voted the wrong way.”

“A baseless charge. We were going to *investigate* \-” Amilita was interrupted as a second notification popped up. And then a third. More and more videos were dropping, it seemed. “What…in the…?”

“It’s for the best you didn’t get rid of me,” Goshen whispered worriedly. “I’ve got another feeling.”

“Don’t,” Amilita’s one word of whispered warning was all she could manage.

Azraea knocked on the door, then taking long steps as she strode to Amilita’s desk, her armor granting weight to every step.

“This is his plan- he’s going to make a grab for power. This is *it* , Amilita.” The Lieutenant pointed at the omni-pad the governess-general carried as it displayed a frozen still from the Emperor’s most recent recorded message, then at the different one that had been playing on Amilita’s omni-pad. “He’s about to make his move.”

“I think you’re right,” Azraea said, coming to lean against Amilita’s desk. “It’s time.”

“Are you sure?” Amilita asked.

“It’s either this, or we start the bombardment, barring some other plan you can imagine.”

Amilita grimaced, wracking her brain. How had it come to this? “I don’t like either plan, but I’ll take your Plan A over *that* . Wasn’t there a secondary plan, something neither Plan A nor Plan C?”

“They blew it up,” Azraea shrugged. “This is what they built toward for months. That is why we can never leave. The moment we do, they’ll just kick it all back down again.”

“Are you saying that they knew? They waited for us to finish the project, just so they could break it? That they recorded endless footage, prepared for a mass release?” That seemed rather paranoid. Was Azraea starting to crack under the pressure of her briefings? Between reporting to the other governesses and military officers, and noblewomen who were tired of their missing members, was she starting to fray?

“They *do* have an *amazing* ability to see everything coming, to take in the complete picture, complete with the scale they need to operate on. It’s like they’ve planned everything we might ever do…even when we think we’ve gotten a step ahead, we find that we’ve played right into their hands. They *always* intended this revolution to grow. That kind of ambition…that kind of mind…he knew. They must have planned for this. So it’s time for us to go on the offensive, or else we lose as Bal’Shir did.  First New York, recently Maryland…now he’s cementing his gains here. I can’t believe how far ahead he’s planned all this, it’s amazing how precisely he scaled up his revolution.”

## Scope

I gazed around the recently finished table at Camp Death.

“The…geopolitical situation of the conflict is actually far larger than I realized. As a consequence, our operations must grow.” I hated announcing my failures to people who believed in me. Our success as an insurgency depended upon their faith in my plans. But if I was to make use of their valuable input in reanalyzing the situation with me, I needed to be as clear and honest with them as I hoped they could be with me. “We need to pivot to scale this revolution up. I think it’s time that we grew past our border in Delaware.”

“What do you mean?” Hex asked. “We’re doing well.”

I looked down at the map table, old delivery routes penned in and last used for that long before the internet. But the basic structure hadn’t changed. Besides, it wasn’t the age of the map as to why we were too scoped in.

“The situation the Shil’ are in isn’t too different from our own, here at Camp Death. Neither of us can stay in place forever.” 

We'd need trucks delivering a constant supply of food, fuel for the generators, and so on. It was a good thing we had Bancroft now, among other Shil’vati swept warehouses. Now that they’d been marked ‘clear’ and we’d confirmed they didn’t leave anything behind, we felt more comfortable using them.

“I imagine they’ve got a difficult supply chain issue with getting troops, rations, armor, and whatever else the fleet needs out here. Earth’s somewhat along their frontier, and we’ve kept the fleet far longer than they were supposed to stay. *Way* past their timetable. They’re probably coming up on the length of their deployment, let alone this mission.”

How long had it been since Amilita had seen her husband and son?

“At some point, they’re probably supposed to need a refit and rearm, or rotate out. When they do, will they carry stories that match what they’re telling the rest of the Empire about Earth?”

That got me some blank stares. Ah, right. They hadn’t used anything but the severely antiquated, omni-pads we’d been given, isolated on their own network. These past few weeks had blown my perspective out of the water. How large a gulf had opened? Would I be at risk of forgetting or drifting from my humanity, the more I drank from the [river Lethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe) that was the Shil’vati DataNet?

I reached down and put on the table a brass-based globe. While its faded old surface still recognized Germany as being split in two among several other anachronisms, it did the only job I needed of it: Pointing out just how *small* Delaware was.

Looking at the familiar shape of its continents, I knew that I was no shade. I still lived and drew breath. I could learn, and convey what I’d learned to the others, who in turn would help me propel this revolution beyond its current borders. We’d *have* to.

“They’ll all go home. They’re not deployed here for life, after all. A fresh rotation inheriting a complete mess might start demanding answers as to *how* the situation got so bungled before it was passed to their hands. The ones here will do just about *anything* to stop that, I bet. In order to save their own necks.”

I glanced at the globe, then at the map, and reached for our pile of color-coded pins.

I stuck a red pin into the top of where Delaware was on the globe. Then, carefully, as if I were priming a detonator, I pinned a blue one just to the west of the first, demarcating the location of another base. Then I glanced at the map again, and a third pin went in, just a bare millimeter away, then I glanced up from the globe, the pile of them that still had to go in, and I slowly swept my gaze over the gathered lieutenants, who for their part seemed confused.

“Even if I had the [Mercator Effect ](https://i.imgur.com/c9pfaUg.png)magnifying Delaware, the heads of the pins would be touching as they do now. If I were to populate Delaware on this little globe with all the pins on the map, I’d have nothing left of our state.”

I hesitated for effect.

“Do you see what this means?”

The idea of being able to have something, even illegal and horrendous things done almost anywhere on the map that covered the table at a mere word was enough to be both scary and, yes, exhilarating. But then I could also spin and then stop with a finger on practically any landmass on the globe, and there I had no more power than I did when I lived as ‘Elias Sampson’. Perhaps less, even, given Elias Sampson at least had his face plastered on billboards in other states and was the well-known romantic interest of a noble house. Well, *had been* the well-known romantic interest. I tried to ignore how badly that stung, and I absentmindedly massaged my aching chest.

“…What we have done here is so small…” Hex almost whispered. “All our suffering, all our gains, insignificant…”

“No,” I cut her off quickly. I’d wanted to issue a reality check, not to crush our motivation. This was why I’d forewent grabbing more globes, and then pointing out that we’d need more globes than we could fit into Camp Death just to represent the Shil’vati Empire’s chunk of the galaxy. “Our sacrifices are in no way trivial.” Least of all hers. “When I stare down at the map-” I thumped the table’s surface for emphasis, ignoring how it shook on the still-settling command cabin boards. “-it feels easy to grant myself delusions of grandeur. To believe that we are somehow *close to winning* . I’ve even been reliably informed that we are a threat to the Empire itself. I have had to ask myself: ‘*How*’?”

Silence answered.

“No one else can see how we’re a threat to their Empire?” I’d hoped someone might’ve been able to see what I hadn’t grasped from Amilita’s words, but so far there were no volunteers. “If it carries more weight, these were the words of a Shil’vati military officer.” I saw Larry shift, as he remembered meeting with Amilita. “Still no ideas? This state isn’t the only red one. For a measure of how scared they are of us, they dispatched their second in command of the whole fleet to stop us, need I remind anyone. They’ve committed to a major troop surge here, on her orders. So, what *do* we have that the others don’t, that makes *us* a threat?”

“Cult of personality?” Verns finally ventured. “You’re challenging their Empress, after all.”

Had he forgotten that I’d at first first let everyone at the bar add ‘little’ to my moniker just to appease his own sensibilities around that? “No, no,” I waved my hand to push the idea away. “I understand that it is the fear that we might *grow* . If that is what the enemy fears most, then that *should* be our course of action. Perhaps we should have already started, but our successes here required our focus.” I stretched muscles sore after sparring, placing my hands behind my back. “So, if we do commit to growing beyond Delaware’s border, then what will that cause?”

“It would force them to deploy those extra troops here to the neighboring states as well, finally giving us some breathing room,” G-Man answered. At last, meaningful input!

“Yeah. They *might* share some troops across borders, but we’d probably get a head start before they talk with each other,” Verns jumped in, following his son’s lead.

“Excellent points.” I turned to face Hex, who still looked ‘out of it’, and I unclasped my hands from the small of my back to put a reassuring hand on her shoulder, waiting until her green eyes were boring into my mask. “Our sacrifices are not insignificant. They have paved the way for us. I promise, we will *never* forget them.”

That seemed to pull Hex out of her stupor, I noticed, and she took my hand in hers and gave it a slight squeeze, with a quiet ‘thanks.’

I turned back to the table, finally glad everyone could put their minds to the puzzle before me.

I used to get vertigo just *looking* at the map and trying to scope out far enough to envision the whole of Delaware- a tiny state with a population of less than a million. Now I tried to imagine it on the face of a nation of over three hundred and fifty times that size, and then, tried to envision the world. My mind strained to consider what it’d take to get there. From somewhere deep, a part of me protested under the strain. I could in a flash see what I’d gone through already. The screams, the smell of burning flesh where lasers had seared clean through. I could process that *later* , I kept telling myself. There was something inside me threatening to rebel, I knew, something that hurt. Maybe I could grow from the pain, like muscles after lifting, or pain during sparring sessions.

I turned to Hex, glad it hid my haunted expression. She cocked her head, listening patiently while I tried to pull my head back into the right space.

They had not seen what I had, so how could I get them to understand, or truly comprehend it? I wished for that three-dimensional map I’d seen to be here, somehow, and somehow for the various endless speculation on our insurgency, taking place in systems flung as far on the opposite end of the galaxy as the Shil’vati DataNet reached. I just could definitely live *without* them seeing some of the merchandise.

“Well, they can’t leave,” Binary said softly. “If they do, I mean, it’d be even worse for us. Earth would face another invasion, all over again. And the consortium- I mean, they might…” she glanced at Sam, not wanting to kick up another argument.

“It would be a bit of a show of weakness for them,” I admitted. “And if they lose Earth to a rival power, that’d shake the faith of every border world they’ve got. So, why *else* can’t they leave? Outside of optics, I mean.”

“Well, for starters, if they left with everyone…well, we’d probably win in just a few weeks. Drag down whoever’s collaborating, toss them in a meat grinder, and be done with this bullshit,” Verns chuckled. “Even if they left behind all the shil’vati Marines, we’d wear them down in a couple years. They have to keep rotating troops through.”

“Exactly. And if we manage to take Earth, it gets a lot more expensive to station troops over us. They’d have to know that they’re *hated* by the zone’s occupants, on that beautiful blue-and-green ball of life below, while they toil on Mars to make it liveable. That they fucked it up, and that they’ve been rejected, and that they have to keep tossing resources at us anyways.”

“I’m sorry, you lost me a while back,” Larry said, rubbing at his temples. “What are you getting at?”

Hex surprisingly stepped in. “Either they’ve gotta commit a whole fleet- which is a *lot* of planets’ combined resources. Like, even major shipyard systems *don’t* have their own fleet protecting them, unless they’re in some kind of danger.” 

“Right!” Binary followed up from her sister and I. “Apparently, in most Shil’vati systems, there’s practically no defenses at all. A warship might pass through for a refit or re-armament and to be staffed, but it’s not generally there to *do* anything within their own empire. The frontier worlds away from the border get *maybe* a shared picket ship across a few systems. Just enough to defend against piracy, discourage smuggling, or raise an alert after checking in after something has gone wrong, like a roach raid. I mean, Earth’s kind of a border world, but it still wouldn’t warrant much attention, *normally* . It has a phase point or two from the Consortium, I bet. Something they can interdict, but even setting those phase interruptors takes a lot of time and effort.”

Her words hung over the table for a bit, and I tapped at my chin thoughtfully. “Alright, so the shil’ imagine themselves the masters of the galaxy- and that means most of their forces are positioned along the boundary systems. But if they have a whole exploration fleet stuck holding position over one planet, then what does that mean to them?”

“Logistically? They’ll have to keep flying food in. Flying people in. Troop rotations.” Sam guessed.

Hex levelled her gaze at me. “When the troops get to their home systems, they’ll start telling the truth that everyone *hates* them. It’ll be awful for the Empire.”

“Wait, they’re lying?” Sam asked, bewildered.

“They’re lying,” I confirmed, thinking of the videos, and how I’d been used to push propaganda, that Delaware was a ‘green zone.’ They seemed *desperate* to find ways to not only stop me, but to make our movement look marginalized. But as I’d reflected, we’d had too many lucky breaks for it to really *all* be just luck. How many people had seen something suspicious, and just decided to just not report it? Tacit, quiet approval went a long way to successful operations.

“Well, how’s that a problem for them, really?” Verns asked. “A Government lies every day that ends in ‘y,’ it’s hardly news.”

I paused. How did I explain Shil’vati society, as it viewed itself? “Well, it’s more that our rejection of them more reflects a total breakdown and failure on their part. Their fleet, their governance, all of it is supposed to reflect the Empire. Every one of them tried in their own way to beat us, to convince all humanity to come join them. Admitting failure would mean their Data Teams and Interior weren’t smart enough to find us and root us out. That their Marines couldn’t crush us. Their Naval officers, the pride of their military, couldn’t think of a strategy clever enough to prevail against, no offense, but a bunch of men, which to them is just humiliating. Their Noblewomen, representatives of all the Shil’vati are supposed to be, couldn’t manage to convince us, either. All their economic and material gains across countless star systems? Rejected by us, in favor of preferring to just be left alone.”

Hex backed me up. “Yeah. It’d be like…your crush rejecting you, times the population of an entire planet. And even worse, they reject your whole system, your way of doing things. It’d hurt. It’d probably drive them crazy. All the horrors they’ve done, they were necessary evils to them, all of it was done to help us, to save us from Mutually Assured Destruction, environmental collapse. Or, well, pick your cause of mass death on Earth. We’d be saying back: *we’d rather die* .”

“You said they’re worried we’ll spread, and that they’ve been lying,” Verns considered. “Those two facts are probably linked. Impossible to keep on pretending they’re winning, and that, like you said, ‘it’s just a matter of time’ if we manage to spread. They can’t hold up the lie anymore. Bad enough to fail, but lying about failing, when the consequence is losing their new crown jewel, while the whole galaxy’s watching?”

It occurred to me that what Verns said was a contradiction. How could I be famous as Emperor, leader of a rebellion, if they were busy lying that everything on Earth was fine? Why had they even acknowledged my existence? Thankfully, Binary chipped in immediately and answered my question before I could even put my thoughts to words.

“Maryland’s also been red since day one. This fits their conception of the situation on Earth. ‘We just need to be patient, give it more time,’ or ‘the situation’s just delicate and we’re overseeing peacekeeping,’ or whatever line they’re feeding the rest of the galaxy about why there are red zones. Sometimes it’s even environmental, like Chernobyl. But when Emperor killed a *major* governess? That was too much to ignore, especially when he exposed her crimes. It was too big a scandal-”

“-Wait, hold on. How was Ministriva a ‘major’ governess?” I asked, interrupting.

“Ministriva wasn’t just a governess. I mean, to *us* she was, but apparently, she was a big-shot system governess.”

“Wait, as in, she ran a whole solar system?” Why was I only learning of this *now*? I’d had some time alone with Natalie’s omni-pad, browsing the Shil’vati DataNet, learning all I could. With the whole galaxy’s knowledge at my fingertips, I’d been uncertain about looking her up, trying to look up things that were benign or unrelated to the insurgency. Basic infantry military doctrine would probably have set off too many flags, so I’d saved it for last before finally abandoning the omni-pad and my life as Elias. Perhaps prematurely, now with Myrrah known to be gone. Or perhaps not, now that Natalie wasn’t answering. I tried to force myself into accepting that going back was an unnecessary risk.

I was so lost in thought that I realized I wasn’t even listening to Hex, and dutifully brought my mind back to the present.

“...one at that. She insisted her nieces were running planets and were admirals all on their own merits, which is a bit strange, considering the Shil’ wouldn’t have cared either way. Ministriva liked to give speeches about how being a noble wasn’t a big deal, but…she really was someone quite important.”

I blinked. That was news to me, even. I hadn’t looked her up. With that kind of power, why on earth had she settled for a title as ‘governess Delaware,’ of all places? Was it some kind of slight between noblewomen, to stick someone such influence with such a tiny, unimportant zone?

“Uh, right. I’d say a fair few are. Most, even, probably.” That tracked. Almost none of the noble hostages we’d taken were anything less than planetary governesses in their own rights. “And Ministriva, despite being powerful, wasn’t exactly popular amongst her peers.” So it *had* been some kind of slight to stick her with us. “As I was saying, they think their victory is inevitable, always ‘right around the corner,’ because the alternative is unthinkable to them.”

“Unthinkable? What would it mean to them if we, I don’t know, *won* a major fight, or made another state into a red zone?”

“If we manage that, then…I don’t know?”

“They’re keeping a whole fleet over our heads, something they’re straining to do without mobilizing, and even that’s not proving enough to stop us. They’d have to accept they’ve lost any chance of getting Earth to comply peacefully.”

“You mean they’ll glass the planet?”

“No way. There’s this species called ‘The Roaches,’ that the Shil’vati tried integrating before us. Rather than comply when defeat was inevitable, The Roaches nuked their own home planet just to kill a few more shil’, and started living nomadically among the stars. The Empress vowed to never let the situation devolve like that ever again, and yet here they are.” At least I’d found *that* out, under ‘prior first contact events,’ and I was relieved my time with the omni-pad hadn’t been a complete waste.

“So…when they give up that they’ll just…leave?” Verns asked, dubious. “Even if it means losing Earth completely?”

“Won’t that leave Earth- I mean, all of us, vulnerable?” Hex asked, suddenly nervous.

“They wouldn’t leave us all behind, would they?” Her sister echoed.

“Well…” I said. “...more like they *can* leave, but *won’t* . I don’t have a perfect grasp on the situation, but Earth’s popular in the eyes of the broader galaxy. Famous, even.” I didn’t want to bring up my own fame, but I realized I was talking from the Shil’s perspective. Specifically, gushing the way Natalie did when I’d once pointed out I didn’t understand why they thought Earth was all that interesting, given how the Shil’ had a rich and longer, better-documented history of their own it might take an entire lifetime to understand. I remembered her earnest excitement. *It can’t not be. Earth’s a massive galactic genetic oddity. A pre-contact civilization on one planet that can read, write, and is industrialized and is full of, you know, attractive men who happen to also find us attractive? That’s automatically the most fascinating thing we’ve found amongst the stars that I can think of.* 

Most of the time the Shil’ showed up, the civilization was either stuck in a medieval period, or were spacefaring in their own right and needed a show of force to convince them to stand down. Often, the civilization they bumped into thought they could take on the Shil’vati Empire. And they had a far greater technological edge than we did. They’d have at least colonized their own solar system, or made the jump to a few neighboring systems. In either event, they were also less interesting, because interspecies couplings were *exceedingly* rare. There, males were guarded jealously. We probably would’ve gotten to one of those within the next couple centuries, maybe been well underway on terraforming Mars and colonizing the asteroid belts, for example, assuming we didn’t blow ourselves up, first, or die of something else.

I’d even messaged her, asking if we could talk.

Silence, which was effectively a ‘no.’

I rubbed at my chest, feeling the dull ache slowly diffuse.

“Emperor?” I realized I’d drifted off into space.

“Mmm?” I asked. “Sorry, was just thinking about…something else for a moment. Where was I?”

“You were saying why the Shil’vati wouldn’t just give up and leave?” Verns asked, as if somewhat disappointed.

“Right. They *won’t* give up.”

“Why?” His tone turned almost accusatory. It occurred to me that perhaps that was his hoped-for outcome.

“Because Hex is right. If humanity’s collective answer to when we’ll join is ‘never,’ then it’ll kick off some soul-searching, maybe even a bit of a freak out. That’s kind of what Operation Town Hall is going to be about- making it *very* clear what our answer is.”

“Well, we need to consider what they’ll do, then,” Larry said. “It does us no good if their ‘freak out’ includes deciding to blow up Earth, if they can’t have it.”

“They wouldn’t,” Verns chuckled. “Sour grapes, I can see. But that kind of spite?”

“At worst, if we kick them off the planet and give our answer pretty plain and clear, I see them refusing to defend us unless we agree to something close to what they originally wanted. Except, if we kick them off, I’m pretty sure the other factions might be a little concerned with stepping foot on Earth.”

“They’d still try, though,” Hex countered. “They wouldn’t be gentle about it, either, if they’re investing enough to risk a war with the Empire. A Shil’ marine dies, the Shil’ fall back and up-armor their next patrol after demanding answers from everyone on the block about what they saw. But the Alliance might just bomb the city block it happened on, without so much as an apology. And if the Consortium shows up, we can forget about blending in. The Nighkru will snatch anyone they can get their hands on and sell them.”

“The last thing they might do is hold position indefinitely. That’s *expensive* for them, but not impossible. It’ll be even more expensive if they hold fast to not developing Earth technologically until we comply. So either we’ll get more technology to fend off other invaders with, or they’ll have to ship everything in-system. That is going to be hard for them to do with a fleet-sized operation. Not impossible, mind you, but it’s definitely a rather *serious* undertaking, and it would still require them acknowledging that their first attempt failed. That is something the current crop of people stationed here seem to be willing to do anything to keep from getting out. The way I see it, we’ve got the fleet here in a real bind. And if we expand, we’ll put pressure on them. Whatever happens from here, we’ve got to hold tight.”

Everyone in the circle nodded. “Alright, let’s take a break for now.”

**Party Man**

Vendetta approached me first, and quietly, he all but demanded an answer.

“Tell me again, why *isn’t* Plan ‘C’ Plan ‘A’? You said it yourself. We can’t *stay* here any more than the Shil’ can. We could kick it off, get some use out of this place. Punch ‘em in the nose, get them bloody.” I could hear the urging in his voice.

“It’s too risky,” I admitted, and I could hear him cough dismissively.

“Come on. That’s pathetic.”

I was instantly offended. Hadn’t I just risked plenty enough?

“We’re still confined here in Delaware. We’ve got the election coming up. There are plans still in motion where if we fail it doesn’t reflect badly on us as a movement. At worst, we’d just be handed a setback, rather than a true defeat. It doesn’t risk anyone’s necks, gives us time to train all the *thousands* of new recruits we’re getting almost every day.”

“Yeah, yeah…” but I could tell he wasn’t convinced. “Just, with the way you were describing what we needed, to really get them to re-think what’s going on down here, I thought it might be time.”

“Plan C’s not an attack. I’m not sure it’d force them to reconsider their situation here. I *hope* it does, if it comes down to using it. But so far, going on the offensive has been our forte. So I think if we started making in-roads to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, launching strikes there, we’ll continue to do well. Speaking of other plans, how did donating to the opponents of our candidates go? Have the Shil’vati done anything in response?”

“We have the candidates under observation. The interior paid them a… rather terse visit,” Verns said with a wolfish grin, tapping a manila folder and laying it on the map, careful to avoid all the figurines and marks we’d left on it. The map was getting full with how many simultaneous strikes were going off. At this rate, we’d run the Shil’ ragged. “Look how nervous the poor sucker is,” Verns chuckled.

I picked up the top grainy printed out photograph. There the pro-shil’ candidate was, his eyes wide, mouth open. One hand splayed on his chest, the other pointing elsewhere in his house, while two agents of the interior stared at him, arms crossed.

I looked up from the photo, closing the folder. “Excellent start. What if the Shil’ retaliate by blocking campaign spending on candidates?”

Verns’s smile split broad. “You’ll have just accomplished what *years* of public protesting for campaign finance reform couldn’t. Hell, if they do ban it, we’ll hire some lobbyists. See if we can get those banned from Capitol Hill for our next trick.”

I nodded my head. “Good point. Anything else to report?”

“I’m worried about our own candidates’ well-being.”

“What? Why?”

“There’s an…emerging problem. As you know, while you’re enjoying public support, there’s a very entrenched, active group opposed to you. And they’re pushing for political agitation. I’ve got a feeling it’ll turn violent, fast. Protestors outside our candidates’ houses.”

“Yeah? What are they saying our candidates are doing that’s so wrong?”

“Saying they’re ‘encouraging terrorism,’ and talking about ‘causing real harm.’ Like *we* don’t exist for that. Personally, I’d love a politician who picks up a rifle.”

“So, just talk so far? Nothing serious?”

“Nothing yet, but I’ve got a bad feeling about it. That they’ll, you know, *do something* .”

I muffled a curse. “Like what?”

“Remember what they did with Senator Bouchard? He was a sitting senator. What do you think they’ll do to an outsider candidate?”

“Good point. So, the Shil’vati will just disappear them? Can we stand up to that?”

“I think they can’t just make them disappear, you know? Bouchard was nabbed by loyalists and his fellow senators. But a candidate? I think…it’s more that it’s humans whipping one another up into a frenzy. I warned you about this- that they’ll not stop at anything if they think you’re going to win. Both sides are primarying the pro-shil’ candidates, so if these primaries go through and we come out victorious, they’ll lose. Republican, Democrat, it won’t matter if both of the candidates are anti-shil’vati. They know that. And I’m worried they won’t let the election come to that.”

“Shit. Good point. So, a Scott situation? A raid, and they lock him up on suspicion?”

“Yeah, I could see them doing that.”

We shared a moment of silence for [Scott ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lhoanl/aliennation_chapter_9_last_stand/), who had fallen at the very beginning of the insurgency. His death had spurred us all from hateful words, to tirelessly working to avenge him. I wouldn’t quite call him a martyr, but I wouldn’t pretend his defiant last stand hadn’t made everyone take their role in the insurgency, including their privacy far more seriously in very short order.

“So, do we just outright confirm that by working alongside them as security? That’d doom all the other candidates.”

I could see Verns strain, his neck bulging. “We can’t abandon them to die.”

“Well, you think they’re gonna drag people from their houses? People going into each other’s homes, physically attacking candidates?”

His answer surprised me.

“Yeah. Yeah, I do. I think they’ll have guards, too.”

I sighed in defeat. There really would be no other way, would there?

“I don’t *want* to start political violence,” I said. “I don’t. I absolutely *do not* want to be the one who initiates it.”

“I understand.”

This rankled me. It felt *wrong* to even consider this. Had they pushed me this far?

“The Sword of Damocles over my head is gone. I’d like to reposition some assets over to Bancroft. Tonight, under the cover of darkness. You know, the VIPs. Then, do your mission. Do whatever you have to, to protect our candidates. Don’t use Vendetta, Grey Mask, or Grouper- they’re *too* bloodthristy. I want restrained people- mature ones. Someone who will take action only if they absolutely *have* to. Record evidence, if possible, because if violence does kick off, I need it to be clear that we’re not the ones who initiated it. Let our people know- if they initiate, if they picked a fight, I’ll deal with them myself.”

“Gotcha,” Verns said. “Look, this kind of thing… I watched the collapse of democracies. They’re ugly. I’ll need Radio to coordinate across candidates. If one’s attacked, the others might be next, and the Shil’vati will *certainly* pay them a visit in the wake of any attack. Any teams we have watching over them would be snagged. We’ll need a way to warn them.”

I waved a hand. “Go. Make sure he brings his laptop, he’s got footage to edit.”

Verns gave me a hand-on-heart and departed.

Then I turned to the twins and G-Man.

“Thank you, both. I couldn’t have explained half that cultural stuff without you two. I take it you have to head home soon?” I asked, the evening sun’s rays shining through the trees. The days were growing shorter.

“Yeah, sorry. We did kind of ask permission to be out late this weekend. It’s ‘G-Man’s’ birthday, after all. And yours is coming up, so…we thought, maybe a birthday celebration? Like a sleepover, maybe?”

“Oh. Uh…where?” I was already tired of sleeping here four nights in. No campfire, in case of drawing a response from firefighters, no light, and barely any running water. I was coming dangerously close to ‘crazy man of the mountain.’

“My place could work,” George offered. “We hosted a meeting, right after the brawl at Lucky’s bar. And, you know my face, and you already know, I mean, unless you’re dumb, he’s my dad. So…”

I felt a slight pang of jealousy over the fact he and his father could share something like that. Maybe Larry might come along, too? I nixed it. That be risking his identity. If *any* of the inner circle got pinched, it would already be disastrous, but we didn’t need to worsen an already vulnerable point of our organization.

“Alright,” Binary agreed readily. “We’ll get you a cake, it’ll be fun!”

That would be nice."

TLDR: Job offer title changed with same duties, I’m in doubt if I’m doing tasks of Automation Engineer or Software Engineer. 

I’m transitioning to a new position at a high prestige automotive company that reached me through linkedin, but there are some things that doesnt’feel very right, I want another perspective because maybe I’m hype blind or something.

They reached me for a Junior Software Developer Position, with 20% more benefits that my actual work and with a better workflow. But when they gave me my offer letter the title had change to Automation Engineer but with the same duties. I’ve asked to the recruiter if it was a mistake but she told me that is the title they handle inside the company, but the duties are exactly the same, I’ll be working as a contractor so the job title is different inside the company and with the contractors. 

For those who want to know the duties, here: 

1. Software Development/maintenance of internal testing tools (Desktop and web-based tools).
2. Update of Matlab models to accommodate required simulation of features on the Test environments for all the projects.
3. Python development to integrate IOS, Android and Web devices with Test Automated stations.
4. Develop and maintain software tools and features to assist in automated testing.

All my internship experience is based on fullstack (C#, PHP backend and Angular/React Front), but I’m excited to code professionally in a language I love a lot, Python. I don’t know what to do, am I choosing a wrong path or getting out of it."

I had an interview with Apple on Monday, January 30th. I thought I did well. I emailed my interview 15 minutes after the interview telling her I enjoyed our conversation and thanking her for taking the time to speak with me. She replied back Thursday the 2nd saying exactly this, 

“Hi [name],

It was nice to meet you and I really enjoyed our conversation too and learning about your experience and interests. I just heard the recruiter is out of office but please expect to hear back soon! 🙂

Best,
[name]”


Yes, she did include a smiley emoji. I waited until Wednesday of the next week and and still didn’t get any news or a receive a reply. So on Wednesday the 8th I emailed to check in with her and see if there were any updates. She replied on Saturday the 11th, 

“Hi [name],

Aw man, sorry to hear about the delay. I enjoyed our conversation and was hoping you’d hear back soon. Let me check again with the recruiter on Monday.

Have a great weekend!

Best,

I took this response as a good sign and sent her a reply the next day saying that sounds good and I’m excited to hear back. I then didn’t hear anything so I emailed her on Wednesday the 15th to check in with her again and see if there was any update. 


I didn’t hear anything. So on Monday morning,February 20th. I emailed her again, that since we last spoke I have not received any news/respond/feedback. I was hoping you could provide me an update on my status our could provide me the recruiters email to I can reach out to them directly. 

And since then she never responded. Can anyone give me any advice. She was the engineer I interviewed, so if I failed she should know. If I didn’t get the offer or am not moving forward to the next round of interviews, then why did she send me misleadingly encouraging emails, not just reject me, or even just ghost me from the start/beginning, instead of leading me on and then ghosting me.

Any advice on what I should do, should I email her again. I really thought I did well."

This faded away during my later high school years and my freshman year at college/sophomore fall. It was a blast and it couldn't have been a smoother transition.

Fast forward to spring of my sophomore year, I feel worse than I have in years. Dealing with midterms, harder classes, trying to figure out housing that is best for me, friend drama, the looming shift to long distance with my boyfriend as we both prepare to study abroad in opposite semester, a continuing pile of internship and job rejection and just the other stresses of life have all sent me so far into the worst bought of anxiety and depression I've had since early high school.

I'm struggling to eat, work out, get out of bed, enjoy the people and things around me, and even sometimes just want to be here. I'm despratly trying to find a therapist, but it hits a new dead end every time. I am truly considering if taking a semester off is the best solution for me, as the only thing that brought me some comfort was being in such a bad mental state my mom flew to see me and I got to see her for a weekend.

Does anyone know why it feels like things have gone south so fast for my mental health? Anyone have any tips or things that helped them get through mental health in college? I feel so alone."

Morgan Stanley is paying me $30/hour + $2000 relocation in Baltimore and for the research I’d be getting $6000 in total + subsidized school housing. I’m also an international student so if the MS job leads into a full time one, that’d be pretty nice because they sponsor visas. My main dilemma is that while MS pays more, the research seems more code related, even if marginally… 

Also, I don’t have any tech related internships so I feel the MS one would be good for me to try out new things and since I do research over the school year anyways, I wouldn’t be missing out on that much. 

And also on a side note, I applied to like 100+ internships over winter break (yes I know it was late) and the MS offer was the only one I got. 😭 I’m also a current junior.

Fortunately, I always protected my work, and started creating strategies back in that time such as signing up the materials I prepared, I also tried to just limit communication just by sending emails that formally addressed the work detail in which we were collaborating. I also didn't allow her or gave her space to approach me, by trying to be in places where there were other people who might see her if she portrayed this type of behavior.

Today I went to a college meeting in which she was there as well. I choose to limit any type of contact just by participating in what was necessary. Fortunately, I didn't need to speak to her. Yet I did notice she was trying to look for eye contact and tried to in a way enter a conversation in which I just didn't engage. I did this and act a bit ""indifferent"" or didn't give her attention as a way of limiting contact and protecting myself considering the toxic past behavior. I felt good and strong.

I'm deciding between two programs right now, I'm in Canada so I expect most of you won't be familiar with the specific schools, but the question should still apply.

One option is U Alberta, generally ranked \~5th within Canada and it's supposed to be especially good for AI/ML, which I am interested in.  Though I know that field is pretty oversaturated.

Another option is Carleton, which is further down the list and not as well known (past top 5 it's basically a wash).  However, Carleton CS has a co-op program which is supposed to be pretty good.

At U of A I could probably still get internships over the summer, but it would be more difficult and I guess less guaranteed.

Just wanted to ask about what members of this sub thought.  Thanks."

Hey fellow Devs,

I recently posted in this sub for some advice about a job switch,  but got a lot of queries and DMs about how I got into Data Engineering, how to get better and go from entry level to senior position or from Data Analyst to Data Engineer (DE)

I'm working as a Senior Data Engineer in a Unicorn Startup in India. 

Trying to give back to the community from my experience in Data Engineering since 2019. Still surprised that not many are aware about what actually are the roles, the expectations from Data Engineers are. Most of the stuff is available online, videos from many youtubers, still posted it for people who might not be aware! :)

Will answer FAQs about Data Engineering. Feel free to correct or improvise. 

**Warning: This is going to be a long post.**

&gt; DE means Data Engineering


I. As a fresher, I'm interested in Data Engineering, but how to get a job in this domain?

A. Getting a job directly as a full-time DE is pretty tough. Try to apply for DE internships and maybe it will get converted to full-time or with that experience try to apply for Associate / Junior DE positions. Build a network on Linkedin with many Data Engineers and connect with them about their experience. 



2.  What are the required skill-sets to become a DE?

A. From my experience companies expect you to be good at any one language

* Python, Java or Scala
* Strong SQL skills
* Data warehousing
* Spark
* Cloud experience - AWS/Azure/GCP \[good to atleast have an idea on how to spin up a cluster in any cloud vendor, setting up Network rules, firewall, etc.\]



3. Is DE in demand, is it better than Data Science?

A. Even though all the hype on the internet is for Data Scientists, the role of Data Engineer is equally crucial and critical for companies to enable Data Scientists. 

* Even the pay is lucrative! 
   * Salaries may vary, but mostly ranges look like this in India
   * Entry level DE - 4 to 10 LPA
   * 2 - 4 years - 12 to 30 LPA
   * 4 - 7 years - 25 - 60+ LPA

4. How do the roles differ, Data Engineer vs Data Scientist vs Data Analyst

A. My understanding - In the Data ecosystem

1. Data Engineer - Process starts here, collecting, cleaning and transforming, ingesting data into Data warehouses or datalakes.

2. Data Scientist - With the collected data in DW/DL, understand business logic and build useful data science techniques / ML models to identify key patterns, insights that can drive revenue.

   3. Data Analyst - Final part in process, Visualize the insights from Data Scientists using BI tools like Tableau, Looker, etc. 



3. How to prepare for DE interviews, Most commonly asked interview questions?



* **NOTE: In most companies, even Data Engineers are expected to be strong in DSA, since first rounds can be OA tests like Hackerrank and F2F Coding rounds before you can enter technical rounds about topics mentioned below. So, still need to Grind Leetcode to some extent!**
* **That being said, there are still companies that focus mostly on SQL, Spark for interviews and pay lesser attention to coding skills.**



After attending close to 40 interviews in last 4 years, the most asked interview questions for 0-3 years of experience were mostly on the following.

**Must have knowledge on these concepts to crack any DE interview:**

I. SQL

* Aggregate functions - AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.
* Joins - **important!** types of joins and their output.
* Window functions - Ranking functions, LAG, LEAD
* what is &lt;**following**\&gt; how do they **work**, how to **create** this and why is it used, **pros** and **cons** for the **following:**
   * CTEs
   * Views, Materialized views
   * Index - also types of indexes, index behind the scenes.
   * Partitioning - types of partitioning
* Normalization / Denormalization - rarely asked but important



2. Data Warehousing (DW) and ETL

* Star vs Snowflake Schema
* DB vs DW vs Data lake, when to use appropriately
* Choosing Columnar vs row oriented Databases
* Facts, Dimensions - understanding, examples
* Steps to implement a Data warehouse (for example in Bigquery)
* Best practices for DW, reporting
* Slowly changing dimensions
* Handling duplicate records, inconsistencies in data.
* Understanding ETL vs ELT process, data cleaning, ingestion techniques. 



3. Spark

* Understading Architecture
* YARN basics
* Sparkcontext, session, worker, task, job, stage, etc
* Spark dataframes, actions, transformations, reading and writing data, specifying schema options
* Repartioning vs Coalesce
* Partioning
* Handling OOM error in spark
* Broadcast variables, broadcast joins
* Best practices of Spark, best tuning practices
* Different persisting strategies in spark


Cloud experience

* Not much questions but it is vital to have an idea on different big data tools and services available in any one Cloud platform and their use cases.
* Most commonly used services in Cloud for Data systems
   * AWS - S3, Redshift, Glue, RDS
   * GCP - Cloud Storage, Bigquery, CloudSQL, Dataflow \[for streaming\]

**Linux skills - I think this is also a very important skill and a basic requirement**

 

Other skills to learn to become a better a niche Data Engineer,  if have the above mentioned topics covered, check these out:

1. Orchestration tool - Airflow \[slowly becoming a must have skill\]
2. Streaming data - Spark Streaming / Flink
3. Pubsub systems like Kafka
4. NoSQL databases - MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.
5. System Design for Big Data



Resources: 

**Datacamp** is one of my most favorite platforms. It has skill tracks for Data Engineering, Python, SQL, Shell, Spark, etc.

https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/big-data-with-pyspark](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/big-data-with-pyspark


**I would highly recommend this but this is a paid platform though :(

Feel free to explore Youtube, Coursera, Udemy for specific concepts / courses based on the topics mentioned! 

if you are a student, use your college ID and activate Github Student developer program, get free access to datacamp for 3 months!

**Other resources I used to prep:**

https://dataengineering.wiki/](https://dataengineering.wiki/



1. **Orielly books -** for any topic, check reviews, most of them are available as PDFs in github.
2. SQL - [pgexercises.com](https://pgexercises.com), data Lemur, Ankit Bansal on Youtube, hackerrank, Leetcode
3. Spark - Spark by examples, Datacamp, ChatGPT recently :P,  to understand concepts with amazing analogies. 
4. DWH - Ralph Kimball book

Notable YT channels: Ankit Bansal for SQL

Big data folks on Linkedin : Shashank Mishra, Seattle Data Guy, Zach Wilson


Data Engineering is gaining more importance everyday. Upskill yourselves and join the ride!

Without trying to brag/sound cocky, I graduated from one of the top universities for CS and interned at two FAANG companies. What recruiters don't see about it is that at university I got all B's and C's, and at my internships I couldn't finish my projects because I didn't understand them/I goofed off.

The hiring team told me that they were impressed by my resume by the companies I worked at and the school I went to. But just because I have those names, it doesn't mean I'm any more competent than other people (I would argue I'm much less so). It's a startup of 3 people, so I'd be expected to take on a large workload.

I'm feeling tons of anxiety and impostor syndrome, like they hired the wrong person mostly based on name brand recognition. I barely know the frameworks that they are using, and I can be a bit of a slow learner. I have lots of mental health issues which is making my emotions much worse.

Anyone have advice on how to build self-confidence in this and feel like I can do well in the job? The anxiety is crippling and I'm worried I won't be able to push through."

I also have some smaller projects I've done as side projects. Also I've thought about delaying my graduation to fall 2024 so that I can maybe have an opportunity to get an internship and more time but I want to avoid delaying if I can, since that means I have to take out loans for another semester.

I'm currently in my second semester of my Computer Science University because I made the wrong choice of going for my business degree after high school at a community college. After a year or so of that, I switched majors to a University and Computer Science instead.

Fast forward to today, I essentially have to pay out of pocket for every semester (I'm 21) with the help of my dad. We're doing a payment plan, so each month we both pay half of the required amount. I still have roughly 3-3.5 years if I take 15 credits per semester and I might be able to shave it down to like 2.5 if I can take summer classes as well (assuming I pass all classes first try).

My cousins recently graduated from a bootcamp but I've heard how competitive it is to find jobs afterwards. Do I suck it up and just continue the University route even though I'm paying for everything? I'm currently doing the Odin Project right now and it's not too bad so far.

I've had 2 internships so far (not programming related, but in the IT field. Mainly servers and such) Any advice?  


TLDR; I need to pay for each semester with the help of my dad. Should I do the full-stack/bootcamp route instead and take a break from school? I have 2 internships that are IT related, no programming though. I'm 21 years old and really would like to be finished with school or have a decent job by the age of 23-24. Thanks"

going to graduate in 2023

got placed in September, got LOI and completed all the documentation (including bond :) )

I was supposed to join in jan 2023 but now its been 2 months here I am sitting in my house and listening to taunts from my parents, its 1st march and still no response from the company regarding joining, I am getting afraid 

...is my placement cancelled??

**then at the end of January**, due to constant pressure from my father to contact the company, I called  to HR department (I got the no. from an email) but got no response, nobody picks the call, then I tried daily for a week until I started this message whenever I called ""THE NUMBER YOU CALLED IS INVALID"" 

funny, isnt it?  because the number I called has a WhatsApp account and after a month is still active

now I am even more afraid, by giving in to my father, I guess I damaged my impression, 

there was another girl placed alongside me in the same company only difference was, she got selected for a non-IT role and I was for IT,  and she already got joining mail and she supposed to join from the 13th of march

cant help but feel very low 

if the company don't call me for joining, it feels it will be disastrous for me as no new technical company is now coming to our college for placements,so can't even apply for a new company,  everybody else are placed and joined their companies as well

my profile was not so good , have no projects , internships , no multiple skills or language, but somehow cleared their interview

I guess  they realized this and left me as it is"
11fe2ay,2,2023-03-01,Education Advice for mid-career,AcridAcedia,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11fe2ay/education_advice_for_midcareer/,"This is going to sound like the most generic post on here because I - like so many - have hit a point in my career after 6 years where I am not sure what I should do next. 

For context, I have a pretty low undergraduate GPA. If this wasn't the case, I would probably directly apply to Masters programs. I didn't try very hard and actually started working full-time as a Data Analyst before I had even graduated with my Economics degree. Now I have 6 years of work experience going from intern to Senior DA (5 at a reputable company + 1 ongoing at a FAANG) and I would really like to work on a Masters degree. 

I did poorly in Economics, but I think I would do much better academically now that I am older and more mature and have worked with Data Science tools and techniques for so long. In the past 6 years while working full time I spent a ton of time on Udemy, Coursera and did dozens of courses that allowed me to pick up bigger projects at work. Everything I've learned about writing good code and statistical techniques and building performant models, I've either learned on the job from a willing mentor or from these kinds of certification courses. I love learning for the sake of 'immediately applying' what I learned and doing these kinds of Python projects in my spare time on weekends gives me a lot of passion. 

I recently discovered the EdX micromasters programs and realized that this might be a unique opportunity for me to add a stepping stone before applying to a Masters program. Has anyone had any experience with these? I think that doing a Micromasters + GRE could help overcome my bad undergraduate GPA in an MS application.

Is trying my best to go get an MS the right path forward for me? Thank you advance for reading through this and any advice is very much appreciated."

Also I've thought about delaying my graduation to fall 2024 so that I can maybe have an opportunity to get an internship and more time but I want to avoid delaying if I can, since that means I have to take out loans for another semester.

Any advice or input is welcome. Thank you."

I thought that having the school name on my resume would help me get jobs easier/faster but that has not been the case. I applied to several part-time and internship jobs and didn’t even get one single call back.

Financial aid at the institution is almost non-existing. I do not have a trust fund or mommy and daddy to pay for it so I’ve been relying on loans. I have a credit score in the 800s but still can’t get an interest rate lower than 10%, even with co-signers. Now would be the right time to drop as I still don’t have too too much debt.

Will I be murdering my chances of getting a high paid job if I drop out and go to a cheaper school instead?

To be honest I did not think the level of education I’m getting is any better than at my previous state school. It just costs 10x more.

I would appreciate any tips. Thank you"

I've been struggling with SA for what feels like a decade now. When you go to school it's not that bad. At least it doesn't feel like it, because all you have to do is study and pass some tests. At the end of high school the thought of becoming a normal adult in a modern society started creeping into my head. I knew I had to eventually find a job, I wanted and still want to have a relationship and stuff. I skipped a summer job because well I don't really have to force myself yet right?

Then came Uni, fast forward 3 years of classes, no job in between. The thing is that I don't get any SA from any school activities so that's why I like studying. End of the 3rd year, I had to get an internship. I managed to easily get one in IT which would be a dream for many. For 2-4 weeks it was kind of fine but all we were told to do was to read some stuff and docs about our project. When it came to actual tasks and daily meetings with colleagues I dipped out. I was having a panic attack every day, stomach pains and stuff and for the peace of mind I just said fck it. Tl;dr it was enough for uni stuff to pass but still sucks.

Now I am after my Bachelor's degree (I think it's the equivalent in English). I am faced with a unique opportunity, my friend from Uni teaches some CS classes for our HS and asked if maybe I wanted to teach as well. To be honest I think I like teaching and I might be good at it. Tomorrow I am expected to meet with the principal. And guess what? I am stressing as hell and the thoughts surrounding all of that are too much. I think I came up with a plan to show up as late as possible and quickly come up with some schedule issue as to why I won't be able to teach. I hate myself so much, I might finish my Master's next year but then... Either breaktrough or you know what."

I see a lot of people really emphasizing the importance of a CS program with a good co-op arrangement, and this is something I've always paid attention to when evaluating various schools.

But lately I've also heard some people say that co-op is overrated and that you're better off doing summer internships or finding work on your own.  I've even heard of people going to schools with good co-op programs who decide to instead find work on their own (to avoid co-op fees etc).

I would appreciate if some of you could explain/share the reasoning for either side, and comment on which is the approach you personally agree with more.

I personally get the feeling that co-op is a bigger help when you're first starting out (Y2, maybe Y3), but isn't that necessary once you're nearing the end of your degree?

I'm mainly asking because I've already applied to a decent school with a decent co-op program, which I'm 90% sure will accept me.  But I'm also considering submitting another application to a better school (overall) with a fair bit worse co-op program.

Thanks."

The pathfinder internship at EA is a decent example of the sort of thing I'm looking for I've got a couple things working against me though.

For one, I didn't declare my major in Computer Science until last semester, so I'm a junior with a freshman's knowledge of CS. I'm good at it, but don't have the experience a lot of employers are looking for in a junior.

Continuing my major right now is not an option and I am set on doing CS. The only problem is it’s almost impossible to internally transfer majors to ECE or CS, and I was wondering if it’s possible to SWE full-time with only a CS minor/certificate.

I grinded DS&amp;A last semester and got an internship this summer at a decent tech company (around Capital One/CISCO level). I’ve done a few full stack personal projects so I’m not a bot, but I don't know anything about OS, computer architecture or like distributed systems, etc, so I’m just seeing if those are necessary things to know when I start working full-time.

I also applied for external transfer, but my GPA is not great, so I probably will get into a mid-tier CS school (not T15). However, I really like UT and don’t want to transfer, but at the same time, if it’s necessary career-wise, I will do it. Obviously, the best case scenario is I stay at UT for CS if I get the internal transfer, but if I don’t, I’m conflicted on whether I should transfer or stay at UT without doing CS.

My goal is to get a FAANG internship/job btw.

These are my options I’m considering assuming I can’t transfer to CS or ECE:

1. Switch to a lower-tier school for CS
2. Switch to Math major with CS certificate and graduate early (2.5 yrs) and go work full-time
3. Switch to math major with CS certificate and graduate early and do CS masters
4. Switch to math major and take OS, comp arch, and more CS courses in community college.

Other details : Department for LGO is EECS . 
I’m currently on a visa working in the US as a SWE - probably inclined to get into tech/consulting after my degree since those 2 categories tend to sponsor.
The only drawback of LGO I observed was needing to work at a partner company (unpaid) for 6 months and the list of employers seems kinda limited. That means lesser chance of a tech/consulting internship converting to FT. I do acknowledge and appreciate that such partnerships tend to make aid possible but just trying to figure what would work best for me.If you’re currently at LGO / have experienced otherwise please lmk!

This decision is making me really anxious. Any thoughts from the folks on this sub would be really appreciated.

Was hoping to get some advice on whether it would be worthwhile for someone with my profile (which is very industry-focused) to bother applying for the top CS PhD programs or if my chances are minuscule enough that my efforts are better spent focusing on getting into a research-focused MS CS program (if you think even that's a reach and I should just aim for one of the industry Masters, let me know!). Basically, as someone who's been out of the university application processes for quite some time (since I applied for college basically), I just want to calibrate my expectations. For context, I'll be applying in the admission cycle at the end of this year.  

Anyways, here are my stats to ground the discussion (please let me know if I missed something):

**Stats**

Uni: UC Berkeley (BA in CS)

GPA: 3.97/4.00

GRE: 336 (169Q, 167V)

Research Experience: Did a year of research in ML with a professor at Berkeley, but never got any publications from it.

Experience: 

3 yrs of experience at Google after graduating. 1 yr in general SWE work, 2 yrs in industrial ML (building and deploying models, writing infra + pipelines, etc.)

2 internships (a 3 month ML internship + a 9 month generic SWE internship) 

1 yr of experience as a TA 

LoRs: The letters from my current Google manager + either of my internship managers should be excellent. Will prob have 1-2 letters from my university professors which are expected to be a lot more generic. 

So there you have it guys. Considering all of the above, do you think there's any point in me applying for a CS PhD at a T20? Looking at my profile, it's glaringly obvious that I'm severely lacking in research experience, especially compared to some of the other applicants I've heard about who apply to these colleges with multiple publications in top-tier journals. However, do you think the rest of my application would be enough to give me a shot or should I not bother and just aim for a research MS CS program (or is even that aiming too high with my lack of publications)? 

I know I should have a good shot at one of the industrial Masters program most of these universities have but I would really prefer to aim for a research-based program since spending 3 years in the industry has made me realize how much I liked doing research in college. Even after graduating from one of these programs, I hope to aim for an industry research focused position, which currently feels impossible to get into since all of these type of roles appear to require at least a Masters. 

Would love to hear what you think or if you have any advice to give regarding my situation!"
11fsso9,1,2023-03-01,Supporting Your Partner Through a Difficult Family Sponsorship Process and Neglectful Father,quocanhh,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/11fsso9/supporting_your_partner_through_a_difficult/,"I am writing to seek advice on a matter that has been of great concern to me. I am a 28-year-old male who is currently living with my 26-year-old girlfriend and her 59-year-old father. We moved in together in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and my separation from the United States Air Force after eight years of service.

However, since moving in, I have noticed that the house is not being well taken care of. There are random items scattered around, and there is a general lack of cleanliness. Moreover, my girlfriend's father's behavior towards my girlfriend has caused me to lose respect for him. He has had affairs while still married and has not contributed to the household in any meaningful way, except for paying the mortgage. We only discovered the infidelity through security cameras we installed around the house for safety purposes.

Furthermore, my girlfriend and I are paying for most of the bills at the house, including water, electricity, internet, and insurance. I have taken on the responsibility of cleaning the house, as it helps my girlfriend have a clean space to come home to after work. I have free time due to my current source of income, which comes from VA Disability, and I attend school full-time on the GI Bill. Recently, I was selected to do an internship at a company that will significantly help my girlfriend and me in the future. I help declutter and maintain the house by cleaning every two days and conducting a deep clean every Sunday.

It's important to note that her father's lack of responsibility extends beyond just financial support. He doesn't take care of the lawn or do any maintenance around the house, leaving tasks like fixing the flooring in the laundry room to go unaddressed, which is currently a gaping hole. His unwillingness to contribute to the household has put a considerable burden on my girlfriend and me, as we are left to pick up the slack and cover the expenses.

Despite all this and trying to talk to the father but it just seems like he doesn't care, my girlfriend and I have been doing our best to maintain the house, keep up with our studies, and provide for her sister's needs. However, her father's neglectful behavior towards his own family is particularly concerning. When the eldest sister arrived, he took her out to eat but left her at home while he went to a local coffee shop to hang out with his friends. On another occasion, he went to IHOP with the eldest sister but did not bother to invite my girlfriend. He also doesn't clean up his mess in the morning, leaving the house in disarray. When we asked him to fix the electricity in the eldest sister's room, which was causing interruptions to my girlfriend's desktop computer and our TV, he didn't take any action to resolve the issue.

All of these instances demonstrate his lack of contribution to the household and his neglectful behavior towards his own family, which has only made things more difficult for my girlfriend and me. My girlfriend's upbringing in a strict household has led to depression and anxiety, and she self-medicates with weed due to her father's inadequate insurance. She is a kind and caring person who prioritizes her schoolwork above all else, except for me. We have been together for three years and plan to get married once we both graduate from college.

Currently, my girlfriend is shouldering the responsibility of sponsoring her sister's move to the United States, even though her father is the official sponsor and you know suppose to be the father figure. Her father has not contributed financially to the move, and my girlfriend has even gone as far as purchasing furniture for her sister's room on her own. I have been helping out by driving around and building furniture. Despite our efforts, my girlfriend's mother, who lives in another country, seems unaware of the stress and workload that my girlfriend is experiencing due to the lack of support from her father, she is still asking for my girlfriend to send her money. As full-time students who are also working and trying to maintain a social life, my girlfriend and I are feeling overwhelmed. We would appreciate any guidance on how to navigate this situation. Thank you for your attention to this matter."

I have worked two different IT internships one being a helpdesk worker and the other being a technical analyst which have been very valuable for me as I develop some of my skills but a personal passion and track of classes that I have taken have been in development and programming. These are skills that I really want to grow but I am worried that I have already started started to kind of paint myself in this corner of IT where I may not be able to get myself out of it if I get after graduation I get a full time IT job. I do know that with my degree I am able to get some basic software development but I am worried that I won't be qualified at the time being ultimately I am wondering if there is a more information systems focused career that would work as a good launchpad into a software development career?

Updated application following a deferral! 

Check it out and see what you think my odds are come March 17. 

Applying in-state, white/caucasian male for Computer Science/Engineering. 

- 3.95 recalculated GPA per UGA's guidelines (97.22 weighted 100 scale) and a 29 ACT (28M, 28E, 29R, 30S)(8 Writing). 
With that being said. I thought I had amazing essays and I am rather involved in my school and community which is honestly what I'm partly riding on for admissions. 
-I was selected to be a part of the North Georgia Saxophone Ensemble HOSTED AT UGA, I am in all of the National Honor Societies, I am a math tutor, I am an all-district (5 time) and all-state (2 time) saxophonist, I did and internship in a STEM field, Varsity Math club, I worked part time, I ran a jewelry business which funded the computer that I built to get me into Comp. Sci, I am in a ""STEM Academy"", which is a cohort based STEM education focused group ( rigorous), I volunteer, and I have taken 5 AL classes and 15 honors level classes. 

Considering Dr. Graves recent report on 2023 admissions statistics, My GPA is mid at 0.08 higher than average and my ACT composite is just 1 higher than average. 

I believe I was originally deferred since they did not receive my newest ACT in time. Should that be true, I believe I have a shot considering the ACT they first saw was a 25. 😭

What do y’all think? 

Thanks 🫶🏻"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'm not the first person to ask this, but I wanted your input.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in high school right now, but going to college next year.

I was always thinking of going into Computer Science because I generally like automating things and building computer software + I want to work as a software engineer.

What I really love doing, though, is tinkering with electronics, I played some with Raspberry Pi and such, and built a couple of projects purely by asking a lot on Reddit and copying parts of other projects, I knew nothing and still don't. 

I have some ideas for devices and robots I want to make. Right now, I'm trying to make a self-driving trash can, but I can't do so efficiently because I don't know what electronics can go together if one is 5V or 10V or something like that, straight up don't know how things work nor how to make the program for the robot. I only know python and java and don't know how to communicate with electronics/cameras. 

I want to learn how to do all this, but it's just a big hobby of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

**Would a computer engineering degree teach me how to do things like picking the right components for my projects and just with electronics prototyping and robotics?** Also, would it provide a good balance between just hardware/low level programming and more of the higher-level programming that is required to land a CS internship? Or would I be at a big disadvantage when stacking up against CS majors when looking for internships/jobs?"

# An indeterminate time in the future:

The first contact materials were classified, yes, but that doesn't mean that they weren't disseminated.  It was considered good manners to send the records of technical first contact along to the xenos government.  Refreshingly to Humanity, these ""four armed blue elves"" didn't seem bent on either conquest or destruction.  Additionally, there had been some leaks.

# On a morning talk show:

""So as you can see the Bluies, as our intern Josh called them are a far cry from those weird tentacle things who wanted to eat our dogs.""

""Nobody misses them Janet, and it's looking like we might have actually found friends out there.""

""At least one of us has.""

""I'm impressed with the Bluies for that one, I know I wouldn't want to be stuck on a ship with one of those guys.""

""Bill, *millions* owe their lives to the Lost Boys-""

""Oh you know what I mean!  I would be scared he'd have a flashback and think I was infected.""

""That's not how PTSD works, yo-""

The show cut to commercial to avoid showing the audience that the flagship personalities actually hated each other's guts and would have disagreed on whether coffee is coffee.

# On a stately ship gently cruising through hyperspace:

High Admiral Zaovkron, Lord of the Great Helm, Keeper of the Stars of the Sea Sailors, put down the materials very politely sent along by the new xenos people.  Everyone agreed that they were adorable, but he was concerned about matching honors.  It was clear that they were a sailing people, yet they had planets.  Is sending a High Admiral equal honors with a Fleet Admiral?  Only the Star Queen stood above him, and she did not wish to offer insult by going herself and overshadowing the diplomat selected by these adorable little people.

Then there was the list of honors attached to their warrior, who was hosted by a mere merchant vessel.  Chance herself seemed to be laughing at them, since the merchant captain had sought out the safest and calmest stars to sail, far from the frontier and amongst governments with little toleration for piracy.  He would point out that the two are friends and nobody cares about even honors between friends.

# On the destroyer burning an unauthorized intercept course:

The Lost Boys were all together again, which was unauthorized and downright discouraged by both command and the MH regs. But the regs could go fuck themselves, this shit was important.  However, the important task of assessing what exactly they'd be doing for their prodigal brother was on hold because a very important debate had broken out.

""Linus is way fucking cuter you knuckle dragging power armor ape!""

""Fuck you bot boy, Lucy is clearly more adorable.  LOOK AT HER LITTLE DRAWINGS!"" The aforementioned power armor trooper retorted while his hand began drifting toward his belt.

""I'm on Pierre's side.  Team Linus Master fucking race!""

""I swear if I have to stitch any of you up over this, I'm not using any painkillers,"" a medic said darkly before continuing blithely, ""Besides Captain Dad is clearly best xenos.""  Fifteen brand new combinations of profanity were invented then and there.

# On the Speaking Softly:

The admiral needed another break.  All joking aside, she was happy for PFC Greg George.  Not that she'd ever tell the boy, since he'd probably run away in terror if she did.  Infantrymen were strange around naval officers, it was a known fact.  She found herself harboring a growing affection for the xenos captain for not only making one of the Lost Boys comfortable, but downright civilizing him.  ""Not high enough rank,"" he said. *If you didn't get yourself busted every time you were close to making sergeant, you'd have been an officer by now, you jackass.*

# In the same cramped ""office:""

The disgraced general downed yet another whisky and wiped tears away from his face, *You beautiful blue bastard, you saved my boy.  You'll never have to pay for a drink in Republican space if I can help it.  Oh my soul, my soul is damned, but you pulled one of my boys out of the fire.* His thoughts had turned somewhat sappy and weepy as he got deep into his cups.

# In an office on loan from a petty officer:

The bookish looking man set aside the originals again and sat back in thought.  Of all the people in the MH Treatment Program, PFC Greg George was a difficult case.  Not just one of the Lost Boys, but a solo operator once they were broken up.  It really shouldn't have been allowed, but their scouts and snipers had all wound up in the Advanced Stealth Drop Surveillance Scout corps.  The normal approach to MH was rocky at best with solo operators, and being a Lost Boy had compounded the issue.  This shipboard treatment, though not exactly clinical, was something to look into.  Guys like Greg were more used to living on ships than planets, after all.

# In the diplomatic suite:

*Well shit*, she thought, *he used math.  Took him a minute.  The media just knows his name at the moment, but when this gets out it's going to get funny.  It's a widely known myth that drop infantry are morons.  Anyone who knows people in the Navy knows better.  Insane, yes, but not stupid.  I guess he could have done worse.*

# On a gaudy ship in a gaudy convoy escorted by mismatched battlecraft:

The ambassador was furious.  This wasn't a meeting between nations or planets, this was meeting an entire new species, and the Republic hadn't bothered to inform anybody else.  *Republic bootlickers think they're hot fucking shit* he thought, *Just because they're the most powerful star nation doesn't make them the representatives of fucking Humanity.  The Coalition of Independent Planets has a fucking say in interspecies meetings.  Hopefully their lost boy fucking walking war crime hasn't fucked up their opinion of us.*

11g2v35,1,2023-03-02,Supporting Your Partner Through a Difficult Family Sponsorship Process and Neglectful Father,quocanhh,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11g2v35/supporting_your_partner_through_a_difficult/,"I am writing to seek advice on a matter that has been of great concern to me. I am a 28-year-old male who is currently living with my 26-year-old girlfriend and her 59-year-old father. We moved in together in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and my separation from the United States Air Force after eight years of service.

However, since moving in, I have noticed that the house is not being well taken care of. There are random items scattered around, and there is a general lack of cleanliness. Moreover, my girlfriend's father's behavior towards my girlfriend has caused me to lose respect for him. He has had affairs while still married and has not contributed to the household in any meaningful way, except for paying the mortgage. We only discovered the infidelity through security cameras we installed around the house for safety purposes.

Furthermore, my girlfriend and I are paying for most of the bills at the house, including water, electricity, internet, and insurance. I have taken on the responsibility of cleaning the house, as it helps my girlfriend have a clean space to come home to after work. I have free time due to my current source of income, which comes from VA Disability, and I attend school full-time on the GI Bill. Recently, I was selected to do an internship at a company that will significantly help my girlfriend and me in the future. I help declutter and maintain the house by cleaning every two days and conducting a deep clean every Sunday.

It's important to note that her father's lack of responsibility extends beyond just financial support. He doesn't take care of the lawn or do any maintenance around the house, leaving tasks like fixing the flooring in the laundry room to go unaddressed, which is currently a gaping hole. His unwillingness to contribute to the household has put a considerable burden on my girlfriend and me, as we are left to pick up the slack and cover the expenses.

Despite all this and trying to talk to the father but it just seems like he doesn't care, my girlfriend and I have been doing our best to maintain the house, keep up with our studies, and provide for her sister's needs. However, her father's neglectful behavior towards his own family is particularly concerning. When the eldest sister arrived, he took her out to eat but left her at home while he went to a local coffee shop to hang out with his friends. On another occasion, he went to IHOP with the eldest sister but did not bother to invite my girlfriend. He also doesn't clean up his mess in the morning, leaving the house in disarray. When we asked him to fix the electricity in the eldest sister's room, which was causing interruptions to my girlfriend's desktop computer and our TV, he didn't take any action to resolve the issue.

All of these instances demonstrate his lack of contribution to the household and his neglectful behavior towards his own family, which has only made things more difficult for my girlfriend and me. My girlfriend's upbringing in a strict household has led to depression and anxiety, and she self-medicates with weed due to her father's inadequate insurance. She is a kind and caring person who prioritizes her schoolwork above all else, except for me. We have been together for three years and plan to get married once we both graduate from college.

Currently, my girlfriend is shouldering the responsibility of sponsoring her sister's move to the United States, even though her father is the official sponsor and you know suppose to be the father figure. Her father has not contributed financially to the move, and my girlfriend has even gone as far as purchasing furniture for her sister's room on her own. I have been helping out by driving around and building furniture. Despite our efforts, my girlfriend's mother, who lives in another country, seems unaware of the stress and workload that my girlfriend is experiencing due to the lack of support from her father, she is still asking for my girlfriend to send her money.

I cannot move it either because I’m in software engineering and some courses along with capstone can’t be moved. 

So I was wondering, is it worth dropping an internship to spread my courses so I have an easier load and just code a massive app for android/IOS in the extra free time?

For reference, I’m in canada, I finish in 2025 in soft. eng so I might have another good project from the year long capstone."
11g60rx,1,2023-03-02,"How to make the most of a short stint in Washington, DC?",Cross-Border-Advice,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11g60rx/how_to_make_the_most_of_a_short_stint_in/,"Just for some context I should share where I am in life, and the situation I'm in. I'm a  27 year old American citizen living in Canada (specifically Ottawa). I am about a semester and a half away from finishing my master's and I'm planning to settle in Canada with my partner. I have a history degree from a prestigious university in the US and previously worked in public service, including a Congressional internship and working for a major city's District Attorney's Office and a Mayor's Office. I am also reaching my fifth year in the US Navy Reserve, where I have done brief periods of active duty service before (around 3 months).

Rewind to 2020, I was stuck at home like everyone else, when I met a Canadian on a dating app and started a long-distance relationship before I decided to move to Canada. With much lower tuition rates and the ability to cover half the cost with the GI bill, I realized I could afford to get a master's degree in Canada without really denting my savings too much. In late 2021 I moved to Ottawa to start a master's degree in public administration. Since then life has been going smoothly, I moved in with my partner after about a year of in-person dating and I also volunteer regularly as a medical first responder. I landed a summer internship with a major consulting firm last year but due to timing, funding, and competition, I was unable to get a return offer. I'm currently about halfway through an internship with my university which will then lead to my final semester in the summer.

I've been applying for jobs and postings like crazy, trying to land a job in Ottawa for after I graduate. I have absolutely no interest in working for the Canadian government though I am interested in some other public administration areas. I'm definitely considering non-profits, think tanks, and consulting firms among others. I'm also quite interested in the idea of working remotely for a US-based organization or company that would allow me to remain in Canada. I'm very open to travel and I'm also looking at types of jobs that would allow me to represent American companies in Canada (like Chamber of Commerce type positions)

The reserves have also been going OK. I struggled with my original unit due to long-distance drilling and travel costs, and I have since transferred to a new unit in upstate New York that is much better to work with and allows quarterly rescheduling. My new leadership also includes a First Class who previously worked for the State Department, giving me a lot of tips on how to handle reserve duties while living abroad, (e.g. working with local Embassy detachments and telework) so I followed his advice and a lot of the stress involved with that has been reduced.  However, this leads to the complicated situation I'm seeking advice for.

I've been tagged for a very short mobilization on active duty orders to Washington, DC. It would start this summer and only last around four months. This is quite exciting, though it also brings a lot of challenges. The first is personal, in terms of going back to a long-distance relationship (even for a shorter period of time). The second challenge is professional, in terms of how to make the most of it. I did a summer internship in DC years ago, and I would probably try to treat these orders (if the time would allow it) in a similar fashion, trying to use that time productively to network. At the time, it was much more straightforward as I knew I wanted to stay in the US. This time, I'm trying to find a job back in Canada.

Is there any kind of networking strategy anyone can recommend while I'm down in DC? Any kind of organizations that have offices or a need for staff in Canada? I've done a lot of research and know that certain city and state governments have some outreach in Canada, but I'm also curious about other kinds of avenues to explore. So sorry for the long post, I would appreciate any advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should also throw in some concerns about timing around a work visa, as I know Canada's immigration agency isn't the best to work with. From my understanding a Post-Graduation Work Permit is supposed to take six months to process, so there may be a brief period of time where I'm not able to work in Canada."

I told him that I was in the process of finishing up my masters program and that I was going to need a job soon, so I asked if he could help me get a job at the agency I was interning at. 

I didn’t think he would respond because I tried to get a hold of him a couple of years ago, and he never responded. But this time he did. And he wants to meet with me over zoom tonight. 

Is this a good sign? 

The way I see it, if he didn’t want to talk to me about offering me a job, he could have just told me so via email. Then again he may just be granting me this meeting out of common courtesy, but he never really seemed like the kind of person who would do that. But I’ve been wrong before, after all I haven’t really seen the man in over 4 years. 

What do you guys think? Any advice for the meeting itself would also be welcome.

Edit: I just had the meeting. I’m becoming just as doubtful as I was before I graduated undergrad. I’m becoming more desperate and more anxious about the future."

A little background, I, (25M), graduated from BSIT and specialized in game development (a program that was offered sa college namin). I was working as a 3D artist/ game developer for more than 4 years, well siguro it has been 5 na including my internship. I loved what I was doing, the passion was there and I can really see myself growing in my choses career. 

I also started with the entry level pay back then na 18k, which was ok for me kasi 1st job ko naman since absorbed ako doon sa company na pinag internan ko, and single naman and wala naman ako binubuhay kaya kebs lang.

Then may yearly increase until I was promoted then naging 40+ na monthly with benefits. I soon quit the job around 3rd quarter last year, kasi my previous colleagues are poaching me and the offer was 4x may monthly pay. It was my sign na din to leave kasi nag wawait na lang talaga ako ng may mag offer para mag leave doon sa OG company. So I left na nga and joined another company. 

Pero before leaving the OG company, I was feeling drained na  sa work ko, passion was not there, I was burnt out. I thought salary issue lang siya. Well partly, pero I think what I was doing was draining me a lot na. I stayed lang doon sa new company for 3 months. Hindi ko tinuloy yung probationary period. I was performing bad na rin kasi doon sa new company and was given a warning na, and given a chance para mag perform pa, pero I didn’t take it na.

I was crying to my family and loved ones, I was telling them I cant take it anymore na, I dont want to work. Luckily, they were supportive. And I know I have enough savings para maka rest ako. I had myself checked up mentally sa professionals and results were not good. I was diagnosed with multiple mental problems, so I’ve been in therapy sessions din.

Now, I think I have recovered a bit, but thinking of working makes me nauseous, and makes me feel week. Pero what’s weaker, is my bank account lol. I knew sooner or later I have to face reality na I have to go back to work.

So now, I’ve been on a job hunt with the same position as before, kasi I know i can excel on it. 

But I also so opening for a tech position, an entry level, and I applied doon and I’m kinda excited? Maybe I missed coding, since yun din ginagawa ko noong college ako. But the huge downside is, obviously, huge paycut, parang back to 0 na naman ako. And whats worse is I dont know if eto rin yung gusto ko in the long run.

If anyone has a somehow similar situation, or scenario. Do you think I’m making the right choice of starting over?"

I have $4.7k now  from my employers RRSP plan (4% match) that I use ever since I joined. Does that mean the contributions I made in 2023 (Janury till now)  can still be deducted for my current T4?

I have $1k in my RRSP sitting on Questrade's RRSP.

After filing my taxes, my new RRSP room should 63k \* 18 percent, which is \~10k for 2023.

In software development, hiring someone for only half a year may not be the most desirable situation. Therefore I‘d be open for an internship. Another disadvantage is that my French is not good enough for professional conversations.

My parents are telling me to go on the trip and that I’ll be fine without this job, but I feel like that perspective is coming from a time when people with college degrees faced less competition in the job market and so it was less important try to amass relevant work experience in the way that a lot of people my age do these days, and so I think I feel more of an obligation to spend my time doing something productive rather than just going on vacation for three weeks and then having nothing else to do for the rest of the summer. So I basically just wanted to get the perspective of other people, maybe some who have more recent experience searching for work right out of college, and so I thought where better to ask than r/Advice. 

For additional context, I’m graduating with a degree in math and this internship is an applied math research thing, which is significant because all my education/experience is in pure math, so getting an opportunity to do more applied math is a bit rare for me and important because I want to have options outside of academia in the future. If more information is necessary I can provide it. Thanks!"

11gp3wq,10,2023-03-02,RANT anyone else really hating social workers?,Fluffy-Watercress-95,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/11gp3wq/rant_anyone_else_really_hating_social_workers/,"Ok so I taught in Title I schools for the past two decades in a few different states. I considered myself to be an intuitive, compassionate primary teacher who navigated bullshit on all sides skillfully and I was pretty well-regarded for prioritizing community, belonging, relationship, and SEL. However, my last and final year I just couldn't do it anymore and decided to leave the profession for something that has a more focused aim. I started in an MSW program last fall in Chicago and need somewhere to vent about how sanctimonious, judgmental, and dogmatic/lacking perspective the social workers I am encountering are.

Generally speaking, the SWers in my classes and at my internship seem to blame/scapegoat teachers for nearly all failings in classrooms and schools. I will be the very first to acknowledge it is not a perfect system by any means, which is why I ultimately needed to leave but it's also incredibly complex, with many groups (each of which has its own ideas and perspectives about what's happening and what should be different). And teachers are walking a pretty impossible line of pleasing everyone, and being the only people in the buildings who know how to do everyone else's job (including a SWer) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY are also the only group who can't just say ""that's not my job"" because everyone is always dumping the responsibilities on them. So fucking heavy is the load! 

SWers talk about walking into classrooms and why don't teachers know how important it is to have a low-stimulation environment because there are students who have traumatic experiences in their lives? Of course this one kid they are there to observe has meltdowns, the teacher should have the room set up to be less colorful and less noisy. That teacher should have some education or PD on trauma informed care/crisis intervention/best practices for kids with ACEs. Like in the time I taught, this is pretty much exclusively what I got training in at my districts. I also was pretty interested in it so read quite a bit on my own time, as well. It's not that teachers don't know, it's that given the environment of having 28 other 1st graders, they are managing a pretty impossible task of attempting to meet each one's specific needs and then being criticized for not succeeding...all the while doing their actual job of delivering content, keeping the attention of a large group at once, organizing small groups, dealing with general run of the mill learning how to be a friend/human/waiting in line/keeping hands self etc. It is a completely different job to work at the individual level with each kid, but social workers seem to believe that is the only part of a teacher's job. And ultimately, it is a much easier job to work one on one.

There are often meetings for kiddos in schools who are biting teachers, or whatever etc. And instead of aiding the process, these SWers constipate the process by calling parents and encouraging them to refuse the system's protocols for emotional disturbance assessment (or whatever IEP qualifying category). They say what's the rush? Why push this kid who is struggling down a path that will label them forever? Shouldn't special education be set up differently? The family doesn't feel heard in these meetings and that causes harm. They say this kid doesn't have mental health problems or behavior problems, this kid has trauma and schools should be set up better. Well, they're not unfortunately and timing is of the essence (especially early on in schooling) and this is kind of the best they can do...so why not aid that process? 

SWers have no understanding of the INDIVIDUAL IN THE COMMUNITY level focus...teachers do not have the luxury of being individually focused (as a SWer is) because they are managing a whole fucking ecosystem of people. 

When a kindergartener runs out of his classroom because he told his teacher he was hungry (15 minutes to lunch) and she told him to wait. Instead of telling him to go back, SWers play games with him, give him a snack, congratulate him on advocating for his needs. And then gossip about how that teacher lacks compassion. If a kindergarten teacher gave every kid a snack when they asked, she wouldn't be a teacher anymore. She'd be a waitress. There have to be some lines and some hard no's. It's so frustrating because they think they're helping but they are undermining a salaried professional, who has taken courses in child development and likely has a master's degree. And those teachers will quit soon if they don't get some fucking support! Why can social workers appreciate all the reasons for the behaviors of students and families, but not teachers? Where is the love for these hardworking people? Are teachers not also trapped as agents in broken systems with limited resources and means? 

SWers talk about ""behaviors"" and patronizingly use air quotes- like don't the teachers know behaviors are cries for help??? These are needs they are trying to express. First, of course teachers know that!!! But also, that isn't what schools or classrooms are set up for.
SWers say, ""what if that kid has problems at home?"" Of fucking course that kid has problems at home!!! Schools do not have magic wands and I guarantee that if they were trapped with a kid who's biting them, they'd also want to figure something out.

I also HATE hearing the language of how SWers are ""revolutionaries within the system,"" like...no sorry, you don't get to be flying the plane AND trying to crash it..the only reason you're making a liveable wage is because you are in the TEACHERS UNION. Like there are some decisions you get to make throughout each day to soften the system's edges for kids and families, sure, but I can't stand the abolition bullshit speak. It feels sanctimonious and smarmy and delusional and gross. Like whatever dream world you're living in is just so you can see yourself in a flattering light to yourself. They are SELF-OBSESSED. It's all about their identity and being seen as righteous. It's pretty easy to become that way when you're not doing any real work.

SWers turn off their walkies when they are having meetings (mostly gossiping about evil teachers or administration)...like when a teacher is calling for help because a student is having a violent outburst.

I think the thing that bothers me the most is when they talk about how school social workers should do more PD for teachers. In my mind, if you've never done a job and never could do it, how can you explain to someone else how they should be doing it better?

Okay rant over. WHEW.

TL, DR: any teacher could be a social worker, and very few social workers could be a teacher. They have no right to judge, or to have the audacity to say that they have the necessary knowledge or skills to teach teachers."

Looking for other inputs! I think it makes sense to delay on 1st glance but I am missing out on re-investing the tax returns and potentialy gaining more money in ETFs/GICs in taxable accounts by delaying so I'm unsure.

My yearly income at my new job is 126k.

I joined my company literaly at the middle of the year last year so I made \~63k. My new RRSP room after filing my taxes would be 63k \* 18% so \~11.3k.

I have a RRSP room of 4k (from previous internships) that i can deduct on taxes today.

&amp;#x200B;

I played around with the nubmers in [turbo tax calculator](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-resources/canada-income-tax-calculator.jsp).

If I deduct the 4k on an income of 63k, I owe 9.6k in taxes.

If I don't deduct the 4k on an income of 63k, I owe 10.8k in taxes.

If I deduct the 4k + 11.3k on an income of 126k on the next tax season, I owe 27,025k in taxes.

If I deduct 11.3k on an income of 126k on the next tax season, I owe 28,762k in taxes

I’m a senior in computer science, getting really close to graduating. I won’t go into all the details, but basically I live in a very tech-dead area in Alabama. Even worse, the pay for any job around my area is practically worthless. This has really been difficult in trying to network and find internships. It’s so bad that I only found one IT internship (unpaid), with the kicker being that I needed to know all about how to set up networks beforehand. Of course I didn’t get the internship, but I feel for whoever did.

So this brings me to my question: would living in a cheap trailer and working remotely as a SWE be possible? I was thinking about doing this for a year or two so I can pay off my loans and whatnot. The only downside is that I have no work experience related to SWE, just a degree I will earn and some projects. I figure this would be a huge setback in getting me a job, but I keep hearing that all it takes is one “yes” to get your foot in the door."

**History:**

So, a couple months back, i could play good games like Witcher 3, MGSV, even Elden Ring at low quality without problem. Then, it started giving me timeouts with the driver and the game would freeze. The problems started to get worse, to the point that some games would freeze for a minute before windows responds again. That was happening in very low specs games like Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm.  Now it got much worse.

Any game that i play, specially 3D, even old ones, if it's not really low resolution, the PC freezes while the screen glitches with multiple distortions. It's a second of distortions then a black or grey screen with vertical lines. The sound stop, windows stop responding, and i have to turn off my PC.

**Things i noticed:**

* The GPU stops for a second, i can't hear the sound of the GPU cooler, then it comes back, but the pc doesn't unfreeze.
* This happens specially in 3D games, i can play League of Legends and most games i used to play with very low resolution and specs, some won't crash.
* The temperature is good even moments before crashing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Things i did:**

* Multiple drivers, old, new, custom, most had no difference. The custom one that i'm using now seems *slighty* better in terms of avoiding the crash.
* Formatting my pc, twice.
* Using a new power supply ONLY for the GPU.
* Different monitor and multiple cables of multiple types.
* Underclocking the gpu and voltage control.

&amp;#x200B;

 **What i didn't do:**

* Removing it from my old Dell Precision Workstation T3500. To clean or reaplly paste. That's because the damn thing is locked in a mechanism that's apparently broken. If you guys think this is really needed, i'll take it to a professional so he can handle it.

Also, I don’t know if this violates the rules but could I ask if anyone could look at my GitHub and tell me if it’s decent enough for my resume? 
Thanks so much for your understanding!"

This made it extremely challenging to secure an internship during my junior year. As a senior, I had doubts that I would land an internship this summer and anticipated having to fight for a junior position after graduation. However, after many rejection emails, I'm thrilled to announce that the battle is finally over - for now! I succeeded in securing a software engineering internship position for this summer with VISA after four rounds of interviews. Since early September of 2022, I have sent around 400 applications, failed numerous online assessments, and stumbled in several interviews with both small and large companies. Despite the challenges, I never gave up, and neither should you. For those still searching for an internship, I believe in you. It might be difficult, but remember, It’s a marathon not a race!"
11gty27,0,2023-03-03,Rejected Internship..,PasonJatrick,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/11gty27/rejected_internship/,"Hi.

So I'm an incoming IT graduate and I feel bad lang na rejected agad yung application ko for this e-commerce platform (pretty sure almost everyone here has used it). I had high hopes pa naman na I'll be shortlisted since my initial interview went well, IT is really vital for organizations such as this one, and I was really eager to learn with them.

I was just informed that they were unable to advance my application and that the competition was fierce.. I don't know if they rejected me because my interview didn't actually go well, or because my internship was supposed to be held on September, or if it had to do with something I wore.

I don't know. Do you guys have ideas why this happened? Is the internship pool really that competitive or is it because of some other factors?"

going to graduate in 2023

got placed in September, got LOI, and completed all the documentation (including bond :) )

I was supposed to join in Jan 2023 but now its been 2 months here I am sitting in my house and listening to taunts from my parents, its 1st march and still no response from the company regarding joining, I am getting afraid

...is my placement canceled??

**then at the end of January**, due to constant pressure from my father to contact the company, I called to HR department (I got the no. from an email) but got no response, nobody picks the call, then I tried daily for a week until I started this message whenever I called ""THE NUMBER YOU CALLED IS INVALID""

funny, isn't it? because the number I called has a WhatsApp account and after a month is still active

now I am even more afraid, by giving in to my father, I guess I damaged my impression,

there was another girl placed alongside me in the same company only difference was, she got selected for a non-IT role and I was for IT, and she already got joining mail and she supposed to join from the 13th of march

cant help but feel very low

if the company don't call me for joining, it feels it will be disastrous for me as no new technical company is now coming to our college for placements,so can't even apply for a new company, everybody else are placed and joined their companies as well

my profile was not so good , have no projects , internships , no multiple skills or language, but somehow cleared their interview

I guess they realized this and left me as it is"

When I look up online the people who are doing my dream job... Well they at least went to the same college as the one i'm in, then two or more other very expensive and/or selective college such a Southampton or paris school of architecture. 

Anyway I don't think I can make it...

Yeah well whatever... I'm under average in just about everything so that's not going to happen. I want to end it all because the World just seems way to complex to keep going. I'm not smart enough to do half of the thing a normal person us supposed to do.

I hope you enjoy this ""street-interview style"" video! Link: [https://youtu.be/fjYWAmfjfYI](https://youtu.be/fjYWAmfjfYI)

A lot of their advice are helpful if you're looking to land an internship in Big Tech.

There are 3 key insights from the video (thanks ChatGPT):

1. **Do projects and get hands-on experience**: Work on projects and get hands-on experience with whatever technology you like, such as creating a website or a database project, and adding it to your portfolio. This can help you build your foundation in tech and make you more employable.
2. **Be open to different opportunities:** Amazon has a lot of opportunities and that you may not come in knowing exactly what you want to do. Interview for roles that may not be their dream role and to be open to transitioning and exploring different opportunities once they're in the company.
3. **A Technical degree not always required:** There are a lot of tech and non-tech roles at Amazon, and that you don't necessarily need a technical degree to get into tech. Tt becomes easier to move into tech roles once you're in the company, and that there are many roles that don't require a computer science degree.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you have any other advice!

One was after the 2nd technical interview, another was ghosted after a call with HR (not even an interview, just call to double check my info, and tell me she’ll get back).

Meanwhile, my gf (FM), was constantly reached out and invited to interviews by recruiters right after graduation and landed a full-time SWE position at a massive machinery company with 0 technical interview. Just 2 30-min calls, 1 with HR, another with hiring manager, and received the offer, that's it.

We have the same background, did the same degree in the same university. I graduated with distinction, she didn't. I did 3 internships, she has none. I had more projects than I could put in my resume, she had to borrow 1 of my projects to put in her resume. I also coached her from scratch how to build her resume. My gf and I share everything with each other, and we both agreed that the only thing in my resume that was arguably worse than my gf's is that I'm not a woman.

I'm not saying this to compete with my gf, I'm sincerely happy for her and I will continue to support her as I always have. But it's killing me that I can't understand what I did wrong, except I was born a male.

1. I never doubt my gf's abilities in any way.
2. We applied for that same position (online, we both just drop our CV on the career page), but I was ghosted (from the application round), was never even actually rejected.
3. After my gf got in, I applied again for a similar position to that company, with my gf's referral, I was still ghosted.

I’m interested in programming, and think back end is something I would enjoy most. Things I was looking at were 

1) stress / work life balance / flexibility
2) pay 
3) how much time is spent on meetings v coding/building 
4) development - continuous learning and enjoyment. Will I be able to move to other roles easily if this doesn’t work out or after being in the role for a few years etc
5) whether I would struggle at the work - needs to be something I can complete. 

I feel like when you have so many fields that look appealing it feels like a really difficult decision to make when starting your career out. I’ve been thinking about this for so long. 

From the U.K. if that makes a difference. And I have limited programming experience in terms of python. Not much on SQL.

11h43z0,116,2023-03-03,My Stint as a Fire Lookout - The First Night,SleeplessFromSundown,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11h43z0/my_stint_as_a_fire_lookout_the_first_night/," [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mtodu/my_stint_as_a_fire_lookout_a_couple_of_visitors/)

Alone at last. My stomach fluttered, a mixture of joy and trepidation. It felt like standing on top of the world. No one would bother me up here.

I picked up the binoculars and glassed the valley below. Hitch from the Ranger Station and his two mules descended the ragged peak, weaving between the sporadic Douglas Fir. We had hiked half a day to get up here, the mules carrying food and water and tanks of propane. The trail is the only way in and out and gets steep and slippery near the top. Hitch smirked when I stumbled and sent smooth pebbles down the incline. He told me it always happened to the ones who were wet behind the ears.

Further down the valley the trees grew thicker and obscured the bone-coloured rock of the mountain. Atop a sharp ridgeline across the other side stood a small wooden structure, a tiny speck even with the aid of the binoculars. It was another of the fire lookouts.

My lookout was a square box six paces by six paces. It would have felt small except that all the walls were windows. There was not much in the way of furniture, a low-height dresser and single bed on one side, a square wooden table and chairs and propane fridge and cooker on the other. In the middle of the room was what looked like an oversized horizontal compass, with a map of the forest on the face and a rotating metal slit around the perimeter. If a fire broke out during my watch, I would use this to pinpoint its bearing. An old pot-bellied fireplace stood at the back next to a shelf full of books.

Yes, this would do.

I had applied for the lookout position in the winter and when I didn’t hear back I took an internship at the paper. Two weeks into the season the Parks Department called and asked if I could come right away. Absolutely I could. The overcrowded office whose thermostat was always set a little too low had already worn thin. Hitch said my hacking cough would clear up in no time on the mountain. I hoped he was right.

I stepped outside onto the timber deck and leaned against the rail. I gulped in a lung full of mountain air and spluttered it back out again and had another coughing fit. Whatever magic the mountain air contained did not do its work immediately.

A rusted steel cable hung limply from the roof on the north-west corner. It ended in a stainless steel eyelet and anchor. I scanned the ground and then stepped off the deck and circled the lookout. Each corner of the roof had a cable and only one of the four was taught, the cable extending to the ground and to a bolt embedded into the rock. They were like tie downs on a temporary marquee you might see in a backyard at a party. That only one of four remained in place was disconcerting.

I ran a critical eye over the rest of the structure. At the base stacked timber planks raised the lookout about a foot off the ground. I had expected the lookout to be on stilts with a stair for access, those were the images google sent back when I searched fire lookout. It struck me that an animal, a bear or wolf, could step onto the deck without much trouble. Better keep the door locked.

The whole arrangement gave off an air of fragility. A tiny timber box atop an exposed and wind swept mountain peak.

The hairs on my arms stood on end and at first I thought it was from the cold. I spun around at a subtle buzzing in my ears. Out on the horizon clouds of deep purple coalesced and blanked out the sun. The storm. Hitch said there might be weather, and if it meant business I would feel the electricity.

I shut and locked the door and switched on the light against the gloom. The second of the two radios crackled. The first was the link to the Ranger Station and together with Hitch I had radioed back the first of my weather reports. It had to be done twice a day every day, feeding the information from the tiny weather station fixed to a pole on the roof. The second radio was a link to the other lookouts. I picked up the radio and twisted the volume button.

“You must be the new guy?” The voice of a woman. I guessed a little older than I was.

I cleared my throat and coughed a couple of times. “Who is this?”

“Martina. Lookout 2. I saw your light turn on.”

“You were watching?”

“I’m always watching. It’s the job. I’ve had to cover your area until you arrived.”

That was fair. I hoped I hadn’t come off as too defensive. The tone of my next reply overcompensated.

“I’m Tom. Tom Winslow. Came up with Hitch today.”

“And he didn’t stop to say hello?”

“He wanted to beat the weather.”

“Hope he gets off the mountain before the storm gets here. The electricity is making my hair stand on end.”

“Mine too.”

“You got a fire going?”

I looked to the black wood burning stove. “No.”

“Get her lit. The temperature is about to plummet. You don’t want to sit through the storm shivering.”

“Roger that.”

An audible sigh came through. “It’s funny hearing that.”

I cringed a little. Was that something people really said over the radio?

“Did I say something wrong?”

“No. No. The guy who was in that lookout before you. His name was Roger. Is Roger. I miss talking to him.”

I didn’t know how to respond. I depressed the button a couple of times without saying anything. “I better get the fire lit.”

“Nice talking to you Tom.”

The strengthening wind pushed me along as I scurried to the east side of the peak. There stood a three-sided enclosure for firewood and next to it the outhouse. I filled my arms with logs and squinted against the wind. A haze of rain already shrouded the peak and lookout across the valley. I was about to get wet.

I hustled inside and dumped the wood in a thin walled metal container by the fireplace. I didn’t have any kindling so I stripped some bark from the logs and scraped up the leftovers in the bottom of the container. The windows rattled against the wind and I eyed them nervously. The flame caught as the skies opened and dumped rain on the roof.

A low rumble of thunder drew my attention from the fireplace. The sky near the horizon lit up. The rain hammered against the western windows in the evening twilight, all but extinguished by the storm clouds. A fork of lightning illuminated the ridge line across the valley.

I took up the binoculars and found the light from Martina’s lookout shining like the beacon atop a lighthouse. I picked up the radio and considered checking to see if she was alright. But it occurred to me she would have seen worse. Didn’t want to out myself as a wet behind the ears newbie.

I pulled a chair up to the fireplace and dumped a bigger chunk of wood onto the fledgling coals. Flames hissed and spat and then engulfed the log. I raised my palms to the warmth.

Wind whistled in through tiny gaps in the window frames. The whole structure shook and moaned as the storm roared outside. The air cooled and felt damp. I pulled a sweater from my bag and crossed my arms against my chest and coughed. Some summer job.

I cocked my head at what sounded like whispering. Barely audible over the drumming of the rain on the roof, distinct, deliberate and with the cadence of speech. I concentrated and tried to parse out the whisper, and could only make out subtle shhh sounds intermingled with breathy syllables.

A flash and then a crack of thunder that made the floor vibrate. The wind gave a final push and, as abruptly as it began, the rain relented. The windows ceased their rattle. Silence, the echoes of the thunder and the rain ringing in my ears.

To the east dark clouds spilled down the valley beyond leaving a fluttering trail like a long dress billowing in the wind. To the west the clouds cleared enough for a final glimpse of the sun before it sank below the horizon.

The radio crackled. “Did you survive Tom?”

I smirked. “Still here.”

“You got the fire lit.” It sounded like a statement rather than a question. “I can see the glow.”

I trained the binoculars on Martina’s lookout. A warm orange glow spilled out from the windows. “You too I see.” I lifted the button as another uncontrollable coughing fit rose in my chest.

“That sounds nasty Tom. Get some food and some rest. You have a long day of sitting and watching tomorrow. If you need anything give me a holler.”

“Rog.” I stopped myself before the rest of the word came out. “You got it.” I tapped my index finger against the radio and then pressed it down again. “Say, what happened to Roger? I asked Hitch why the position came up so suddenly, but he didn’t answer. I think he pretended not to hear me. It was weird.”

“Roger went missing a week ago. One day he was on watch and the next day he missed his weather report and wasn’t answering his radio. No one has seen him since.”

“Did he hike down off the mountain?”

“Doubt it. All his gear was still in the lookout when Hitch got up there. He didn’t leave a note. He didn’t tell base anything. He didn’t tell me anything. He wasn’t the type to pick up and leave without telling anyone.”

“That’s strange.”

“Don’t worry Tom. The typical day up here is uneventful. Get some dinner and get some rest. You must be tired from the hike up.”

She was right. The excitement of arriving and then the storm wired energy direct to my brain, but now it was done I felt the effects of a long day. “Will do.”

The flame of the gas burner packed more bite than I anticipated and the enclosed space soon filled with smoke. I opened the door a crack and sat on the dresser and rested a plate of charred sausages on my lap. Martina’s lookout twinkled orange on the horizon below a sky filling with stars. The weather had passed and the night was clear. It would get colder still.

The realisation that this lone orange light on the hill was the only thing resembling civilisation within a half-day’s walk brought a smile to my face. A solitude so close to being complete had long been the subject of daydreams. It started in school and kept on during a failed attempt at college. Working life in the city rubber stamped the desire to escape, and to escape alone. And here it was, finally.

My stomach full, another grumble came, but slightly lower. I couldn’t put it off any longer. The one drawback to my new living situation were the amenities. I did not relish sitting on the long drop in the dark, but the urgency would not be denied.

The light from the windows spilling out onto the ground was enough to navigate the stone’s throw to the small timber structure built atop a hole in the ground. The door to the outhouse had a simple wire latch on the outside and a similar arrangement on the inside of the door. I turned my head in anticipation of the smell and found it surprisingly bearable. Using the latch as a handle, I closed the door and plunged the freezing space into darkness. Shit, should have brought my phone if only for the light. I considered going back for it, and then felt behind for the cold and clammy seat and sat.

A light breeze pushed through small gaps in the timber siding and my bare skin prickled. The door shifted and the thin wire of the latch pulled tight. My heart skipped a beat. I told myself that it was only the wind. I watched the thin rectangle of light at the edge of the door and took in a sharp breath. A shadow flitted into the light and then was gone The door rattled again, harder than before, harder than what the light breeze could do. My stomach clenched.

“Is someone there?”

My voice was thin and high pitched. The question itself was ridiculous. There was no one up here. There was no one for miles. The door shook harder again. I feared the latch would pull free from the door. I put my hand up to the door and applied pressure, and something pushed back. Something was out there, banging on the door. An animal? What animal pounds its fists on a door? Through the cold of the timber came a subtle warmth, like hot breath.

I took my hand away and grasped my knee in a feeble attempt to stop it shaking. My eyes squeezed shut. I tightened into a ball. Flashbacks from high school raced through my head. Hiding in the toilet stall, hiding from them, my tormentors. They too had banged on the door. They laughed and howled and taunted, and I cried. Waterworks Winslow they called me. And the more they did it the easier the tears came. I sobbed now, trapped in the outhouse and in the dark atop a mountain.

And then, silence. The door sat mute. I lifted a trembling palm and felt for the warmth and found only oppressive cold. I pulled up my pants and lifted the latch. The door unlocked, I paused, listening for signs that my tormentor was gone. After a deep breath, I flung open the door. The lookout shone its light on the open ground. I looked left and right and found nothing.

I closed the door and there on the outside, right in the centre, was a black equilateral triangle about the size of a closed fist. It looked like something from art class where we used a hot wire to carve letters and shapes into chunks of wood. I traced the charred outline of the triangle. It retained a subtle warmth and smelled of smoke. This was made just now, while I sat, while I held my palm up on the inside of the door. Any notion that it had been an animal, some curious bear perhaps, dissipated into the night sky.

“Is someone there?”

The question went unanswered. I scuttled back inside and locked the door behind me. I would have closed the curtains, only there were none. The interminable darkness of the outside world surrounded me on all sides. There was nowhere to hide. My mind filled in the darkness with all manner of men and beasts. I whimpered.

I picked up the radio and almost depressed the button. Embarrassment stopped me. As comforting as Martina’s voice would be right now, I couldn’t do it. Like I couldn’t tell my parents about the bullying at school. How I was nothing more than poor old Waterworks Winslow. I propped myself beside the fire and trained my gaze on the horizon and the safety of the glow of Martina’s lookout.

A thought occurred to me. Was this a hazing of the new guy? Was Martina behind this, and Roger as well. Could it all be a ruse? I latched onto the idea and held it close to my chest.

The night passed in heightened alertness despite my fatigue. Sometime after midnight I ventured to lie down on the bed, but my eyes never left the door for long. I kept the fire going if only for the comfort of the heat and the light. I coughed and spluttered. I have passed many a miserable night, but that one tops the list.

In the cold morning light I unlocked the door to the lookout and ventured outside. I crept towards the outhouse and prayed to gods I did not believe in that there would be no mark on the door. No burnt triangle. That somehow it had been a trick of the mind, a reaction to the first night out here.

I made exaggerated blinks over tired and sore eyes. There it was. An equilateral triangle burned into the door. It had not been there when Hitch showed me around yesterday, of that I was sure. It hadn’t been a dream. I had felt the warmth through the door.

Something caught my eye to the east. Down the slope a little way the lone charred skeleton of a burnt out tree stretched into the sky. It was a misfit, a jagged black trunk devoid of branches surrounded by healthy and unharmed trees on all sides.

I scrambled down the slope and in my excitement almost slid too far. Two puzzle pieces of information lodged immediately into my brain and only added to the mystery. The ground around the tree had been cleared by persons unknown of all loose and flammable material. It was as if someone planned to destruction of this tree, and this tree alone. The second item turned my stomach in on itself. At about head-height above the ground, an equilateral triangle had been carved into the enormous trunk, the same shape that had appeared on the door of the outhouse. That one was in black, this one white as bone in the charred carcass of the tree.

I scanned the eastern slope of the peak for any other burnt out trees and found only mottled green mixed with brown. I turned back up the slope to the lookout, only the roof visible below a brightening sky.

11h7dzu,3,2023-03-03,sometimes I feel bad about needing medication to function,-chromatica-,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11h7dzu/sometimes_i_feel_bad_about_needing_medication_to/,"I wish I could get up and be focused without having to fight the impulsiveness, fatigue, and unmotivated feelings, because those things also stall me from taking my meds, which stalls me from getting ready for the day and getting to work ASAP, which leads to my guilt about having ADHD... it's a vicious cycle!

Some days I wake up and feel fine, but other days I have 0 motivation to do anything besides watching cute cat videos on social media. It's been hitting me especially hard lately since I'm in the middle of college midterms and I started a new internship. So technically, everything's going pretty well for me right now, but this morning I couldn't get going without taking a dose of my ADHD medication. I feel bad for needing medication to do normal stuff when there's nothing bad happening in my life.

I actually feel a lot better now that I've taken my medication, like the overthinking thoughts and the action paralysis are gone, so yay for meds! They definitely have improved my quality of life and I wouldn't be where I am without them. And yet I still find myself struggling to fight that stigma around mental health medication. 

It's really no different from the daily allergy pills and other medications I take for my physical health, and I acknowledge that I have to be kinder to myself since I have ADHD l and I'm trying to adapt to keep up with society, but I still have those guilty thoughts about needing medication for my ADHD. 

I can't be the only one who struggles with these feelings of guilt sometimes, right? How do you overcome this sort of thinking?"

Hoping to get my college to pay for it. Then in the fall semester, I have to take a class at my university and this class is a graduation requirement for my major and all I have to do is get a certificate.

Responsibilities: not sure, but I know I will be learning defensive cybersecurity.
I may be getting a security clearance!"
11hg8kl,117,2023-03-03,Do People Really Graduate With EE Degrees Without Any Real Technical Ability? How Can I Avoid That?,BaseballAnalysis,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/11hg8kl/do_people_really_graduate_with_ee_degrees_without/,"I have heard quite a few times something along the lines of ""employers are hiring you for your skills and the degree is just a minimum."" This resonates with me and I completely agree with this statement.

However, I'm baffled that it should even need to be said. Are there really that many people graduating with engineering degrees who are not qualified for entry level positions? What was the point of the degree if it doesn't even qualify you for that much? What is it that sets the person who gets hired apart from the person who didn't?

Background:  
I'm entering my first year of Engineering Physics (which is just an EE program + Physics major courses at my university) after studying philosophy for two years and it's vital to me that I really have the skills to be a competent entry level engineer when I graduate. How can I develop these skills and set myself apart?

In the interim before my degree starts this September I am working on a side project involving a custom built laser pointer and a mechanical device which will be used as an educational tool to demonstration simple harmonic motion. 

I also have a few coding projects under my belt, including a linux terminal program which can access information from the periodic table of the elements with simple commands. I have a few years of work experience, including one technical position as an IT Project Coordinator.

I will be involved in the rocketry club during my undergrad working on avionics. Assuming I do well in my courses and pay attention, should I still be worried about not having enough technical ability to get an internship? Or are the people who complain about this just lazy and in engineering only for the money? What else can I do to really make sure I learn relevant skills that will get me employed?"

11hi0vs,3,2023-03-03,Is it too late to start changing to frontend from a backend background?,Weather_Only,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11hi0vs/is_it_too_late_to_start_changing_to_frontend_from/,"TL;DR: Only have backend/ full stack internship experience with Python, Go, and AWS. Applied to &gt; 200 jobs and zero feedback from entry-level backend jobs. Graduating in May and OPT starts in July. Need help determining if switching to front-end rn is worth it.

Full background: I am a senior graduating in May and need to find a job before July. My previous internship-turned-full-time-offer was rescinded during the layoff and I couldn't find a job since with my backend internship, some full stack projects and club experience using flutter, IOS, or native android development. I know a bit of everything from all these experiences but no companies reached back to me. I am thinking this is because I have no full time experience working as backend and companies probably don't want to hand their servers to a 0 years of experience new grad. I know a bit of javascript and React Native on a very fundamental level, and I am thinking if I should really leave all my previous experience behind and start fresh looking for front-end internships after graduation and look for front-end jobs. The problem is, I don't know if this is viable considering I have just 3 months left and no previous front-end experience. I doubt I could even find an internship for front-end.

Could you give me some pointers? Should I do it? Which stack should I go for? Angular or React Native? Typescript?"

Basically I’m on my internship and I’ve been working full time with my site supervisor for about 2 months now. Maybe that’s impressive for not having a bad day?

So I’ve been using my downtime to study for the NCE. I priotize my paperwork, my clients, and everything else beforehand before I even open the books. I brought up taking Spring Break off (3/28) and my supervisor wasn’t thrilled.

Apparently the downtime I had been alotted was done to help me out, and that there was other office work I could’ve been assigned. Apparently he was trying to be considerate to my case, so me asking for the week off read off as me taking more than I gave. I had no idea that this was the case until now, and felt horrible the rest of the day.

I vented to my mother and she expressed concerns about me being exploited. This is unpaid, so in her mind I should be able to take off without issue seeing as I’m not employed. That said, I have been good experience. I have had clients to counsel, groups to lead, paperwork and treatment plans to make, and so on. Though at the same tine, I can also understand that someone not getting paid should have more of a say in their schedule. I’ve been putting in 40 hours a week, so there’s merit in her being concerned.

Some others things to know are that I have Autism (Undiagnosed). I’ve gotten into some hot water for misreading tasks in the past.  The main example is being well versed in CBT but havinf to apply DBT interventions and thinking. I swear these styles are opposites…

This is also the first time I’ve been employed full time. Every other position has been part time or volunteer, so I’m not accustomed to whether or not these are growing pains or not.

I’ve contacted my faculty advisor for theur assistance. I want to get as much consultation as I can before I jump to aby rash conclusions. I know I need to express my feelings towards my supervisor, but right now I just don’t feel up to it…

What do you guys think? Is this experience normal, or are there a fee red flags. I’m not looking for answers, just perspective. I don’t feel like I have a lot of people I can talk to about this atm, so all help is appreciated!"
11hiqmm,2,2023-03-03,Should I take an unpaid internship at my dream company or a paid internship an okay company?,throwaway223333111,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11hiqmm/should_i_take_an_unpaid_internship_at_my_dream/,"I recently got two offers as a human resources (HR) intern this summer at two places. I don't have any full-time corporate work experience or experience in the field. 

The first offer is an unpaid part-time internship at my dream company. It is a huge university hospital  and the people who interviewed me (and who I would be working with) were very nice, professional and reassuring. I feel as though I would love to work here but the idea that I would only work part-time and that it would be unpaid is making me question if it is worth it. I am not sure if they would be open to hiring me after the interview is done. I am fortunate to be able to live with my parents for now and take student loans to keep me afloat but I would need to work a part-time job on my days off from this internship to pay some monthly bills (phone, car insurance, gas, food).

The second offer is a full-time paid internship at a company with 2-3 star reviews on Glassdoor on the employer's treatment of workers. It is a non-profit foundation and only doing this internship it seems because they need labor but for cheap as it is a student government subsidy program. The pay is minimum wage ($15/hour) which is better than no pay at all. The people who interviewed me were very curt and they made it clear that they only want a student intern for the summer with no possibility of working there after. I think that the full-time work experience and the fact that I would be paid for my work is a plus for this company.

 In your opinion(s) what do you think would be the best option in my position? Does it make a huge difference if I take one over the other? I need to respond to the job offers in 2 days and I am really 50/50 between both of them. I'll answer questions about it in the comments."

I (22M) am finishing my undergrad in Spring in Marketing and Graphic Design. Recently, I accepted a remote internship at a smaller company (let’s say Company A) that matches up with my values, is in the industry I like, and I really like the people I would be working with. 

However, today one of the top companies (Company B) accepted me for a hybrid internship but I would have to move (not far) to a big city I’m not familiar with and I didn’t vibe with this team as much.

Please help as I am not sure what to do. Do I retract my acceptance to Company A to have a better name on my resume? Is it possible for me to ask both teams if I can do both jobs? Is it possible to ask for a delayed start on one of the internships?

Like I said, Company A matches well with my values and I could see myself returning later in my career but Company B would look really good on my resume and would also be an interesting experience/connection. 


TLDR: I'm a 22-year-old marketing and graphic design student, and I'm in a dilemma as I have received two internship offers. I accepted a remote internship from a smaller Company A, which I really like, but I just got offered a hybrid internship from a big-name corporation (Company B) that requires relocation to a big city I'm not familiar with, and I didn't vibe with the team as much. Seeking advice on whether I should retract my acceptance to Company A for a better name on my resume, if I can do both jobs, or if I can ask for a delayed start on one of the internships."

My problem right now is I don't know what exactly to do that will help my situation. I know an internship will make me more employable but I'm not eligible for that (having already graduated).

So what should someone in this situation do aside from constantly filling out job applications? Personal projects? What else?"

First thing I did wrong is that I signed up for 5 AP classes and two Honors courses. Once the school year started, I got an internship at a local cybersecurity company - the work is all remote, but with little background in cybersecurity i have to work a lot harder than I expected. On top of that, I do a bunch of clubs and activities like theater, website maintenance for school, hackathon planning, and general CS event planning.

I'm 3/4 of the way through the year but my burnout is insane. 

My questions:

How well do you feel like you can balance your college work and real life without burnout?
How can I make better use of my time so I can stay up to date with everything I have going on?

Thanks everyone who decides to respond to this :)"

I thought engineering students pay similar tuition as us, but turns out they pay almost 7k less than us (international students) and also got co-op for a whole year (and earn back some small tuition back). For co-op, they only compete with co-op students, but we need to compete with the whole entry level ppl in canada for an internship. we don’t get any special graduation “gifts” (my engineering friend will get iron ring) … well, we got our “connections”😀 
a rotman title gave us nothing more benefits in applying for jobs. would not choose rotman commerce again if I could go back. I should go to utsc’s co-op program…💸💸💸💸
not saying that I can’t find a job, it is just rotman should provide more support and help to match its tuition"

TOEFL: haven't given yet(hopefully will get 110+/120)

research experience: 

* 3 months(in my 4th semester) for an international project funded by a well-known organization on Speech/ NLP. My worked very closely with the professor from my college who was a part of the team.
* Summer internship on Theoretical ML in a top 7 IIT.
* Currently working on a research project with a professor from a top30 university in the US. This will most possibly lead to a publication later this year.

upcoming:

* I will most probably be interning in the US or EU in the summer based on the SRIP results.
* I am working on my 6th semester project with a professor from my college.( not well known as a researcher, but he is a really great teacher well known in our college for his teaching.) The project is not related to ML as of now. It is based on programming languages theory.

Extra-curriculars: I am part of a tech-club( but don't have much active participation.) I was a TA( unofficial) in my 3rd semester. I also am a trained classical dancer and have won awards at a college level.

By the time of applying, I expect to have at least 1-2 good publications. I haven't written my SOP yet.

Offer A: Is with a company with many offices throughout the state.  Start date is late May. In a city 3 hours away.

Offer B: Is with a smaller company. But still good reputation in the area. The biggest pro is that it is less than a two minute's commute to where I live right now.  I can start in two weeks. I can work with them during school year/next summer.

Neutrals: Both companies were  recommended to me by the college where I will be going to this fall/pay is the same/ both offer what  I am looking for the internships/ both work with the DNR &amp; DOTs/ both companies offered on the spot offers/ both said they hope this turns into a full time job after my two year program ends.

Biggest con for me at the moment is that I would have to move twice in a 4 month period if I take offer A. But offer A has more offices I can transfer to. 

Either way, I have till March 6, 2023 to let them know one way or the other.  The college program I plan on doing I will have to move to a city 1.5 hours from where live now.

I am currently leaning towards offer B because of how close it is, but offer A sounds like it has more options. 

How else should I narrow this down? Or why I should consider offer A more.

11hvtul,135,2023-03-04,A confession and a squarning,yungplum170,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11hvtul/a_confession_and_a_squarning/,"I am a graduating squirrel and I scammed my way through Berkeley CS (Climbing Studies).

I did squirrelly things to get in. I stole food from humans in high squirrel and cheated on tree-climbing exams and lied on college applications about my nut-hiding skills. I also did squirrelly things in my extracurriculars, causing irreversible damage to many of my tree-lationships and the organizations where I had positions of responsibility.

Once I got into Berkeley, I didn't stop. I wanted to declare, and I liberally stole from trash cans and picnics, breaking the trust of my humans and treemates, and even felt good about it back then. I manipulated my friends into helping me steal french fries to get good grades. After COVID hit in my freshsquirrel year (2020), I blatantly took food from hungry humans and continued doing so until 2022 or so. During the pandemic, I lied about having long winters to gain advantages over my classmates.

I was once flagged by the head squirrel in an upper-branch and almost got caught, but I managed to scamper my way out of that by lying even more. I didn't stop there. I kept doing things I knew were wrong because I didn't want to stop. When it came to jobs and internships, I fabricated the number of nuts I had and even got away with it, getting opportunities I shouldn't have.

So why am I posting this? The answer is to get this all out of my system and maybe start a journey of self-discovery and acornment. I am also posting this because I know I am not alone. Most aren't nearly as bad as me, but stealing nuts is too common in Berkeley EECS (Environment Eating &amp; Climbing Studies). Maybe you are being tempted to do any one of the things I have, and I am here to ask you to reconsider.

Chances are, you are nimble enough to scurry away with it. However, you don't yet know about the sleepless nights after these errors of judgement, with so much guilt gnawing at you, paranoia about getting caught, the fact that you can't even tell anyone about what you've done, and the most dangerous thing of all--a thrill, a high which compels you to do this again. It becomes an addiction and stealing food becomes easier every single time. Soon, you forget why you were stealing food in the first place. You no longer steal food because you want to declare CS or store food for the winter, you steal food because you are addicted to it. That's when you get caught (I almost did too, but managed to get away with it).

You might think that stealing food is only limited to your academic and professional life and your personal life and identity is separate. Wrong. Soon, these morals (or lack thereof) chew into your identity and your world-view. It changes you, eats away at your identity and pride, and distorts your personality. I see my honest treemates have pride in their hard work and a level of passion and knowledge in this major that I will never share. The damage that happens to your identity and moral code also affects your social relationships. Passionate and honorable squirrels make lots of friends, start good families, and do great things in life, who knew?

If none of the above convinced you, think about this. With some new advancement in AI (Acorn Intelligence), what if they make a tool which makes it impossible to trick an acorn checker? Imagine you are a graduating senior like me and they find out that you cheated in some 61A acorn-gathering project in your freshsquirrel year, however unlikely that is. What now? Suddenly you can't graduate. What if you have graduated already? There is a risk your degree could get rescinded. That is something that genuinely is making me go nuts.

So, if you are thinking about stealing food, please don't. Climb a tree and forage for food like a normal squirrel. Worst case, you get chased by a dog. You will still have your honor. This is the end of my word vomit. Now, feel free to downvote me and slam me in the comment section."

In 2021 I got my Network+ and Security+ back to back, and interviewed to joined the network team but bombed it due to not being able to answer half the questions (e.g. distance limitations and speeds of different fiberoptic cables types, etc, very specific information that I memorized for the test but did not retain for the interview). I am awful at interviews in general.

In 2022 I was ""promoted"" to a middle school, basically the same job but a little more pay. I still make under 40k a year, and ever since the pandemic my job has basically become 90% chromebooks. Swapping out damaged chromebooks, tracking down lost chromebooks, moving, building and tearing down carts for chromebooks, distributing and collecting chromebooks at the beginning and end of each school year, etc. I'm in chromebook hell on top of the workload I have already. My job is physically exhausting and repetitive, I don't use most of what I learned even in the A+ and I'm not learning anything new.

I've considered continuing to study for more certs, I was going to do CCNA or Linux+ next (I like Linux and keep hearing it's an important skill), but I need more hands on experience or I won't retain all this theoretical knowledge. I also hear you can only get so far in IT without learning how to code, something I've struggled with in the past, but now I'm at it again and actually making some progress this time, and having a blast, mostly with making games (a friend of mine is a game dev and that sounds like the coolest job ever but I feel like it's a longshot).

I'm building a Github portfolio and I'm reading Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. A field tech told me I should look into Google certifications and ethical hacking, and I found the ""Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate"" course on Coursera which I'm interested in. I'm also doing the Odin Project which a (different) friend of mine has been telling me to do for years. I'm doing it with my girlfriend who is a teacher and wants to get out of teaching (we are also learning Python together as she's interested in GIS). I'm enjoying Odin and I like the fact that it teaches a variety of skills, but I'm not that excited about web development. I'm determined to see it through though.

I know developers make more money but that feels like a complete career shift and I think I'd rather try to go further in IT since I already have a foundation in that, but I feel completely lost on how to move forward. I've been told I should have a homelab but not sure where to begin or what kind of homelab to make (I don't have a lot of space or money), I've used VirtualBox to play with Linux distros but that's about it. I'm awful at interviews and rusty at job searching. When I do see higher paying IT related positions online they sound intimidating with a ton of technologies and programming languages listed. Where is the middle ground where I can just get out of help desk and move on to something a little more interesting?

Part of me really wants to go back to school online to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science, but I'm afraid of investing so much time, effort and money into something that I don't know if it will be worth it. I have an AA In IT but didn't get hired until I got my A+, it's from a predatory online school though and I'm embarrassed about it.

I'm fully aware that I've spent too long in this position, I got complacent and me and my girlfriend both get the summers off which is really nice. But I feel like I've fallen behind. I don't know if this is relevant but I'm in my late 30s now. My life has gone through a massive shift since last year (new job, new relationship, new house, quit drinking, etc) so I'm more motivated than I used to be, but I feel like I've wasted a lot of time and gone soft."
11i282i,2,2023-03-04,Is part time jobs not a thing in USA? Because I always read about internships. Or are they the same?,gul-tekanna,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11i282i/is_part_time_jobs_not_a_thing_in_usa_because_i/," 

When I read this sub and cscq, people always talk about internships as the only way as getting some experience before you graduate. It's important and a good way to create connections in the industry

But, here in Europe(and I've worked in 3 countries) we usually just hired part time students for many developer or related(like simple data engineering/analytics) positions, then they sometimes just got hired after, or they moved out from the university city back to their home town where I guess

Same for me when I studied, I worked part time at a web agency for several years. Maybe I mix up the terminology, but it seem to me that what americans talk about as internship is a fixed period of 12-16 weeks where you work full time in the summer break or as a master thesis mixed job in your last semester or so

You also have the internship apply periods for some season, we always just hired continously during the semesters

Thankfully, I found out that summer what I wanted to eventually do after shadowing one of the workers there. Become a sysadmin or a network admin.

I was able to land a job recently at a local MSP and I feel more motivated than ever to get started. I know more or less about what they are going to expect me to be doing. The employer emphasized that he wants me to grow and become a part of their team. Overall, management made me feel like they wanted me there.

My reasoning is that I’ll have more skills and knowledge in various areas (networking, repair, etc.). Also, if I decide to pursue my Bachelor's, I could get into Computer Science rather than one niche area, like Software Development.

The reason I’m looking into this particular program is because it is the only computer science/IT-related program offered that involves an internship. There are others (at both this community college and another one that’s nearby), like software development, web development, cybersecurity, and networking, but they don’t offer internships.

Would this even be worth it? Would I be able to find work, or should I pursue one of the other programs and find an internship myself? I know it’s not impossible to find an internship on one's own, but it’s extremely difficult, to say the least. (FWIW, I know the cybersecurity program I’m looking at is called Technical Support &amp; Cybersecurity, and they help you get a few CompTIA+ certs and certification as a Cisco network tech. Though I know ultimately certs mean next to nothing without experience.)

I’d very much appreciate everyone’s input! :)"

However, the used car market is pretty bad right now and, for the price I'm willing to pay cash (5000$-7000$), I don't see many cars for sale that aren't damaged or over 200k kilometers (with automatic transmission).

If we look at my liquidities, I might be worth around 15-17k, so I would not feel comfortable having more than half my worth in a car, especially a used car, so I wouldn't want to spend more than my budget on a car (paying cash). One thing to consider also is that I will work full time this summer and I also have an internship of one month (not sure if it will be a paid internship or not yet) in May, which is why I ideally would have a car by then to avoid spending hours in public buses every day.

Buying a new car probably would have been the best move, but I don't think financing a new car over 5 years so that I could afford it would make sense. Therefore, I've looked at the possibility of buying a used car, somewhat in good condition, worth between 8000$ and 12000$, putting a downpayment of around 3000$ so I can keep liquidities and financing it over one year, so that I'm not stuck with a car payment every month for years for a used car and pay a lot of interest. I have around 2 years of credit history (724 credit score) and currently work part-time.

I was wondering if my plan was a good idea, if it's possible or if there's a best solution in my situation.

I assign sa team ko as a full-stack contributor and the programming language and framework they use ay foundation lang alam ko and sa framework na related sa java ay wala pa talaga akong alam and It is hard for me na makasabay sa kanila kasi as in wala talaga ako alam and I try my best to keep up with them by self-studying every day but ang bagal ko mag-aral and naprepressure ako sobra like baka mainis na ka-team ko if 2-3weeks eh di ko pa din gets yung ginagamit nilang technologies and also, paid internship pa naman ito which I'm thinking na they are all invested sa akin kasi kala nila magaling ako and mabilis makasabay but in reality is not. Ako lang din intern dito sa team which makes me nervous and also It takes time to absorb yung pag-aaral ko like sobrang bagal.

This week, my supervisor give me time to learn maybe 1 week about the technologies but still can't understand them. He/she also give me a basic CRUD task to complete last week related sa pag-aaral ko pero di ko nagawa dahil naprepressure ako mag-aral at ang ikli ng timeframe but still now tinatry ko pa rin best ko na ipasa this week yung task na yun pero hanggang ngayon di ko pa rin magawa.

As an intern and incoming fresh grad, na-overwhelm ako na ganito pala sa real-life na trabaho lol where all things are fast-paced. Magaling ako sa school and I'm one of the best students pagdating sa programming according to my classmates from senior high school to college but I can't apply pala dito yung galing ko sa work and sa school lang nadadala yun. I'm thinking na lang na umalis ako dito sa company if 3-4 weeks di pa rin ako makasabay sa kanila because I'm thinking na sayang lang yung binibayad nilang allowance sa akin. I will drop na lang muna this OJT subject and try again next sem. because of the time na nasayang.

Pero bago muna yun, can someone give tips po on how to adapt sa ganitong set up during fresh grad or OJT/internship days niyo?"

2022 graduate with a masters degree in CS (equivalent to a 4 year BS degree in my country). Struggled a lot financially through my two years degree because of the miscalculations I made to pay for my masters degree. Lost the entire focus in studies and programming because of no money. Applied for a lot for internships during those two years but couldn't find any to gain any experience and support me financially. Finally got two full time job offer letters from two companies (A and B) but both of them have some conditions:

The company A pays 300k (in local currency) per year but have a bond of 80k for two years. Most of my classmates joined this company and all say that they have a good working environment but we never know until we start working there. The company is ready to onboard me as soon as possible. **Its office is in my present city.**

The company B gave me the offer letter in Jan 2022 of 400k without any employment bond but here is the twist. They onboard employees on the basis of business demands i.e. if there is no business demands they won't hire me as full time employee and on the top of that they have given me an unpaid training on their tech stack for 8 months from July 2022 to Feb 2023 . **Its offices are spread across various cities in my country, so I have to relocate. They have given April 2023 as the tentative month of joining.**

The only reason I have done this unpaid training at company B is because I didn't want to get stuck in company A because to be honest, my family can't afford to pay 80k if something goes wrong.

All of my basic programming (and cloud) concepts are clear, I have worked on some projects, have a GitHub profile, a LinkedIn profile, a resume. Everything is ready. I am ready to work on any technology.

All I was looking for a company to support me financially so that I could focus on programming rather than focusing on fulfilling my family's basic needs but that hasn't happened yet.

I have worked as hard as I could in my life to get good grades, to get some practical experience but I am still stuck in life. Even my body is giving up both mentally and physically.

I don't know what to do in life anymore."
11iggln,0,2023-03-04,"Don't be like me: If you want to get into Georgia Tech, you MUST take full IB Diploma",Knowahhh,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/11iggln/dont_be_like_me_if_you_want_to_get_into_georgia/,"Note: I go to a large public school in state that sends a bunch of kids to GA Tech each year (8ish) 

In sophomore year at my school you have the option to enroll in IB courses and full IB Diploma. However doing such would mean you basically would have to drop most if not all of your electives (think computer science, engineering etc.) I had always known I was going to do something in business so i thought that instead of doing full diploma I would take a bunch of certificates and APs so I could take more computer science and business classes. Also, doing this would allow me to apply to my schools internship program a year earlier which basically helps students get internships. 

What did this get me? deferred and then waitlisted (from GA Tech), which we all know is basically getting rejected. 

The reason I'm writing this is because I just found out that the person ranked one position below me (27/420) in GPA just got in. (note: i have a 95.2/100 UW 99.8/100 W). So clearly GPA wasn't the deciding factor. 

What about test scores? I have a 35/34/34/34 ACT and he has a 1500 in SAT. So test scores aren't really the difference, if anything mine was stronger than his. 

What about demographics? We are both relatively high income and male who wouldn't really benefit from any quotas. 

What about extracurriculars? I know I don't have the whole picture but I am confident I beat him in this category. I have state awards, school awards, regional awards, internships, founded a couple clubs leadership in a couple clubs all related to business... and he hasn't. I cant imagine his recommendations were any better than mine. 

So what does that leave? Essays and IB diploma. He is in my IB English class and he is not a Sophocles. So, ignoring the content of his essays the only difference between him and me is IB Diploma or not. Oh but class rigor how could I forget. I must have taken not rigorous classes if I didn't do full IB. By the time I graduate I will have taken 7 AP classes, 9 Honors Classes and 6 IB classes and every possible business and computer science class available at my school. Sure this might not have been the MOST rigorous at my school but I thought that this tradeoff would benefit me in the long run. Well right now it hasn't. Again I know I don't have the full picture but I cant help but feel not taking full IB diploma was what cost me GA Tech and possibly the other schools I'm waiting on.

I thought that by trying to prove to colleges that I have a passion for business they would overlook this one fact but i was wrong. I should have just sucked it up and taken a bunch of ""rigorous"" classes for the simple fact that they are ""rigorous"" and nothing else.

If u made it this far sorry for the rant. Also this guy in question 100% deserves it I'm just salty.

TLDR: Take diploma if possible."

2. Average CS major admit at a top school not primarily known for CS, like Harvard or Penn. You're taking care of business, but you're not a standout and are relatively anonymous at the university.
3. Top student in a CS Honors program at a non-CS school like Alabama or Arizona. You're among the best at the school and have priority access to university resources.

However, I will have the coursework completed next spring would there be a way to still discuss this on my application or should I leave this detail out of my application? 

&amp;#x200B;

Transfer courses: I have completed all of my CS coursework and mathematics coursework I am scheduled to complete in winter 2024, therefore I am on time to complete my math coursework, however, I am nervous that they won't take me if I apply and I state that I am going to finish in winter 2024. Is this a big deal to the admissions? I will still have this done before spring 2024 which is the deadline, but I am not sure if this is looked down upon when applying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clubs/Organizations: Associated Students Academic Senator (ASB/Student Government), President of the Computer Science Club, President of the Sexuality and Gender Acceptance Club, Tutor Lead of the Computer Science Club, Google Developers Student Club Technological Lead. Enrolled in my school's honors program and am currently honors Certified. Is there anything I should improve my regarding my clubs/organizations? I have contemplated creating a web development team, but it is still in the making.

  
Extracurriculars/Projects: Created my school's club hub website and worked alongside the club presidents to help students locate clubs easier with the new modern website (HTML, CSS, &amp; JS). Won a hackathon by creating a full-scale dating app in MLH utilizing (React.js, Django, and Twilio). Created a C++ gameboy emulator from scratch due to my passion for the language and a better understanding of memory management by creating a project. Created 4 different websites detailing my research on virtual reality benefiting or not benefiting the educational system (1 site for each app used/tested in the classroom). Published a book alongside my professor and honors peers detailing our findings about experimenting with VR in our classroom (Scheduled to release either this spring or summer). Created my own personal learning log by just using Django and bootstrap and shared my learning log for some of my fellow classmates to use. Created my own video game in unity and tested it alongside some of my classmates. Currently creating an app to help the incoming freshman with calculus 1 for fall 2023 (Swift). Created 4 different games in vanilla JavaScript at the beginning of my journey in computer science at community college when I was interested in gaining knowledge in web development. Studied the minimax algorithm and used it in my Chess game in C++. In terms of personal projects, how can I improve this section? 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the long post, but I am just looking to get some insight on what I can do better or if I should open myself to more opportunities before applying. I think my personal projects definitely need work and if anyone has any personal projects they created that stood out I would love to hear them just to gain some inspiration and new ideas for future projects! However, I feel like I am weak in job experience as well as internships for computer science. I have always struggled to find internships, therefore if anyone has any advice on this I would love to know! If there is any criticism I am 100% open to hearing it, so that way I can make improvements on where I might be lacking as a Student/CS major."

Edit:
So I just want to give some more info as well as thank all of you who have replied. I am a CS major so I have experience with a few programming languages I’ve had to touch through my career. I also do have a few fairly simple academic projects, plus two somewhat bigger projects. I also because of my major have knowledge of algos and analysis, which come useful to leet code type questions which I have been practicing on and off. I am also currently learning dotnet framework as I felt might be easier since most of my programming has been with Java. My worry was that I don’t have a lot of experience with technologies like sql, react.js and a lot of other technologies which dominate the field right now. I am putting in the work now, but some times I feel I might be a little late when compared to my peers. Again thank you for the advice and love to hear more."

However, I understand that US News rankings are not the end all be all, and wanted further insight into these programs.

For better context, I live in Virginia and so the cost would go like this: VT and Purdue (\~39k each per year room and board) &lt; UVA (48k/year R&amp;B yes school of engineering is overpriced and no aid or merit scholarships) &lt; UMD (\~49K/year received the presidential scholarship for 10k/year). I would say my two main choices would be UVA and UMD, considering they're also very similar in price. I know that UVA is more ""prestigious"" but I think for computer science, UMD has its fair share of recognition. I would say a huge factor for me is the internship and research opportunities (ofc with job placement after graduation), does UMD have an advantage over any of these schools?

The tuition for each school is not really far off from each other so is UMD the way to go? I appreciate any responses!"

I never had money for further education so stayed in the town and now 10 years later I can see how limited my options are. Firstly I never wanted to study commerce, I wanted to study only animation or game development but as there is no way to that without studying unnecessary subjects in class 12, so I went for commerce.


Some backstory about me that you can ignore :
I did take IP in 11 in which I learn absolute basics of mysql and java(NetBeans). After college I took some courses to study c, c++ and c#. I was supposed to go to kolkata after that to apply for internships while staying in hostel but my moms health deteriorated and I didn't leave. It was like that for two years and now my mom can't stay alone. She said she could but during 2020 I left for Kolkata for an office job and she had panic attack overnight and was hospitalized by the maid. Her sugar was 30 only and now nomatter how much i think about leaving, it ain't happening. Thankfully covid introduced work from home and now there is a way for me to stay with mom and also earn. I saved money last year to study B. Ed as a better source of income was needed but the course fee of 2L made sure I couldn't do that either. I teach kids accounts during evening time and that is how I earn my living. It's decent but my savings are 0.
Backstory over. 



Now I randomly stumbled upon a video on youtube that talked about self taught programmer who is doing decent and while I do take videos on youtube with a grain of salt, I researched a bit a saw there is some hope. So I want to ask for help here as most these videos were of people abroad and I think Indian recruiters only care about degree, I am hoping somebody can show me a pathway. I have started learning python from  freecodecamp in youtube and it's certainly easier than any of the language I have studied. I just want to earn decent money in work from home scenario. My current earning is 20k so any upgrade on that is great for me, thank you for reading this and sorry if I am not completely clear on some things.

It seems like 10-15 years ago, you could walk in and become a help desk tech and sysadmin without any degree or major certs.

Now-a-days, judging from what a lot of my coworkers say and posts on here, tech seems to have gotten *very competitive* in recent years. Most help desk jobs (low paying non WFH type even) are asking for a few CompTIA certs, a bachelors, and experience at a minimum. And they get hundreds of applicants as well. This isn't even considering higher tier support roles or even sysadmin roles.

I've seen this myself, I currently work at an MSP and looking at other jobs it seems to be pretty hard out there.

I personally went to college and got a bachelors and have a dozen certs to my name, but it still seems like the bar just keeps getting raised higher and higher. Eventually you'll need a CCNP + Bachelors to even become a junior network admin.

Of course, internships make all of this irrelevant, but even internships are very competitive to get as a college student.

Will we eventually hit a point where you need to have dozens of certs and college education + experience to reliably land jobs? Is IT just becoming too oversaturated and employers are therefor able to be extremely selective and cherry pick only the top tier candidates?"

Wasn’t allowed to join college due to extremely conservative family who believe in ‘traditional gender roles’ and focusing on me learning how to be a good wife instead. Was only allowed to complete highschool because of the laws in my country. I’ve been forced to sit at home while all my friends and peers are off to college and achieving their dreams. 

Somehow during highschool I managed  participating in extensive extra curricular activities that resulted in me receiving international awards (Olympiad gold medals within country and the greater geographic region, national and international championships for sports and academia.) however due to Covid my final exams were cancelled and we were graded on how we performed in the previous grades which resulted in my GPA getting dropped from a 3.8 to a 3.0.

I’ve been operating 2 non-profits for about 3 years. 
1st one focuses on the underprivileged areas near my neighborhood. I help widowed women and single mothers to gain skills that will prepare them to get jobs and become self sufficient (for eg, basic English skills, financial literacy, computing skills, hairstyling, makeup etc)
Impacted loads of women and then started helping children in those areas to help buy their school books and helping them apply to college and giving out scholarships. 

My second org is a rescue shelter that mainly focuses on a specific reptile and dogs. My sanctuary is one of the only places in the country were there has been successful breeding in captivity (the species is considered endangered in my country). There are also multiple special needs animals that I take care of.

I’ve also volunteered at major international events and other non profits.

Because of the physically and mentally abusive household that I live in, I have no way to attend college in person or even pay for it. My parents even tried to force me to get married because in their eyes women don’t need to get an education because they’re only good for getting married and serving their husband.
This resulted in me getting diagnosed with a disease that affected my mobility and I had to go through extreme difficulty to walk properly again.

Many kids from my non profit and my younger sister look up to me and I believe that’s it’s my responsibility to set an example for them. I do not want them to end up like me and i’ll do anything it takes.

Because of my situation my parents will not be paying for anything.
I talked to a few regular donors at my organization and they raised a substantial amount for me to attend college for a full year. Anything more than that is not possible.

Due to my non traditional situation, going to colleges in person will be hard so I decided to apply for the UPENN LPS online BAAS program and was accepted. 
I plan on applying to transfer to T-15 colleges after my first year. I can only attend if I receive financial aid or at least 75% of covered tuition. But that seems very unlikely because I’m international. Other than that I have T-15 level internships and extracurriculars. 

I just need advice on my future transfer capabilities and if I should join this UPenn program. I cannot attend community college because my parents will find out and I’m in desperate need of escape from my life to become independent. Will my transfer chances get affected ? Please give advice this is very crucial to me."

I cannot study MSc in Data Science in Germany, since its prerequisites need a bachelors in IT/CS/Statistics. So I chose to study Computational Mechanics assuming that atleast it'll prepare me with a few skills or tools needed in data science.

The masters program that I am studying introduces me to C++, Python, Unix Shell, basics of ML and HPC. Apart from these topics, it is a standard computational mechanics course with numerical methods, mechanics and FEM. 

However, I am already introduced to python programming and used to numpy and matplotlib. I also tried Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course.

2) Apply through college and get in the corporate world ( pay can be anything between 40k to 80k)  

Reasons for being confused :) 
1) For the past 3years, I have done a lot of work in ML/AI/CV and the IISC intern is offering me work in that field. (Most companies that come on campus are for sde role so they don't interest me much )
2) Pay is an issue, even though I have the privilege of taking the low paying option my mind is saying don't do that ( since few of my frens got a high paying intern, I am comparing myself to them💀; along with that I want to be independent from my parents and make them happy) 
3) plus I think for masters in future having IISC on my resume would help me.

The compensation is pretty much equal, maybe Meta has slightly nicer perks and corporate housing instead of a stipend, but not really a big factor.

I’m mainly conflicted because I’m pretty sure I want to do SWE, and realistically if the privacy engineering position wasn’t at FAANG, I wouldn’t be considering it. It could be interesting to see what privacy is like, and I already have two SWE internships (one at a decent but not well known company, and one at a tiny local international company). From what I gather their privacy engineering positon involves very little coding, so while I’m sure some skills will be transferable, I don’t know how much it will help with future SWE recruiting. That being said, Meta is a bigger name, but I’m not about the effect of the name vs. the effect of the position title. Also, what would look better on a resume for SWE full time recruiting next year: SWE at ServiceNow or privacy at Meta?

After that, I did a 2 months internship in a large association (30 establishments, 500-600 users on the department where I am). I prepared workstations (by hand, one by one, no deployment server) and then 3 months CDD where I was on the road on all sites to migrate people from old Citrix servers to RDS + M365.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to go on site, change the hardware, explain the changes, migrate the data, prepare the meetings with the other sites, check with the directors and the head of department (to check the user accounts, clean up, create new ones, etc.) + with the service technicians who came with me every day (a pool of 5 techs took turns one per day) + GLPI updates etc.. In short, nothing crazy technically, but I was thrown into the bath we'll say, the first day I had a USB key, no access and hop.

&amp;#x200B;

I stressed a lot but it went well, the technicians of the provider were cool and in the end this ESN offered to hire me. I've been hired again for 3 more months where I'm doing support on the southern part. I'm still a beginner though. I do a little bit of everything but at a low level.

I connect to the switch directly to see if I have the same behavior: same, gateway IP address but not internet. I send a feedback to the CIO who tells me to call the ISP, which I do. The ISP technician makes me do two or three basic tests and then solves the problem by telling me that it was due to a routing error on their side.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the example, which shows that what I can do is limited, but it's also quite representative of my job when it's not a ""simple"" request: basically, I contact the IS, I give feedback, and then I act under the supervision of someone and apply what I'm told. Typically, in this case, the CIO texted me ""good work"" afterwards, which always surprises me a little because I feel like I'm not doing much... Otherwise simple support (""Outlook doesn't work"" ""I don't have internet"" ""I don't have access to X folder"") etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, on the pure hardware part, I'm not crazy because my technician diploma was entirely remote except for the exam. I've already changed my RAM and my hard drive but rarely more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

I like support, I like assisting users, I have a good contact with them, this is clearly something I noticed during my first experiences of the last months. So there's a support dimension to it that I like. Besides, I got a lot of good feedback from the sites I was going to, and I think that the relational aspect is the most positive point that the CIO sees in me, that's what he told me the most often anyway. Which is cool, but I'd rather be recognized for the technical part, which is the heart of the job.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have to apply to other offers because my contract is ending soon (no permanent expansion of the IT team). I'm applying to some jobs for beginners but I'm afraid I haven't learned enough, practiced enough, in short, I'm not up to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I take all your advice."

I think the only way I stand a shot is by working on the topic over the summer - I have some prior research experience in the topic but it can't compete with the current ML PhD application pool. 

I don't really want to do a regular SDE or MLE internship since my objective is to try and get a PhD. The lab I work at in my university is willing to let me work with them over the summer, but it's a different domain (3D CV), and so I'm hoping to find a lab that fits my interests better. Unfortunately most of my cold emails have gone unanswered, and I don't really know where to look for this kind of information. 

Any tips on searching for research positions like these? In an ideal scenario, I'd like to find a great lab, intern over the summer and then go back there for a PhD."

11j3tw3,27,2023-03-05,t-25!,tokeni,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/11j3tw3/t25/,"Thank you for tuning again! and Happy Sunday!

Look, it's 5\^2 days left until March 30th. Hey, I thought it'd be nice to mention that because I'm literally a math simp, but who here isn't? 

OK, let's jump right into jumping with joy for our good friend, **Georgetown**, and his close buddies, shall we?

Coming in hot as hot can be at #22 on U.S. News, there's plenty of reasons to love or hate on Georgetown. Solid academics across the board, its professors are as popular and highly regarded as are at other similarly-ranked universities. Yes, Georgetown does come off as outdated, even in comparison to its peers. That said, it'd be rather unlikely that you couldn't find opportunities to serve and contribute for a good and noble cause, not just on campus but likely in D.C. as well. The value of the ""Georgetown"" brand will absolutely hold its value perhaps forever, and I would argue that its alumni network is stronger than many ivies because of its' reputation in the realms of college sports and politics.

Whereas Georgetown is situated near D.C., the George Washington University stands directly at the core of D.C. The student body is kind of saturated in the sense that it may tend to choose to admit students from wealthy backgrounds. That's not saying much, but it could be a stressful aspect to deal with socially if you come from FGLI background. However, GWU is special because of its location, and internships and networking is made that much easier. If you do plan on attending here, then I strongly encourage you to take advantage of all the pros, such as the proximity to White House, etc., and the connections it has to important ambassadors and politicians.

What about American University? In my opinion, there's no better school than American University if you are a passionate SJWs who is looking to make a direct impact by spending years getting an undergraduate degree while also participating local socials and politics. I mean it endearingly. Actually, a buddy of mine graduated from AU several years ago, and since then, has worked for non-profit organizations, worked in the Midwest with Indigenous populaces, and looking back, has appreciated what opportunities AU offered him, and last I heard, he's still happily married to a Yale alum. Other than its' emphasis and support for social justice work, AU isn't great in most other regards, and it's probably best relegated as a ""safety school"" for anyone interested in public policy and foreign affairs.

Howard University. On one hand, it is run by unreliable admins, and their professor are not the best. It is lacking in those ways. On the other hand, if you are looking for a college experience that is based on connecting with other black students, then Howard is the premier institution for that. It's called a home for a reason, and while FAMU or NCA&amp;T will obviously be cheaper options if you're only looking for a degree from a HBCU, there's a culture of excellence at Howard that is unique and incredible. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think about D.C.? Do tell your opinion and stories about D.C. in the comments. Ngl, I'm trying to instigate a fight between NYC, Boston, Philly, and D.C. lovers. And that's a clue as to what city I'll focus on next, so it could be a TUFT decision for me.... get it? lol

I'll be right back with more fun reviews! Thank you all for the support, and I'll see you tomorrow!"

I am a current CS undergrad at mid-tier state school planning to graduate in December 2023.

Due to the current economic situation, I am stuck on deciding whether to pursue a masters or go straight into the workforce after I graduate.

The main reason I want to go to school for masters is that I would be able to apply for internships at top places such as FAANG and try to obtain a return offer, which I've heard is easier than just directly applying to these places. I currently have an internship this summer at a large, non-tech company, but it's not a company I would prefer to work at after graduation as their new grad salary is relatively low. The cost of masters is not a big concern as long as I can get value out of it.

I've read multiple posts on this subreddit saying that a masters is not worth it for SWE and that it's better to go straight for a job. If I decide to apply for jobs, I would probably keep my internship's return offer as a backup and apply to other places."

What should I do?",realjasong,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11jl6fi/csecon_major_but_i_dont_feel_like_i_have_what_it/,"Rant ahead.

I major in CS, Econ and have a minor in business studies. I completed internships in both CS and finance; the former was paid and the latter was not, My mother always told me that she believed I should pursue a career as a programmer, which is partially why I chose to major in CS.

At first my CS courses were relatively easy, but as I began my fourth semester things started getting rough. But I still wanted to do well in CS; in fact, I focused so much on my CS course last semester that I ended up neglecting my other courses (there were four programming assignments that were half my grade). I did end up doing well in that particular CS course however.

Right now I’m questioning whether I have what it takes to excel in computer science. Because the hours I spend on these coding projects is either at office hours or just staring blankly at the prompt, going online searching for suggestions that I end up not being able to understand, or frantically asking questions in our student chat group.

I started gravitating toward my Econ and business studies side in my studies and my job applications. My mother isn’t that happy about it, and I’m wondering if I made the right decision. I have gotten a few interviews, but I haven’t been able to receive an update from them.

I just don’t know what to do anymore."

I'm a university student at a semi-target T30 school (UVA) who just recently switched career focuses from social science to software engineering. All of my previous internship/project experience have been in Computational Social Science (a research internship at another university in Geographic Information Systems, and a schoolyear research position helping a social scientist with coding and data analytics). By the time I apply for internships next year I should have a good amount of upper-level CS coursework, and a decent GPA in my CS classes (Analysis of Algorithms, Software Engineering, Computer Systems).

I recently decided to pursue a Software Engineering internship and would optimally like a position at FAANG and Microsoft. I want to know whether this is possible with my nontraditional resume, and what I should work on to maximize my chances (any advice on courses to take, and things to do in my spare time). Would getting a Software internship at a no-name local company help things, or would it be more beneficial to spend the summer working on personal projects/leetcode and build up my resume that way?

Thanks in advance for all your advice!"

11jqp92,2,2023-03-06,Suggestions for a person who likes understanding people's experiences?,Eve1273060909,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/11jqp92/suggestions_for_a_person_who_likes_understanding/,"I graduated college last year. I'm from a developing country and my parents sent me to the U.S. for college and paid for full tuition (I know it's a ton of money,) but I didn't make much use out of it. My major was in physics but I think I only liked the philosophical tint to it like how we understand the world or make stories and guesses about the parts we don't know. I liked English and some part of philosophy but I struggled in a different system for expectations of work, which my country's high schools don't have the same kind of evaluation for, and I had trouble working with goals that aren't clearly stated. Of course a degree in humanities wouldn't be much help in finding a job either. But in my final year of college I was miserable having to examine things that are far from our experiences, and I would take less pay though I hope not to have to worry about livelihood.

Does anyone have suggestions in my case? I know you have to balance doing a job you kind of like and the pay, and I wonder if I put too much weight on fit vs taking a stable job like programming, but how far should you go, those things makes me mind-dead. Routine tasks numb my mind. I feel the world is suited for people whose personalities make them think about making profits, or who help them do it by analyzing data and developing products and not for people like me who like to enlarge the boundary of my own experience. Those things have hard knowledge that you can be valued for but understanding and relating to similar experiences feel common sense. I've considered social work for a long time, especially in the hospital, but some of the sw positions pay terrible, and on reflection I doubt if it's the way to go for relieving problems (maybe I'm ignorant, I don't know a lot about the field,) because some service like operates on donations from people who get rich from the societal structure that made the recipients poor. I also thought about technical writing but you'd have to be interested in machines and products. And copy editing, but the work is contract, not a stable job. I've also thought about a small area I/O psychology, but then I'm not very interested in the procedures in HR and how much money you help save through the job, and it seems it needs a psych bachelors. At this point I just feel like I've looked at the list of all the jobs and ruled out each one and there's no option left.

As a side question, how can you get into a job if you have no experience? I've graduated so can't take on internships from companies and there's not much skilled volunteer work. Or if anyone have similar interests or experiences, would they be willing to share? Thank you for any advice."
11jqw6l,6,2023-03-06,What does a person with a biology degree do? Seriously. I need advice.,mcshnazzy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11jqw6l/what_does_a_person_with_a_biology_degree_do/,"Look, my (23f) goal 4 years ago was to become a medical doctor. I was all set, I had just been accepted into a prestigious summer internship, great college gpa, and everything was going pretty perfect. Then covid screwed everything up. Internship was canceled and my gpa tanked below medical school standards. Somehow, I managed to graduate with a Bachelors of Biology and I have no freaking clue what to do. 

I have searched the whole internet for jobs with a bio degree and everything either needs more education (masters, PhD, etc), some extra certification (for working in medical labs), or just won't call me back. I have always loved forensic stuff, so I recently applied to several autopsy technician jobs and morgue jobs (both of which only require a high school diploma) and nothing! And these are entry-level jobs!!! I feel like I wasted my time with a useless degree while everyone around me was working on career advancing opportunities.

I need advice from people both with and without degrees. Should I abandon biology completely? Start over and find a job doing something practical that everyone needs? Or should I commit and go for a higher degree in something like forensic science, forensic psychology, or some science? Is it even worth it?

EDIT: Well, I looked into accelerated nursing programs for people that already have a degree but apparently I'm missing one of the prerequisite classes. Is it worth it to go back and take 1 or 2 classes from a community college to become a nurse or should I abandon it and go into computer science or something."

So im currently in my 2nd year in cs in a 3 year program (april 2024) as an international student and i wanted to have a little guidance.

Summer is coming and unfortunately I havent contributed much to my side projects, my resume is rather empty so I don't really know if summer internships are really possible so some thoughts are stressing out that i hope to be answered:

- I want to take a gap semester, preferably after fall term to be able to apply for internships, I will use this summer I have to grind LC and projects. I dont know if this is allowed or will this affects my pgwp or not but I just want to squeeze in an internship before I graduate.

- Let say I graduate on time and applying for jobs. I don't care about the pay, I desperately need a job even if its like 30-50k cs job. How viable is this? The ultimate goal is to get a PR but I desperately need a job with my crappy resume with no internships.

Any answer or advice is appreciated, it has been stressing me out for a solid year and I feel like my future in Canada is slowly fading away.

How can I present myself the best so that they would concider me for a job? It would be a big step for my career.

11jzi0v,1,2023-03-06,I resent my depressed boyfriend,resentfulmoron,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11jzi0v/i_resent_my_depressed_boyfriend/,"Hi.

I know how the title sounds, but I need advice.

And I'm sorry for how long this is.

My (24F) boyfriend (27M) has been depressed since I have met him, but has been functional until a year ago. We have been dating for five years and while things haven't always been great due to both of our mental health, for most of the time he was the one I would like to spend my life with.

Until a year ago, he showed me he loved me every single day, he would surprise me with simple but thoughtful things, he took care of me and would visit regularly when I was stuck at home recovering from a surgery for a month, he remembered small little dates that would matter and was just extremely affectionate and kind to me.

By the way, we do not live together, but we have plans to. In my country, the average person leaves their parents house at 30 years old because of the way economy has been going, so we have been struggling a lot.

After he lost his job last year, he lied to me for the first time during sex. Even though it was quite a small lie, it affected me greatly as I have some sexual trauma which makes me feel quite vulnerable, even more than usual I assume (he knows about everything that happened to me) and being dishonest with me at that moment made me feel horrible. He apologized and we tried to move on, but I admit that I struggled a lot with this and was more reactive to small problems afterwards.

After this issue, everything just went downhill, in my opinion.

He started hiding things from me, where he was or what he was doing, he stopped planning things entirely (I already planned most of our dates, but it went from 70%-30% to 90%-10% responsibility), he couldn't keep a job for more than 3 months and is still unemployed, doesn't have a car nor knows how to drive, and then, unfortunately, he lost his father.
We have had hundreds of conversations where he says he is going to do his best and make an effort and do more for the relationship, but time and time again he just ends up disappointing me and making me feel unappreciated.

In one of these conversations, after I told him that I was tired of feeling like this and wanted to understand what had changed between us and what could we both do to improve, he admitted he had been taking me for granted, but that he wanted to get better.

I have been working for a while now. After I finished university, I did some internships at a few companies where I was worked like a dog for more than a year and now I'm at a new company where, while it isn't perfect, at least I'm being payed an actual salary. I have been saving money to be able to move out and either rent an apartment or perhaps eventually buy my own place. While I was working, I have been struggling with my mental health as well, because of burn out and the chronic depression I have been suffering with for years now. So I am also in therapy. Which I understand that this might be hypocritical of me.

It's been over one year of lying, false promises and just 0 effort and I have come to the conclusion that I resent him deeply and that I no longer respect him. I feel incredibly selfish, because I understand that he has been going through a lot, losing his father has impacted him greatly and it's obvious that he is completely lost and has been lost for a long time. However, I also feel like I have become his mother, his caregiver and his girlfriend - I had to be the one to motivate him to finish his studies and then when he told me he was miserable after months and didn't want to study, I helped him get off and find interviews, I helped him create a CV and I am the one who has been carrying the emotional weight of the relationship for more than a year now. I don't feel like I'm in a relationship, I feel like I am constantly taking care of someone who can't or isn't willing to do the same for me now.

I am not sure what to do anymore. I know I'm being unfair, since he has been dealing with so much and I am scared that if I leave him, he will do something bad.

Please help me.

TLDR: My boyfriend has been depressed for a really long time, it has been affecting our relationship immensely and I am not sure what to do anymore."

It's March 1. R1 decision dates have come and gone. R2 decision dates are soon approaching....  
Many of you lucky intelligent, overachieving, (handsome/pretty?) GClubbers have a destination or two (or more) in in the BSchool Class of 20xx  
But what should you do now? Give up on your job and coast? Quit? Travel the world? Take hardcore accounting classes? Thank you [**nink**](https://gmatclub.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;un=nink) for [drafting this message 10 years ago](https://gmatclub.com/forum/admitted-i-can-t-wait-till-i-can-quit-my-job-syndrome-109102.html) \- it still lives on and still very potent! \[This topic was originally written by Nink, a storied GMAT Club moderator and is now edited, improved and reposted with relevant current advice\]  


1) It's only March 1 and Fall is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO Far away.  
2) Now that you KNOW you will be gone in the near future, your productivity has dropped significantly at work.  
3) If you hated your job before, now you are giddy with the prospect of sending a legendary, explosive goodbye email to all those b\*st\*rds (at work) who made your life a living hell.  


A lot of you guys are anxious to put your current career behind, and start your bschool journey ASAP.  


**Here are various Do's and Don't's that some of us have learned the hard way** 📷  
(And other current/past students, and other members, please feel free to chime in)  
**1) Should you stop working to your best abilities at work? Should you burn the bridge and fire away that email to the entire company (explaining how much they suck?)**  
Probably not. Believe it or not, networking does not simply mean meeting new people once you enter bschool. It also means keeping your current relationships intact. No matter how much you might hate your boss, no one can't predict whether you may need his/her help in the future.  


I've met a M7 student this past summer during after-work/internship networking event in NYC. He/she struck out during on campus recruiting at his/her school, and had to return to his/her old employer to do a paid summer internship. He/she kept in touch with various people from his/her ex-employer, that he/she was able to at least get a paid gig for the summer.  


**2) Should you quit your job early and either take a vacation or do something else before school?**  
If you have a trust fund, significant other (who will finance your early freedom), or rich parents, etc - ABSOLUTELY. It's a good idea to take a mental break now before starting school. You won't have time to relax once the school starts, so enjoy your life while you can. However, if you don't have such arrangement (rich parents, etc), stay as long as you can. Debt sucks. You don't want to know how much interest you end up accruing month after month while in school. Bschool life can get quite expensive. You will always be poor in BSchool.   


**3) Should you get an early start by reading various textbooks, etc?**  
Probably not. I admire your desire to excel in academics but you are ALREADY well prepared for bschool at this point. Most of you will do very well in school. **Rather, I would work on your communication skills**. If you are not a good public speaker, I would practice NOW and get used to speaking in front of strangers, etc. This is important because without great communication skills (including the ability to sell yourself effectively), you will have a tough time in class and during recruiting.  


Work on your killer closing speech now. It comes in handy during recruiting. Interview is not about going in and answering their questions. Before you go it, KNOW exactly what YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW ABOUT YOU. Make a mental list of those items in your head. Before the interview is over, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING on your list was communicated to the other side. That makes a successful interview.  


**4) What is the biggest regret of current students?**  
Not having started recruiting &amp; career research before BSchool. There are no resume writing classes and there are no ""introduction to consulting"" classes either. You are expected to know this ahead of time and if you are starting from scratch expecting to be spoonfed, you will be managing this in addition to your school work, networking events, clubs, etc. Start early before bschool - figure out which companies you want to work at, down to the exact names and locations and do as much research, networking as you can. It is easier if your goal is MBB but you can still do a lot to prep for interviews, network with current consultants and ask for advice, work on presentation skills, etc. Don't expect anyone to hold your hand in BSchool - it is sink or swim and it really helps if you know a thing or two about swimming before you get dumped in the deep end of the pool.   


**5) What about my current boy/girl friend? significant other?**  
There's no right or wrong answer to this one. Different people do things differently. I've seen people break up before bschool amicably. I've seen married people moving together. I've seen married people living in different states. Whatever option you end up choosing, if you put in the effort to make it work, it will work out in the end.  


My soon to be wife and I were already engaged when we decided to get our MBA. She was little more ambitious and ended up doing her MBA in the west coast because she wanted to live where ""they have better weather"" \~  
Me - I only did my MBA because: 1) did not want to move to west coast; 2) did not think I would get into the school that she was going to; 3) she's doing it so I guess I will get one as well  


We spent the last year and a half on the opposite side of the country but made every effort to come together during the breaks, holidays, etc. We made it through and we will be getting married in June before both of us begin our post MBA careers.  


**6) Is MBA worth it? It's too expensive!**  
Well, nothing in life comes easy and we have to take a risk sometimes. But important thing is that we manage our exposure to that risk.  


I think if you invest $X amount for X MBA program (which, traditionally placed its graduates into great jobs, etc + great education that will pay dividends over your career), then you have a good reason to take that risk. But let's say you lost your job or you simply hate your current job. You are simply going to school Y because you just want to get out of your current situation and you expect to get a job out of it after 2 years. That's a risky decision.  


**7) Finally - Manage your future expectations now**  
What can MBA do for you? Different people have different expectations. Usually, it's really optimistic. But no matter where you end up matriculating, in the end, it's all up to you.  


If you are a bad driver, and you buy a Mercedes, it's not going to make you a better driver. You will simply be a bad driver driving a really nice car.  


If you expect that your degree from school X will suddenly change your life completely, you will be making a similar mistake. A top b-school MBA will definitely open you doors. But to make the best out of your opportunity, you have to evolve. You have to make an effort. I don't mean that you should simply: 1) excel in classes and get great grades, 2) attend all the workshops and seminars, 3) go to all the networking events, etc  


You should do all that and make small efforts such as: 1) If you are bad with names, make an effort to change that. If you meet someone new, the old ""you"" would say, ""I will learn his/her name eventually."" Change that and say, ""I don't care what I have to do today. Even if it means I have to spend next 20 minutes and tell her all my embarrassing flaws, I am going to know that person and learn his/her name today.""  


If you were never in to sports, take this opportunity (over next 2 years) and find new friends who are into sports - learn why they are into sports, and attend sporting events with them and REALLY make an effort to see if there are any sporting events that you may end up liking.  


If you have never went to a broadway show, take this opportunity and change that. Make an effort. Who knows what you really like anyway? I learn new things every day and as a result, I evolve for worse or for better. But what I know is that I am not the same person that I was 2 years ago.  


Try to make small efforts like that over the next 2 years. You will be pleasantly surprised...  


**8) If you are an international Student in the US, don't try to live in the Comfort Zone of your Country**  
Part of the experience is exploring the American culture, learning about it, and getting to know how things work. Living with your countrymen/countrywomen may feel safe and convenient. You can commiserate about American football or American food but it will rob of integrating into a society faster, learning the culture, and generally enjoying your experience a lot more. If you can, get an American roommate - you will enjoy your experience a lot more and have a chance to teach them about something and learn from them quite a bit.   


**9) Your first few weeks/months in Bschool will be WEIRD but it will get BETTER**  
Thank you [**AlexMBAApply**](https://gmatclub.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;un=AlexMBAApply) for this feedback/comment - I completely agree.   


However, what you want to just be aware of is how the social dynamic evolves over the course of 2 years.  
I can't speak for every person who went to b-school, but at least in my own experience as well as others (both friends and past clients), is this:  


In the first few months of school, it will feel like HIGH SCHOOL. Yes. High school. Not even college.  After these few months (the first thanksgiving is usually the turning point), people do mellow out a bit, and there's far less posturing.  


Everyone is insecure when they come into a new environment. Some students may know a handful of folks beforehand (i.e. went to the same college, worked in the same firm), but even then, few if any are really friends.  


So just about everyone comes in with no real friends in the school.   


And for some reason, it makes the group as a whole regress back to high school. We all get insecure, and we all want to be liked, and we all feel a bit nervous about ""what if I don't make any friends?"" or ""I really want to establish my reputation"" blah blah blah. Some may even inadvertently project their desire to be ""that popular gal/guy"" or the ""man on campus"" -- something they never really were in college or high school. Or trying to live up to some image of what a popular person should be, or trying to relive college days they never had.  


Just know that EVERYONE, all your classmates, are feeling the same way you do in the first few months, no matter how much ""posturing"" some folks may do to overcompensate.   


You'll probably even see some folks who try a bit too hard to be ""that guy who everyone likes"" or the ""party central dude"" or whatever. Or the guy who talks up a great game (whether they do it in a subtle or overt way) about their sexual conquests, name dropping as a way to show that they know important people, trying too hard to project that they're more outgoing than they really are, or even trying a bit tooooo hard to come across as more relaxed and chill than they really are.  


But just know that it's all posturing. And you may even do it from time to time at a dinner party, drinking event, etc. Everyone is a bit insecure, and because it's been a while since you were ""new"" to a school (i.e. freshman year in college), for many of you, this will be the first time in a long time where you've been in an environment with a bunch of people roughly your age (because at work, you were likely one of a handful of youngins in a sea of old folks). As such, it's easy to even inadvertently assume that there's going to be a social pecking order (just like high school) and it's important to establish your social standing right away.  


While there likely will be a lot of posturing (i.e. ""look at me! I'm such a party hard dude!"" or ""I'm going to be that guy who has 500 of his closest friends from b-school over for a house party!"") in an effort to outdo others in their extroversion, that will go away. People calm down. Most of us will eventually realize that no one in school really cares about that anyway, even if the initial insecurity of not knowing anyone may make one do some foolish things to get others to like them.  


So long as you're normal and well adjusted, you WILL make friends. You WILL have a great time, without having to try sooooo hard to ""network"". So long as you're helpful to people without being overbearing, and you go to some social events (don't feel you need to go to EVERY one), you will do just fine. You may not make friends in the first few months, but a lot of people will be in the same boat, wondering where they should go on the weekends, who to socialize with, etc. Find a way to overcome that insecurity and just be yourself -- and you will find your place within the school with friends you love hanging out with.  


Eventually, the people you really like will be your friends, and the people you don't like you won't have to really deal with them outside of academics.  


And finally, don't take yourself too seriously. If you have a sense of humor about yourself, you'll likely get less stressed out in school, and you'll be able to also laugh at some of the absurdities and neurosis of some of your fellow classmates...

11k0j4o,2,2023-03-06,Is it bad to mention ongoing projects on your resume when applying for an internship? (Computer Science),Cronos993,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/11k0j4o/is_it_bad_to_mention_ongoing_projects_on_your/,"Hi reddit,  
So basically, I am in my sophomore year of undergrad CS and I am looking to apply for internships this summer. Here are some of the questions I wanted to ask:

1. I am making a website along with a friend for coding competitions; kind of like a mix between online judges and leetcode style websites. This started out as a passion project (also, it's our first FS web project) but later when we were asked to make a project for our database course, we threw it in. We are developing it using the MEVN stack and of course some bash and C++ for the judge.The thing is, it's not complete as of now  since I mentioned that it's our first FS web-based project but we have figured things out and are making some actual progress (for beginners) like integrating ACE editor into the website and being able to execute code on the server along with  a login page along with the authentication that actually looks professional with all the cool CSS animations but, a lot of the work still remains which we work all day on.  
The question is, should I add it on my resume as an ongoing project? I really want to, cause I think it's quite impressive for the 3rd world country market I am in where most of the projects are really basic even for people who have graduated. Would that give a negative impression if it's ongoing? would it help if I also provide a link to the open-source github repository me and my friend are working on?
2. I have made some teeny tiny open source contributions to some decently large projects like FastAI where I added a feature and was tagged in their patch notes along with a bug I found and fixed myself which I think is good enough to add but, the other os contribution I made was in Cabal (the official package manager for Haskell) where I literally just changed one line of code and later reviewed a PR relating to that. The thing is, I don't know Haskell so I wouldn't be able to talk too much about it cause it was a very basic change. The internship doesn't require any experience in Haskell so that's not the problem. So, if I mention that it wasn't something huge would that be ok to fit in? Note that I am not an active contributor in these projects.
3. Most of the internships I see on LinkedIn in my area, have a requirement that you should be a fresh graduate because my country produces a lot of bad graduates and so, companies look for these desperate fools to get work out of as ""interns"" (even though they would barely of any use). An internship by a decent looking startup I am keeping an eye on is saying you must be in the 3rd year of CS but I am in the 2nd year. Should I still apply?

If you read all of that and want to help me out then thanks a ton."

 Hi so i am a 2nd year student doing btech in cs and have a strong dislike for coding but was fascinated by the product management field. I would like to know how to get internship in this field and i am willing to take and implement whatever advice you will give.  
 

I am a student in the 4th semester in a tier 3 college.

I have recently found myself aligned with this field.

I would like to know the skills and oppurtunities required to join this field.

11k1qii,16,2023-03-06,A (possible?) list of EC Ideas for CS + Environmental Science Majors,NathanA2CsAlt,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/11k1qii/a_possible_list_of_ec_ideas_for_cs_environmental/,"\* These are just ideas I came up with as I was doing my personal project with NOAA

&amp;#x200B;

1. Revisions of existing code-bases for NOAA generation data. These programs haven't been revised since the 70s, and often are inefficient, ugly, and annoying as F\*ck to use. [NOAA Affiliated Projects](https://github.com/NOAAGov/NOAA-Affiliated-Projects)
2. Improvements to various climate models using AI and Statistics. Doing this will make you a wonderful coding gerbil. As, at least from what I've experienced, many physicists/researchers don't know how to code, let alone use AI/ML, and people who know how to code with AI/ML don't understand how to use the physics, chem, or bio in their training efficiently. If you enjoy both, you are an extremely valuable asset. 
3. Blog posting on [medium.com](https://medium.com) or similar service, this is actually something I've started doing. While I am currently not doing this for college applications, it does demonstrate an interest in the topic at hand which is useful for internships and such. Right now, I am making one about installing a certain kind of software made entirely in Fortran.. What a pain in the ass.
4. As a follow up to 3, creating documentation and explanations for stuff! So essential, yet often not done adequately. Since I like making things more efficient and easy to use, this is the best way to connect my joy of teaching to my interests directly. Nothing shows you understand a concept like being able to explain it to others

&amp;#x200B;

I have these on the top of my head, I'll append as I come up with potentially other ideas."

Imagine you are a recent hire for a full-time tech job at company **A** (which you want to stay with) and a part-time degree at school **X** in the evening. However, due to a scholarship arrangement (eg. scholarship-for-service) that pays for that part-time degree **X**, you are required to intern full-time at a different company **B** for the summers only. It is mandatory to do part-time degree **X** with this scholarship-for-service condition.

Ideally, I want to do A + X during non-summer seasons and do B + X during summer. (Explicitly, after the summer of B + X, I return to doing A + X in September.)

Is this possible? How would I go about asking for this? I'm okay with taking unpaid time-off from A, but I'm worried that A won't let me return after summer. Also, should I be considering any other factors during thought experiment? (I'm discounting opportunity costs for A that incur due to a summer at B.) 

(Also, I shouldn't mention during the interview that I would take the summer off to do internship with B, right?)"
11k5wgg,8,2023-03-06,IT manager in need of help,InexplicableDecision,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/11k5wgg/it_manager_in_need_of_help/,"Sorry for the wall of text!

We are a small local government with about 260 users with several offsites. I have 2 desktop support staff, and that's it.

When I started this job, I inherited a shit network a few years ago. Almost all services had default admin password or no password. There were internal servers open to public access for convenient access, and I saw a standalone Windows Server 2000 running unrestricted without a purpose on the network in addition to a few Windows XP running on desktops. In addition, of course everybody had local admin privilege.

People were able to do whatever they wanted for a long time. When they fuck up, one of the support staff would pretty much just grab the machine and reimage the device. By the way, the reimaging process was all manual and take all day or two to get it done. Because the staff will grab Windows 10 installation CD or flash drive and start installing the OS, updating, and other necessary applications one by one (now it takes 30 minutes or so to reimage it, phew).

Main Firewall was severely undersized for the size of this organization and some of the routers and switches were either completely unconfigured or had some other organizations information still on it due to obtaining the device somewhere else and plugged into the network immediately without being looked at or configured.

There hasn't been much of any documentation other than several years old network diagram and excel spreadsheet of admin credentials (even though majority of them were default passwords). There was no asset management of any kind. We had so many different version of applications, biggest one being Office applications ranging from 2003 to 2016.

Users were constantly complaining about frequent network outage and slow speed (some switches were configured half duplex for some reason???)

Anyway, few years past now. We have a stable network with much improved security posture. We still have a long way to go, and we are making an improvement constantly.

The problem that I have now is that I feel like a such a shit manager. I may be an okay engineer. I have not been able to motivate my support staff to learn about server management/networking.

It has taken me a few years to make them show up to work on time and work on tickets as they come in (not when they feel like doing it) and prioritizing tasks. I still need to jump onto half the support tickets to help them troubleshoot. I started asking them more questions to improve their troubleshooting mindset/thought process.

I have asked multiple times about hiring someone who can help me manage the network, and upper management keeps saying we don't need more people and maybe I can get an intern in the future. They assured that if they were to hire someone, the position will be filled with a local college student or recent graduate from a local college.

When I explained to them why I need someone with some skills/knowledge, their response is always ""just train them."" All they care about is optics and local politics and bragging rights.

I genuinely feel like a shit manager for failing to convince the upper management of the IT's needs and get the help we need. I would like to motivate my employees to better themselves and make themselves useful as they have so much free time and we provide online training solution. I would really like them to get the career satisfaction. I even recommended a few certification options they could work on if they are interested. All expenses paid for by the employer. I have had quite a few 1-on-1 meetings with both of them to learn and figure out what their interests are and help them achieve their goals. I really haven't been successful at that. They are leaps and bound better than a few years ago, but they are still having issues with basic networking fundamentals, and don't see the desire to learn more.

I keep telling myself that it will get better and I will have more time to work on improving our procedures, processes, policies after finishing these projects to further stabilize our network and plugin some big security holes. In reality, my plate is constantly overflowing and I feel like I am drowning (recently, my boss said ""You are now supporting this new organization. Help them out with whatever they need). I am finding myself increasingly more short-tempered and more on the edge. This is not me. Now I am looking into therapy sessions to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss and the employees are actually good people. Although my employees are not where they should be, they have improved a lot over the years. I know there are lots of people in similar situation. I would like to get some input and see what I can do to improve the situation. All constructive criticisms are welcome. I'd really like to improve myself, my employees, and the organization."

I’ve done well in all my CS classes and internships but i think a large part of that is due to the fact that there has been so much hand-holding for any programming I have had to do. For all my programming assignments and internship work I’ve always had detailed instructions telling me exactly how to do things to the point where it feels like I’ve never really had to figure much out for myself. Because of this I feel like I might not just be a good programmer, simply good at following instructions. Some of this may be imposters syndrome but I feel like it is more than just that. Whenever people have technical discussions I often find myself getting lost on simple topics that I have definitely learned at some point but just can’t seem to remember or by the time i can parse what they meant they’ve moved on and I can no longer follow along. This makes me feel like I might have important gaps in my CS fundamentals. 

I was wondering if anyone has any advice for when you feel this way or any tips to do well in your first full-time job. I was also wondering if anyone had any useful resources to make you better software engineers early on or anything to help potentially fill in any gaps in the fundamentals I may have. I have a lot of free time this semester and i want to spend it learning how to be a better programmer and feel confident in building things for myself rather than needing a lot of guidance.

Any advice or resources is really appreciated!"

I already  submitted my application for the Fall so I won’t have that pre-req done unfortunately (bummer). Can I still go into the major anyway? 

**Would they still let me in the major? Do I absolutely need to have Physics 2 done before transferring to UCF? Will I be part-time status until I meet the pre-req?Can I be a full time student?**

If you are from Germany, google ""Why did the Pilgrims go to America?"" in German, then in English. You get a completely different answer.

People always tell me to just go to a blue city in a blue state, ***I am in a blue state and live on a college campus and still can't piss in a bathroom without being harassed, still need to fight for my medication where they have literally left me weeks without, take a year, 600 dollars, and a notification in the newspaper to get my name changed and much more.***

I have about one year left of a Bachelor's in Computer Science degree (\~150k dollars, another reason I am not staying). I'm taking German classes, but I'm worried I probably will not be C1 when I graduate. My rough idea is to apply to gradschool in Germany, get a student visa, get my degree and apply for jobs as soon as I can. I know public schools are free as long as I cover the cost of living. I have roughly 10k USD saved, and I'm working towards at minimum 20k, preferably 25k. This summer I'm hoping to do an internship in my field. I'm not too picky on which university I want to attend, but I'd prefer something in Westfalen. I have a valid passport as of now. Unfortunately, I never had a good opportunity to change my legal name or gender, and I'm worried that if I start it now that I wont be able to get an updated passport in time. Oh well."

11khxkx,1,2023-03-06,NYC teacher looking to switch to Software Engineering? 29 Female,harryspetx3,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11khxkx/nyc_teacher_looking_to_switch_to_software/,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a science teacher in NYC, teaching public school and making around 78k per year (49k after tax) with two master's degrees. I'm looking for advice from people who are familiar with software engineering or just making a career switch to a higher paying field. 

I also don't know if it is too late to switch to software engineering now given my age and the fact that I have zero experiences with computer science or coding. I've heard of discrimination against older folks in tech so I'm slightly worried about that in the future. 

To be very honest, my biggest reason for making the career switch is the money factor. I know there will be a lot of NAY-sayers here telling me to go with the passion or what makes me happy over the money. When I was 24-ish, I sort of took the ""easy path"" and became a teacher instead of applying to med school because I thought that studying 12 hours a day in med school would make me unhappy and that I wasn't super passionate about medicine. Now that I have more years of work experiences I realized how bad of a mistake it was. But I'm not gonna go back to the pre-med route because frankly it will take WAY too many years to become an attending. Thought about other paths like nurse anesthetist  but also similar number of years of schooling required.

I don't know if software engineering is my passion but the idea of working for BIG Tech and being at the frontier of tech is appealing to me. I like problem solving but I am also worried about what if I can't solve this problem/cant figure it out- will I get fired if I do it too often? 

I've recently started with the very basic (watching khan academy videos on Javascript and reading a book on Python). It seems like learning the language itself in these two easy languages is okay but software ENGINEERING will def involve more critical thinking right? Started two lectures of Harvard CS 50 but found the second lecture of C to be a bit confusing to me so I went to khan academy to learn some very basic coding first. 

My first masters is in biology, second masters is in education. I've been teaching for 4 years and haven't been in school for a long time. I haven't taken a math course since 2013 so I'm slightly worried about getting a MS in comp science because what if I'm actually super dumb and fail all the exams haha. But I was definitely a math/logic oriented person in HS - did all the way up to multivariable calculus in HS (Forgot everything for sure tho!)but went the pre-med route in college and mostly took biology classes with no math. 

As I mention earlier before, one of the reasons I wanted to switch career is because I want to make more. In the long run, ideally I would like to make 200-300k per year if possible. But if not, then whatever. Right now I'm barely making 80k as a teacher. I'm working everyday at after school and on both Saturdays and Sunday as a tutor as well as the summer. Basically working 7 days a week. And even with that, I don't think I'm barely hitting 100k with all my side jobs/hustles. With my afterschool and tutoring jobs, it always feel to me that I'm just selling my time/youth for the VERY little money that I'm paid. And it doesn't feel good. The tutoring hours are random sometimes- randomly got cut hours by my boss last minute. And I don't think I will even hit 100k this year with all the side things that I do/working 7 days a week.

&amp;#x200B;

While I do enjoy some aspects of teaching (positive relationships with some kids), I also felt like I haven't learned much in the past four years of teaching. I've learned certain things within teaching but it isnt super transferrable to other jobs. And also! Besides the salary freeze, admins are also going a bit crazy! At my school we get evaluated every 2 weeks or so! Just got one today unexpectedly and probably didn't go too well. I'm not miserable as a teacher but for most of the days, I just cant wait until the next vacation! Seem like the days off are the main things that make me happy at the job! I don't get much respects from some students, parents or admins (when they are in a bad mood- somewhat unpredictable sometimes!)

And I was secretly envious of my friends who are doing data science or other cool jobs that seem to keep them learning more about important skills/being at the frontier of cutting edge tech. 

Anyway, thank you for reading my long post. 

I was thinking about doing the NYU Tandon Bridge program maybe starting this summer and if I get a B+ overall then maybe I will apply to the NYU Tandon CS program? There is also a Mayor Graduate Scholarship Program for city employees and it was the reason I consider this program.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thoughts? Should I do it or not do it? One of my friends who is a SWE said it is very competitive to get a first job as a SWE so he wouldn't advise doing it solely for the $. He got a CS masters and worked 2 years at a minimum wage internship program before landing his current six-fig job. Another friend who is also a SWE now (he was a comp science dropout but somehow made it back to CS) he is now working for a startup at NYC. He is making 6 fig now but he said there are weeks of him working 7 days a week and he pulled so many all nighter.I'm cool with working 7 days a week sometimes or pulling all nighter occasionally but would like to limit that because it is not sustainable for my long term physical or mental health. One other teacher friend said to NOT switch because SWE will be replaced my AI in the future and he told me to just go with nursing but.....like I said, in the long run I am aiming for a higher salary (hopefully in the 200-300K or more ) and that seems to be more feasible in tech. I know some nurses make a lot too but that may also takes a lot of schooling/exp? Idk. But tech as a field seems so much cooler to me even tho I dont know too much about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice from people who are working in tech/SWE and those who made the change would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading my post. Sorry if I'm naive about the compensation part or if I am aiming too high when I say I want to make 200k lol ! (just wanted to be honest with my actual long term goal tho). And hey its the internet - who cares if you judge me haha."

11kl6q4,5,2023-03-06,UIUC CS+X vs. UW-Madison ECE+CS,LukeChase2022,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/11kl6q4/uiuc_csx_vs_uwmadison_ececs/,"Hey y’all, 

I am deciding between UW-Madison for ECE + CS and UIUC for CS+X (one of the super niche Xs). I want to know if UIUC is worth the cost. 

Cost/Financials:

UW-Madison (in-state after scholarships): $10,000-20,000/yr
UIUC (out-of-state with no scholarships): $57,000/yr

I am very lucky in that my family is willing and able to pay for UIUC without taking on any loans. However, if I attend UIUC, my parents have asked that any money I earn from internships/part-time jobs go to helping pay for the school. If I attend Madison, however, I will be free to invest that money for the future. 

Part time work earnings:

20hr/wk @ $15/hr x 15-16wks/yr = $9-10k/yr

SWE internship earnings:

40hr/wk @ $30-55/hr x 12wk/yr = $12-24k/yr. 

Assuming that I invest the majority of my earnings in a diversified portfolio, I estimate that I will have approximately $80-120k (depending on whether I choose to graduate early or not) in the bank after leaving UW. This is a significant sum of money that I will be missing if I choose to attend UIUC.

However, UIUC advertises that its CS program graduates earn an average salary of $111k with an average signing bonus of $31k. UW-Madison states that ECE grads earn an average salary of $95k with no reported signing bonus figures. This is also a significant financial advantage of UIUC that should not be mistaken.

The only caveat that I see to my calculations here is that I may be overestimating the number of hours I work during the school year or the amount of money that I can expect to earn in the summer. Please let me know in the comments if I am wrong in any of these measures. 

Opportunities:

UIUC has programs like Research Park and City Scholars that may be able to give me better experience so I can land a better job after graduation. Additionally, I am aware that UIUC is famed for being a school that prop shops and quant traders like Optiver, Citadel, and HRT recruit SWEs from. I understand that getting a job at these firms is very challenging, but I believe that if I go to UW-Madison, my path to these jobs is basically impossible since they recruit largely based on school name. 

UW-Madison allows me to double major in ECE+CS, which gives me more flexibility in careers right after graduation. Especially considering that this major will prepare me well for pursuing a graduate degree in chip design, I think it is a significant advantage that should not be overlooked. 

School:

At both schools, I estimate that it will take me around 3 years to graduate.

Additionally, UW-Madison’s curriculum is more appealing because it is vastly more engineering/CS focused than the CS+X curriculum. I feel like the CS+X requirements are way too lax (someone please correct me if I’m wrong here).

Social Life:

Both are big schools, so I don’t feel like I’d have trouble finding friends in either place. The only preference here is that I hope to go to UIUC so I don’t have to see the same people from high school lol.

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this."
11kldor,3,2023-03-06,"I'm a postdoc in academia, and I want to escape. Does anyone have advice about moving to industry or other non-academic positions?",RiverSnorkeler,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11kldor/im_a_postdoc_in_academia_and_i_want_to_escape/,"Hi, 

I am currently a postdoc at a major research university in the southeast. I earned my PhD at the same university. Officially, my diploma says I have a PhD in Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences, but that does not really encompass my research specialty. My dissertation focused on acoustic signaling in freshwater fish, and how their communication networks are impacted by noise pollution. I measured individual fish hormones in response to acoustic cues as well as their auditory sensitivity. I also worked in our lab's bioacoustics program. I recorded acoustic signals from fish, amphibians, and aquatic insects. I typically market myself as a physiological ecologist.

Prior to coming back as a postdoc, I was a pathways intern for the National Park Service, and later a term employee with US Fish and Wildlife. I knew I wasn't cut out for academia when I was still a grad student, and many of my advisor's students work for federal agencies. I experienced so much discrimination and sexism with USFWS I had to reach out to a regional director (who happened to be my advisor's first doctoral student). Sadly, said director had a similar experience in her first federal position (also in the same region where I was working at the time). Right before I quit, my supervisor doxed my mental health condition during a lab meeting without my consent.  My advisor basically pulled a rescue mission to bring me back to her lab. 

While I am very grateful that my advisor was able to bring me back, the department itself is toxic as hell. I'm no sure if this stipulation varies between institutions, but even though my advisor had funds to cover my salary as a postdoc for the year, she had to bring in a new grant to hire me as an official postdoc. So while we drafted grant proposals, I was hired as a temp employee. I should also mention the admins in our department are constantly being replaced, so it's common to get 3 very different answers for a single question. And because I was a temp employee, I was only allowed to work 20 hours a week. I was pulling 40 hr weeks, buuuuuut I definitely wasn't paid for it. Even with my husband's salary, we had to use a food bank sometimes. At one point, my advisor asked the department head if they could extend my hours in this rare instance. She argued that I have my PhD, and I was the only one in the lab who could perform certain tasks. The department head suggested my advisor fire me and get an UNDERGRAD to finish postdoc-level research. 

We finally got a nice grant from the USDA for ecotoxicology work, but my salary is \~20k below average for my position. Additionally, since my advisor had a serious accident, I've been acting as an advisor to the new master's student, lab manager, and researcher working on 3 separate projects. I briefly thought about teaching a class for the department, then I was informed I would not be paid for the opportunity (but the university would assuredly collect course tuition money). 

TL;DR - I am seriously burning out in academia.

I am still looking for federal positions. One of my closest grad school friends works for USFWS, and he always lets me know when potential job matches are posted. We spoke the other day how there are so few biologist positions available, and most of them are temporary with no relocation assistance. Usually there are massive hiring initiatives a few times a year, that has not been the case in the past year. At this point in my life, I'd like a job with some security and work/life balance (if they still exist). I really want to go home to New England. As a woman, it's a bit safer than the deep south.

I'm interested in either industry or even medical research positions. Zebrafish are a very popular medical model. What worries me most is my degree will put potential employers off. I also have concerns that my skills aren't really in demand anywhere.

If anyone has advice on transitioning from academia to a different field, I would greatly appreciate any insight."

**TL;DR**

I am up for a performance review in less than 2 days and I want to carefully do three things: 1) ask for more money; 2) ask for more time off; and 3) address the overall work conditions to make them more bearable.

**Background:**

I have been working at my current job since November of 2021. I was un unpaid intern working two days a week while I finished up my degree. When I graduated in December of 2021, I was offered a full time position at the company, beginning that following January. I was initially offered $40k (on the low side for the industry, yet comparable to entry-level), but countered with $44k since I wasn't going to be receiving healthcare benefits.

Now that my yearly review is coming up (that I and the business manager had to hound her about scheduling until finally, business manager just put it on the calendar and called it a day), I am asking for $55k, which I know is a steep ask but my reasoning is as follows:  
• I do not get healthcare benefits.  
• My current salary of $44k adjusted for inflation is $50k.  
• +2.5% annual raise  
• I have my hands in all projects because I'm doing the technical things.  
• My boss wants me overseeing the two interns (supervisor role) and deciding what projects to trickle down to them.

I'm also asking for more time off. As it is now, we only get 10 days off a year, 5 vacation days and 5 personal days. To me, this is nowhere near enough, especially since I found out one of my other fulltime coworkers gets 15 days off. Still low, but better than what I get.

**Company info:**

We're a high end firm in our industry and very small⁠—as of this writing, only 8 of us⁠—and owned by my boss. My boss has had our current office location since July of 2021 and started with herself and three other employees. We've since doubled that in a year and could honestly hire more people to tackle the workload. My boss has expressed interest in hiring more people. In my industry, it's standard for firms like mine to take on 5-6 projects a year. We currently have over 60 projects and my boss isn't really showing signs of slowing down. This has put a lot of stress on myself and two of my coworkers, who can handle the full nature of what these projects call for. Our interns handle some of the more menial and time consuming tasks, but tasks that nonetheless need to get done.

My specific role is more on the technical side. I use all of the software that's required for my job. My two full-time coworkers know the software as well, but their focus is more on the creative aspects of what we do as well as most client interaction. I sometimes get smaller projects that are wholly mine, but it seems I've been getting fewer of those and more focused on those technical aspects of the job.

**The plan:**

I'm getting married in the fall, and I definitely don't need to be without a job during that. If I can make it to January 2024, then I can work on getting my certifications and looking for a much better job elsewhere.

But if the conditions continue as they are now, I doubt I'll even make it to the summer. (Details of the working conditions posted below.)

Need advice on how to go about all these things."

Not sure where (or whether) to attend or what my options are. Please help.

Here are my stats, briefly: 35 ACT, 4.67 GPA (top-15 public school in Ohio), 7 AP exams (5s and 2 4s) with 4 more this year. Numerous, if boring, ECs: pres. of Chess Club, mem. of Latin Club, Key Club, Quiz Team; soccer and track. National Merit Finalist.

Results (applying as CS major):

The Good: Ohio State - Accepted, $3,000 Merit Scholarship (rejected for full ride scholarship);   U Tennessee - Accepted, stat-guaranteed merit scholarships (\~$18,000) ;   U Cincinnati - Accepted, $10,000 Merit Scholarships;

The Bad: UNC Chapel Hill - Rejected;   Georgia Tech - Rejected

The Not Good Enough: Virginia Tech -  Accepted, no aid + rejected from honors college;   NC State -  Accepted, no aid (so far) + rejected from honors college;   Wisconsin - Accepted, no aid

I have regrets with my application process, such as which schools I applied to, what I put in my applications, how long I spent on them, etc. Mostly they stem from ignorance and a lack of good advice from those around me. Some people assured me that my stats would carry me into almost any school I applied to and I had a good chance at a full ride somewhere--which was my ultimate goal and dream in this application process. I'm left wondering what I did wrong but more importantly where I should go from here.

My personal opinion is that, without scholarships, college is outrageously expensive. While my parents have enough money saved that I could attend the schools that gave me scholarships with very little (or no) debt, I can't justify spending that money for several reasons. Between impending divorce and health issues, my parents' financial situation is uncertain at the least. I can't conscionably take that money from them. I also simply want to earn it myself without a handout. (BTW, I won't receive any financial aid because numerous circumstances made my parents finances appear much better than they are now).

I have a couple thousand dollars saved myself and know that I won't struggle to find internships, co-ops, and first jobs as a computer programmer, so I can handle the debt. I'm just wondering if any of the schools that accepted me are a smart and realistic option. I can't help but feel like I could've earned a full ride at a good school like I wanted, or at least been admitted somewhere prestigious enough to justify incurring debt.

Are their universities that offer full rides to 2nd year, transfer students? Merit scholarships at all? And what would the best path to this be? Attending one of these schools, putting my nose to the grindstone to work towards additional scholarships from them my sophomore year? Doing the same at a cheaper school, planning on transferring? Taking a gap year, maybe finding work experience? Fuck college altogether because anyone can learn how to code anyway?

TL;DR : I thought I was going to receive better scholarships or get into better schools. What are my options for finding a full ride or larger merit scholarships to a good CS school next school year?

Edit: I didn't list my actual financial awards/offers from these schools, so here they are:

OSU: $33,000 (including scholarship)

UT: $34,500 (incl. scholarships)

UC: $29,000 (incl. scholarships)

And just for fun:  VA Tech: $60,000;  UW: $58,000;  NC State: Not in yet but real talk--I'm not getting shit."

I'm currently in the process of learning Python Frameworks and SQL.

From what I've seen in this subreddit and Job listings is that DE jobs are more suited to people who switch from Data Science/ Data Analysis and the crowd is mostly based on that niche. Now, from what I've heard switching from core Data Science has the advantage of having learned Machine Learning and hardcore Data Science. Moreover, a lot of job listings that I've seen actually specify that the Data Engineer has to implement Data Science and Machine Learning. I guess this is required so that DEs have better communication with Data Scientists, who are the end user.

Now, the major problem I have, related to this, is that the Data Engineering Roadmaps and Bootcamps don't ask you to learn Data Science or Machine Learning. Also, my college degree doesn't let me access the Linear Algebra course(they replaced it with ODE/PDE), also I don't quite like Math. The Thing is that learning DE tools(Like Spark and Hadoop) alongside Data Science(which is more mathematical in nature) would be quite hectic for me as I aspire to crack a Remote Paid Internship within an Year. For now, this is my primary goal. I am willing to learn another stack if need be.

I go to a school that’s a target for finance, but semi ish for computer science(in top 10 overall by usnews).
I’m pretty interested by the idea of both working as a developer and working in banking, and after my freshman year I started my own start up, doing kinda everything (programming, pitching, connecting with VCs, etc). 
So my current plan is, get a tech internship for soph summer, recruit for banking for junior summer, figure out what I like better, and if I end up liking banking better, go with the return offer, and if not recruit for tech full time. FYI I’m planning to double major in CS and Econ. 
I’m not sure if this is a feasible plan, and if I should just focus on one track. It seems pretty doable to me considering the extra time I have from service and the difference of the recruiting timeline of tech and banking, but lmk how u guys think!"

I’m going into my internship for my grad program in August and I have two options that I can’t really decide between. Both “expect” me to stay on as an associate after I graduate, which I’d like to honor if possible.

Option number one is a non-profit agency that has school-based, residential, as well as your run of the mill outpatient therapy opportunities. I’d get a pretty nice stipend as an intern on a semester basis, lots of hours, and the job afterwards would be salaried with benefits.

Option number two is a small group practice that works with a few non-profits. It sounds like I’d get paid a little during internship, but the pay after I graduate makes me nervous. I’d get paid based on a scale of how many clients I see a week with 10 being the minimum and 25 being the goal which pays $35/client. It sounds like I’d still be able to supplement hours at some of the non-profit setting as one of their employees to make some extra cash.

I’ve heard CMH can be a soul-crusher but I’m also not sure I want to deal with building a caseload on my own quite yet. Plus the security of a salary seems worth it as I have a growing family. 

Any advice?"

Or the tech stack could be so particular to this department and company that it won't have any value to other companies.  The other thing that worries me is that in order to really make contribution, you will need a good deal of domain knowledge that I don't have, so I won't be able to do much of value and make any positive impression on anyone there.

Just curious if anyone has experienced any issues like that and how soon did you realize that accepting the job was a mistake?  Anyone leave before the official end of the position to take another intern position?

I recently submitted a paper which got rejected, and is, to be frank, not really worth resubmitting anywhere. 

Yesterday I mentioned to my advisor that I was feeling like moving forward with my PhD wasn’t a good idea. Basically, he decided a couple of months ago that anyone who doesn’t have at least one publication a year must TA the following year. At the core, we really just don’t have any interests in common, and this has made getting on a fruitful research trajectory difficult. I also have felt in general like my advisor generally has had a lot of apathy toward my PhD and hasn’t provided much guidance in helping me learn to do good research. This, along with things that I could’ve done better as well. 

I don’t see a pathway to publishing before I leave for my internship in 2.5 months, and we both agreed that spending time TAing without having clear goals set for my research will just end with me wasting more time. 

I am going to look for another lab to join, because I still really want to finish, but I feel like the odds of getting into a new lab, given that I have been pretty unsuccessful in this one, are slim. As I said, I still would ideally finish my degree because I love my field, but I have concluded that staying in this lab is not a good way forward in general. 

Other than that, it is looking like there’s a high chance I will need to find a job. I have a MS in computer science, and I had a fairly successful internship last summer (they offered for me to return this summer, which I’m doing, but they don’t have any open full time roles due to the economic downturn). 

My obvious dilemma is that I have a huge hole in my resume, and not much to show for my time as a PhD student, since everything I’ve done with my advisor has been kind of unsuccessful in one way or another. I also feel like I’m pretty knowledgeable about my field (multi-agent reinforcement learning), but that I don’t have a lot of concrete achievements to back it up yet. Additionally, I feel like this is a niche field that doesn’t offer much in industry besides pure research jobs. On top of all this, I feel like I’ve forgotten a lot of the generalist knowledge I had from my MS. In summary, I feel like I’m very specialized in a particular field but don’t have the credentials of an expert. 

I’m really just looking for advice on the steps I should take to start looking for a job. My target would be at least by September, since I have my internship coming up and enough savings to last until then."

So I have a flat file of 3 columns, employee, employee\_title and that employee's superior.

I need to create a hierarchy table for some analysis, but I'm a bit stumped on making a recursive function to read all the superiors of a given employee.

Example:

|Employee|Employee\_Title|Superior|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A|Intern|B|
|B|Analyst|C|
|C|Supervisor|None|

The desired table is as follows:

|Employee|Intern|Analyst|Supervisor|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A|A|B|C|
|B|None|B|C|
|C|None|None|C|

The issue is reading employee A (intern), seeing its superior is employee B (analyst) and then getting the superior of employee B (supervisor), and so on.

It is not a simple re-structuring of the table, I actually have to do some recursive step and put all values on the appropriate column for each employee (returning None when it doesn't exist).

The actual table has a lot more people and titles. I've only managed to get the correct table structure so far (employee column and the columns with the titles), but no actual data.

Any ideas how I can do this?

How did that go and would you recommend?

So, backstory. I am a mechanical engineering graduate with a bachelors. A company I’m working from right out of school threw me into a development program for young engineers. It gave me a lot of exposure and up close experience with the machines. 6 months later I’m on a projects team. Due to the economy forecasts, I have it on good authority that I will not be offered a position with the team that I have been working with and learning from. I am, however, being considered for a role in Procurement due to my background from one of my internships. I have already started looking casually for other jobs, but not applying. My hesitation is due to my limited experience (&lt;1 year) outside of school.

My options are:
1. Sit here and do nothing and hope that I still get an offer on the team I want 
2. Start interviewing and engaging with the Finance offer 
3. Start applying for other jobs with other companies

So what would you do in my shoes? Does anyone have any experience going to finance for a stint and then coming back to engineering? Or should I start slinging resumes left and right?"

I've been applying to both full-time jobs in data science/analytics and internships for 4-5 months and have received one final round interview so far for an internship. Lots of rejections. I know the market sucks in general right now, but I can't help think there's something I'm doing wrong or something I could improve on to help my chances. I've been a high achiever my entire life, but I just feel pretty down about choosing a math degree when what I want to do for a career is data science. People say math is a great choice, and I know I would make a wonderful employee, there is **great** value in having a math education, but I don't think tech recruiters are seeing that? I would love to hear some insight from folks who transitioned into data science from a non-CS degree (math in particular, or otherwise). Any tips, connections, or general empathy is super appreciated.

Academic Background: I have a BS in Pure Math from a small private liberal arts university, finishing up my MS in Mathematics this may from a mid-tier public state school. Graduated with a 4.0 from undergrad with Honors and I won my department's award for high achievement in mathematics. I currently have a 3.8 in grad school, and have been a graduate assistant for the past two years. The past year I have been instructor-of-record for a business calculus class. Courses from grad school include: 4 semesters of real analysis, Applied Probability, Dynamical Systems, Ordinary Differential Equations, Data Structures and Algorithms (CS course), Numerical Linear Algebra, and Numerical Linear Algebra II for Data Science. In the latter course we essentially learned the math behind a bunch of machine learning algorithms, as well as how to implement them from scratch in Python and using Scikit learn.

Skills: Python (3 years), SQL (pretty much beginner level), Java, C++, MATLAB, packages in Python: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib.

Other background: I'm a female, on the East Coast of the US, I was a collegiate athlete (swimming) and team captain, sorority member and served on the exec board, president of the math club in undergrad, and am currently secretary for the Math graduate student association at my university. I have no related work experience or internships (I've applied every summer for the past 2 years, no luck, I received one interview total)

I have 2 data science projects listed on my resume. One is an image recognition program using CNN, and one is a clustering project. I also feel confident in my ability to do well in a technical interview, but I have not been given the chance yet.

I will say, I don't as of right now have a github profile, and am not posting my work online. I understand why this would be quite important, but a math degree and teaching is time consuming and I haven't had the free time to put out work that I am proud of.

This leads me to a second question: I don't know exactly what the standard is for posting my work, how do I know if a certain project is good, has enough work done on it, isn't redundant from what others have done, etc? I guess I would say I know how to implement a bunch of machine learning algorithms including neural networks, and I know why they work and when to use which one, but in terms of putting together a nice example project, I'm unconfident.  What advice/resources/guidance can you give me on this specifically, and do you think this is the main reason I'm not getting interviews?

That felt a little all over the place, but hearing back from anyone with some encouragement and help would be appreciated. Thank you!"

I interviewed for two internships so far, one was a month ago and the other was two weeks ago and I haven't heard back from either one. I’m not sure what to do and it’s getting late. We're in march, and the internships start in may. 

I’m proficient in python, C/C++, java and I have pretty good experience in Linux. I worked as a customer success manager at a tech startup for a few months before I start my degree, so I have some experience in the industry. I’m not sure why I’m not hearing back from any internships. 

Please I’m so so stressed out so any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!

Btw this is my resume:

why is my brain so fucked up and ruins everything for me. i could just have a normal life with normal relationships and friendships and i could have motivation to do my homework well and on time and make friends at my new job and not freak out this guy at school and be emotionally stable, but instead i’ve been given the opposite.

i hate it when people say that it’s ultimately UP TO ME or it’s MY DECISION to change things. i’ve been going to therapy and taking medication since i was 14! i’m 22! my issues have just evolved. i get better in one area but then i find out another area fucking sucks. i’m on such a downward spiral. this past september through december have been the best months i’ve ever had. i wasn’t necessarily doing well at school or anything. but i was happy. i went to work, went to school, went home and slept. i felt okay for once in my life. but now it’s back to my shitstorm of a life. i wish i could catch a break. i wish i could so bad. feelings suck, anxiety sucks, depression sucks, it ruins everything for me.

now recently i finally had a neuro psych exam to find out what’s really wrong with me, and immediately the lady was so shocked at how little progress i’ve made due to my shitty treatment. my fucking 5 therapists in the past all have been interns and idk why they allowed that to happen. i always thought therapy was just meh and it wasn’t helpful and it was just something i had to go to. but now i’m realizing that maybe it’s not supposed to be like that.

it’s frustrating that no matter what i do no matter what shit i type on reddit no matter how i try to reframe my thoughts, i will always be like this. 

a part of me is sad that no one knows this about me. not even my family. i took a break from medicine and therapy for a year back when i graduated highschool and my parents were happy that i was better and stuff. they don’t know that now im on like 10x more meds and going to therapy and did a neuro psych exam and that i’ve wanted to kill myself before and that i hit myself when im incredibly frustrated and upset and that i’ve resorted to drinking lately whenever i am so unbearably sad. i wish i could actually kill myself so that people know that my actions are not intentional and i am not intentionally obsessive or impulsive or crazy. i don’t want to be like this. i don’t want to ruin all of my relationships and projects and jobs. it sucks"

I did get one response from a place that doesn't pay and is local, but I really don't want to work full time during my summer from college and not make any money, I might take it as a last resort, just for the work experience, but I'd really rather not. Any tips for getting an internship? I'm mainly looking for a web dev internship. I only know c++, html, CSS, and a little bit of javascript, but i dont know if thats enough for an internship"
11lecqv,3,2023-03-07,A bit about my experience,wifiwonderlex,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/11lecqv/a_bit_about_my_experience/,"I’ve been scrolling through this sub and I just thought I’d share my experience as a restaurant all rounder (bartender/ barista/ waitress/ unappreciated cog in the system)

I worked this job over Covid and during my first university internship. My degree requires 1000 hours of field work (unpaid) split between the last 2 years of the degree. I needed the income for my internship. I was a school mental health worker which was rewarding but mentally and economically exhausting. So many of my peers in the degree were fired from their jobs because they couldn’t accomodate for the internship. I was incredibly privileged as this job accommodated for this and gave me weekend shifts to get by, but the conditions and the way they treated staff was quite horrific. During that time I had to sacrifice my own mental health so that I could get by financially. I managed to get government financial assistance (Centrelink), but they were giving me $5 (AUD) a week at the time (no I’m not joking)

A few things that happened during this time:

- the diner suddenly changed from being part of a restaurant chain to being their own private manager owned restaurant. I was not told about this and only found out by seeing a “you may know this person” pop up on instagram with a restaurant who had listed their address in their bio which was the exact same as the chain restaurant I worked at.  When I inquired I got a vague answer about it having to do with the price of their meats or something, turns out it was a lie and that the conflict was as the CEO of the chain restaurant was my managers ex and I guess they couldn’t be civil? Idk.

- I got paid in cash, I requested to be on the books and receive pay direct to my card as I was on Centrelink and I needed the pay slips and required information so I could declare my income. They told me I could but then changed their minds.  As I was not ‘on the books’ , management were incredibly stingy with pay. At one point they cut pay by $3 and didn’t tell anyone. I only found out when calculating a pay after an 8 hour public holiday shift and realising something didn’t add up. We also didn’t receive pay differences for working during public holidays or weekends. We had a flat rate which was below the legal limit for people in my age range.

- I got no support from Centrelink, they refused to support my claim for income and the diner were underpaying me for long weekend hours. I am a lived experience social work student with anxiety and depression. This lived experience is highly valuable to my profession, but also means I am more susceptible to vicarious trauma and burnout, this plus being an unpaid intern and getting treated horrifically by both Centrelink and my job was too much, my mental health reached a point it hadn’t in years and I had to quit to basically keep myself off the edge. 

(I know not a lot of people don’t have the option to quit a job to preserve their mental well-being. I am incredibly privileged to have been able to do that as I was being supported by parents to get through the rest of my internship)

- they had me work a night shift alone with no one else but the apprentice chef when they knew they had a massive table coming in. 

- When I quit, they begged me to work 1 more shift. I did it (I know I know, I should not have done that).

After I quit about a month later the restaurant shut down due to “lack of staffing” (not surprised), apparently around when I quit about 3-4 other staff members also quit. There were not many of us at all so that was enough to tip the scale.

I’m in a better place now. Still in my degree but I have a different job and feel incredibly supported by my team. Just thought I’d share a bit about my experience as it’s therapeutic for me and also might help others scrolling this sub notice similar red flags and behaviours in their work places. Thanks for reading.

Edit because I forgot to include something:
- we had a tip jar, never got the tips."

Travis looked out the window at the green hills rolling past the car window.   He smiled at the stone wall stretching out along the road.   A few minutes in silence later, and the driver pulled into a carpark and turned back to look at him.  ""Girley Bog.""

Travis nodded at him while looking down at his smartphone.  ""Five stars, plus a tip.""

The driver, Curtis, nodded.   ""I guess you'll be needing me?  I'm the only bloke around.""

Travis smiled with a sigh.  ""Yup.  You did good, kept the chat to a minimum.  Thank you""  He said, as he started to exit the door.

Curtis got out and popped open the trunk.  ""Your bags sir.""

""Thanks again.   See you probably this evening.""

Curtis smiled as he shut the trunk and went back to the driver's door.   He waved out the window as he drove off.

Travis stood with his suitcase and full backsack as he started looking around.

A woman stepped out from a path amongst the trees.  ""Professor Hawkins?""  She said, smiling.

He smiled back.  ""Dr. Adams?""

She nodded slightly, approaching with her hand outstretched.  ""It's good you made it out.""   She said, shaking his hand.

He took a breath as he looked around.  ""Beautiful country.  The greens remind me back home.""

She laughed.   ""I didn't know you were American.  Teaching here in Dublin?""

""Yeah.  I've always liked traveling, figured it was time to start seeing the prettier parts of the world.""

She motioned him back toward the path.  ""Camp is set up over the next rise.  You ok in a tent?""

He chuckled as he pulled the suitcase behind him.   ""I've been ok sleeping in holes.   A tent is a luxury.""

""Good.  I have a couple student interns with me, but for the most part It's all me out here.""

He looked around at the deep mud off either side of the path.  ""I read some of your report.   Excavating a Celtic mound right?""

She looked back at him.  ""Some?""

""Busy guy.   You needed an Metallurgist, college sent me.   Here I am.""

""Well, yeah.   Pretty much.""  She smiled at him as she started speaking with her hands more.  ""Well, we're thinking its a sacrificial site.  Maybe some sort of spiritual center.""   She looked back ahead as they walked.  ""The bodies are super preserved, charred, but preserved.   Some sort of burnt offering, maybe enemies they sacrificed.   We're still working on pulling them out, but that's not why you're here.""  She turned back with a smile.

""Yeah, why am I here?   Find a cool sword or something?""  He laughed.  ""I'm a fan of Vikings.""

She shook her head.  ""No.  Vikings come much later.   This is old here.   Honestly, I have no clue what were dealing with.   That's why you're here.""   She pointed as they turned the corner.  ""Go ahead and get set up in that blue tent there.   ""Rodney!""

A young man with a thin mustache stepped up from a hole.   ""Yes Fiona?""

She waved him over.  ""Come meet Professor Hawkins.  Help him get set up and then bring him over to the cover stones.""

He smiled and stepped through the mud to help Travis.

\---===\*===---

Rodney stood outside the tent watching while Professor Hawkins unpacked.    After he was done, Travis stepped out, laughing.  ""Thanks for the help bud.""

Rodney tapped his muddy left boot on his right.  ""I'll help where I can, but I didn't wanna mess your temp home.""

Travis shrugged.  ""No worries.""  He said, patting the young man on the shoulder.  ""Take me over to the cover stones she was talking about.""

Rodney smiled and started walking.  ""Mind the wet areas.  They'll drag you down.""

Travis followed him closely, still his boot found a deep spot and sunk near to the top.

The intern laughed quietly and then pointed at the hole he was in earlier.  ""Got a pump in that one under the muck.   Took me a week to set up the those walls to keep the water from just flowing in.""

Professor Hawkins peered over, noticing the rocky foundations at the bottom.  ""That where you pulled the metal items from?""

""No.  No.""  Rodney said, laughing.  ""Those are still in the ground.  We're not moving em without you.""   He looked back at the hole they were passing.  ""That hole was where we found two of the burned men.""

Travis nodded slowly.  ""The burned men, right.""

Rodney waved him on.  ""Come on, this way through the grove.   I bet she'll be down on it.""  He looked back at him.  ""She's super excited you're here.   Been waiting all week ya knows.""

""Good I'm wanted somewhere.""  Travis said laughing.

Rodney slogged on through the muddy path, his feet sucking in the mud.   ""So, you're a blacksmith or something?""

Travis shook his head.  ""No, well, Yes, used to be.  I got started smithing but I got intrigued and continued learning the science behind it.   Couple papers and here I am.""

""You just started smithing?  Like a hobby or something?""

Travis pulled his boot up, highstepping over a deep black wet spot.  ""Yeah.""  He crossed over, taking Rodney's hand to stabilize himself.  ""GI bill.   Never stop learning."" He looked up at the young man.  ""After I retired from the Army I kept busy.   Got a farm going, goats, horses, rows of squash and corn.   Growing up I had horses, and shoeing was always fascinating to me.   I took some classes, learned the basics, then took more.   I went from horseshoes to gold smithing, to full on metal engineering class.   After that I studied at a local foundry back home in the states, and then I came here.""

""Dublin right?""

Travis nodded.  ""Yeah.  I got me a flat there with the wife.""

Rodney smiled at him.  ""Kids going to be Irish?""

He shook his head.  ""Too old for that.  They're all grown.""  He sighed a bit.  ""I got a couple grand babies back in North Carolina I need to go visit, probably next month.""

""Congrats sir.   Bet they're cute.""

""Buttons.""  Travis replied.  ""So, Fiona laughed a bit when I mentioned a sword.""

Rodney nodded.  ""You'll have to see it.""  He pointed as they entered a clearing of purple flowers.

Fiona Adams raised her hand up from a large wide hole.   Three pumps near the far edge echoed across the bog as they pumped water out of the site.

Travis approached the edge and looked down at the excavation.   The mud was stained with the multicolored corrosion of the metals.   He hopped down quickly, sliding without care of the filth rubbing onto his pants and shirt.   He walked over beside her, staring down at the exposed aggregate.  ""What am I looking at?""

She looked down at it and then back up at him, laughing again.  ""A shrine?  I don't know actually, just speculation.""   She looked back down and poked a chunk of corroded hardpack with her trowel.  ""We've been scared to pull it out without you.   I want to minimize damage to the pieces.""

Travis knelt down, touching the green and red chunk poking out.  He then looked at the serpentine shape outlined in the mud.   ""How many pieces are there?""

She scratched her forehead, leaving a mud streak.  ""Not sure til we get them out, but.""   She pointed out.  ""We have seven large sections.   I'm thinking maybe they made a metal boat or something?""

He stood up, shaking his head.  ""This is a lot.  I didn't bring enough solvents for this.""   He pinched his chin, thinking.  ""We can pull one of the smaller ones up carefully, clean at least one.   Maybe we can get a feel for what we're working with.""

She stood up beside him.  ""How you think they got this much iron?""

He looked at her, doing a double take.  ""What?  No, this isn't iron.   Look at all the colors.   Iron rusts red.""  He pointed out across the site.  ""No, there's copper there.  Hell, that white there might be traces of magnesium or rhodium.""  He laughed.  ""You might have a plane crash here.""

She shook her head.  ""No.  No, this isn't a plane.   This is an early Celtic site.""

He looked back at her, staring.

She pointed at the far wall where three large stones were propped up.  ""Those stones laid over this entire thing.   They're rune carved, and we dated the corpses on top of them.   They're near three thousand years old.""

He blinked slowly.  ""Three thousand?""  He shook his head.  ""Maybe someone moved them on top.""  He waved his hand over toward a smaller of the discolored clumps.  ""I bet a plane, but you never know.  I say we start there.""

She glared back at him.  ""Alright.  Let's start there.""

\---===\*===----

Beth had returned with sandwiches from Bray's bar in town by the time Travis and Fiona had the first hung of colored mud gently hewn from the surrounding clay and muck.   The quartet paused the work and joined her on the upper embankment overlooking the dig.

Beth handed out the brown paper wrapped meals and poured ale from the carrier box into their cups.

Travis tipped his head and raised the glass.  ""Thank you.""

Beth smiled at him.  ""You're welcome.""

Fiona scooted up beside Travis, unwrapping her sandwich.  ""So, still think its a plane?""

Travis took a bite and chewed for a moment before replying, shading his eyes from the sun.  ""So far its just rainbow colored mud and some spear points.   No telling, but given the probable metals in it, its something this century.  Maybe a bus?""

Beth laughed and choked.   ""A bus?  Someone buried a bus, here in Girley?""

Rodney sighed. ""Probably still full of bodies if so.   Might have to call in the police.""

Travis shrugged.  ""We'll find out shortly.   We get that bit there out.""  He pointed at the mud on the screen.  ""Get that there up and washed and we'll have a better idea of what we're digging up.""  He looked over at Fiona.  ""Those cover plates.  You know what the runes say?""

She laughed.  ""Spiral spiral dot dot dot.   Triskeles mostly.   Not a real writing system, just symbols.""

""Oh.""  He said before taking another bite, and then squeezing in some chips.

She paused a moment.  ""There was one pictograph I liked there on the center block.   It's unique to here, never seen anything like it.""

Rodney nodded, chewing.  ""Yeah.  I know that one.  The big bird.""

Fiona took a sip of beer and looked at Travis.  ""There's a carving there, a big bird surrounded by tiny men.""

""The men are on fire.""  Beth said, staring down into the pit.

Fiona looked at her.  ""Still up for interpretation.""

Travis laughed.  ""People on fire up for interpretation?   Figure it would be easy to figure that out.""

""They could be on fire.  They could be holy men.  They could have campfires around.   We have no context.""  Fiona continued.

Rodney pointed out where Beth was looking.  ""We've pulled burned bodies out of here.  We have context.""

Travis took another bite and the group sat quiet thinking for a moment.  ""Sacrifices to a bird deity then?   They have big eagles in Ireland back then?""

Fiona shook her head.  ""Not that I know of.""

\---===\*===---

After lunch the quartet went back down into the pit and pulled up the clump of multi-colored mud.    As a team they carried the wood frame holding it over to Professor Hawkins' tent.    They hefted up onto his plastic table and then maneuvered it up and over into the wash basin.

Fiona sighed and wiped the sweat from her forehead.  ""You really gonna wash that in here?""

Travis paused and nodded at her.  ""Yeah.  Why?""

She pointed over at the bed a few feet away.  ""Chemicals in and around in your sleeping bunk?""

He laughed.  ""They're not harsh.  Just enough to get the debris off.""  He looked around at the team.  ""Don't get any shit on my bed okay?""  He pointed with a smile.  ""I sleep there.""

They all nodded as he sat down at the basin.    He turned on the battery powered pump and the fluid began trickling over the clump.   Clay and mud washed free as he gently began brushing.

Little by little spots of gleaming material appeared from under the bright earthen mud.

Rodney gave an audible.  ""Oooo.""

Travis continued until something recognizable took shape and all four paused.

Fiona leaned in pointing.  ""That's a gauntlet.  What the fuck is a gauntlet doing here.""

Travis pushed more mud free.  ""This is an alloy.   Shiny.  Chromium alloy, Inconel if I didn't know any better.  Someone is fucking with you guys.""

Rodney leaned in.  ""The fingers are weird.  What is that six fingers?   The dude have that poly hand whatever?""

Travis leaned back, shaking his head.  ""This is a joke.   Archeology my ass.   You guys fucking with me?""  He looked up at Fiona and stood up.  ""The university is paying good money for me to be here and you're wasting everyone's time.""

Fiona shook her head, raising her hands.  ""No.  Not at all.  This was here, we dug it up.  You helped us, you saw!""

Rodney raised his hands up.  ""I don't know either man.""

Travis paused and looked back at the mud, sighing.  ""It would have been hard to fake that leeching into the mud like that though.  The crystallization and draw would have taken decades if not centuries.""   He shook his head.  ""Whatever.  No.  I don't know how you did it, but that is not from the time frame you're talking about.""

Fiona took a deep breath and stared at him.  ""I don't know what that is or when it is from, but I swear we didn't put it there.   It's a mystery, fake or not.   Your time, your knowledge is still needed here to figure this out.""

He shook his head.  ""No, old swords, jewelry maybe.  I got gear to identify anything like that.   This, proper ID and manufacturing location I can do from my labs back home.""

Rodney looked around.  ""So, so what?  We clean it up and send it back with you?""

Travis walked toward the entrance of the tent and looked out over the dig areas.  ""Beth, head into town and get me a big bucket of CLR.  We can dig up the rest of it and wash it clean.   Then we'll rent a uhaul or whatever you have here and get it back to my flat.  I can have it all identified by the end of the month.""

Fiona stepped up beside him.  ""Then we'll quit eating up your time.""

Travis nodded.  ""Then I can see my grandbabies.   Yeah.""

Beth walked past them.  ""I'll have to go to Kells, It'll take me a couple hours.""

Fiona raised her hand.  ""Rodney go with her.  Professor Hawkins and I will begin digging up the other pieces.""

""Yes Ma'am.""  The intern said before walking out to catch up with Beth.

\---===\*===---

They spent the next couple days removing the other clumps of corroded mud, setting them aside on their own cupped pallets.     One by one they lifted them free of the pit and used a newly purchased cart to get them lined up at Travis' tent.

The fourth night of his stay he started the washing.   Beth sat beside him, carefully removing and sorting the debris removed.    Fiona and Rodney stood back, ready to carry pieces in.

He started washing the piece from the far edge of the pit.   Mud washed off into the basin easily, revealing a long silver metal piece.  Travis disregarded it and handed it off to Rodney.   Quickly the team had another clump for the wash.

He sighed and continued, adjusting his safety goggles several times so he could wipe the sweat from his forehead.   The next piece was larger, from the far opposite end.    As he washed its form began emerging.    Spines rose out from the mud, glimmering in silvers and golds.  Multi colored oily hews glistened across the surface.

Travis paused, and then continued cleaning, care reentering his work.

Fiona stepped closer as an eye socket appeared, then row after row of teeth lining the bottom of the now apparent skull.   ""What the fuck is that.""

Rodney leaned over and Beth stood up beside him.  ""Um, that's that's weird right.""

Travis stared at the skull of alloyed precious metals.  He then looked up at Fiona.  ""This, this I don't know how.""  He stammered, standing. He looked back down at the skull with his hand at his chin.  ""The gold and platinum in this is worth I dunno, a million dollars at least?   No one in their right mind would waste this and bury it out here.   What the hell kind of prank is this.""

Rodney laughed, pointing.  ""Banksy!  Banksy is fucking with us!""

Beth laughed.

Fiona took a deep breath.  ""I don't know, but we carry on.   This is still an archeological dig and we will treat it as such.  If this is a hoax, then our science will sleuth it out.""

Travis looked over at her.  ""And if it's not?""

She smiled.  ""Then our science will sleuth it out.""

He nodded at her slowly.  ""Rodney we need this guarded.   No one is to know about it.   Get a truck from in town and you're going to take this to my wife at my flat.  I have a precious metals vault there.""  He looked at Beth.  ""You're going to escort with him.""   He pulled his phone from his pocket and pulled up his wife's tab.  The phone tried to ring and then abruptly died.   ""Damn it.  I guess I need to charge it.""

Fiona pointed over at his solar charger near the edge of the tent.  ""Charge it up while they go and get the truck.    Your solar battery should have juice in it.   We'll organize the drive with your wife once you get a bit of juice in it.""

He nodded and then waved the younger interns off.   He stared at Fiona.  ""Fake or not, this is a treasure.""

She looked at the skull as it gleamed from under the LED's.   ""History books are going to have a chapter about this.""  She smiled.  ""This is big, Banksy or not.""

\---===\*===---

Beth and Rodney had returned and were packing up the alloyed skull of precious metals when Travis had finished rigging the pump to a large plastic basin to wash the largest clump.   The two interns finished wrapping and securing the skull and then came out of the truck to help Fiona and Travis lift the meter and a half long mass of mud and clay into the tub.

They set it down and Travis began putting on his gloves and and goggles.    Rodney got brushes and trowels for everyone and they then began to lean over and remove the detritus.

The clay easily dissolved in the oily brine mix and Beth was the first to find something of interest.   She pulled up a small glimmering spheroid.   ""What is it?""  She asked Travis.

He looked and shrugged, pointing over at the collection tray.  ""We'll figure it out later.""   He then continued pulling off clumps of rainbow hued crystalline muck.

With each pull the quartet discovered more and more of the shiny metal carapace underneath.   It was hollow on the inside with holes matching where the alloy arms would have been connected.   Professor Hawkins paused and leaned onto his heels.  ""So is it like a suit of armor or something?""

Fiona aimed the hose into the internals and began washing out the mud.  ""I'm thinking some sort of idol.   Gold and silver wouldn't have been good armor, worth too much, to brittle right?""

Travis shook his head and hit the outer hull of the thing.  It rang out.  ""I bet I could hit this thing with my truck and it wouldn't dent it.""

Fiona sighed, focused still on washing out the internals.  ""Still a mystery.  I like it.""   She smiled, unnoticing the tiny black flakes washing out into the basin by Beth.

The flakes spun around in the brine, circling each other, clumping together.    Beth noticed them just as they snapped tight into a ball.   The pump immediately stopped.  ""What the fuck.""

They all stared at it, spinning in the fluid.   Travis leaned closer, reaching out, just as it ignited.

Everyone jumped slightly back.

Fiona leaned forward again, staring.  ""What?  That's on fire.  That's on fire!""

Rodney was already up and running toward their storage container.  ""I'll get it!  I'll get it!""  He said as he ducked inside, looking for the extinguisher.

Travis stared at it.  The fluid was starting to create a current leading into it.   He raised his hand up slightly toward it.  ""It's cold.  How's that cold.""

Fiona looked back and forth from the sphere to Travis.  ""Those chemicals are flammable.""

Travis nodded and quickly grabbed the sphere and pulled it out of the soupy brine.   He rolled it across the ground where it stopped in a puddle.    It quickly doused just as Rodney ran up and sprayed it down with the extinguisher.

The quartet stood the black ball in the puddle.  Beth broke the silence.  ""Think we should get the Geiger counter out?""

Fiona motioned at Rodney.   He sighed and handed her the extinguisher before going back to the container.

He returned and knelt down next to the sphere with the apparatus in hand.   He chirped periodically.   He then looked up at everyone.  ""Less than a banana.""

Beth looked over at Professor Hawkins.  ""How?""

Travis shrugged.

\---===\*===---

By evening they had set up a test site down in the hole.   Fiona used a set of thick leather welding gloves and carried the sphere down to the drained hole.    Rodney had dammed up a large puddle of water, ready to open a makeshift sluice to fluid it should anything happen.

Travis watched as Fiona sat it down on a plate in the center of the hole.   The dampness on its surface quickly dried, evaporating and then a blue flame appeared near the top of it.

Fiona looked at him.  ""What is it you think?""

Beth held up the Geiger counter.  ""Still minimal.""

Travis took a can of oil and slowly poured a dribble onto the sphere and pulled it back.   The black clump of flakes swelled and the flame grew from blue to a bright red.   He looked up at Fiona.  ""No idea, but I could see why they made the idol for it.""

Beth knelt down looking at it.  ""It's like an eternal flame right?""

Rodney laughed.  ""Wow.  Imagine never having to light a campfire.  You could just come with a stick and touch that thing.""

Travis laughed, setting the oil down.  He ran over to the carved clay stairs and went up toward the wood.   He returned with a branch and began pulling the leaves off.   He then reached over, touching the sphere.   The branch ignited.   He smiled at Fiona and pulled it away.   The flame on the end died out, and Travis' face changed to quizzical.

Rodney pointed back at the sphere.

Travis poked it again, igniting the stick, then withdrew it.    The bright flame died back down.  ""The flame stays localized.  That's weird.   It pulls it back in or something.""

Fiona motioned.  ""Poke it more.""

Travis complied and poked it fully onto the sphere.   The branch glowed red then white, consumed as Travis pushed it further into it.    The flame grew.

Beth pointed at the sphere.  ""What's that white bit there.""

Travis looked at a spot growing on the sphere.  ""Looks like mercury or something.""

Fiona got up and left the pit.   She returned a few minutes later with a bundle of sticks.

They each took one and began poking the black flaked orb.

\---===\*===---

Beth had sat the Geiger counter down to go get sandwiches from the ice chest.   The group had sat around the yellow and red flame, poking it, feeding it sticks as night fell.    Rodney had gotten up and returned with several logs.   When Beth had gotten back with the sandwiches, the flame had engulfed the logs and was now starting to emit a fair amount of heat.    They began eating and drinking, laughing and talking with wide smiles.

Fiona watched the stars high above, the flames casting light on the walls of the pit.   ""This thing, whatever it is.  They gave sacrifices to it, here.""

Beth was yawning.  ""I can see that.   They built a town around it.""

Rodney pointed.  ""A society of fire worshippers.""

Travis held his knees as he sat, staring at it deep in the coals.  The mercurial metal had swelled around its base.  ""I still don't know.""

Fiona laughed.  ""Don't know?   This thing is the heart of this whole complex here.""  She pointed at it.  ""It's clear they worshipped that stone.""

He shook his head.  ""Science will sleuth it out.""  He said staring at her.

Rodney looked back and forth at them.  ""Um.  It's getting late.  We going to put it out, go to bed?""

""I like it.""  Beth said.

Fiona looked over at her.  ""We could sleep here I guess.  You guys ok with that?""

Rodney looked up at the open sky.  ""Weather's good next few days.   I could go get our bedrolls if you guys want.""

Travis nodded.

Rodney got up and went to go get the bedding.

\---===\*===---

Travis let the logs die down as he laid in his bedroll on middle ledge of the hole.   The cold clay helped cool his back as he got comfortable in the sleeping bag.   He watched the coals around the black sphere as his eyes got heavier.   He eventually drifted to sleep.   The last thing he consciously felt was the warmth on his face.

He woke up hot, someone was screaming.   He opened his eyes and struggled against the bedding.

There was fire, everywhere.   He looked around as waves of rolling flame filled the pit.    He looked around and saw Beth ducking from a flame reaching toward her.  Fiona was next to her with the extinguisher, shooting puffs into the cloud of flame and smoke near them.   He followed the flame down toward its source and saw the coals of Rodney, his plastic bedding outlining his form aflame.   The black sphere, no, silver sphere was hovering above the motionless young man.

""Hell shit fuck!""  Travis yelled.   ""Spray Rodney!""

Fiona looked at him, her face pale with fear.  ""We did!   It's alive!""

Travis blinked several times.  ""What?""

Beth pointed at the sphere.  ""Look at the flame!""

Travis looked at the cloud spreading above them.   He watched, could see it.   The flame moved, moved counter to the wind and smoke.   Branches of fire splayed out, growing from the root of Rodney's body.  ""It's like wings.   They're like wings.""

Fiona nodded.  ""The fire bird.""

Travis stared.  ""Damned phoenix.""   He looked around, saw a stick and crawled toward it.    A wing of flame pushed down at him and he rolled toward the stick dodging the fire.    His hands latched onto the thick branch and he rolled again.   His leg ached as an old injury reminded him of his age.    He had closed the gap though, and he swung.   The stick connected, and like a baseball, the sphere cracked and was launched away from Rodney's charred corpse.

The sphere bounced as the fiery bird followed it.   It landed down in its hole near the plate.    Beth kicked into action and ran toward the sluice Rodney had built, kicking it open.

Water flowed out of the puddle and swamped the silvery sphere.   The fire struggled, pulled in and down.    Then it squelched out, and only a small blue flame poked out from small holes in the sphere's side.

Travis scooped up some muddy clay and walked over, dropping it onto the orb.

\---===\*===---

They sat watching it until the sun came up.   Beth had distributed head lamps and Travis would periodically fill buckets of water and dump them into the hole as it steamed.

Fiona looked up at him and then over at what was left of Rodney.  ""What are we going to tell people?  We have to get the police out here.""

Travis didn't look up from the steaming puddle.  ""Doesn't take a lot of science, but people aren't going to believe it.""

Beth stared at him.

He looked over at the young woman, soot smeared on her face.  ""Phoenixes, dragons, the myths.   This thing, whatever it is, the bodies you found weren't worshippers were they.""

Fiona looked over at him, her eyes blinded by his headlamp.  ""I thought they were.  There is a lot of broken pottery around them.""

He sighed.  ""Fire brigade.   They were fighting it, lured it maybe.   Got it here in the mud and drowned it.""

Beth nodded.  ""This bog is always wet.   That's smart.""

""The cover stones are probably their way to warn anyone.   Leave it here.   Let it rot in the mud, keep it drowned.""  He said.

Fiona whimpered a bit and wiped a tear from her eye.  ""We're still going to have to tell someone.   Rodney's family needs to know.""

Travis took a deep breath.  ""I know some people.  They can handle things like this.  They'll believe me and will get it properly taken care of.""

Beth laughed.  ""You know people?""

He nodded and looked over at Rodney.  ""He's not my first friend to fall.   We're going to make sure he gets his respect.""   Professor Hawkins then got up and went to his tent to make some phone calls."

11lfndx,2,2023-03-07,Internship vs Research for a confused freshman,Suspicious_Island928,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11lfndx/internship_vs_research_for_a_confused_freshman/,"Hello! I am a first-year ds &amp; econ and I'm hoping someone can give me a bit of advice on a choice I have to make.  I am planning to study abroad in japan in the 2024 spring semester, from late March - late July. the application opens in a few weeks and I have been debating on which program I should apply to.

1. guaranteed part-time ds research at a university in Miyagi (north Japan) but low chance of getting an internship bc of the location.

2. guaranteed full-time ds research at a university in Osaka but a low chance of getting an internship bc it’s full-time research. 

3. take courses at a social science university in Tokyo (no guarantee, but research may be possible) and try for an internship(s) in Tokyo. 

One thing to consider is the level of difficulty in getting accepted. From difficult --&gt; easy, it is 2&gt;3&gt;1. The first two require a letter of rec from a faculty submitted in the fall, and I do have a few profs I have in mind, but since I am a first year, I am a bit anxious if they would be eager to. the research programs also have fewer spots available. 

**The thing is that I don’t know if I want to go into grad school or industry after graduating.**

according to my Japanese parents &amp; friends, 1 month+ internship is uncommon in Japan and the companies that have long internships most likely are in Tokyo, so being away from Tokyo really drops the likelihood of getting internships. ofc, there’s a remote option but most of the biggish companies I researched prefer in-person. 

I’m fluent in Japanese &amp; have Japanese citizenship so there shouldn’t be problems. 

I talked to my major advisor and he was mentioning how I can just do research at my home university (my university is a pretty well-known research university), but I have heard getting into research is difficult bc it's a big state school. Also, I am not very concerned about ""exploring"" bc I have been to Tokyo a couple of times (about 1-2 weeks each time) and my hope is just to live in Japan for a longer period.

which programs do you think will be the best choice for me? 

any advice is sincerely appreciated! thank you!"

I am only on my second semester, so im not fully trained on any of the languages ive learned. Either im actively taking courses for them or i will be taking a second course to complete training for a language in my next year. I feel incredibly under qualified for all the positions im seeing because i know so few languages.

C# is what i will be finishing next year. I am currently learning java and JavaScript. Ive already touched on HTML and CSS but we dont start python, cobalt, swift, or anything else until next year.

From what she shared with me, she was a bit surprised that her contract got terminated in less than 2 months of work (including on-boarding)

She mentioned that her manager never had a conversation about her performance during their 1-on-1 meeting and that she proposed her manager to give her feedback regularly about her performance (thing her manager didn't do).

She also mentioned that she usually shared with her manager her daily work in a form of summary via instant messaging.

She told me she's wasn't a beast in her work, but was gradually growing and getting use to the stack. She didn't have the time to prove herself and terminate her 4 months internship.

She worked at a well-known Canadian startup.

What are you thoughts about this? I never heard an intern getting laid off. It's hard to believe."

I am currently in my final semester of undergrad at UIndy, majoring in Human Biology. My career goals are to go into forensics, preferably as a DNA analyst.

I’ve been accepted to UIndy’s Masters in Human Biology program, as well as IUPUI’s non-thesis Forensic Biology program. 

I’m feeling truly torn on which program to pursue. I’ve made pros and cons lists of both and I’m still undecided. Originally I was all for IUPUI because I can finish the program in a year and get right to work. However, after learning about some of the opportunities I could have at UIndy, it has me second guessing. 

I’m already well established at UIndy and have worked with all of the professors in the program. If I went there for my Masters, I could work in the forensic DNA lab working on actual crime scene case work with a local police department. The program would take 2-3 years to complete. If I went to IUPUI, I could get an internship at a local forensic lab as well as complete the program in 1 entire year. 

How can I truly know which is right for me? Is there one that stands out more for what I want to pursue for my career? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I am at a standstill right now because honestly I have been having a lot of trouble with computer science (I barely understand ANYTHING) but when I study anything else I just think about how I should be realistic and focus on computer science and so I've been very down lately and not doing much. It's getting harder to study because I don't have that strong of a passion for computer science because I don't think the learning style suits me and even though I enjoy studying other things sometimes I begin to lose interest because I just think I am going to fail in life if I don't focus on the hustle of working hard and getting an internship and then getting a high paying job etc. (I know about balance but I always seem to lose my sense of identity when I try to mix two goals together.)

11lo888,0,2023-03-08,"I am an excellent programmer, but I have no work experience and my soft skills are awful.",This_Dying_Soul,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11lo888/i_am_an_excellent_programmer_but_i_have_no_work/,"I'm really worried about finding a job. I'm in my third year of CS and I have proven to myself that I can tackle difficult assignments; I know that I am good at this. Of course I know that I have loads of stuff to learn, but I want to emphasize that I am more than ready for a Junior position writing code in C, Java, or Python.

My problems are two-fold: (1) no internships, and (2) not a people-person. I don't have any internships under my belt because I enrolled in CS out of interest and I didn't foresee myself trying to make a career out of it. But honestly, with the way the economy is right now, any good-paying job is necessary, and at this point I have the knowledge. I just don't have the on-hands experience.

In regards the second issue, I've had my fair share of teamwork. But it's not something I thrive in. I'm more interested in being alone with my mind than being with a team working on a product. I'm also just not generally well-spoken or communicative. I know that none of this translates well into an interview, much less a company culture. And I always hear employers say that they would rather hire candidate B, who is less skilled but more personable, over candidate A, who is more skilled but less personable.

So what can I do to gain an advantage? I have many projects from school that I can improve and publish, and I am working on a portfolio website for this purpose. I also have very good knowledge of Python, as I have studied the core documentation intensively. And yet I apply to so many internships outlining all of my assets, and barely ever get a response, if not to be rejected.

It shouldn't be this difficult, right? How are so many people picking up Junior positions? Is an internship basically required in this day and age? If it is, what's my best shot at getting around this?"
11lp4zw,4,2023-03-08,I am a 22 year old Indian woman wanting to leave home.,Feeling_Amphibian_25,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11lp4zw/i_am_a_22_year_old_indian_woman_wanting_to_leave/,"I am a 22 year old female living in India, in a very conservative. Although they will tell you that they are not because after all they are allowing me to get a degree, get a job, etc. I hate my life. I am constantly stressed and depressed. I have no one to talk to about how I really feel. They have told me already that my feelings regarding getting married are of no consequence to them. I constantly have to bottle up my feelings and nowadays I feel like on the verge of exploding. I am not allowed to object to anything, they will quickly say shut up, don't argue, be threatening. 

I hate how they make me feel. I want to stick a knife into them. Its not like I don't appreciate everything they do for me, I do recognise that they go above and beyond with material things. But thats it. My mental health doesn't exist. Once I got them to take me to a therapist, and after she talked to my father, his response was that I had disparaged him and my family infront of her. So I resolved I would never go there again with their money. I just wish I could get hold of that bottle of poison again and kill myself. This feels like hell. I have no money, no job. Hostels, and rent cost a lot and I can't pay that. I went on the internet to look this up, and discovered that many women say that even the police and NGOs didn't help them. I tried to get an internship a while ago, and they told me I should concentrate on studying right now. I didn't attend the interview because I realised that with school and making me work like a maid, I wouldn't be able to do it without help. My plan right now is to stay home, work on my skills, get an income. 

But I can't help but think that I need to have an escape plan. Its not the escaping but the execution which worries me. Suppose I have no job, no money, no one to help me where could I go? One of the many downsides of being an Indian woman is that I would be unable to get help from friends, because their families too would be thinking that they can't help someone  who left her parents. Has anyone who has been in my situation give me some insight?"

Even things that I used to enjoy like lifting don't bring joy like they used to, and it's been days since I've had an actual conversation in person and I haven't even said a word to anyone in person in the past 48 hours. When I do talk to people, I put on a smile and act like everything's alright even though I feel like I'm slowly being crushed.

On top of that, I'm falling behind in two of my classes because I'm struggling to find the motivation to start working which creates a vicious self-perpetuating cycle where I feel bad and slack off which causes me to feel worse and slack off more. While my peers have tons of extracurriculars and internships, I'm just wallowing in my room for most of the day.

Sometimes, maybe once every 1-2 weeks, my parents will call me and I feel like I failed them. When they ask how my studies are going, I say they're going well(which is sort of true for my other two classes) even though I've slacked off and I feel like such a huge financial burden to them. At least, if I didn't exist, they could devote more time and expenditure to my younger brother's studies because at least he doesn't slack off.

I can't tell them about my deteriorating mental health though because they're not very open-minded with that sort of thing and I know they'll say something along the lines of ""it's all in your head!"" or ""Studies come first!"" or ""Just be positive!"" or ""We'll cut off your tuition if you don't do well this semester.""

To further compound the stress, I have midterms the next two weeks including two this week. One tomorrow night for one of the classes that I'm behind on and another the coming Friday for a class that I'm actually good at. I hope, tomorrow, the urgency of the midterm will give me the motivation I need to cram for it and hopefully do well.

It was my top school as well due to my familiarity with the campus from my internship, cheaper in state tuition, amazing ece program, etc. so I've pretty much committed to it.

I think it shows that even if your grades/test scores aren't out of this world, having strong extra curriculars and essays can really make the difference. Hope the college season is as lucky for you guys as it was for me!"

Should I go for it? Is it worth it? For context, I am east European.

I have gotten myself involved in CS degree because I want to make lots of money and that's my main motivator. Do I like this degree? I do but that's mainly because I see it as a great way to earn more money. This might seem very shallow maybe but that's just how I am.

So with that said, should I take this internship and start moving in this direction? So far I have been preparing myself to get Software Dev role in the future in some good company because it pays well as far as I know but I am in the beginning state only as I am still learning C++."

I see this as a very good chance to get into the world of programming, however I'm not sure how to go about the actual academy. It's 5 days a week, with weekly tasks to solve in own time. This chance also aligned with me putting in my notice at my current job so will be able to invest all my time into this opportunity.

For my study (electrical engineering), my thesis needs to be on an R&amp;D project I'm doing as an intern, and there's fairly strict requirements coming from my school (another reason why it took so long).

Because I've been out of the academic / technical loop for so long, I've forgotten a lot of math, programming skills and habits I formed during my 4 year study period. In my spare time I do watch a lot of technical youtube content which makes me retain at least some intuitive knowledge about engineering, and I've been working on a creative music carreer which helps me internalize signal processing to 'some' degree. Thing is, the intern project is going to be a c++ machine vision application with some pretty unfamiliar topics to me. Both the hardware and software in this project are looking very scary and I've just got a major sense of impostor syndrome. I know I'm a procrastinator / fast learner, but I just don't know if I'll manage to get up to speed this quickly.

Dear Ms. Lo,

Kindly accept this application from a highly motivated and enthusiastic student, who wishes to apply to your unique APAC Trading Course.

After hearing Devraj Bhattacharya and You (Angel Lo) speak at the Monash campus on Friday, not only introducing me to the company but also your unique trading course in Hong Kong, I was deeply interested.

As a highly motivated and ambitious penultimate year Banking and Finance student at Monash University, I have demonstrable interest in the financial markets and trading. I am working diligently to develop my skills in trading and analysis, including completing the Bloomberg Market Concepts certificate and learning programming languages such as RStudio and its finance applications. By taking these steps, I am confident that I can become an outstanding candidate for future trading and analyst positions. I think this unique training opportunity would provide me with an excellent education to start a prosperous trading career at your firm in the future.

Flow Traders reputation within the finance industry as a leading technology-enabled liquidity provider and market maker is stellar and I have been carrying your tote bag like a badge of honour.  Your focus on innovation, speed, and automation has created a billion-dollar company that’s younger than myself, and I am excited about the prospect of working with and learning from a team of highly skilled professionals committed to excellent returns.

Through my academic coursework and internships, I have developed strong analytical and logical reasoning skills, as well as proficiency in MS Office and Excel. I am eager to participate in the hands-on challenges and trading scenarios that the course promises, and I am excited about the prospect of being fast-tracked into the final interview for the Graduate Trader position in Hong Kong.

I am confident that my skills, experience and personality make me a strong fit for the Trading Business Course and the eventual Graduate Trader program. After placing 2nd in your live trading game, my ambition for a trading career only grew larger.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and interest in the Trading Business Course.

Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Ms. Lo,

Hearing yourself and Devraj speak about your APAC Trading course at Monash on Friday, inspired this application. I’m deeply interested, and highly motivated thinking about how this course aligns with my strengths, goals, and ambition for my career. There are three reasons why:

1. **Passion**. As a 2nd year Banking and Finance student at Monash University, I’ve diligently developed initial skills in trading and analysis. I’ve built on this by completing the Bloomberg Market Concepts certificate, as well as learning RStudio and its finance applications. This career path was ignited by my progress in maths and reading about Renaissance Technologies, Jim Simons and the Medallion fund.
2. **Potential.** Naturally, I have much to learn, and competencies to build. I also believe this unique opportunity to apply my strengths, energy and interest will not only build my skills but also provide Flow Traders with a strong student candidate for future opportunities. I have developed strong analytical and logical reasoning skills, through my academic coursework and internships.
3. **With Flow Traders, an Industry Leader.** My research has found that Flow Trader’s reputation as a technology-enabled liquidity provider and market maker is Industry Leading. Focus on innovation, speed, and automation has created a billion-dollar company, and I am excited about the prospect of working with, and learning from a team of highly skilled professionals, such as yourself, committed to excellent returns.

The hands-on challenges and trading scenarios that the course promises, are especially interesting to me. I am confident that my skills, experience and personality make me a strong fit for the Trading Business Course and the eventual Graduate Trader program. After placing 2nd in your live trading game, my passion for a trading career only grew larger.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and interest in the Trading Business Course.

I’m a Senior dev working on mostly front end. My team has gone through 4 front end developers in the past year and the common theme is that they just weren’t doing enough. But oddly enough, they all have had more years of experience than me when they start.

It’s taking a toll on me because obviously I have to assign work to them but the amount of teaching that I have to do is getting frustrating. There’s not one person who was ever able to do something all by themselves even after almost a year and there wasn’t any work that I didn’t have to either walk them through or eventually rework. All this is in addition to my own work. 

By the way, our UI work is fairly straightforward, we just render ui based on api response, the ux design is already provided.

I just got off a call this morning where I had to teach someone with 6 years of experience in angular how to do a git add and commit. He also doesn’t seem to understand flexbox. It was the same with the last two people, there were gaps in knowledge that were shocking given that they have more years of experience than me. We’ve had interns that were more talented. 
Would it be career suicide to suggest to our tech lead that the quality of hiring is becoming a problem or am I the problem? I’m honestly drowning trying to balance teaching new hires things they should know and doing my own work. I don’t even know what’s the way forward. The person who hires them is a tech lead of many teams so he’s not going to know about their day to day activities and I’m scared that I’ll sound like a complainer and non team-player.

I'm on my final year of my Masters in Cognitive-Behavioural Interventions. 
I have to write a case report for my internship and that includes a case formulation, which I've chosen to do in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). 

The patient I've chosen has Bulimia Nervosa and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. 

Regarding Bulimia it's pretty straight forward according to the ACT model, but I'm struggling with the ACT formulation for the PD. 
Some of processes are pretty easy to identify, such as cognitive fusion, experiential avoidance and self as concept, but it gets hazier when it comes to clarity of values and committed action. My patient's Obsessive traits drive actions that are, in fact, in accordance to her values, even though they cause her harm in her job, her relationships, etc. 
That being said I'm struggling with writing a case formulation and my mentor isn't being all that helpful, firstly because she doesn't know the patient herself and second because she's focusing on the intervention for the Bulimia. That's perfectly valid, but since it's for my case report I have to be more thorough. 

So, has anyone used ACT for this disorder? Do you have any insights? Would you recommend some nice bibliography please? 

Thanks in advance!"

 I wanted to share my experience at a recent internship because I'm honestly not doing well. I was an HR intern. Prior to this, I have have had nonexperience in the corporate world. I come from a humble background. Both my parents worked non-corporate jobs. I grew up in ""hood"" and it's hard to admit this but I feel I might dumb and here's why. My internship gave me a work laptop to work with projects. I transfer a work documents to my personal computer just cause the screen is bigger and it more comfortable to use. Unfortunately, I didn't know this was not allowed. I geuinenly didn't know that. I feel dumb cause I feel I should have known that. because no one in the HR team sat me down and told me the policies/rules. Aside from that, outlook has the option to have two emails together. I was sending out test emails(a draft that was going to be sent out to employees of the company) to my team with my personal email. It was a mistake cause the two accounts where connected when I did the mail merge. The Hr lady that even so those emails are ""their property"" and classified? And this internship was remote. And the manager was keeping track if I was online through Microsoft teams status. Basically if I was home I would need to let her know if I set out or if I had lunch. But most of the time I was at home and I didn't think that was the way I was being monitored. Amongst other things she told me I lacked soft skills. I was at this internship for less than a month. I admit to the mistakes that I made purely out of ignorance. I'm heartbroken because of this. I'm trying to keep my spirits up but it feels like I'm being penalized for a mistake I made that I wasnt aware of. And when I think like I feel dumb because it should have been common sense :("

I’m pretty much leaning towards the Amazon offer because it’s based on Bellevue where most of my friends will be at, and has a relatively cheaper COL compared to SF, plus Amazon is paying me more. Plus I’ll be an SDE intern instead of being a part of a fresh-soph program; I’m not sure if this is an added advantage but I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

However, with Uber, I’m sort of conflicted on reneging on them. I’ve had the offer since late December, however, they haven’t started the onboarding process and I don’t know my location or team yet. I’m not sure if reneging on them would be a great idea but on the other side I’m not sure if this internship is what’s right for me. 

I would love to hear your perspective on this and what you think is the better opportunity. Thanks!

Since starting undergrad school I knew I wanted to attend Waterloo for my master's. Finally, last year I decided to apply. A couple of thibgs stood up to me back then:

1. You need to have a professor agree to supervise in order to get accepted into the program
2. You should have a clear notion of what it is you wish base your research on

A little about myself:
I am from a small Latin American country, and majored in an engineering discipline (average grades were 89.4%)
I did my undergrad thesis at one of the top universities in Germany (was supposed to be a 6 month internship but ended up helping 2 years (1.5 years remotely)
With the tool and results from my research, I was included in the development of 4 papers (2 were accepted into very well known conferences, 1 of which I was co-main author). 
I worked two years in the industry and became senior after the first year.

Basically, I have always pushed myself to be the best version I can be. 

It was so frustrating to know that I needed approval from one professor to be accepted, yet the only reply I got was to tell me there was no space in his lab. I tried sending emails and calling (even trying to contact students to see if they could help me). No one even bothered to aknowledge recieved. I ended up being rejected and feeling a bit scammed. 

So here I am, thinking if I should persue the masters degree. I know it is normal to apply to many programs, but I also feel it might be a waste of energy, time and money. As far as I can see, my biggest weakness is coming from a small university.

What do you all think? Is there any advice you think I should know? Please give me all the tips and criticism that might help."

I hope this is relevant/allowed, just looking for advice. I recently accepted a summer internship as a developer, which I think is going to be great! My only qualm is that I also just secured a interview/chat with another company, which I got through reaching out to the CEO (small-ish startup), as well as through personal references of people I already know working there. This would be for a role I would be more interested in (AI/ML), but I have decided I won't go back on my acceptance of the original job. 

I would like to keep my options open with this company, as I would love to work there in the future. How should I approach this? I feel bad that I had them go through the effort of setting up a meeting, just to take another job before it happens. I would also love to just chat about what they do, but they're probably too busy for that.

Any advice is welcome :)"

I have been in the IT industry for around 10 years now 5 of which has been for a major university on the east coast doing mostly break/fix and a bit of system admin work.  Its a good job, but with no upward mobility and I have grown tired of the break/fix nature of IT. 

I started down this path about a year and a half ago with WGU with the eventual goal of getting a job doing some type of software development work. Since graduating I have started to look for jobs, but have started to be discouraged. Every job it seams have a 2+ year requirement, and im not finding truly entry level jobs.  The few entry level jobs seem to mostly be internships requiring you to be onsite. I'm for a lack of a better way of putting this an adult, with a house and bills and such and so I really can't see myself taking an internship and being able to afford to live!

I'm looking for advice on how to close that 2 year requirement, or is it just best to ignore that 2 year requirement and apply for the job anyways?

I was hoping to get some guidance from a couple members because I'm feeling very confused and anxious about my future in finance.   


A little bit of background about myself, I'm 27 and I am studying finance at a university in miami. During Covid I decided to go back to school as the job I was working didn't have any growth and I figured it was a good opportunity to get my AA at a local college before transferring to university. I was originally going to go into accounting, but after speaking to a friend of mine, he got me interested into the world of finance. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do in finance, I recently joined a club at my school that is all about Investment Banking, but it feels like I'm way behind the ball and it feels like if I wanted to go into IB, it was something I should've been thinking about as soon as I decided to get back into school. A lot of my peers have internships at great shops this summer and I'm still trying to figure out the basics of this very dynamic world. My school offers a lot of Virtual Internship Experiences so I've been tackling those as much as I can. Internship experiences catered to IB from BofA, JPMC, WF etc., etc., trying to learn as much as I can to catch up. The club has been helping me out a lot as well, learning about the different sectors within IB, the recruiting process, what to expect from the job and it's been great. I still don't know if its something that I want to do, but it feels like I need to pick something and start working towards it sooner than later. I really only picked IB just because of this club at my school and it felt like a good place to learn the ropes of finance.  


My question is, if I were to continue this path of IB, is it hopeless for me? Should I try and find some other role in finance and work towards a different path? I graduate next spring and an internship this summer seems unlikely, as I should've been looking for internships last year for this summer. I honestly feel a huge amount of imposter syndrome and I don't know if I'm making the right choice or not, so I was looking for some advice from people who have been in a situation similar to mine to shed some light and hopefully make me less anxious about my choices."

I’ve recently made it to the final stage of my first real data science internship. I’m applying for the role of a trading analyst for an insurance firm for the summer. My final interview is with the CIO next week and I want to be as prepared as possible. 

In your opinions and experience, what technical / statistical concepts should I study up the most to be prepared for the interview? It’s primarily analytics focused, but the application said machine learning knowledge is a bonus (I’m in the process of learning about ML now) 

Technical questions in my previous interviews were as such….decently easy but I feel it will advance I’m difficulty this round.

When is the mean and stdev not helpful? 

How would you go about plotting a time series chart of time it takes plants to grow and their height? (Prompted because I said I like gardening) 

Other types of “here’s a situation, what’s your strategy do solving the problem?” 

Lastly, tools I’m expected to use and know are python (I know decently well) SQL (very well), and tableau (familiar with bit better with other plotting tools)

I was able to model the gas plume using NOAA’s [ALOHA](https://www.epa.gov/cameo/aloha-software) program, but my boss is asking if I can somehow attach time data and animate it to show how the gas moved over time. 

The current gas plume model only spit out a  table with four rows, one for each polygon in the model. There is no time data with the plume. 

How would I go about creating some sort of time activated gas plume map? I’m mainly using arc pro but have some skills in python as well. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

I am a finance student and have a year left to graduate without the minor. The only careers I would like to pursue as of the moment is Corporate finance and software and possibly a masters in comp science. I prefer WLB and pay above all. I have an internship in program management for Continental in the summer. That being said, I'm thinking of adding a comp science minor but doing so would add a semester to graduation and 4-5k in loans to finish in Dec 2024. Would it be worth it? I can add a second internship during that summer and possibly offset cost. If i choose not to do the minor, I can take IS programming classes in Java and Python. However, the minor would provide more in debt knowledge to data structures and projects.  It should be noted I have taken 6 courses a semester till now and have a 3.86 GPA. Is the minor worth it?

I am an out of state applicant and overall the cost of tuition would be high as they have not given me a need based grant. My friend with a higher EFC got institutional grants which made his total COA lower than mine. 

A few days later, I get an email saying I need to do extra verification for my reported income. It was specifically my income, not my parents. They asked me for a W2 form when I reported my job. I worked at an internship over the summer in 2021, and I had to fill out a W9 form and was paid as a contractor for $1200. At the time, I thought that I didn’t qualify for filing for taxes since my earned income was low and I was a minor. I checked again online recently and this seemed to be the case.

I provided the W9 and a scanned copy of my check, materials that passed through IDOC without a problem as W2 substitutes, and the verification failed. I emailed the 3rd party company that was handling this, and they again told me to submit a W2 which I didn’t have. So again I emailed and then they gave me a special form for No W2’s, I submitted that, and now I have to make, file, and submit a Schedule C for 2021. 

I was wondering if:

1) I have eligibility for filing Schedule C
2) if I do, how should I do it?
3) if I don’t, what do I say? 

Thank you so much!"

I worked in the tech industry so not great timing. I was with my company for *18 years*. I know that’s a lot. But I loved my job and my clients. Unfortunately about a year ago the place basically crashed and burned under poor leadership and my entire department imploded. 

Like many here I feel either severely overqualified or under-qualified, and I’ve applied to dozens of listings and cant even get a call back except from scammers. I am at a loss.

Is 40 too old to retrain for a new career? I don’t even know what I’d do and I *just* paid off my student loans last year, so the idea of going back to school is daunting. Internships seem to only want newish grads. Even fast food places don’t want me. And I might snap if I hear the phrase “nobody wants to work” ever again."
11me8lg,2,2023-03-08,Breaking into embedded,Jaydogg_,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/11me8lg/breaking_into_embedded/,"Background: I graduated with my Bachelors in Computer Engineering (ABET accredited) in December. I worked the whole time, and the place I worked at had a Controls Engineering internship/training opportunity that I started a little over a year ago that lead to an engineering position once I graduated. I think it’s a fine job. I definitely don’t hate it, but sometimes it feels like I’m a glorified technician and I don’t find it incredibly interesting. 

Taking a step back, what I really liked in school was programming (90% C++), embedded systems (we used an 8051) and FPGA hardware design. I took a senior elective in real time systems, and although I didn’t get as much out of it as I should’ve because I was swamped at the time, I’m sure what I did get out of it can only help. 

I didn’t have a ton of time to do personal projects while I was in school and working, but I just got a few STM 32 and ESP32 boards that I’m going to do a few projects with. Once I have a few of those under my belt, how hard do you think it would be for me to make the switch without any embedded internship experience? Thanks in advance for reading and your comments."

I am making this post because I am serious about tech entrepreneurship and really appreciate perspectives from experienced entrepreneurs. In short, I am at an important juncture in my life (high school to university) and I'm contemplating the choices and the best course of action.

### Brief Context, About Me
- I graduated from a polytechnic in Singapore as a Valedictorian + founded some clubs, extremely involved in stuff inside and outside of school, etc.
- A polytechnic is very similar to a college (but treated as high school in Singapore), i.e. I specialize in computer science and we take modules like linear algebra, networking, database management, software engineering, etc. (basically just like a mini college, covering ~50-70% of actual college stuff)
- I'm super involved in internships and startups and I have ~3 years of full-time working experience in the tech industry and founded some small businesses (nth crazy, just like programming tutoring, e-commerce biz, etc.)

TLDR; I have some decent experience in tech already because of my high school background + ~3 years of experiences, so focusing on academics in college would be less valuable for me. I am, however, still planning to go college nonetheless to gain new perspective (overseas exchange maybe) and also network and stuff;

### How to focus on becoming a tech founder in college?
- In high school, I did ALL SORTS of things and I felt like I learned SO SO much. I'm not saying I'm a damn genius now, but I feel like doing these things on a repeat in college would be less productive.
- I found my love for entrepreneurship in high school and I deeply believe that my time in college should be to work toward actually becoming a tech entrepreneur rather than grinding for good grades and trying to be president of all clubs.
- Now the challenge is I'm not sure what's the ""best thing to do"" if tech entrepreneurship is my goal in college. I trust that an experienced mentor's guidance would be immensely valuable and I would love to hear any advice at all!

TLDR; I learned a lot in high school through being heavily involved in everything and I don't think I want to do this on a repeat in college, because my primary goal is tech entrepreneurship. I really value experienced mentor's guidance and would really really love any advice!!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! Love to hear some perspectives from anyone!"
11mfmk6,1,2023-03-08,RV battery system,Dakine4real,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/11mfmk6/rv_battery_system/,"College student here, admittedly not a electrical engineering student but could use some help. 

For an internship I have I’m trying to put together a marketing trailer. One of the ideas that we have had is to try and offset the need for a generator with a battery system that can power our electrical needs for around 6-7 hours, the length of an average trade show day. 

The trailer will have a 13,500 btu air conditioner, 2 large tvs, one smaller tv, 15 led light, a small air filtration unit, and a computer or two. 

Currently with the research I’ve done, it seems to me that a 100 ah battery will run just the AC unit for about an hour. Figuring that we will be running additional items and for a much longer period of time than that, I thought our needs would probably be in the 800-900ah range for a battery system. 

I guess my main question is, is this really a feasible thing to do. Storage is not a problem, cost is not a problem, but at the end of the day, is this something that can be done? Do any of you have recommendations for a project like this or insight into if this would work?

I was also thinking about Tesla modules which I believe are around 250 ah, then I thought about solar as well. Basically I’m just asking for any advice you might have on a project like this and if you could shed some light on how to go about calculating electrical draw and converting that into an estimated runtime figure. 

I appreciate it"

I'm writing a post here to see if anyone could offer me some advice on my chances based on my portfolio on getting the **SMU School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) Achievements/Aspirations Scholarship** as I personally do not know anyone who got it from my group of friends. If anyone here has the scholarship, and does not mind a DM, please drop a comment and I will DM you!

My main question would be what the likelihood of me getting this scholarship would be, and if I would be better of trying for **Achievements** or **Aspirations** as my first choice, as I tried for the SMU Merit one previously and did not get it :(

Some background about me: I am from JC and took BCME (all H2) and H3 Biology and got 85 RP w Dist. Was initially set on a Bio course, but had a change of mind through NS and switched to SMU. Now i currently hold a place in SMU Double Degree: Computing and Business. My portfolio stands as such:

* No background in coding as I did not do it in JC. However I started taking courses during NS but nothing spectacular
* Currently doing a post-NS internship for 5 months as a business analyst at a decently sized ecommerce company 
* Have some experience in teaching coding to kids (through a part-time job and volunteering by myself, but it is mainly block coding e.g. Scratch)
* Leadership: Was Vice-President of my JC CCA, few times class chairperson and led a few projs e.g. VIA whilst in sch
* Achievements: Wrote some papers, and participated in competitions whilst in JC and NS but none of them are CS related
* Volunteering: Did a fair bit of volunteering in JC and continued whilst serving but mainly volunteered by teaching students secondary/primary school subjects or interest related
* Reason for scholarship: Have two younger studying siblings, so would like to fund university through a scholarship, and use part-time work to fund pocket money

Would appreciate any help possible! Thankss"

My first day comes, and I had this idea that I was gonna get a proper introduction to the different platforms they use, but they just showed me what they used, but not how to actually use it. So, even now I'm not exactly sure what all these things I have downloaded on my computer does. Within my first day, I was already given an assignment to do, which isn't something simple. And way out of my knowledge and skills. I wasn't even expecting to get anything maybe for the next couple of weeks, I thought I was going to be provided with some training, like watch how they do task and give me small tasks while they watch me. But, my first assignment they gave me an assignment where I had to add a functionality into their existing code! I was freaked out cause of course I don't know. I don't even know what their existing code does. I let my mentor know, I don't know how to complete it. And they were nice enough to help me, but throughout the assignment I can tell they were getting annoyed of my questions because of course I was asking some pretty stupid questions.

I feel like I got the wrong exception with this internship. I don't know if this normal for an internship, since its my first one. I haven't gotten back to my internship this week, because I already had an existing out of town plans that they had let me go on. So I'll be back next week, but I'm worried and dreading it.

I plan on docking it in some form with a laptop stand next to a 1440p 144hz monitor, and possibly using it alongside a tablet, for note-taking and media consumption so touchscreen/2 in one capability is not needed.

I've looked around at different ultrabook style options, like the Acer Swift 3, Lenovo yoga 6, and Asus zenbook, all with AMD processors with pretty strong iGPUs, however, I'm not sure which generation/model fits my use case and price the best. I'm not sure about Intel's iGPU performance, and how much a dedicated GPU would impact cost and battery life ( Nvidia Optimus?)

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* \*\*Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:\*\*Preferably under 800 dollars, but the budget is flexible.
* \*\*Are you open to refurbs/used?\*\*Refurbs/open box like new are acceptable
* \*\*How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?\*\*Build quality and battery life come first as it will mainly be used for school, with performance behind.
* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*Moderately important.
* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*A smaller screen size is preferred, but I'm not sure how beneficial a larger laptop next to my monitor would be.
* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*I'm not completely sure what CS school entails with regard to having to run VMs and Linux and such, but the school I'm going to has a VDI that I can use to run any intense programs and VMs.
* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*Valorant, R6 siege, Overwatch, CSGO, 144+ fps on a 1080p window on the 1440p monitor with the lowest settings is acceptable.
* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*Docking compatibility may need a strong USB-c connection/thunderbolt. I'm not sure how much ram/storage I would need and if I would upgradeability but it is a concern.
* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\*If there are any laptops set to release soon, or a new line of processors rolling out that would make previous generations cheaper, I would be willing to wait a few months for better options or pricing.

Are there any thoughts on using a PC + tablet for the benefit of cost/future-proofing/reliability? I'm not sure what the college experience is like and if I would need to have the ability to do anything that a tablet couldn't do on the go, or if I would need a laptop for any internships. Also, tablet/dock recommendations would be helpful. Pen support + good display and quality are important to me."

The team is also composed of highly skilled people from big companies working on this startup as a side job. 

The person running this company invited me to return as a PM intern. The PM work I’ve been doing for them that goes well beyond what an intern would do. I talk directly with clients and participate in every meeting/user flow building session.

It happens that I was offered a position as a virtual client solutions intern at Morgan Stanley, and now I am extremely conflicted as to what is more valuable for my resume if I plan on becoming a product manager after I graduate: to continue working for the company I currently work for, or to take Morgan Stanley’s offer.

I've been applying job abroad in a while, and this was the first that I actually passed. But I'm over overqualified.


May naka exp na ba ng ganto dito? I applied for a trainee position sa Netherlands,

I'm an IT, integration specialist with 2 years xp dito sa Pinas.


Here is the email I received,

""Thanks a lot for your application. I discussed your profile intern. At this moment we cannot do you an offer.

We prefer that you would work in the Netherlands. Then we should hire you as a knowledge migrant. The problem is that the salary would be to high for a Trainee. 

So at this moment we couldn't hire you.""


I could have applied sa engineer position nila but I am 1 year short I think kasi 3 years and minimum exp. At late ko na rin nakita. 


Should I reply pa ba? May pag asa pa ba 'to? Ofc I don't want to look desperate but damn, I think it was close. ☹️"

11mt1v0,0,2023-03-09,Should I apply for this cybersecurity position?,Hotamale,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11mt1v0/should_i_apply_for_this_cybersecurity_position/,"Hi everyone,


I was checking around job advertisements in my area and noticed that there is an ad for a **Cloud Security Analyst** position. I have a CS degree and around two years of professional experience (+two internships if it matters). I'm currently working as a system engineer in a hybrid environment, but I have always wanted to pivot into cyber security. 

I have dabbled with quite a lot of areas during my work(networking, system administration, databases, cloud, devops), a classic jack of all trades, master at none. I'm currently happy with my position, but security jobs are quite rare in my area and I don't want to miss one I think I might be qualified for. 

Do you guys think this job is a downgrade, if it is do you think is worth it in order to get my foot at the cybersecurity door? Please feel free to share your experiences.



This is what responsibilities are listed:

· Review the current cloud security measures, recommend enhancements, identify areas of weakness, and respond promptly to possible security breaches

· Collaborate with Engineering and Software Development teams to incorporate strong security controls, apply security best practices in development life cycle, and mitigate security vulnerabilities

· Develop and drive the implementation of a security architecture that supports company’s goals and deliverables, through strategy, design and requirements

· Building and operating automated security operations

· Perform security evaluation of cloud setup in new projects, assess major changes in cloud infrastructure and define relevant security requirements

· Monitor security events from relevant cloud services and conduct the required investigations

· Develop and maintain cloud security related policies and procedures

· Analyze security best practices and trends and provide appropriate recommendations

· Coordinate investigation process of security incidents and problems"
11mt6lb,7,2023-03-09,Applying for a job as a double major,Bigchungga985,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11mt6lb/applying_for_a_job_as_a_double_major/,"I'm a double major in Physics and Computer Science in my last semester of my 4th year. I have been working in a laser lab as a research assistant for almost a year now where I was tasked to make a 2D spectrometer (this includes building it and writing the software for it). Given that the majority of my out of class experience is in the Physics field rather than computer science, should I be applying for internships or junior positions? (I am planning on applying for software development/engineering positions, but also open to web development).

Also, is it beneficial to be a double major in something like Physics? Any companies I should consider applying to with this kind of background?

Thanks in advance"

11muhil,98,2023-03-09,"Now that I’m an adult, I realize I don’t know who I am at all because I was never allowed to be anything other than what my parents wanted.",helloworld1036,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/11muhil/now_that_im_an_adult_i_realize_i_dont_know_who_i/,"It became so much more apparent when I entered college and after I graduated.

My friends were allowed to have options on where to go to college, and tour different campuses to see where they’d best fit. I was told that every campus is the same and it’s a waste of money. I had to go to whatever the “top” college I got into was.

My friends took classes and majored in topics that actually interested them: ecology/environmental science, psychology, teaching, women’s studies. From as far back as I can remember, I was told by my parents that I’d get a cubicle at a financial company and that’d be the pinnacle of success. So I studied finance and whenever I struggled in a class because I truly had no interest in it and wasn’t motivated to get better, I felt like an utter failure. 

When I graduated, I got a full time job offer from my student internship, a very small, unknown company but with good people and a great boss. When I told my parents, they weren’t happy or proud, they didn’t give a shit. I was told I needed to keep looking for an “actual” company. So I took a corporate job and started on this career path and it’s miserable. 

I never got to paint or rearrange my room growing up. I never got to form or pursue any of my own interests. I never got to choose a sport or summer camp to try out. I was told I would learn violin (I sucked at it, and when I finally convinced them to let me quit, I was told I was useless). I had to succeed in math and science, even though my true strengths were always in the humanities.

Sure, I may have a cushy corporate job now, but I’m miserable. I envy my old friends who are pursuing their passions and making new friends with similar interests, even if they don’t make as much.

I hear my friends talk about how they’ve always loved computers or sports or nature as a kid, and I simply can’t relate. I can’t recall any interests as a kid that I organically formed.

I literally have no idea who I am because I spent my entire life trying to appease my parents and earn validation from them. I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like a shell of a human."

Never did any IT internships in College except a short helpdesk stint my freshman year ( I realise this as my biggest downfall now ) Was sure I wanted to follow the Marketing track. Now graduated trying to get into cybersecurity. Working Helpesk L1 full time but like most people I am wanting out. I have my security + and am interested in SOC level 1 roles. Haven’t had much luck applying for those so looking to get my Network + and widen my search to networking roles too. What cybersecurity homelabs could I do to bolster my resume ? Is helpdesk to SOC too ambitious ?

Everyone said “maybe he is jealous”, “ignore him he’s bitter”, etc. 

Well he was right. 

I’ve only been here 3 months but 1/2 of the team either quit/retired/transferred. 

 - The deadline are super unrealistic. (How do I average 50 tickets daily but you get mad when you assign me 127 tickets and I can’t complete all of them).

 - my co-workers are high-key rude and act irritated when I ask any sort of questions. 

 - I’ve had other IT jobs, but this is the 1st one where I literally don’t want to get out of bed in the morning and get anxious just thinking about work.

 - I was hired on as hybrid and the CEO is pushing for full-time in office now

I want to quit so bad but:

 - the benefits and pay are great. 

 - they’ll pay for my masters degree and if I leave within two years I have to pay it all back.

 - I had a hard time landing this role in the 1st place.

 - if I can last 1 year exactly, I can apply for other roles in the company and pray that it’s not as toxic as my current one.

My manager is heavily biased to the other team members (they’re Indian and I’m American) and I only see her for our weekly 5-minute chats. Which she bails out on most of the time.

I found a very nice cybersecurity internship (technically in my last semester but school is online) that I would love to apply for, but I have a hard time justifying to myself switching from a permanent position when I have rent and bills to pay, to getting something temporary only for my happiness.

Thoughts? I need some advice."

11my8lc,4,2023-03-09,Junior in College with 1 year of help desk; what should I do?,Seadles,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11my8lc/junior_in_college_with_1_year_of_help_desk_what/,"Hello everyone, I’m a 3rd year college student majoring in MIS with plans of getting into cloud infrastructure engineering as a career after I graduate. Right now I’m currently working in help desk at my school.

I’m aware that cloud engineering isn’t typically an entry level role so during my time at help desk I’ve obtained my Network + and will soon be taking my AWS SA-A to get a head start before graduating. After that, I’ll get to work on some cloud-based projects.

I’ve been applying for internships all over the country for weeks now but they either don’t reply and leave the job post open for months, or tell me relocation isn’t offered and end the interview on the spot.

Provided I don’t end up getting an internship to jump-start my career, are roles such as jr sysadmin or jr cloud support engineer realistic options for me once I finish school as a way to pivot into cloud infrastructure?

I’m very worried that I’m just going to be stuck in a cycle of help desk jobs if I can’t find an internship soon, people keep telling me help desk isn’t very useful and that cloud internships are absolutely essential.

I would be grateful for any advice you guys can give me."
11myj3u,0,2023-03-09,Take on hardships to do an internship at a good company compared to an easier time at a mediocre company?,kekst1,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11myj3u/take_on_hardships_to_do_an_internship_at_a_good/,"Hi, 

I posted here quite a bit already, I'm an English Education student trying to pivot into IT/Security by doing internships/part-time gigs and getting an online Security Degree next to finishing my teaching degree. 

My work history is 4 years of barkeeping during weekends, 6 months part-time full remote at a startup being the main DevOps, Sec Ops and M365 admin guy, now 6 months part-time full remote at FAANG as a Customer Success Manager. 

Last week I applied to ~10 positions for internships and got 4 interviews out of it. Today was my first interview with one guy at one of my countries (Western Europe) Fortune 100 equivalent manufacturing companies and after only 20 minutes of talking about what his team does and what my experience was, I got an offer. The position would mainly be about IIoT/OT Security and IoT Data Engineering, both I have never done before. 

Problem: I would have to move for 2 months to the most expensive city in my country to get onboarded before I can move back to my city and work remotely. This would cause me a lot of stress, loss of income compared to my current FAANG gig and potentially push back graduating by one semester (I'm already 24...) 

I also have interviews coming up for gigs in my city, mainly IT-Consulting for larger MSPs (think Accenture, Capgemini etc.) and a large insurance company with a pretty boring position tho. 

What do you guys think, is it worth it? The manufacturing company would keep me as a part-time remote worker afterwards in their IoT Data team."

11n0ji6,1,2023-03-09,"I have a good life, but I just feel so inadequate.",ShadowDrifter179,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/11n0ji6/i_have_a_good_life_but_i_just_feel_so_inadequate/,"I'm a 21 year old male. On paper, I have a great life. I'm about to get my bachelor's degree in August with a good GPA of like 3.4, then a year after that I will have a Master's degree and hopefully I will pass my CPA exam.

I'm working an internship at an accounting firm making $32 an hour while I am there, I have about $700 monthly expenses so the rest of it is going directly towards savings. Granted, I'm paying for my last year of schooling, and I might have to pay for my Master's degree which is roughly $10-15k, but I will probably have enough for it and even enough to take my CPA exam. Not to mention I am filling out scholarship applications in order to try and curb that amount.

I have a family who cares about me, if anything a little much because I feel slightly constrained by them. I have a brother who has got my back and will bend over backwards for me, if really necessary. I have a good friend who we constantly check up on each other, and constantly help each other out. I have a group of online friends that I don't talk to a lot but when I do, they are always pretty welcoming. Sure, one of them includes my former best friend though who I realized was just using me to vent. She left for 8 months after breaking up with another member in the group, and she came back recently, although it was only to try and get back with him, I thought it was because they missed or liked hanging out with me. That sucks, but it isn't a big deal.

I have a girlfriend that cares a lot about me. We have our issues though, we haven't had sex in like 2.5 months, and in the nearly 7 months we have been together, we have had sex probably 7ish times. I know we are busy, and with our parents in our homes it makes it kind of hard, but it doesn't even sound like she has the desire to have sex. In the few times we have an opportunity, she is always too tired, or she hasn't shaved, or she doesn't feel like it. Which is totally fine, I am not entitled to her body, but now I don't want to ask because I'm just getting rejected, I don't want to guilt or force her into it, so I'm waiting on her to ask. It's been a long time now. It feels worse considering she used to regularly have sex with a guy before we met. I feel inadequate.

Even when we have had sex though, it's bad. She took my virginity, so obviously I am bad at sex, but holy shit I did not think I would be this bad. She gets off most of the time, I have gotten off once. I know this is because I struggle from porn addiction. Before her, I used to get off everyday to my own hand, when I first got with her, that subsided a lot actually, but it didn't help. Now that it's been a long time, I've come back to using it all the time. How hard is it to fucking stop doing something? It seems so fucking easy, it makes me feel inadequate.

With my schooling, I feel so overwhelmed all the time, I'm trying to work 40 hours with my internship if possible, while also taking 4 classes, I'm doing the bare minimum in school, barely keeping up. If I don't work 40 hours though, I may not save enough to accomplish my schooling and CPA in a timely manner, I also want to make a good impression of my employer. I haven't read a single chapter of my accounting law book since the semester started; I got a B on the exam. I manage to pull it off by studying well I guess, but I don't know how I will replicate it. It's not a case of impostor syndrome because I don't believe my success is due to luck, but man I feel like I will fail at any second, it makes me feel inadequate.

My internship is so difficult. I don't know how I will actually make it in this field. I feel like I don't know what I am doing. Constantly annoying people with questions, make the progress of a snail, not sure how they don't realize how bad I am at this. And to think that at the end of the internship I was going to ask for a part time position while I go to school. I feel inadequate.

I recently got into an accident. It was my fault, I was not paying attention, looking out the window instead of the road, and rear-ended a guy going 20 mph, I tried to break and swerve, but I didn't slow down fast enough. I pushed him into another car, now I am responsible for both. Everyone is okay, but my god is it expensive. I have already paid $1000 to get my truck in working order, and that is not including the couple hundred dollar bumper I need to get, and the citation I need to show up to court for, and the raised insurance premiums I will need to pay. I also got my tires aligned, and it turns out my outer tire rod is torn, the end links need to be replaced, and the upper control arm is in bad shape, $885 fix. Even though, this tire stuff is in bad shape, I know it wasn't from the accident, that being said it is still draining my emergency fund. How could I not pay attention? It makes me feel inadequate.

Then because of this stupid self improvement mindset I try to have, I constantly internally question my friends and girlfriend to see if they are good for me. It gives me an us vs. them mindset and I hate it. For example, with my girlfriend, I try my best to help her out. Her dog is having behavior issues, I offer non-corrective solutions to try and help, and I try to help implement those solutions but she veers towards using corrective solutions. She has not learned how to drive yet so I drive her everywhere. I can't teach her because she has no vehicle to learn, and she can't use mine because my dad owns the vehicle, and it is too risky for him to allow her to learn. Her parents refuse to help her. I looked up that driving lessons in Las Vegas are $600 which is quite a lot, but worth it. It also looks good for insurance, and it means she doesn't have to buy a vehicle to learn, she can instead go straight to a motorcycle like she wants.

It's obviously a lot of money, but she does not save at all. I consider myself to be pretty good with money, so I offered to help her budget so she can slowly save up for it and make progress towards it, and at first she was willing but when we actually started she didn't want to. I'm not going to control her finances because it is not my place, so I have just left her to work on it. She hasn't made progress towards it, and is constantly stressed about it, and it bothers me because I want to help but she does not want my help. 

These kinds of issues bother me and make me wonder if we are a good fit together, but I know she is going through her own stuff, and who am I to judge what she does. I don't want to control her. She is probably going through more than I am (Like most people, they go through much worse than what I go through), and I know she is trying her best. I feel shitty for thinking this way because we are doing the best with what we are given, so who am I to deem her unworthy or something for doing the best that she can, and have it not be enough for me. I feel like a piece of shit for it, because I am sure I am doing things that bother her that I do not know about. Yet she talks about how I am the nicest guy she has ever dated and how I am always so sweet to her.

I'm scared to mention these things to her though, because she does not take criticism well, and she sometimes ""splits"" when I give her a lot of feedback about things that bother me because it makes her panic.

I love my girlfriend, I really do. So I don't know why my brain sabotages me with making me think we maybe shouldn't be together. I feel so lost, and I don't want to make a move because I feel like whatever move I make, I'm damned if I do or damned if I don't. This only adds to my feeling of inadequacy. I feel this way with my friends too, where I see things that make me question if they are good friends for me, but like cmon brain, they are doing the best they can as well. Who am I to judge them for that?

This doesn't even touch other topics, like how I can't get off my phone, I can't get myself to practice piano, I can't get myself to tell anyone these things because people think I have it together and everyone I know thinks I am so nice all the time when in reality I am always so mean to myself. I hate my position."
11n0r6b,6,2023-03-09,Study Abroad or Internship,Ok-Chemical3,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/11n0r6b/study_abroad_or_internship/,"Hi guys, was hoping to get some input on whether I should do a study abroad or stay in Ireland for an internship.

I am doing CS and have been given the opportunity to study at TU Munich for the second semester, which runs from mid-april to late-july, which is much later than ireland. If I was to go for this the chance of getting a summer internship before my final year, is basically none as I would only be around for 4-6 weeks. I'd also be doing nothing significant between Christmas and April.

On the other hand I could stay in ireland and get experience with an internship, which seems even more important for graduate job prospects, considering the not so stable job market as of late. However an internship is not even 100% guaranteed, although I have a decent gpa so it shouldn't be a major problem.

Basically, is an internship important enough to stay at home rather than living/studying in a new country?

I am a First Year at a MI Community College, majoring in CS applying for the Fall'23 cycle.

**Demographics &amp; Location**: Male, in MI

**Applying to**: Cornell, Northwestern, Northeastern, Vandy, Emory and UVA

I got rejected from Umich instate but got accepted into Santa Clara so far.

**GPA and test scores**: CC gpa 4.0 ( rigorous schedule),

HS gpa 3.7 UW, 4.2 W

32 ACT (35 math, 30 science, 29 english, 35 reading).

High School class rank top 7%.

Excellent essays

**EC's**: currently a SEO head intern, contributor to open source projects, member of CC honors society, did research with professor who will write my loc, leader of a stem club at school. In PTK, I work with leadership.

I plan on having just over 35 credits after winter'23

**Also while my current GPA is 4.0, for my midterm report I will have a B in chem but the rest of my grades will be an A. This would make make my overall GPA 3.92. Should I submit this midterm report to schools that recommend it but not require it such as UVA and Northeastern or should I leave it out. I’m debating on whether to send it. Would it hurt me or help me?**

Would appreciate your opinions on my chances and any advice would be great."

Originally planned to graduate in 4 years (spring 2024) but I intend to attend the Grace Hopper Conference and shoot my shot for a FAANG internship for summer 2023 and hopefully get a return offer. I want to extend my graduation to the end of Fall 2024 instead. Money for college/extending graduation isn’t an issue for me.

How does this even work? Graduating in the fall means I need a full time job lined up for spring 2025. When do I start applying for spring 2025? Is extending graduation worth it? 

Do I just change my resume to say “graduating fall 2024” instead??"

I just received an email from a summer internship I was offered about having to take a drug screening before starting at my position.

I don't start until the 2nd of June, so I still have time to detox, but my employer wants me to do it soon. From my perspective, there are three things I could do:

1. Say I'm busy for the month of April and don't have enough time to make an appointment. (The testing center is an hour away, and the appointment itself will take an hour)
2. Do the drug test when they want and fake the results using a friend's or synthetic urine.
3. Email them and admit that I have smoked recently in a legal state and was told that I would not need to take a drug test. Then ask for more time to detox.

I think every option has a downside. For #1, It's not a complete lie, but it is suspicious, and I'm unsure they would be willing to wait that long. #2, I could get caught somehow. #3, they might flat-out reject me because I admitted to drug use.

I'm honestly not sure which of these options is best. I feel like #3 is the most honest and will most likely work, but it also runs the highest risk of me getting rejected from the internship. The boss at the job is kind of a hard ass, from what I hear. At the same time, I was told there wouldn't be a drug test, so I am unsure of what to do now. Any advice is appreciated."

I want to be more connected with people so I’ve also been trying to be involved in the community through clubs, jobs, etc.

Over the past school year, I’ve applied to so many different things from clubs, organizations, jobs, internships, and stuff but keep getting rejections. I’m trying my best by trying new things, gaining skills, and improving my academics and resume but it just doesn’t seem to be working. 

Recently, I’ve been applying to summer jobs, internships, and stuff for the next year because I want to be more involved with my community and gain new experiences but it seems like even if I’m ready to try new things, outside forces aren’t ready to accept me. 

I get interviews but then I always get rejected anyway. I don’t want to compare myself to my friends but it seems like they’re succeeding somehow with club exec positions, jobs, and internships and I’m doing something wrong since I keep getting rejected. Also a lot kids younger than me from my high school and community are upcoming students to my college so I feel like I’ll be behind them since I’m not as social or involved as they are even though I’m trying.

I understand that you have to try to put yourself out of the comfort zone but it doesn’t seem to be working. I’m also feeling a bit overwhelmed and disappointed in myself with the constant rejection emails and lack of responses from over the past 7 months. I’m going to keep trying but I’m struggling to improve myself and keep positive with this.

Found the rest of positions mostly on indeed (searched ""swe intern,"" filtered by city and date posted)

Spent a **lot** of time on resume since my experience was not impressive (reading feedback others were given on reddit was extremely helpful)

Went to two career fairs at my school, I got emails and followed up but all those companies ghosted me or resume rejected. Still glad I went for the professional experience, will go again next year.

I have worked as a backend developer at WITCH for seven months. After leaving the company, I was unemployed for six months, during which I learned the MERN stack, worked on some projects, and practiced my DSA skills. Recently, I began applying for MERN stack developer jobs and successfully cleared an interview for a startup that is currently working on open source blockchain technology for clients and may venture into product territory in the future.

The founder offered me a two-month internship with a pay of 30K to see if I am up to their speed. If I finish the internship successfully, they will offer me 50K. The only catch is that the office is an hour away from my home, and the work timings are from 9AM to 8PM. I am not sure if the 6 LPA salary is worth undergoing such intense work and commute schedules. However, if I refuse, my jobless gap will increase, and I might miss out on better opportunities.

Overall, I am confident in my skills and believe that I can upskill further and find better opportunities if I try harder. I would appreciate any advice on what I should do next. Thank you."

I have been on this reddit for a while and I finally have the courage to ask about my situation. I was scared and worried about my situation for a long time, but I really want to brave and ask for advice about it.

I am currently in my 4th year in uni and I am studying renewable energy engineering. My journey in the last 4 years have been a disaster. Covid hit in my first year and I couldn't understand anything from online classes. I was doing fine though until I finished my second year. My gpa was good and I was on time with my study plan.

However when I started 3rd year everything went downhill. My family started going through financial issues which caused a lot of problems at home. A lot of arguments and fights happened which caused a lot of stress and pressure in my life on top of my courses. I went into depression and wasn't able to focus or care on anything at all. I started procrastinating a lot and barely studied anything. This really affected me in 3rd year. I had failed 4 courses and dropped 2 which really put me behind and lowered my gpa a lot. I considered of quitting and dropping out as I felt hopeless and thought I have no more future.

All these problems continued in this year as well. I have wrecked myself and my transcript. Till now I have a total of 7 Fs and some Ws on my transcript and my cgpa is 2.7. I am also behind by 1 year now and I need 5 years in total to graduate.  My transcript looks absolutely horrible and I am very scared and worried that it will ruin any chance of getting a good job or a good career. Despite engineering being hard and rigorous I still enjoy and I want to help the environment around me. But I feel like I already ruined my chances to be a good engineer.

I cant switch my major or change uni as its too late, I just want to finish uni at this point and graduate because I am exhausted. I didn't do much on the side either I only have 1 internship I got through a friend but I didn't learn much and it wasn't close to my field.

I am anxious that my uni years will haunt and affect my career for the rest of my life. My question is will it really harm me?

Please if anyone went through something similar and did horriblly in uni like me (bad gpa, bad transcript, no experience) were you able to find good jobs? Was it a difficult process? Please if anyone can help or advise I would really appreciate it. Thank you"

Keep in mind I am studying Computer Science, so my knowledge on networking and system administration is limited, honestly not sure why they gave me this work to do.

I'm hoping I could get some pointers on some of my thoughts.  It'd be appriciated. The cpu has been bought already at a discounted price.

For the motherboard I've scoped out :

*£125* B760M PG RIPTIDE Intel LGA1700 DDR5 Micro-ATX (with student discount)

\+ new, price, size

*£155* **MSI PRO Z690-A Motherboard Socket 1700 Z690 DDR5 S-ATA 600 ATX (refurb)**

\+ z690i

I hear there's not much need to overclock this gen cpu. Is there any truth to that? Does it make any sense to go for the riptide to keep build costs down or will I be throttling the cpu?

&amp;#x200B;

For ram I thought I might go the cheaper route for now &amp; upgrade it a bit later down the line when the low latency stuff is going for a decent price?

*£45* **Crucial 16GB (2 x 8GB) PC5-38400 (DDR5-4800)** 

&amp;#x200B;

for the gpu I'll wait a few more weeks to see if amd announce anything budget otherwise I'll likely buy a 2080ti / 3070 / 6700xt used if I can find one for a good price.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as cooling, psu &amp; case I guess that depends on the motherboard size &amp; gpu though I guess all of those gpus are in a similar class &amp; my needs should stay the sameish. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I should consider?

Any thoughts would be great."

It's always been extremely difficult for me to make friends, since I was shy and always have panic attacks around people, even with children my own age when I was just a child. As a kid, I figured that it was OK, though, since schoolwork came easily and naturally to me. I figured that it would compensate for my near lack of social skills, but as an adult, that couldn't be farther from the truth.

While the other kids in the class were making friends and struggling with schoolwork, I had the exact opposite problem. During the summer break between every school year, I would vow to be a more outgoing and friendlier person. The early part of the school year was usually a success, but it honestly just felt like I was playing a character, and by the second or third month, I was extremely worn down, and my shitty anxious personality would storm back with a vengeance. Not only was/am I anxious, I would often scream and throw tantrums whenever I was overwhelmed, whether from too much noise, or people relentlessly bullying me. I was the victim, yet I was always the one sent to the principal's office whenever this happened.

At 11 or 12, I figured that I would be going through puberty soon, and that I would become more mature with lessening outbursts and anxiety. However, it seemed like it has only gotten worse. I was able to pass all my high school classes with flying colors, being the top 10 in my class of 300, but my crippling anxiety prevented me from participating in all the relevant teenager activities, such as joining clubs, dating, internships, etc. My college years saw my grades tumbling down like rocks; I used to be able to figure things out on my own without having to ask anybody for help, but now it became paramount to do so. Once again, though, I was too nervous and afraid to make friends or even ask a professor for help; I figured that I would just be bothering or annoying them, and didn't want to be seen at all.

Now I'm nearing 30, and with full brain development happening to most people at 25, I think it's way too late for me to change. Whenever I try, I just feel like I'm wearing a fake skin suit, with all the anxieties of the day wearing me down, until my regular shitty self is front and center again.

I don't make as much money as I should be, because of my lack of desire of a leadership position. Having people under me means more money, but it also means more pressure and anxiety. Plus, I feel bad for anybody who would have to work for a loser like me.

That is all. Thank you for listening."

\- I have no idea what to do because I cannot afford to pay for college all by myself and the only way I find money in March is to get a loan. An 80k$+ loan.

So, I have two options:

\- Defer for a year and use this year to try doing an internship in an international organization and finding all the scholarships I can, knowing that I could not find an internship and I could be rejected again from the scholarships and consequently need to pay for everything next year. 

\- Get a massive loan and go study in the US this year, knowing that I need to be lucky and find a great job just after college to pay back all the loan in a reasonable amount of time.

I recently moved to the US and am currently waiting for my work permission. While I'm not able to work or do unpaid internships before I get my green card, I'm doing my best to make the most of my time.

During my master's program in psychology, I fell in love with R and began taking online classes in data science, statistics, and R programming. I realized that data science is the field where I want to be. I am a disciplined person and love to learn, so I became very comfortable using R and various packages from tidyverse, building shiny apps, and using machine learning models. I also gained internship experience and worked with a few startups.

Due to circumstances, I had to escape my country of origin and have lived in different places before finally settling here. While waiting for my work authorization, I needed to keep my mind busy and challenge myself, so I took classes on C++ and data algorithms. Although it's not directly related to data science, it's been fun and helped me understand programming better.

I still have a few months before I can start working, and I'm trying to figure out how to best prepare myself. I want to ensure that I'm marketable when it's time to start my career. So, I'm seeking advice on what else I can learn to be more marketable.

11nwphi,33,2023-03-10,EE and CE double major,peraderas,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/11nwphi/ee_and_ce_double_major/,"Hello everyone. I am a high school senior who recently got accepted to study EE .

I am interested in areas where I can possibly design or improve computer related hardware. Working on transistors, memories, CPUs and GPUs in a company like Nvidia or AMD seems to me something that I can enjoy. On the other hand, I am also interested in signal processing and coding to some degree and I have found areas like computer vision to be interesting during my brief high school internship/ job observation.

Do you think EE can provide me with knowledge and opportunities to pursue these fields ?Or is it okay if I double major in CE along with EE although they are similar ?

I believe that my school will probably have better name recognition for an EE degree and although I am not deeply intruiged by simple circuit design, other fields of EE like solid state and control systems  look pretty enjoyable."

11nx6ah,4,2023-03-10,Should I come clean to my future job about smoking weed?,Dry_Palpitation_8287,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11nx6ah/should_i_come_clean_to_my_future_job_about/,"Context: I live in a state where cannabis is illegal. However, I recently went on a vacation to CO and smoked a lot of weed while I was there. Other than that, I only smoke once in a while with my friends. I am in college in the USA, 22M. Burner account.

I just received an email from a summer internship I was offered about having to take a drug screening before starting at my position. When I first received a call from the recruiting agent that I was being offered the job, I asked if there would be one. They responded, ""no, I don't think there will be."" I don't start until the 2nd of June, so I still have time to detox, but my employer wants me to do it soon. From my perspective, there are three things I could do:

1. Say I'm busy for the month of April and don't have enough time to make an appointment. (The testing center is an hour away, and the appointment itself will take an hour)
2. Do the drug test when they want and fake the results using a friend's or synthetic urine.
3. Email them and admit that I have smoked recently in a legal state and was told that I would not need to take a drug test. Then ask for more time to detox.

I think every option has a downside. For #1, It's not a complete lie, but it is suspicious, and I'm unsure they would be willing to wait that long. #2, I could get caught somehow. #3, they might flat-out reject me because I admitted to drug use.

I'm honestly not sure which of these options is best. I feel like #3 is the most honest and will most likely work, but it also runs the highest risk of me getting rejected from the internship. The boss at the job is kind of a hard ass, from what I hear. At the same time, I was told there wouldn't be a drug test, so I am unsure of what to do now. Any advice is appreciated."

I got a referral from a friend who works at Cisco for a software engineer intern position. The recruiter/my friends manager was really impressed by my resume and seems to like me. I got an OA a day later and I got some test cases to pass on two questions and completely bombed the last question. Am I screwed? I’m a sophomore in CS and haven’t taken DSA yet but I studied all day on leetCode before I took the test and the problems they gave were really difficult. I tried my best and they said my application can still be considered regardless of my score but I don’t know how true that is."

Fear forced it forward through the cold.  Air sucked at its core, syphoning heat away, pulling at its thought and memory, but it had to go forward.  *Curse these natives.*  The fire was burning hot.  It could still hold onto the few blades it had made, holding them near its core, near its self.  It could remember.   *They've changed, learned.*  It looked down at the surface.   The darkness of old was gone.  Motes of light now illuminated the earth.   The natives had perfected the base metals, crafting conveyers for themselves.

It flew along one of the stone lines following one of the metal contraptions, its lights leading it through the countryside.   It tried focusing ahead, its senses blurred in its primal form, but it could see numerous lights ahead.   It could feel chemicals on the wind, carbon, plastics, raw petrols.   The cold was creeping in.   It needed to eat, and so it descended back into the realms of man.

Alana stood next to her car while waiting on the pump.   She leaned, watching the liters roll the price higher while holding her smartphone to her ear.  ""No.   No.   Look Sam I don't care.   You go on with Helen.  Your shit will be on the sidewalk when you get home.   No!""  She shouted.  ""No, Sam.  I know she's there with you, I saw your post you piece of shit.   Leave me a.""   She paused.  A dim light in the sky caught her eye.   ""Is that a UFO?""  She mumbled to herself.

Alana stepped out from under the awning of the Circle K and stared at the light in the sky.   Slowly it grew, getting redder, brighter.  Then she felt the heat.    Instinct hit her and she stood still, like a deer caught in the lights of a semi, then her legs moved.

Alana ran.  Her phone fell from her hand, clattering on the concrete.   Her feet propelled her away from the gas pumps just as the fire surged around her car.    Smoke and heat flowed around her, licking at her neck.   The door to the gas station slid open with a chime as she ran inside.   The clerk watched her run past and fell down as the windows shattered.

Alana kept running, through the aisles, toward the back, pulling the freezer open, and jumping inside.    The blast wave of the erupting pumps slammed it shut behind her.

\---===\*===---

*Delicious.*  It had settled on one of the conveyors, drinking the petrol from the container in its undercarriage.   Heat surged around its core.   The seats inside burned hot, allowing it to focus on safety once more.

Underground there was a stockpile of the fluid.   The creatures had built in safety devices to prevent unchecked combustion.   It felt down the pipe in the ground, clawing at the check valves with its talons, poking holes, sucking.   Then the petrol came up freely.    Fuel, raw, unadulterated fuel erupted through its extremities.   It drew more and more fire and heat around its mind, allowing more memories to reconnect.   *They are stronger, learned far more than I could imagine.  I must work quickly.*

It clawed at the melting conveyor, pulling strips of strong metal from its frame.   It began weaving the strips around its core, melding their ends together, annealing and reheating bits of metal into the steel to strengthen it.   The cage would help hold its valuable heat in, help it forge, help it remember.   It stretched out as the canopy fell on top of it.   Its fiery fingers searched out blobs of elements, pulling them in and intermixing them as it reforged its chest.   Bit by bit it worked, piecing its glowing bones together.

Connor looked at Travis as he spoke into the microphone.  ""This thing, you said it came out of the bog.   What exactly is it?""

The rest of the firefighters gave Travis a glance as the firetruck roared down the road.

Travis forced his head back in the seat, looking up at the roof.  ""We don't know exactly what it is.   It acts alive.  It's fire.  That's all I know.""

Connor leaned forward and grabbed the older man's knee.  ""You saved my men back there.  I barely believe the fuck that thing is, but I believed you for whatever reason.   Tell me from the beginning.""

Travis looked him in the eyes, leaning forward, speaking slowly into his mic.   ""I'm a metallurgist.  I came out here to help Dr. Adams on her dig, remove something out of the bog.   One of the pieces we pulled out had dust in it.  That dust balled up, like magnets or something and became that thing.  It killed one of the interns.  I knocked it back into the bog and it went dormant again.  Government guys came out to retrieve it, and they fucked up and now its loose.""

Connor thought for a moment, leaning back toward the window looking up at the sky.  ""Anyone got eyes on it?""

Heads shook through the cab.

Travis leaned his elbows on his knees.  ""You seemed to hurt it, drove it off.   It'll want to rest somewhere, recollect itself, feel safe.  It's fire, so it'll probably want to eat.""

The firefighter to his left laughed.  ""Learn that in metal school?   Fire demons from bogs need to rest after we hose em?""

Travis rose back up, staring at him.  ""MIA training.   When downed in enemy territory you need to get your senses, find safety, shelter, hide, tool up.""  Travis' eyes widened.  ""It's going to tool up.""

""What do you mean?""  Connor asked.

""The things from the bog.  Armor, advanced composites, alloys, things I don't think DARPA has even cooked up.   It had a set of armor, that's what the dust was in.""  He looked toward the back of the truck at the firefighter who had been raked by the creature's claws.  ""It made the talons that it hit you with.   It's probably going to rebuild its armor.""

""What about just getting its old armor back?  Go back and get it from the bog?""  Connor asked.

Travis shook his head.  ""Fiona and Agent Jones have it in the box truck behind us.""

Connor nodded, thinking.  ""How you think it got caught in the bog to begin with.   Think we can lure it back maybe, trap it?""

Travis leaned back again in his seat.  ""No idea, but I think your ancestors were responsible for it.   There were several burned people there and lots of broken pots.   They put a cover stone on top of it as a warning.""

Connor smiled.   ""We'll bury it again then.""

\---===\*===---

Memories came as it worked on its structural frame.   It felt good to craft again, to feel things form in its mind's eye.   Their buildings came apart as it moved through them, except the bricks.  *Damn clay.* Plastics everywhere.  They enclosed so much in the delicious molecules.   It pulled the heat from the fires igniting all around it.   It peered over the box containing the circular bits of cut metal at the corpse of the native creature.   It had fired a propulsive weapon sending lead bits into its core.   *Interesting.*  They had improved much on the spearpoints of old.

It, He, he began remembering.   He had missed his target, falling on this cold world.   Survival, forging, working against the water.    He pulled much needed aluminum from a chest near the back wall.   *I inspired them.  They changed the world in my image.*

He looked around the confined area for more aluminum and smelled it behind sheets of heat treated silica.   He pushed on the glass, shattering it, feeling the aluminum containers full of liquids.   *Damn cold.  They have learned to hold such horrible temperatures!*   Then he saw one of the creatures inside, a female.  She was making their horrible warning sounds.   He reached in to quiet her, but the pain of the cold was too great.   He instead pulled out the cans and focused on extracting the metal to add to his spine.

\---===\*==---

Alana watched as the fire surged into the Circle K.   The room outside of the freezer glowed yellow and waves of smoke rolled past the top of the glass doors.    She watched as the fire appeared to move with intent through the aisle.   Her mouth slowly gaped open as she watched metal melt and draw into the heart of the flames.   Her eyes adjusted to the light, and she could see the bits mold into a shape in the core and a spine forming near the top and bottom of the chestlike shape.   Then the fire turned and pushed on the glass, shattering it around her.

She screamed.

\---===\*===---

The firetruck reached Kells, following the light bouncing off the clouds above and the rolling smoke in the distance.    Within a minute they reached the scorched gas station and the firefighters jumped out to start putting out the blaze.

Connor exited and was immediately shouting.  ""Anyone in there?""

A whimper came from inside.

Connor pointed.  ""Survivor!""

Travis was out and waiting as Fiona rolled up in the truck.   He ran to the window as she rolled it down.  ""It's here somewhere.  This town is going to burn if we don't stop this thing.""  He looked across at John.

Agent Jones nodded.  ""I've been on call the whole trip.  Trucks are coming up from Dublin.   The Kells fire department will be here momentarily.""  Just as if summoned, another firetruck pulled in from the east.

Firefighters hopped out and started talking with Connor.

Travis watched them as information was shared.   ""They got this.  We got this.""

John looked at Fiona.   Her face was pale as she looked at Travis.  ""They're bringing in the army.   It could devolve into a warzone.   They're planning on evacuating everywhere this thing goes.""

Travis looked at John.  ""No more secret agent bullshit then.""

John nodded.  ""Yeah, cat's out of the bag, and the bag is on fire.""

Travis looked around, above the rooftops.   Several other bright glows were bouncing on the clouds above.  ""Kells is on fire.""

\---===\*===---

The trees burst quickly, giving up their heat, fueling it as it crawled through the town.   The conveyances were pleasant as well, fuel and metals.   The creatures were using bits of platinum, palladium, and rhodium in the exhaust pipes for some reason.   *Weird.   Thankful for it though, as odd as it is.  Thank you.*  He pulled the metals quickly as he moved down the stone lines between the cast clay structures.   He watched the people run, triggering more memories.

They had been a nuisance.  *They still are.*  But he had an alliance with them before.  He remembered his home away from home, the mountain on the island.   He had raised up a people, taught them to forge metal.  *They were useful in mining.*  Their little carbon hands digging in the dirt and stone was humorous.

He had used them, trained them, taught them weapons.  They went out across the seas to bring him metal for his body.   He had gotten his sight back to nominal, his hearing tuned, his senses sharp as well as his claws.   His people had been a boon to him, and then his mountain erupted.   The poor apes burned in droves, and it wasn't even his fault.

He left his ruined home to seek a new people to worship him, mine for him.   He remembered the storm.  *Curse this rain soaked world.*  He was weakened, pushed down to this land, this island.   The people here got mad he ate one of their trees, hitting him with sticks.  *Savages.*   Then they figured out his hydrophobia.   *They are smart.*   He looked around and attacked another petrol containment facility, pulling up more heat and metal for his body.

He had arms and crude manipulators now.    He had linkages he could control now in his neck and he formed circles to aid in focusing his optics.   *I hate being blind.   Sucks getting old.*  He shaped the two eyes in place looked around.   *Ow wow.   These little bastards have made a lot.*

He reached out and grabbed a few more exhaust pipes from nearby conveyances and continued moving down the stone road.

\---===\*===---

Travis hopped back in with Fiona and John and drove deeper into town.

John was busy with his phone, texting.  He looked over at Fiona.  ""Helicopter over the north end of town.   Entity sighted.   Police are evacuating homes in its path.""   John waited a moment, staring at his phone.  ""Travis check this out.""  He held up the phone for him to see.

Travis looked at the image.  The creature had a formed skeleton inside the flaming exterior.   ""It's rebuilding its armor.""

John nodded and looked back at his phone.  ""We got inbound fighters going to level the thing once its in a clear area.""

Travis stared at him.  ""You're going to shoot a fire monster, with fire.""

""Thermobaric bombs.""  John looked up at him.   ""Concussive wave should suck the oxygen out of the air, suffocating it momentarily.

Travis sighed.  ""Stop them.  Stop that.  Those weapons use high fuel high heat to cause that concussive wave.  That's like trying to drown a shark while its attacking you.   Fucking stupid.""

John looked back down.  ""Um.  Fighters are already inbound and waiting targeting.   I don't.  Shit, they're not going to hear the concern in time.  Shit. Fuck.""

Fiona slowed the truck.  ""We're chasing this thing into a warzone.""  She pulled over next to the ruined Emo station.  ""This is beyond us.   Let them handle it and lets go back to the bog.""

Travis looked at her for a moment and then nodded.  ""You're right.""   He pushed John.  ""Let me out.""

Fiona glared at him.  ""What?  The fuck you doing?""

Travis looked at her as he pushed the door open.  ""The military are doing what they do.   They get hard for shit like this.   You guys go back.  I'm going to get something out of the back and keep going.""

""What are you going to do?  You keep going you're going to end up a smear on a wall, or charred like Rodney.""  She said.

Travis disappeared behind the truck.   She could hear him roll up the back door, and then slam it back down.    He walked back up beside her window holding the four fingered gauntlet.   ""It makes things, ridiculously impossible metalworks.   It isn't stupid.   If it's not stupid then maybe we can communicate with it.""

John looked at him, blinking after a moment.  ""You're going to talk to a fire monster.""

Travis held the gauntlet tight in his arm and patted his right pocket with his free hand.  ""Yeah.   I guess I'm going to try and talk to a fire monster.""

Fiona groaned.  ""Get in idiot.""

Travis shook his head.  ""It's too dangerous.   You guys get back to the bog.""

John looked over at the burning station and then back at Travis.  ""Yeah, dangerous.  Come on, get back in.""

Travis smiled and hopped back into the truck.

\---===\*===---

He sensed the metal inside the building.   He burst through the heat treated clay and stopped in front of a heavy alloy door.   *Marvelous.*  He sucked in heat from the burning pieces of plastic and paper and focused on the large door.   Metal poured from it and he started shaping it around his body.   *Ah legs again.   It is nice to not have to rely on my heat to move.*   He annealed the new bones with wave after wave of alternating temperatures.

Inside the chamber were other baubles, including several ingots of gold.   *I needed this!*  He pulled the metal into strands, mixing it with iron, copper, aluminum, bits of platinum, technetium, and niobium.   He molded the alloy around the oculus component, adding to his sensory array.   *I'll be back to fully functional in days rather than decades.  They have greatly improved.   I may even be able to rebuild my own conveyance.*

His sensory suite allowed him to hear one of the creature's vehicles pull up outside.   Noises, their noises, vocalizations could be heard over his own fires.   He turned and looked out the ruined hole he had created.

One of the primates stood at the entry.   It was vocalizing.   Vocalizing at him.   *Stupid monkey.*  He watched with his corrected eyes as the creature produced a gauntlet, his gauntlet.   *The creature from my tomb!*   He stepped forward and the native stepped back from his heat.

*Oh yes, I burn them.*   He pulled his flames in toward his core, holding it within the metal.    He watched as other primates arrived outside with more of those projectile launchers.   *Idiots.  What are those going to do.*  He focused on the primate with his gauntlet.   He extended out his crude rough form hand, waiting for it to hand it over.

The creature handed his gauntlet back.  He took it and slid it onto his right hand, flexing with his flames.   *Feels good.  Wait, he has the rest of my armor!  You have the rest of my armor!*

He looked back at the creature, pointing then pointing at his own chest.  *Give me my body!*

The man looked at him, slowly pulling something from its clothing.   He watched as the creature manipulated a tool in its hand and then unfolded it.

It was a knife, basic, wait, not basic.  It was titanium, forged exquisitely well.   The creature presented it.   He took it up in his gauntlet, admiring it.   He then looked at the primate.  It was pointing at the knife and then back at itself.   *You made this?   A primate made something of this caliber?   Impressive.  You can't hear me.   Still, I wish you could.  This is revolutionary.*

He lowered himself down closer to the ground and turned the blade over in his hands.   *I never thought your kind would be worthy.   This, this changes things.*

He turned back to the vault and began heating up the room again.   The primates had to step back as he drew in more metal.    He sculpted the pieces pulled into a rod, heating it and mixing the metals in proper portions.   He then turned back to the creatures and stabbed the rod into the ground in front of the novice metallurgist.   He then pulled the heat out of the rod, letting it cool appropriately.

\---===\*===---

Travis had his hands at his sides. ""Keep calm!  Do not fire!   It's not acting aggressive.""

One of the shoulders shouted.  ""What the hell is that?  That stick could be a weapon.""

Travis shook his head.  ""I don't think it is.""

The dragon sat in the bank staring at him.

He pointed at the rod.  ""What is that?  You going to do something?""

The creature's metal body glimmered from the flames inside of it.   Purples, silvers, gold, and greens rolled over the metal in waves as heat and light pulsed in its core.   The rod reverberated.  ""What is that?  You going to do something?""

Travis understood.  He touched his own chest.  ""My name is Professor Travis Hawkins.  You can refer to me as Travis.  Do you understand?""

The dragon stared at him for a moment.  Then the rod echoed back.  ""You are Travis.   I understand.  My name is Professor.""  Then the dragon roared, releasing smoke and a burst of flame.

Travis smiled.  ""Nice to meet you!""  He then roared, miming the dragons' name.   ""I don't know if I said that right.""

The creature shifted inside the ruins of the bank.   ""It is nice to meet you.   I do not know to refer said.""

Travis blinked in understanding.   ""Jones!   Linguists.  Tell the general we need linguists here.   Also get I dunno, oil or something.   Tell him we have open dialogue!.""

Agent Jones laughed and began texting.

The soldiers kept their weapons aimed and ready."

So I'm 22M it's bout to have been a year since I graduated college and i just wanna find a job and move out already. I've got a lot of skills like video editing, production etc and my resume is crazy, it's just it's so hard to even know where to look for jobs. and the ones I do find barely ever get back to me. 

Right now im an intern at a record label in NYC and im kinda just doing errand boy type shit but I'm hoping to work my way up to actually being able to create stuff for them and help out more. It's just hard to really contribute anything when I'm only in the office for one day. My managers never ask me to do anything on my remote days. Even when I hit them up they just handle everything on their own. 

I do direct music videos and edit videos for people as a freelance thing,, but I haven't been getting many clients lately. It's really hard to meet people i can work with bc I live in the middle of nowhere south Jersey,, like the pine barrens area. In order to find any connections in my field I NEED to be in the city and I have no idea how I could make that happen. 

I know there's Facebook groups and sites like places4students.com. But I'm just confused about how I'd go about getting a job in the city before I live there. Would they give me time to relocate or do I need to just be there? And is there any way I can sublet with somebody and then just like,, find some bullshit job to pay the bills AFTER i move out? Idk bro I just can't do this suburb shit anymore I need to be around people,, but I have no idea how I'd go about doing that. I see some of my friends that done made it out they mama house and everything and ,, I feel so behind the curve compared to them. I don't even have any idea where to START getting my shit together. But then I think and realize they were born up north near where all the opportunities are. When I realize that, it makes me be a little easier on myself but then scares me at the same time bc I feel like I'll never make it out of here.

Any advice would be appreciated ,, thank u 🥺🥺🥺"

11o47uo,2,2023-03-10,Should I go back to in person school for my senior year of highschool or continue virtual?,sadphrogs,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11o47uo/should_i_go_back_to_in_person_school_for_my/,"So a bit of context on what I [F16] currently do. I do virtual for my normal/core classes, and do a paid engineering internship in the afternoon. I used to go into for pre-engineering at the career/technical school for half days but my teacher recommended me for an internship which is really cool since I’m a junior and this is usually only for seniors. This was also the only pre-engineering internship opportunity he’s gotten (meaning out of everybody in all the classes, he chose me, a junior to do it). So of course I took the opportunity and it’s been super nice so far. Really enjoy it.

Now here comes my problem. I get an email saying “Choose what you do next year” and I go into crisis mode. I have pretty bad anxiety if Im honest. The reason I choose to do virtual is because it became so bad after covid. Im a pretty introverted person as well and I don’t really care for social stuff 98% of the time, but that 2% is making me question everything. Im so scared that Im gonna miss out on something big by missing high school. Some people say it was “the best years of their lives” while others say it was the worst. Every time I’ve stepped foot into the main school, which has only been a handful of times, I get really panicked and anxious. My school is good to some people, but it’s also got a bad atmosphere for others.

There’s also the fear that my internship might be mixed up a bit if I go into actual school and that is definitely my top priority. They said they want to keep me for as long as possible, so I can do it for next year as well. I also fear my grades might drop slightly since I’ve adjusted more to virtual now. My parents and teachers have all said I’m going down a pretty good path with what I’m doing now, but I’m scared I’m making a huge mistake.

There’s quite a few other fears but I’ll stop here to keep it short. Do you guys think it would be better to go back to in person or continue on the internship/virtual path?


TLDR- I’m 16F junior in HS. I do virtual, have an engineering internship, and have anxiety and am introvert. I am nervous that I am missing something in high school though and am wondering if it’s worth doing my final year."

I have worked two jobs  since graduating. Both being in the metals industry (first steel, now copper). I live in Pittsburgh, PA and have a fiancé who works as a nurse and just got a promotion. She loves her job and floor she's on. We both have family and friends in the area, so sadly moving away from Pittsburgh isn't in the cards. Especially with the wedding coming soon and her getting the promotion. 

When I first looked after graduating, it seemed like chemical engineering jobs were very limited on this side of the state. Only options I saw that would take entry level engineers with 0-3 years of experience were mostly jobs in the metals industry. 

I have realized over the past two years I really don't like the metals industry. I like to dress up nice for work like I did for my co-op, but I definitely could not in these roles. The cleanliness, safety, and health hazards (especially with my current employer) are having me wanting to get out of this industry as soon as I can.

I had a process engineering co-op with a mobile gas detector manufacturer (weird industry for a chemE to work, but it was the only place I could get last minute when I knew I had to fill a semester that I would've had to do part-time). I worked it that fall semester, and was asked to stay and work part-time while taking some classes in the following spring semester. Sadly, covid cut that short. The company had to cut all of their part-time employees, which included co-ops and interns.

Ever since then I have compared my other internship and my jobs I have work to my co-op. Even some job descriptions I have been critical of looking for similarities to my co-op. This being said, I really want to get back into some kind of electronics manufacturing. Plus it seems like there's a bunch of opportunities for this industry in Pittsburgh. 

(I want to bring up that I have experience in both process and quality engineering. I have done a lot of work in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma at my co-op and current position. I would like to find a role that involves these in the electronic industry.)

What certifications do you suggest getting to help get back into the electronics industry? Is there any other suggestions that will help? I really don't want to go back to school.

I really appreciate any feedback!"

11o7w0w,1,2023-03-10,federal background process concerns,plain4trax,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11o7w0w/federal_background_process_concerns/,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. 

I was offered a seasonal internship position that is hosted by several organizations, one of these is NPS. I was selected over 90 applicants and would be a benefit to the program, as it would greatly benefit me. This requires multiple background checks due to multiple orgs and one of these is a Federal eQIP/public trust clearance. 

I've not been particularly wanting to work in fed gov, in part due to the difficulties I hear with getting past the application system and rigorous beaurocracy that never lets up. I'm a graduating master's student hoping to work with more state/local or nonprofit orgs. I've held several academic, research, and organizational roles in addition to school, but I'm trying to break full-time into the environmental field now that I'm graduating.

The issue is I have an arrest and dismissed misdemeanor (due to lack of evidence) for domestic violence. I'll provide more details at end of post for those interested, but, trust me, I know how bad it sounds... I am not a violent person, most would describe me as quite calm and easy to work with. I have never had an encounter with the law before or after (4 years ago). 

None of my previous roles have ever asked about this. Its never affected my work or personal performance, even when the case was going on. It's not shown up on background checks to my knowledge. I filed a petition to destroy my fingerprints, which was approved and completed to my knowledge. On most applications, I do not have to disclose this because they usually only care about convictions and felony-level crimes. Less often, I encounter positions asking about arrests, but I admit I avoid applying to those. 

This incident that happened is not a defining characteristic of my life story and I do not want to be put into situations where I have to relive it and justify it to people. I have worked very hard to develop past that time of my life. The type of charge I received immediately brings a prejudice and I don't think all my professional efforts should be discounted because this happened.

The federal forms for this process do not care if my case was dismissed or expunged, because they can require I report all this info from 5-7 years back. My case is only 4 years out.

On a much lesser note, I partake in state-legal medical marijuana and have for several years to relieve a back injury. 

They would start this background process when I accept the temporary offer. Only about a month before... I would have to move for this position and it is a risk because I don't know if I would pass the check and don't know if they will revoke the offer based on this alone. Additionally, I do not want to form any bad associations since I am so early in my career.

**Based on the facts, my questions for those who have gone through the fed process are:**

-How likely would this indiscretion prevent me from passing this type of background check?

-If I am unlikely to pass, is it better to recind myself or risk having a possible denial? I worry about the possibility of applying to federal positions in the future with a previous denial

 -Would it be advisable to wait the 2-4 years before pursuing any more fed positions to avoid including this? As I mentioned, I am interested in workiny with other types of organizations, but I would like to keep the federal possibility open.

#**I'll also take any advice you can offer! On the background process, or what you would do if you were me. And/or how to navigate this and potential questions concerning this with employers in the future.**



More info on my case: Also long story short, my mother held a knife to my stomach. I pushed her away in self defense. I consider myself a decent person and was raised to tell the truth (to a fault). When I told police my version of events, they laughed at the implication of my mother with a knife and arrested me when I got to the part of pushing her away in my own defense. As mentioned above, there was no evidence either occurred, I lawyered up and the case was dismissed. But, as you can imagine, this is not an easy thing to live through again or explain to people. Most people have loving mothers and could not imagine theirs doing something like that to them, so they assume I'm the instigator."

I (22M) have been in college since I graduated high school. Diagnosed at 5 and I’ve been on meds basically my whole life. I’m smart but I have never had an easy time in college. Struggling with substance abuse and over partying my first year, getting sent home for the pandemic my second year, and then just barely getting by in the third and fourth year because of awful mental health. My poor grades and everything forced me to stay an extra year and I was so motivated to just get out once that happened. 
Then, my first semester of my 5th year - I fail 2 classes (they were both stupid elective fillers I never got interested in). This was bad because it put me on academic probation which meant I had 1 semester to do really well or I’d lose my scholarship. Still, I was on track to get out in May so I took my required classes and was doing great. I had a plan to get an internship in the summer after I walked at graduation because I need one to officially graduate. 
Now, in the “last semester” of my last year and I’m doing really well, I find out I had to have done my internship before graduation to be able to walk. So I take on an internship at my school for the marketing team, along with doing classes. 
That’s where it went downhill. They said I had till May 1 (so about 10 weeks) to get my 200 hours in. I start putting in the time while trying to manage schoolwork as well. I start getting stressed because it’s really tough for me to do that especially with such an unstructured “internship”. A few weeks later and I’m just unable to focus on anything. I forgot to hand in a midterm worth 25% of my final grade, I’m behind on intern hours by like 30 hours, and I’m missing assignments because I just never did them. I scheduled out my whole day today and ended up staying in bed the whole day with no motivation to do my stuff. 
If I can’t graduate in May then I have to switch colleges or drop out due to the loss of my scholarship after this semester.  

It seems so hopeless now and my family just keeps telling me to push through, “it’s only another 2 months”
I’m just so stressed and upset. I lost all my drive from the beginning of the semester, and really just need some motivation or advice."

However, it's been awhile since inflation has been a big issue for many countries, the ever increasing layoffs especially in tech and uncertain future economy, are there any stronger reasons to apply for and accept government scholarships like (PSC, SG:D, DSTA, CSIT, Defence Merit, SAF, etc) compared to bond free ones like scholarships offered by the school? For those who have experience or know anything about the current job market, are tech jobs getting harder and harder to get especially in recent months and what are the current opinions on the job market in the near future?  


Personally, I think that the world will go back to the days where it is not ""free"" money. In recent years, salaries just kept going up and up and up and especially for those in the tech sector. Salaries were crazy and it was easy to get jobs because of the high demand. But with the increasing intake of tech programmes like CS in universities and the uncertain economy and future, I am considering to apply for government scholarships. I am not someone who is really into civil service, and based of my tech internship in a stat board, I find it boring and slow but it's manageable. What are some advice do you guys have?"

I'm a 24 yr old b.tech IT 8th semester student . Last year I got a FTE+6 months offer at paytm . My intern has started in January this year and so far everything is going good.
Although paytm is not one of the MAANG company and its salary is not at par with some other companies that came to my college but it still is a decent pay.
To focus on what I should do next I told myself that I should devote myself and develop certain skills which would help me to switch to higher paying companies and by doin so I could gain experience in backend. 
But now my family members have started asking me what am I going to do in future . Basically they do not agree with my plan that I stated above.
They want me to prepare for MBA and want me to aim for IIM next.When I asked them why they want it , the reason they gave me was ofcourse higher pay and promotion and also that a recruiter would not accept a bachelor's graduate if a MBA+btech grad is also applying. 
Basically doing MBA will give me edge over others. Although I somewhat agree with this but I've seen many people who did not start good in their corporate life but after working hard for an year or 2 landed good packages in good companies like CRED and Microsoft and Google so I was going to do the same but now I'm really confused as to what to do next.
My cgpa is only 7.42 with 89.6% (class 10) and 92.6% (class 12) (just mentioning it).
What are your views on this ?"

I am in my first year as a CS-Econ major and had no idea, that you have to apply so early in the school year to get summer internships. Do you guys think that there are still companies looking for summer interns or do I just have to wait for next year? I am living in Denmark so not looking to go to US for internship but would go all around Europe for one

I am a 26-year-old Frenchman with a master's degree in accounting/finance/tax law/management.

After spending 5 years (I include 2 internships of 6 months each) working in accounting firms as an auditor, I decided to change paths and work in a company (and not a firm).

I have just received a job offer as a Senior Financial Analyst working for the FP&amp;A department for a large international company replacing a person, for about 6 months.

The fact that it is a fixed-term contract does not bother me (I live in France, an indemnity of 10% due salary must be paid in this kind of situation).

I would like to have your opinion on your feelings about the FP&amp;A service in relation to the audit, in particular the skills necessary to succeed in this type of position. I am also interested because at the end of this contract, it is not impossible that I will be hired by this company after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I made mistakes, I hope my English is not so bad.

Thank you !"

I got accepted into UMBC MSCS  program. I'm an international student and am currently working as Senior Software Engineer. How is CS graduate course at UMBC, in terms of course curriculum, career fair, and assistantship opportunities? I'm more inclined towards UMBC as it comparatively has a lower batch size and better assistantship opportunities, along with a decent location, considering internship opportunities as well. 

I've got admitted to better ranked colleges, SUNY, Buffalo, and UTAH both MSCS and is really confused about which one should I go for. Cost is a major deciding factor for me and my end goal is to get a good job."

Situation: currently doing a second work term at a relatively good company. They offered me an extension to stay for a 8 month work term (4 month on top of current). I was pleased at first but then I realized it might be a non-blessing in disguise.    


Problem: There is only a limited number of work-terms in my program (5). If I decided to do an 8 month term, I will only have 2 left (one in fall and other in summer). If I were to go back to school for the spring-summer, I will have three terms remaining (one in fall, and the last 2 *both* in summer). Now onto the real problem, I really want to do an internship at a FAANG -level company and I think I have a shot at it. And for some reason, I'm convinced that my chances at securing such position will dramatically increase if I were to apply for a summer term.     


Essentially it's this: good guaranteed opportunity costing me one summer term chance at Big Tech v.s  passing on a good opportunity for the reward of one extra summer chance at Big Tech.    


At this point, I'm so deep into hypotheticals that I'm not sure how I can be helped but that's basically it.    


Some pertinent questions:  
1) Are most big tech positions in the states? This is important because it would be difficult to get visa due to my nationality?  
2)Do I still have a chance at big tech after coop or do they dramatically decrease once you settle in a fresh grad  full-time position after school?"

I like this security and the internship will look great on my CV but I will be taking out another year. 

My friends have told me that I will be missing another year, and that I can be earning actual graduate salaries at the end of university a year earlier if I just go univeristy and give up the internship. I have also been told that if I can get this internship, I can probably get another one.

How much of a difference will my university make to my overall goal of working at a big tech company.

Will it hinder me still if I have this internship under my belt?

Out of those OAs, I got ghosted after getting a perfect score in them. I have 2 previous internships, and when I was searching for those I was getting multiple interviews pretty easily. Is it really that different right now?

I'm from Canada so I need sponsorship for US-based positions so that may be a big factor for those, but why can't I get interviews for even small companies/startups here in Canada that don't even look that promising? 

There have been so many positions that I felt VERY confident when applying to them because I knew the tech stack very well because of my previous experiences and projects. But then I got ghosted.

I'm on that Leetcode grind, and actually feel pretty confident in my ability to do well in an interview, but what good is that if I can't even get a single interview? 

It almost feels like someone logged onto my email and set up a rule to block any emails with the word ""interview"" anywhere in them (I actually checked this). I seriously don't know what I'm doing wrong."

I am currently a college dropout at the university level, I attended Texas A&amp;M and Blinn community college I got my associate's while at community college in Liberal arts. I am looking to acquire an IT job because those were most of my coursework classes. 

Since dropping out last year, I studied and took my A+ and Net+ certifications, I Passed both tests should I look to get additional certifications? (CCNA?, AWS?). I pick up tech-related subjects very quickly, I can program in C++, Python, and RobotFramework, and know the basics of Linux and Unix OS. I know how to subnet and set up networks, and understand ports and API requests. Have experience using GitHub and other community resource platforms.

What should my main focus be? 

Continue to learn to program and take boot camps to apply for software engineering jobs or go the IT route. What certs do you recommend? Ideally, my job could be remote as I like the idea of not always communicating with an office building but I know IT jobs often have to be on-premise.

Let me know your thoughts on this, what certs to look for, and what knowledge areas to branch out on.  

Prior Work experience:

Software Engineering Internship (Coop during school) 

IT Internship - Took a mandatory internship during my senior year of high school, and was taught the basics of network setup and configuration. Learned to rewire 110 punch-down blocks, and crimp and create ethernet cabling. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR -- I dropped out of university, Got A+ net+, I've applied to 50+ jobs and only gotten 2 interviews so is there something I can do to make my self stand out as a good candidate. Finally cert/ knowledge recommendations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for Reading,

Best Regards,

11ov0pi,1,2023-03-11,Benefits of and when to transfer to a better College,Purple_Guarantee2906,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11ov0pi/benefits_of_and_when_to_transfer_to_a_better/,"So I am a freshman currently at a public university, ranked ~#183 for computer science in US. I had gotten into a lot higher ranking private colleges in HS but at the time didn’t think the $60k/year price tag would be worth it. 

I luckily got a software developer internship in fintech, but I wouldn’t give my college credit since I self studied practically everything, like we’re just about to learn about BST. And this wasn’t through my college’s connections either, I got it by applying to practically any internship that had the word software in it. 

I still ended up getting an internship as a freshman, which still sounds surreal to me when I say it. So my schools name isn’t “holding me back” but it also isn’t helping. 

Should I stay at my college or try to transfer into a better college, like t15? Since I am seeing that for quant firms, they only consider people from top universities. I am not sure if I even sure if I want to go into quant, but I don’t want it to be impossible due to my colleges name."
11ovw1l,1,2023-03-11,Sterling Background Check Fail?,Jen024,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ovw1l/sterling_background_check_fail/,"I recently graduated from college and was offered a job at a hospital. I found out that they use Sterling  background check and Sterling sent me a link to fill out my past employment information for verification. Thing is, my very first job was at a cafe shop and my second job was at another hospital working as an intern, both were very short-term ranging from a week to a month. I left my previous jobs due it either not relating to my major or schedule conflicts with my school. For the cafe job because it was such short term, I did not even bother going back to get my paycheck. Now, Sterling is asking me to provide proof with W2 and paystubs or references from managers. Due to my short employment period (technically I was still in training when I quit my past jobs) I highly doubt my past managers remember me or will give me a glowing reference to Sterling. However, my resume would have been a blank slate if I didn't put them as work experience because all I have is my clinical experience. I was really excited to graduate and get my first full-time job at a hospital, but now I am worried that my offer will get rescinded because I did not pass employment background check with Sterling. 

I'm not sure what to do now, wait until Sterling finishes my background check, talk to HR at the hospital, or start searching for another job? Although there is no guarantee they will not use Sterling as well or hire me because I will most likely leave out my short employment jobs in my next resume."

I'm a fairly recent engineering graduate with over 3 years of work experience (1.5 if you don't consider internships).

My current options are to (1) look for a new job right now, (2) quit, finish my masters, and then apply for a new job, or (3) take the abuse/extra work that gets piled onto me by nearly everyone I work with and apply elsewhere when I do get my master's.

I've been getting a lot of praises from my direct supervisor/chain of command (got the highest possible score on the annual performance eval), but those from other teams/departments always push their workload onto my team full of fairly new hires/graduates (think of engineers who just finished undergrad &lt;3-4 years ago and half the team being at the company for around or less than a year). Our manager does a good enough job of pushing back, but it just came to light that higher ups don't care and expect us to do more and more for others. 

It was bearable initially, but as of late, I'm seeing myself just burned out. Having to stay 10+ hours, bring my laptop home to do reports others should be doing instead, and neglecting school/life/exercise/etc.

I guess this could be a typical thing expected out of salary workers, especially in a manufacturing setting, but I just feel like it could be better elsewhere or if I can really just take a break and come back to work elsewhere after my master's.

Would it be difficult for me to get a new job after taking a couple months off to finish my master's? Thank you."

I’m a CompSci major and so many of my peers are doing well with A’s and B’s, program often and in their free time, are creating side-projects, have jobs in IT, and are even looking for internships. 

Me on the other hand? I can barely keep myself together. My grades are mediocre-to-bad, my GPA is mediocre, I haven’t programmed or coded in a year, and I’m also struggling with chronic mental illness while simultaneously struggling to maintain myself. 

I just feel like I don’t belong in college. I feel like I’m unworthy in comparison to everyone else. I only chose CompSci because I was a directionless 18 y/o who had no clue what do and was forced to make a quick decision because I was graduating from HS and was forced to decide between the work force and college. I never had passion for what I’m doing. I only chose it because I had no where else to go. 

Now here I am two years later. I have no idea what’s going to happen after college assuming I don’t drop/flunk out of college. Like I said previously, my GPA is mediocre, I have no side projects/internships to my name, and I am not even sure if I have the intellectual capabilities for this field.

The worst part is that I know I won’t do anything about it. I won’t fix my situation in life or even myself. I have been complaining about the same things for years and here I am years later complaining while doing absolutely nothing to fix things.

I’m just a permanently fucked up mess of a person, as well as a hypocrite. Rant over."

I'm writing this post so some people can hopefully guide me in the right direction so I can ensure I do good on my first ever technical interview. After countless companies rejecting me(as I'm sure 99% of you can relate), this is the one I cannot fail. So, the internship I have been going through is f5's 'cybersecurity operations and product management apprenticeship' . Based on the job description maybe one can gauge what interview questions should look like.

To add some more context, I asked my recruiter what to expect and she said 'I still have not heard of what they will be testing you on but I know it will be pretty basic. Just to see what you do know about Python and your problem solving skills and how receptive you are to advice and feedback.' I also asked the manager what to expect and he said, 'We are still deciding what coding challenges we plan to use, so I don't have a firm answer yet. But I expect that there will be 2-3 challenges, with the first one easy (a ""warmup"") and subsequent ones will be more difficult. Nothing too crazy though, the questions should be appropriate for a CSC student with 1-3 years of classes.'

I am a soon-to-be college graduate from the midwestern US. I am graduating this May from a top 50 university with a BS in Financial Mathematics and a minor in Computer &amp; Information Science.

Initially, I wanted to gain the skills to become an actuary through my degree, but I've decided instead to aim towards becoming a software engineer, preferably in a role where advanced math is applicable (back-end, AI/ML, game design, data science).

Unfortunately, I did not do well academically throughout my schooling due to a multitude of things, so I'll be graduating with about a 2.3 cumulative GPA.

In addition, I do not have any completed programming projects to showcase to future employers. I do not have a portfolio page for them either. However, I do have a GitHub, and I know roughly how to use it.

Lastly, I do not have any internship or full-time professional experience related to either financial mathematics or computer science at this time.

My coursework related to mathematics included: 
* multivariate calculus, 
* linear algebra, 
* differential equations, 
* probability,
* scientific computing, 
* financial economics, and 
* derivative pricing.

My coursework related to computer science included:
* introduction to programming in Java,
* data structures in Java,
* discrete mathematics,
* data structures &amp; algorithms,
* computer systems, and
* information security.

Given my situation, I am wondering where I should focus my energy in the coming months. My concerns are:
* if you were someone with little academic success (but a STEM degree), no programming projects, no professional experience, but some OOP knowledge with Java, would you apply to jobs or build your portfolio?
* is completing an internship necessary before finding a full-time software development position?
* should I branch out to learn new technologies, such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and build additional projects with those? How far down the Node/React/SQL pipeline should I go?

My thought was to begin The Odin Project to learn to build web applications through the ""Full Stack JavaScript"" track, build and showcase my own projects afterwards, then practice for interviews on LeetCode while applying to jobs, but I'd still be months away after graduation from being hired.

I still need to pay rent. Should I apply for more ""finance-related"" jobs (given my major) and work towards an actual development role with projects, etc. in the meantime?

What do y'all think?"

There's a great coding and development culture here at IIIT's , and students are really hardworking,  however still very few students were selected in google/Microsoft/Apple etc during placements. Whereas my friends from undergrad, who went to US for their Masters are all working for top product companies, almost everyone has an Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Intel etc on their CV's. 

And while I agree people can change a lot in 2 years, I know most of them didn't have a clue about Computer Science or Coding, no development projects or any internships. We just bunked classes and studied 1 day before exams to get our degrees.

So really wanted to know from experienced devs out here, is cracking these jobs abroad easier than in india?? Does the Masters from abroad really transform average student into a skilled and knowledgeable software professional?? Or is it just me being jealous of seeing my friends doing better than me??"

11pf688,10,2023-03-12,I’m getting destroyed in my new role. What should I do?,thotherside_10,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11pf688/im_getting_destroyed_in_my_new_role_what_should_i/,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m probably the only employee in my whole IT department who doesn’t have any IT education whatsoever. I was first hired at the company as an IT intern (after getting my Business Mgmt degree), then did pretty well, so the company kept me as a contractor for the past 7.5 years. During this time, I was super burned out and depressed so I learned as little as possible, outside of what I needed to do my specific job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to how I got in this situation - It all started when I was given an important client in Dec. 2021. I told my boss and the client I don’t understand why I was given this role because it’s not my expertise at all and I don’t know if I can do well. They said “oh your director gave you this role for a reason so I’m sure you’ll be fine.” HA. Ok, sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things went well at first, but about 2-3 months in, things went downhill because I didn’t have a clue what the client was talking about. Data files, prototypes, APIs, all that stuff had me so confused and looking like a fool trying to give them the data and technology they needed. There were two data engineers on the project but I was to act as the main poc and “project manager” even though I had zero experience. I had been a support analyst the entire time at the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the project took 6 months to get what the client needed, they said, “we’ll work with this person on your team as our main poc and if anything big comes up, we’ll loop you in.” They didn’t want to work with me after that! I was glad that the project was finally over, but felt very embarrassed and defeated by the whole ordeal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my boss and my director only got the positive end of the story of me working with that new client(from someone else, not me) so they thought things went smoothly and I was a good fit for keeping the client. I didn’t have the courage to tell my boss and director that I’m not the right fit or how things really went with the client. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, my department director strongly encouraged me to apply for an internal Business Analyst position. I knew it wasn’t the right fit for me but I was curious about how much money they’d offer, so I stupidly applied and then felt like I was in too deep to say no, so I accepted the job. BIG MISTAKE. 

&amp;#x200B;

6 months into the Business Analyst job, I’m again feeling thoroughly incompetent and I’m one mental health breakdown away from quitting without another job lined up or checking myself into a mental institution. It’s BAD. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m constantly on multiple projects at a time with very educated and knowledgeable people and I’m over here looking like a clown making myself and my project manager look bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea where to go from here. They hired me because they’re short staffed. But everyday I stress about this job from the time I waste up until I go to sleep, even when I’m off the clock. I have fallen into a very intense clinically depressed episode and I fear what I’ll become if I keep this job. I haven’t showered in a week or groomed my hair in a month, and I avoid my friends and family.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, the pay is great (low 6 figures)which is still barely enough to survive in this HCOL area in this economy, especially with me supplementing other people’s income in my household. If I quit, I’ll never be able to: 1) get hired in the same field; 2) get paid this much money again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need some straight advice. What should I do?

I’m on antidepressants, but they’re not helping."

English Teacher:

She also pretty close to me and help me get the summer job at Starbucks since I got really into coffee/latte art in junior year. Given my relationship with her maybe a 8-9/10

&amp;#x200B;

Math Teacher/NHS advisor:

I talk to her occasionally but not often since she's always busy doing stuff for the school. Really chill and was so glad I asked her to write my rec letter. Also prob 8-9/10

I honestly don't know how to rank these

**Interviews**

**HAVARD WHERE IS MY DAMN INTERVIEW**

MIT (10/10) Bro we just clicked. He loved the stories I told him about cyber and some of the projects I working on. Legit said like that's type of stuff an MIT student would do. Also talked about sports, and family things. Went for like an hour

Princeton (8/10) She basically asked like who I was, some hobbies I had, and that was it. Then, she turned it on me to ask some questions. I had some prepared but at some point, it felt like I was interviewing her now. I asked way more questions than she did to me. Still went really well. Tried tie in facts about myself in my questions to her to make it seem like I was a good fit for Princeton. She told me that she really hopes I get in and to contact her if I have any more questions. Went for like 40 mins.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

*I have never experienced more pain in my life than the week of writing essays, but I think the majority of my essays were really good. Not going to talk to much about them since a lot of them are personal but I'd give them a 8/10. MIT, however, sucked balls. It was my last application and I was so burned out and I don't even think I would like MIT. I wrote my MIT supp in like 2 hours, let my dad check it, and submitted. MIT is like 5/10.* 

All of my essays were done either the day of or like a week before.

I stuck with the same topic for my Common App for RD schools but rewrote it a lot to. After getting rejected from Stanford, I found some major flaws that I needed to fix.

During my internship I did pretty much nothing. Once I joined as an full time employee I started just doing basic things at work. Small bugs were fixed and I added a small part of a feature mostly in frontend. We use company specific front end product which is of no use once I step out. Now that I look around my experience seems to be of no value. I haven't even implemented an API in the backend( we use Java and jax-rs jersey). I am not confident in Java and haven't upskilled myself since college days. My resume is worse than it was before. I don't know what is happening. I want to leave but my team is one of the best teams that I have seen. I have no complaints whatsoever other than the fact that I don't feel like I am working enough. I spoke to my manager/team lead and he said I am doing well for my experience. 

Do you think it's time for me to change my job? 
I want to continue as a Java developer so how do I start upskilling myself? 
I feel I am losing on a lot of things and everyone at my age/experience is already much better.. Please guide me."

To present myself, This year I changed major from Math to CS. I started to learn programmming only at this moment, it was very hard at first, but now I am getting better at it.

Also, I live in France and in my school we have ""Alternance"", it is like an Internship, I have 1 week of class and then 2 week at work. It also helped me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm now stuck between tutorial hell and trying personnal project but I then get lost and give up. 

I currently folow two courses on Udemy (JavaScript, React), at work I use Php / Symfony.

What is the road from now on, do I need to keep watching courses or do I need to do more personnal project's (or both) ?

11pk4ss,66,2023-03-12,I’m stuck in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. I think something nightmarish happened here.,cfalnevermore,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11pk4ss/im_stuck_in_the_neonatal_intensive_care_unit_i/,"We’re on week three. I was losing my mind before week one was over. Neonatal intensive care unit. The NICU. It’s where they send babies who aren’t quite ready to go home for one reason or another. Birthing complications, abnormalities, premature births (they call them the “preemies”), or whatever. It’s not a place anyone wants to go to, but damn will you be glad it’s there. I don’t know if I can take much more after what I found. But it’s for my daughter, right? To make sure she has the healthiest possible start to her life. That’s what a good responsible parent does. That’s why we’re still here.

We’ll call my daughter Sue, and my wife Zara. Sue should have been fine. No pregnancy complications, Apgar (that’s a little test they do right after birth to check the newborn’s health) score of 9 out of ten, she didn’t seem to have too much trouble latching onto mom to nurse, and she had two parents eager to take her home and get their new lives started. She seemed like a perfectly healthy, and screamy, newborn girl.

But the nurses at our first hospital were concerned about her rapid breathing. They had us wait to go home until they ran some tests. For three days, we sat there in a mix of horrible dread, and the sort of excitement/fear only new parents can feel, while they monitored her. Then, on the day we were supposed to go home, the tests found “high levels of acid” in her, so they assumed she had something called “neonatal metabolic acidosis” which I think means she’s producing more acids and gasses than her body can get rid of, leading to rapid breathing, which then made feeding difficult. They couldn’t find a cause or confirmation of anything, so they shipped us off to the NICU.

At first they put her on oxygen. That actually helped with the breathing. Her acid levels went down with her breathing purer O2, and after a few days we could take her off those tubes and she could breathe fine. Her acidosis had resolved itself. “So we can leave now, right?” We wondered.

“We’ve noticed she isn’t eating as much as she should.” They told us. “It could be connected to her previous condition and we’d like to keep monitoring her.” Three more days of waiting and sleeping on an awful hospital cot ensued. After that, NICU doctors still weren’t comfortable discharging us until her feedings balanced out, but meanwhile, they kept finding more things to be worried about. “We want to run this test to make sure her eating troubles aren’t neurological. We’ll run that test in three days.” Three days later we’re told “the test came back great! But now we want to run another test to make sure she’s not aspirating. The soonest we can do that is in another three days.”

On, and on, and on. We slept in the hospital for the first week (in a room we weren’t allowed to eat in). In the second week, we were put up by a charity organization, so we had beds and hot meals again. We still spent most of our time in the NICU with our baby. My spouse saw a lactation consultant the whole time, because she wasn’t producing enough to feed our girl by herself, and I watched that grow into self loathing in her mind. I could see it in her face, every time Shae screamed in frustration while she was nursing. Pumping kept both of us awake even when we were in the quiet of the charity house. So stress built up for both of us.

Just to add to that, my vacation time is running out, because American healthcare is fucking garbage and there’s no parental leave for my job. So that’s weighing on us. Our cats at home are being fed by strangers (to them), and we’re constantly exhausted. But here we have access to donor milk, so we know our girl is getting all the food she needs. The doctors know what they’re doing. I trust them. I think their system is ruled by politics, which is needlessly stressing us out, but I have to believe the experts know best. The nurses have all been amazing and supportive. They’re happy to watch the baby while we get some actual sleep.

It can be hard to maintain a positive attitude though. It gets more and more frustrating. The hospital has these  strict schedules it wants us to keep. Feedings, and pumping sessions every three hours, and she has to finish a certain amount. First it was 45 ml. Then it was 60. Then 70. And Sue was always perfectly happy to pass out and go to sleep long before her bottle was empty. But she was nursing too. So maybe she was getting all she needed from mom after all? But maybe not. It’s best to stay with the doctors so they can make extra sure. Or is it? I have no fucking clue. The problem is she’s tired when she eats, right? So my wife and I wondered why we didn’t feed her first, and have the nurse run their tests after. That way she’s not upset about being poked and prodded for a few minutes when we feed her. She’d have more energy. Some nurses were happy to oblige. And you know what? Sue did eat more. Not all the nurses wanted to change it up though. They insisted it was Hospital policy that they do things the way they do, because it allows them to chart and monitor her growth and her vitals. “Well why can’t we change up the schedule? Sometimes she’s hungry, and starts screaming an hour before feeding and wears herself out by feeding time?” Once again, hospital policy in the NICU. Are we doing what’s best? I wish I knew.

I’m frustrated with the hospital, I’m angry for my wife, who hates that she’s not producing enough for our daughter, I hate my job for pressuring me to return, I hate this country for discouraging all of us from fighting for paternity leave and childcare benefits, I hate Donald Trump and the Republican Party for those and a variety of other reasons (Fox News, a channel popular with American Conservatives (and consequently full of bullshit talk shows) ends up on the communal tv a lot), and I’m getting really tired of listening to my daughter scream at me.

But now, I’m scared.

I found this journal. It’s one of those “newborn” journals with fun little things to write so you can document the birthing process and your child’s growth. I assumed it belonged to whoever was stuck in this NICU room before we were.

I found it lodged behind the couch. It looks old, but the date on it is only from a year ago. Zara needed a break. She was staying with her parents for a day, to catch up on sleep as much as possible. So I was alone when I found the thing. I’d just gotten done feeding Sue a bottle (and pouring most of it down the NG tube). She screamed for another ten minutes, but miraculously, this time, she fell asleep. If she stayed that way, I’d have maybe an hour to myself. Two if I was lucky. I was too damn tired to game, or websurf or anything, but I was too wired to sleep. So I sat on the cot, and by some random chance, I noticed the sound. Just a little thump. I investigated and I found the journal.

It was a dirty little pink thing, with “The Story of You” printed on the front in flowery gold ribbon-like letters. I knew it wasn’t our birth journal. Zara had taken that with her. Curious, I opened it up. The usual stuff was there. Lots of places for the parents to fill in details and write anecdotes.

*This is the journal of Bethany born April 9th, 2022*

*Mommy: Carla Daddy: Ford*

*Our note to you: We can’t believe it finally happened! We’ve finally met you! You’re more beautiful than we could have ever imagined! We have your room ready. We can’t wait to bring you home! Our lives begin anew! We love you Bethany!*

That was the first page. There were places for photos, but those were all empty. I guess they never got the chance. I was kind of wistful and sad for a moment. After all, some family had left their book of memories behind. The best case scenario there, was that they dropped it and forgot about it. But this is the Neonatal intensive Care Unit. It’s more likely there was a tragedy. That seemed even more likely as I flipped through the pages. These parents had jotted down a lot. They were ready for this baby, and they were as excited as a couple can be about it. There was a whole page where I’m guessing her mom wrote a whole essay about how much she adored her new bundle of joy. We both felt that way a few weeks ago… But the point is, these people were stoked. Their baby was everything to them. No way in hell they would leave their book of memories behind if this had a happy ending.

I can’t say for sure what really happened to these people, but the journal told a strange and impossible tale.

About halfway through the journal, the writing in it changed. It wasn’t parents filling in sections anymore. They ignored the blank spaces and the writing, and wrote top to bottom, over top of the anecdotes and the little squares to put pictures. It was like they were keeping an actual journal. Here is what they wrote:

*Something is wrong. Not with Bethany. We’ve been here for three weeks. Nothing is freaking wrong with our baby, but they still don’t feel comfortable letting us leave. The doctor said “we don’t want you to have to come back.” Who gives a shit? We’ll come back if something goes wrong! Let us go home and figure out our new lives! But no. More tests. More monitoring, and now? Something royally fucked up is going on. It took way too long for me to notice, but I’m tired. Hell, I’m exhausted. It was three o'clock in the morning when Carla left to have a soda in the lounge. She said she would be right back, as it would be time to nurse soon. One of our nurses dropped off a bottle of donor milk and stuck it in the warmer too. That was the last person I saw.*

*I had dozed off. I was startled awake by Beth’s crying. My phone was mysteriously dead. The clock on the wall said about an hour had gone by since my wife left. The whole floor was dark and mostly quiet. There were a few beeps of machinery, and whirs from vents and computers, of course, but I swear the building sounded empty. Just me, and my baby, who was screaming for food. I was really confused. The bottle was still sitting in the warmer. Had the nurses not come by to feed her? They’re supposed to. We insist on feeding whenever we’re here, but the nurses have to document her vitals and make sure she gets the necessary amount. And where the hell was Carla?*

*What could I do? We must have just had a really busy nurse. So I grabbed the bottle, and I fed little Bethany. She downed the whole bottle in less than five minutes. It was insane. She’s never eaten like that. Not in all her time alive. I was alarmed, but happy. Her eating was one of the things her doctor was worried about. I burped her and held her in my arms, preparing for the screaming and the battle of wills that came with trying to rock her to sleep. But the screaming never came. She lay there in my arms and just stared at me with those big blue eyes. I smiled and cooed at her, happy as a father can be, but she just kept staring. It was pretty creepy if I’m being honest. But she was fed, and calm. I changed her diaper, dressed her, swaddled her, and set her back in her bassinet. She stared at me the whole time.*

*With her taken care of, I decided to see where our nurse was, and find my wife. I kind of wanted to get away from Beth’s staring eyes too. So I walked out into the hall, and that’s where I started to freak out. The place was empty. No human beings. No nurse, no doctors, no janitors, no technicians, no other parents, and no other babies. Most of the lights were off, but there was definitely some machinery still working. Still. It was like I was suddenly in an abandoned hospital. Even worse? My card to get in and out doesn’t work. I’m stuck on this floor of the NICU. The lounge with the soda machine is right outside that door. I couldn’t see my wife in there, but I couldn’t see the whole room either.*

*I went from one room too the next, getting more and more panicked. Every bassinet was empty, every desk, every bathroom. There was nobody. There were signs of life, people’s clothes, an open book sitting on a table, some computers still running at their desks, but there was nobody. Had there been some sort of emergency that I missed? Had the nurses somehow forgotten about me? Had my wife not said anything? I gave myself whatever excuse I could think of. Some bizarre set of circumstances had trapped me and my baby on this floor. But it was temporary, and they’d all be back in time. What else could I do? I went back to our room, and sat with Bethany. She’s still staring at me like a little freak. I looked out our window to see if I could spot any signs of life, but it was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything. “There must be a power outage. Everything will be fine,” I told myself.*

*Well… it’s been three days. My wife never came back, no nurses ever arrived, and the sun never came up. I’m still stuck here waiting, but this isn’t natural. What could possibly keep the outside sky so black? Where the hell are we? And why won’t Bethany stop staring at me? She cries when she’s hungry. I had to break into one of the staff rooms and raid their fridge for a jug of donor milk, but it’s the only one, and it’s not going to last forever. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. My food is gone. I can steal stuff from the communal fridge for a while, but I have no fucking clue what I’m going to do to feed Beth. She can’t eat solids yet. Maybe there’s more donor milk somewhere. What the hell am I going to do? Where the fuck am I?*

That was the first entry. I sympathized with that guy a lot. It sounded like he was in a very similar state of frustration as me before he got “lost.” I feel lost and trapped here too. But Christ. What the hell happened to him? It couldn’t be real, could it? It only gets weirder after that. Impossible even. I mean, just look at this next passage:

*There’s something in here with us. It’s not human. I don’t think it has eyes. I saw it at the end of the hallway, crawling on the ceiling like an insect. It didn’t react to us at all. I had Bethany strapped to my chest, and at that moment, she decided to cry. Then the thing whipped a head toward me, and it freaking roared. No eyes, no mouth, just teeth, and a humanoid body. It dropped from the ceiling and came bounding towards us. I ran for the nearest room and barricaded us inside. I don’t know what to do. I need to feed Bethany. But what? Oh great. I cut myself.*

Monsters in the NICU? This is someone’s project. It has to be. One of the interns fancies themself a writer. Still. I don’t know. I hear weird noises at night. I figured it was just stress and a lack of sleep. It sounded like someone yelled “breath” or something down the hall a few days ago. But maybe it was “Beth?”

The last few entries get… unhinged:

*I killed the thing. I smashed it with a chair until it’s squealing stopped. I’m eating part of it now. No way to cook it, so what else can I do? At least I can get water from the sinks. Is it really water? It doesn’t look clear. I did find a way to feed Beth. It hurts, but if I can keep myself alive I should be able to keep us going. She couldn’t get enough. She crawled toward my cut and latched right on. I’ve never seen her eat like that. She needs to stop staring at me. She’s still a newborn baby, but she looks a lot less vulnerable and delicate to me. Still, she’s my daughter.*

Yikes. Here’s a short entry:

*More things. Not like the first. Not sure how many. I’m hiding. I can’t get to water. I need to feed Beth. I’m feeling weak. I gave her too much. I think she’s gotten bigger. Still won’t stop staring at me.*

The only reason I’m not really freaking out is that it’s still daytime here. No black void outside my window. I’m pretty sure I saw a nurse a bit ago. I think I’m safe. The next entry is the last:

*I gave her everything I had left. The things came and ate part of me. My legs, one of my arms, a bunch of my torso. I don’t know how I’m alive. There’s so much blood. But I don’t feel any pain. The monsters helped me write this. I’m not sure why. I thought about writing and they brought my journal and helped me move my hand. They talked to me too. No clue how. Only one of them has a mouth, and it definitely can’t do speech.  They say a “beast” must be fed. They thanked me for my “contribution,” then they took Beth. I tried to protest, but they explained that it was best for her to remain. Then they left me here. I have one arm. I’m dying. I’m trying so hard to finish this writing alone, but I’m so weak.  I did it for you Beth. I gave you the best start I could. I love you.*

While I was transcribing that, a nurse arrived. I might have sighed out loud in relief. I asked them about previous families, but they said they couldn’t keep track. I don’t know if Carla, Bethany, and Ford were real or not. But I’m getting the fuck out of here. Whether the staff like it or not, I'm not letting anything happen to Sue.

Update:

We’re home. I yelled in ways I never thought I could. The doctors forced us to learn how to insert NG tubes into our daughters nose, and sent us off just to get rid of me. We’re safe. We’re out of that place. I don’t feel like I’m being sucked dry in there anymore. I haven’t forgotten what I found though. I looked into it. I found an obituary for a Bethany Shades, who died in the NICU last year. She had an unseen heart condition. Her mother, Carla, committed suicide days later. The father, Ford, disappeared. He’s on the missing persons list and everything.

I don’t know what’s real. Whether it’s true or not, something sinister roams those hospital halls. It’s not the nurses, or the doctors or even the screaming newborns. It’s something else. It feeds on the families there. It brings stress to them and employees alike. I’m just glad I got out when we did. And I wish Sue would quit staring straight at me. I know her eyes aren’t developed enough to even see me from there."
11pm9f1,16,2023-03-12,No Return Offer Post Summer 2022 Internship,nybaldwin714,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11pm9f1/no_return_offer_post_summer_2022_internship/,"Hi all! I'm still processing this news as it's still pretty fresh. I interned with a company for essentially 3 summers (started in Fall 2021; ended in Summer 2022). I never received an ounce of negative feedback my entire time there. I was really hoping I'd get an offer after graduation (because how could I not???). 

Last September I receive a survey from the company saying that they were interested in my next steps and I filled it out immediately. It wasn't an automated email but rather sent from a real person who works there (we connect on LinkedIn - he's very nice). I'm thinking, ""ok great! They didn't forget about me! I have a fat chance of walking away with a return offer"". Now, my roommate told me to always have a back-up plan and that I should still look for jobs. I thought to myself, ""nahhhh nothing is going to go wrong. I'll get my offer :)"". I was wrong.

February 2023 rolls around. I email the woman in charge of talent acquisition and inform her I'll be graduating very soon (this May) and am interested in potential full time opportunities. A few days later, I get this heartbreaking email:

""Thank you for reaching out! I hope all has been well.
 
At this time, I’m unfortunately not working on any positions that would be a fit for you. However, please feel free to check out our career’s page and apply to openings that look of interest.
 
Best of luck with your last semester!""

Now, when I first read the email, I was in SHAMBLES, rightfully so, as I was really banking on this job. I was thinking, ""oh dear god WHAT DID I DO WRONG?"", feeling like an absolute failure ( I still do). After re-reading it a few more times, I realized it has nothing to do with my performance explicitly, but rather there are no roles for me straight up! I'm thinking that since I wrapped up my internship last Summer, there hasn't been any entry level SWE roles under this company AT ALL (which makes sense given the market we are in currently). It's crazy because I have not seen any entry level SWE openings on the career's page since I looked last Fall. Now, when I checked the career's page just now, I ONLY see senior SWE roles. Upon doing the whole job search, I'm finding mostly senior level roles which is disheartening. 

It took me a while to realize that the email doesn't say ""you can't EVER work here again!! Don't come back!!"". She said she doesn't have anything for me RIGHT NOW. Which doesn't mean forever. Who knows?? A role could open up in a couple months or even 6 months to a year.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for my internship experience, I think I'll have a leg up on some candidates. However, it would have been a dream to finally make that, ""I'm pleased to announce I'll be an incoming SWE at 'X company' after interning with them"" post on LinkedIn. Because that's what LinkedIn is, you basically jerk yourself off right?

I know it's not the end of the world, but it sure feels like it. It really sucks how this ""recession"" is eating up the tech space. I'm also going to stop looking at my feed on LinkedIn for a while. I love seeing folks land their internship/full-time roles and I'm excited for them! Just a little sad for me, you know? When I was applying for my very first internship role, I made a big a** spreadsheet with like 50 rows on it. Now, I don't even have the motivation/energy to do that. Resisting the feminine urge to crawl into bed and not come out. 

How does someone intern with a Fortune 50 3 times but doesn't land the job?

Anyone else in the same boat as me? Anyone not get a return offer because of this f*cked up market we're in?? Please comment down below."
11pn2g2,4,2023-03-12,Choosing between Cornell Tech and UCSD,Suspicious-Shower114,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/11pn2g2/choosing_between_cornell_tech_and_ucsd/,"I have a nice-to-have problem. I'm having a tough time deciding between UCSD MS ECE and Cornell Tech M. Eng ECE. A bit about me: I'm an international student from a non CS related background. I have a year of experience working in the same. My aim through grad school is get into the field of data science/ analytics. Though I've started picking up the hard skills needed for this, it's far from being even an intermediate analyst. I can put in 60-70 hours a week due to health limitations. 

Cornell Tech: 
Pros: 
1. Location (NYC is great for such roles is what I understand) 
2. Focus on management studies: (I like this because it's something that is required while working in tech i feel)
3. Small cohort: (Last year's batch size was 9. There are at Max 300 people on the whole campus. Lesser competition, more individual attention with the prof.)
4. Ivy league Tag.

Cons: 
1. It's a 1 year program. I'm not very sure how well I'll be able to pick stuff up in a year if I'm changing my career domain. To what extent will learning stuff before enrolling help? Might be too demanding health wise. 
2. Cost: it costs as much as a 2 year program. 
3. Not many people know about Cornell Tech. This can be an issue with recruiting. I don't wanna seem as a rip off. 
4. The weather in NYC is terrible. I'd like to work on the west coast. 


UCSD 
Pros
1. It's a 2 year program. Switching domains becomes easier when you learn something new for 2 years instead of 1.
2. Proximity to silicon valley. Going to school in an area that's closer to where you want to work might be beneficial. 
3. Great weather
4. Possible internship since 

Cons
1. Might not be as well known as Cornell but do recruiters know Cornell Tech either? 

Overall Cornell just feels like a high risk high reward situation while UCSD feels like a safer option. 

Any advice on choosing between the 2 would be highly appreciated."

Year 2 SWE undergrad, have experience with asp.net core, c#, c, python, java, dbms. But i wouldnt even dare tell recruiters that im good at them simply because of how broad they are.

I thought i was decent at python, but couldnt even solve hackerranks intermediate python test. Aside from basic SOLID and DRY principles, avoiding brute force / hardcoding i dont think i have improved dramatically.

I feel that most of my projects are far from optimized and probably will have glaring issues / code smells upon further inspection. I often rotate between the ""if it works then it works"" and the ""i think can make one small change to make this run faster, and end up spending the entire day on insignifcant performance increase"" mindsets.

Not sure if i need reassurance or somebody to tell me to wake tf up. I passed on an SWE internship and took on a role as a tester instead because of how unprepared i feel. Everyone around me told me i was an idiot and should just fake it till i make it. When will i know im ready ?"

11pnv1r,0,2023-03-12,Applying to SciencesPo &amp; other top schools,RedSpikem,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/11pnv1r/applying_to_sciencespo_other_top_schools/,"Hi! I am a junior in High School from Romania and I would like to apply to an undergraduate program at SciencesPo (+other universities, but this one is my top choice). Given that I only have 6 months left until the Early Admissions begin, I wanted to make sure that I use this time wisely.  
Most of my friends apply to top schools abroad (some even Harvard) and seeing their CV has scared me a lot :). I am so so stressed out by the fact that I do not have enough activities, so I wanted to make this post to ask you whether you believe that I will be accepted and/ or what do I have to develop in order to upper my chances.   
About me: GPA 9.89/10 (Romanian System), IELTS 8.0, and I will sit my Romanian Baccalaureate in June 2024 so there's no grade for that yet. 

Fun-facts for the ""holistic"" approach: I know 7 alphabets (Arabic, Cyrillic, Latin, American Sign Language, Romanian Sign Language, Greek, and one invented by me 3 years ago :)). I can fluently read and write (or sign) in all of them. I self-taught myself a few things such as ASL and Romanian Sign Language (around a CEFR of A2), crocheting, Graphic Design - in Figma and Inkscape, and Programming - the basics like HTML, CSS, Python. Not only that, but I come from a poor financial background, with 4 brothers and no family member with studies beyond high school, nor with baccalaureate. So I would be the first to have a Baccalaureate Diploma and with undergraduate studies in my entire bloodline.

My questions are:  
1**. What of the aforementioned activities should I continue?** I am currently focusing a lot on the UNICEF one because I have just recently been named Member of County Coordinating Committee for Child Friendly Initiative. Also I stopped going to MUNs because I already have a lot of experience and I want to invest my time in sth else.  
2. **What should I add?** What type of activities seem to be missing from my CV?  
3. **How can I do leadership activities in my community without an NGO?** I want to do something with Opportunup because it is a true passion project that I have invested a lot of time in. We have daily posts with new opportunities and i want to also add something like donations events, but as far as I know I need an NGO to get money or donations from people, legally. The problem is I don't have the money to found an NGO so it would be a hard pass. I was thinking of webinars, but they are not of the same impact.  
4. **I have not been a president at any association** and it is kind of late for me to do that given that I only have 6 months. I only focussed on the practical part of helping (being a volunteer, trainer, and founder of initiatives) rather than organizational (being in an executive board). **How much does this disadvantage me?**

5. Any general tips and tricks for the application? Or for my civic involvement? Anything is useful as I am really stressed out. It would be a gigantic leap for my family and for my education, that is why I want to push even harder."
11pq4vb,1,2023-03-12,[Male 22] Is it okay to ask to meet up with a girl [Female 24] I met a year and a half ago?,LDS_Aviator,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11pq4vb/male_22_is_it_okay_to_ask_to_meet_up_with_a_girl/," 

I met a girl a year ago and a half who was a missionary and introduced me to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and when she left to go home from her mission we both expressed our heartfelt good byes and we messaged a lot since she finished her mission. I am interested in starting a relationship with her, but I'm from Tennessee and she's from Utah.

I have improved myself a lot since then, I built an attractive physique by working out and eating right, took care of my skin, and started reading, read the whole bible and most of the Book of Mormon, and even started making excellent grades (before they were terrible, mostly C's and B's, Now Straight A's because I was able to channel my high-functioning Autism and OCD properly like I did in high school), and recently I even received the Melchizedek priesthood. I also even gained the ability to deal with my high-functioning autism and can now socialize with out much difficulty. I never would have had the confidence to express my feelings for her then, nor could I have because missionaries cannot date during their mission, but now I feel that after improving myself I have became a desirable man and have the confidence to talk to women, and many women have expressed interest in me since I improved my self, but I am simply not interested in dating.

This May I am finishing my bachelor's degree and after this summer I am starting my masters degree, and in the weeks between my internship and the start of the semester I plan to go to a state a little bit North of hers to go mountain hiking.

Would it be alright for me to ask to meet up with her on my way back from my mountain hiking trip? I am absolutely not just using this as an excuse to see, I have always wanted to see the national park in this state, and definitely not trying to do a hookup because I am a virgin saving myself for marriage. When I meet up with her, I would like to express my interest in her, and long term I would like to marry her. She has saw that I have improved my appearance because we are friends on social media, but do you think that she would still remember me as a fat autistic kid? I feel like if I met her in person, she would see that I am much more attractive, not just physically but personality wise too, than I was when we first met, and she would be more interested in me. Even when I was fat and socially awkward, she was so kind to me, and is the most beautiful, unique, and perfect girl I have ever met. She is the only girl I have ever met that made me feel so comfortable and accepted. Would anyone be able to give me advice on how I could ask to meet up with her to express my feelings without appearing weird or creepy?"

Help Desk Agent at $12/hr, worst fucking place I've seen. Users so dumb that I wouldn't trust with a car, let alone a computer.

Then I went back to college, dropped that shitty job, got an internship at $30/hr; got 4 IT certifications, working on cool tech I never thought I would touch in a million years. Life's pretty good, and have been at my current employer since.

However, these recruiters at TEKsystems will not leave me alone. They keep calling me at odd hours of the day asking me if I want to work for pennies, they keep sending me emails for job listings that are asking for the whole IT department in one person. No matter how much I tell them I make, a new recruiter comes by every week or two and does the same thing. It's like a bad ex that won't leave me alone.

My advice to the new people trying to break into IT reading this is to never touch TEKsystems, and to never give them your information. There has to be a mom &amp; pop shop near you that'll be much better to work for, these parasites will just keep calling you no matter what. Learn from my mistake.

EDIT: I can't respond to all 630 comments, but I love reading about the ones that say I'm an idiot and I don't know what I'm talking about, that TEKsystems is the best place to work ever; and especially the posts saying I deserved to be paid as much as a burger flipper for trying to enter IT. Really helpful stuff, thank you.

Otherwise I'm glad I'm not taking crazy pills, and people agree with my long rant.

I'm still trying to figure out how you people are getting lunches paid for you by recruiters. The people who contact me can barely read their script, let alone take me out and buy me food."

11puy2j,1,2023-03-12,Is it really that hard to find a software developer job if you're not that picky about the company?,liam12345677,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/11puy2j/is_it_really_that_hard_to_find_a_software/,"I'm about 8 months out from graduating now and for most of that time have been in a bit of a hole stuck in a pretty bad service job and haven't done much towards getting a CS job which is what I always said I wanted but wasn't that motivated when it came to putting in the work. I tried game development for getting a portfolio of projects up but kept getting bored/stuck and putting it aside, and I then went through some of the CS50 AI online course, until recently where I began going through The Odin Project. 

My background is a maths degree where most of the module choices/projects I chose were related to programming. I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to Python, but that's about it. Game dev was C# but I wouldn't say I know that language.

I literally just want to get out of this horrible job ASAP, but on the rare occasion I look up programming related stuff on youtube that isn't a literal ""how do I solve this coding problem"" question, I always see the annoying clickbait titles and thumbnails saying things like ""Web dev is DEAD in 2023"", ""Why you will NEVER be hired as a junior developer"", ""This ONE thing is keeping you from getting a job"". I was literally just trying to check reviews of The Odin Project before I started it but seeing those thumbnails and titles just makes me feel a bit worse.

I assume they are wrong though? Or vastly exaggerated. I am not aiming for a faang company and I know if I wanted that, I would have needed to be building a portfolio and doing internships during my time at university. It's probably possible even now but would be quite a long shot. I just want to find a job, presumably in web dev seeing as I am doing The Odin Project which is for web development if anyone hasn't heard of it, and for now I don't mind starting out in some small name local company paying £25k a year or whatever.

I also am not that bothered whether or not it's web dev, but TOP appears to actually be teaching me skills I will need to use as a developer such as the linux terminal, git and good git practices/conventions, and I can build a portfolio of web dev stuff throughout the course. And that's what I feel I'm getting out of TOP compared to doing loads of beginner game dev/Unity courses or even the CS50 AI course.

Sorry if this post is a bit of a rant. I believe I've managed to ask some questions and vent some (hopefully) understandable frustrations about trying to get a job in software development. Idk if you are supposed to call web dev ""software development"" but I'm including any kinds of software development here!"

All of that aside, I just wanted to ask if anyone had any tips? I see a lot of advice around internships and applying right out of school, but what about for us slightly older folk who are going it more or less alone? I see a lot of posts (and talk to a few friends) who mention how long their job search is for their first gig, going 6+ months without an offer sometimes.

im sorry if this gets asked all the time. im really struggling with feeling undervalued at my job and want to know if staying is objectively better than looking for something new.

backstory: i am a college dropout. my degree had nothing to do with my work anyway so i consider it a bullet dodged. i am a director of graphic design, i have been doing this my entire life. my dad is a drug addict, but is not a bad man, and he introduced me to my current job straight out of high school. he was eventually let go for being unable to manage his addiction and i stayed at the company. (he is doing better now!)

at my current job i started as my dad's production assistant, and after he left, i eventually took over the graphic design for this company and worked my way up in terms of titles. it is a large local company and our media and marketing team consists of only four people: myself (graphics), a videographer, a social media coordinator, and our VP of marketing. i have been working at this company since 2011, so more than 10 years now. last year i was finally given a raise after a few years and i now make $20 an hour. 

because our marketing team is so small, i do a lot more than graphic design. i do all your typical graphic stuff: i make LED graphics, billboards, posters, signage, logos, social media graphics, gifs, and digital ads. i work heavily in adobe creative suite. but i also write scripts and copy, write blog posts for my company's website, i proofread and edit, i am in charge of our email marketing campaigns, i am a photographer (and a damn good one, tbh), i edit photos, i edit occasionally in premiere pro, i shoot and edit tiktoks for our page, i code in java and html for our wordpress site, and i do a LOT of client outreach. i am still sort of a production assistant because we have no one else. i also do social media outreach from time to time, though now we have an intern who handles most of it. i am frequently going on photo and video shoots with our videographer, where i set up and take down lights and also shoot stills. i used to set up and take down virtual livestream classes during the pandemic. i used to publish a 30-50 page magazine, doing all the design and layout work alone, up until the pandemic hit. i also do various creative projects around the company when needed, from painting mural pictures to managing the ads that run on our website. 

i feel like my skillset is really good. a few years ago i had a friend who worked in esports who i freelanced for, who gave me an awesome pep talk and told me that companies would be fighting over me with the breadth and depth of my abilities, he was shocked at my hourly rate. that was the first time i have ever actually felt like i DO stuff and have skills, because my company just kind of brushes me off. 

part of me feels like any gen z kid can do what i do, everyone makes graphics and tiktoks. but recently i have started to feel like no, im way better at all this marketing stuff than just your average run of the mill person. a random dude grabbed off the street could never do what i do, at least not without years of experience and practice. i feel like my company completely ignores how much stuff i do for them, and the depth of my knowledge when it comes to the company itself. i built our brand style guide and was the person who actually started branding our stuff on social media, the company had no visual consistency before i was there. 

i dont get any paid vacation time, any day i have to take off and cant work from home, i dont get paid for. i dont make overtime hours. i work 5 typical 8 hour shifts and my documented hours and scrutinized constantly by an auditing company that questions everything i do, down to asking me to come to one of my photoshoots to make sure im ""really working"". i had to fight to get a new computer last week after using the same imac for 10 years. i dont have a 401k and it had never even been brought up to me. when signing up for health insurance, my boss informed me that ""most companies"" do not cover workers health insurance. he told me that they would reimburse me for half the cost of my insurance and give me a raise to compensate for the remaining balance, but i just found out this never happened, i was never given a raise, and my health insurance is being taken out of every check i have gotten so far this year. of course i expect to pay a small fee for it, but having to pay full price for health insurance when i have been with this company for ten years is absolutely ridiculous to me. i know fast food workers who are treated better upon hire. (no offense to fast food workers btw!)

i feel extremely undervalued and its making me hate myself and doubt my skills. i love my coworkers and they are like family to me. i love taking pictures and graphic design, it is genuinely my passion. but my job is sucking it out of me. i was told as a director of design with my experience, even without a degree, i should be making over $50k a year. that sounds like SO much money to me. i have no idea what to do. this is the only job i have ever had. ive never stood up and asked for anything before. i dont know if i should put my foot down, or leave, or if im just overvaluing myself in my own head."

I attended Blinn College for my associate in liberal arts. Then transfer to Texas A&amp;M University(College Station) During Covid semesters, I got super depressed and couldn't make it out of bed let alone get any of my school work done. I got my academic suspension I applied for the discussion and didn't get accepted back. I was living in a 4x4 appt by myself and didn't have any human interaction for weeks on end, all virtual classes and I was drinking and smoking daily and heavily. Since then I turned myself around, I stopped drinking completely, and I still smoke from time to time to help me sleep and on the weekend but my relationship with it is much more healthy.

Now That I'm out of college, I was studying Infomation Technology and completed 84 hours of credits. I decide that take the CompTIA A+ and Network+ Tests and passed them both, I want to reapply to university, but I haven't taken any additional classes to raise my GPA back up from failing all my courses my final semester. Is it possible that A+ and Network+ certs could get me back into school? I know it's a long shot, but I want to complete my degrees, I want to finish my college education, or should I apply to a small school and try to boost my GPA?

I have plans to take my CCNA, additionally, and have brushed up on SQL, Database structures. Relearned Python, Java, and Web development. I worked while in school as a software engineering intern, do any of these things make up for my lackluster GPA and academic performance over my college career?

I think I have an ok, not great as I’m still working on it, 3.42 gpa so as to give a bit of context to my situation. Since I’m a sophomore and I initially chose this major since I have prior experience with programming and cause the job pays well and has a lot of job opportunities or so I thought. I haven’t been able to land a single internship so far, I’m not asking for something big and I don’t even need to get paid but I want to experience what’s it like actually working in the field. 

To be frank, I think a big reason is about how my college hasn’t really taught us anything major so far and I haven’t really done a lot of projects apart from a website and a half built weather app using swift (both was self taught). So I wanted to know if you guys have any feedback on what i should try to do moving forward. Should I focus more on some personal projects or should I try to look for more internships. If it’s the later, any suggestions on how I could look for one easier as I’ve already applied to most of the ones on handshake. One reason I want to go for internships is money since I don’t really have a proper job as I’m a full time student. So any advice on this would be appreciated. Thanks for reading through so far!"

MSE(16-month) : I know that MSE has a better brand value due to SCS school, but the cost is too much for the whole program, around 130k. There's no funding and internship opportunity, and instead the program has a studio project for the professionals track.

UW MSIM(12-month) : 12 months program including internship, tuition is cheaper relatively, Seattle advantage, but less time to prepare for FTE roles.

CMU MISM(16-month) : Cost is pretty much the same as MSE but I can at least do an internship to fund my last semester, and have more time to prepare for FTE roles.

I am a coding bootcamp grad &amp; have about a year of experience. I worked as an intern for 7 months then worked at another company for 3 months &amp; switched to another for 3 months. 

How do I explain this ? 

The first job was great I learned a ton. The 2 other jobs weren’t a good fit and one was very toxic. 
I took some time off and work at Walmart. 
I’ve been applying to jobs and have an interview later this week. 

I don’t have a real good portfolio, most of the work I did was ticket and creating solutions with senior developers. 

When I asked if the position was remote HR said they have not worked with remote workers but would be open for the right person. 
During the phone screen they said they are looking for a junior developer with an ability to learn. 
I’m worried how I can play the portfolio section and prove I can learn.  I do have some stuff to show but nothing special.  

If the position was remote I would receive 1099 and no benefits. 
But if I’m in house I could get a pension + healthcare.   
It would be NYC. 
I would like to work remote for a few months learn the system meet the team get my finances together before relocating to nyc.

11q7mxy,3,2023-03-13,I’m an adult and I barely know anything about being an adult or being independent in any form,Born_Panda_2990,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11q7mxy/im_an_adult_and_i_barely_know_anything_about/,"	I don’t know what kind of parents I grew up with but I think it is the kind that doesn’t teach their kid how to do certain things that one should know in order to be able to be independent wen they grow up. I’m currently in college and I didn’t know how to do my own laundry until my freshman year of college, my roommate had to teach me. The only things that were taught to me were how to do the dish’s, vacuum, and some of your basic housekeeping; but those are just any other chores that any kid would get. I barely can cook, I can make breakfast foods, maybe lunch, but dinner is a lost cause. 
	Another thing is that I don’t have a license. I know how to drive, but I failed the maneuverability part because that is the one thing my parents didn’t bother to teach me. I need to get my license because I have an internship coming up for the summer and I need to buy a car but I don’t know anything about insurance, what type of price is decent for a car, or how much mileage I need to look for in a car. I have had to rely on people for rides for almost everything now and it is embarrassing; it also doesn’t help that some people continuously ask me when I’m going to get my license or tell me to just simply get my license when I have told them how my parents are. When I mentioned I wanted to at least look for cars, my dad said that I couldn’t afford a car because I haven’t been saving and all I do is spend money. I have two savings accounts, one my dad created for me and my siblings when we were little and one I created a year or two ago. I have no idea how much I have in the one my dad created because he doesn’t tell me but if it’s how much I think is in there, I think I have enough money to buy a decently used car (with both accounts). Every time my brother and I have mentioned about cars, it always gets shut down but my dad also every now and then mentions about looking for cars. I hate how everyone my age seems almost set to be out on their own and are able to do things that makes them independent and I still have to rely on mommy and daddy to take me places. I know that adult life has its challenges and big responsibilities but my parents have made it seem like one of the worst things possible and my siblings and I would crash in burn instantly. 
	My sister has been out on her own and moved out since 2020 and she seems to be doing fine, and my dad isn’t too happy about that and tells everyone she’s not acting like an adult. I feel like the older i’m getting, the more my parents try to shield me from being independent. 
	Another thing I should mention about my internship is that it is 30 minutes away from my house and it will require me to drive at night (and I have to commute). The way my mom sees it, I will still not have my license by the time I begin my internship and my dad will have to take me back and forth; she thinks that me driving at night will be too dangerous and suggests she finds a person that lives closer that will allow me to stay at their house for the summer and I WALK back and forth to the location where my internship is. I fee like I’m running out of time and I’ll be stuck with my parents forever. How do I deal with this or slowly become independent on my own?"

I'm a master student in ML at a european university. I feel like I am now at a point with ML where I have a really firm grasp of most theory, even up to an advanced level with probabilistic ML, PGMs, the math behind everything etc. I've found a particular interest in graph representation learning, and am currently working on implementing things in Hamilton's book and some papers.

The reason I want to query some more experienced people is that I feel kinda stuck reasoning about all of this on my own, not checking my knowledge and structuring against people with more intuition and experience. I was at a very similar state during my bachelor's in CS, and found my way out by getting a internship, which rapidly improved the rate I aquired software engineering/CS knowledge.

I don't quite know where to begin looking for communities where I could get some form of exchange of knowledge, or even some sort of mentoring, with and by other people, helping building something that actually could be used. The natural thought would be getting a summer internship, or assisting some academic or industry with unpayed labour or something, but I don't really know which roles to look for, and it seems like it might be too late for many opportunities. Otherwise open source came to my mind, but I don't really know where to look for such communities or projects that develops useful skills in relevant areas.

I make $65K a year. I find myself needing to put in 50 hrs weekly to get my work done. Maybe this would be less if I had more experience? As it stands, I need to spend a lot of extra time to understand the various concepts and what is being asked of me (lead meetings, certification study, sprint planning).

At 50 hrs/week my net pay calculates as $20/hr. This seems worth mentioning because my rate was $25 hourly as an intern. That means that I'm making roughly the same money as a Cloud Engineer working 50 hours as I would have as an intern. That seems odd, especially considering the additional responsibilities. I am concerned that I am not being developed as an engineer, and that the company is taking advantage of my abilities and willingness to step up. I feel that I should mostly be focused on acquiring technical know-how and experience at this point in my career. Is this ""normal"" given the circumstances outlined?

Context: I'm familiar with working long hours and ambiguity/shifting requirements. A high level of required effort isn't the complaint. The issue is the relationship between that level of effort and the payoff (monetary and knowledge/experience) that I stand to gain."

I have made pros and cons lists for my options, but would really love to hear from people who actually work in these fields, or have advice regarding this matter.

I am torn between software engineering, and accounting.

The absolute most important outcome for me is being able to work remotely due to my disability and health.

Secondly, is time, I am graduating with my associate of arts this semester at my local community college, and it has taken me 4.5 years to do so. I work part time from home in a remote position (completely unrelated field) for the last 4 years as well, and am a wife and mother (33 years old). So, depending on which school I choose, and the program, I could be looking at between 2 to 3.5 more years of school. Which is fine, but I really need to start making more money. If I get a different job now, then that will ultimately lengthen the amount of time I would have to be in college because I wouldn't be able to go full time. Which is the plan (full time). So there is a tradeoff on that aspect, I would rather push myself to get the degree faster, and start working and gaining experience as soon as possible in the chosen field.

All of these programs are fully online.

So for **software engineering**, I have narrowed it down to these options for this degree, 

a **Public university** in my state, I am approved for scholarships already, and there is an internship as part of the program. This option will take 3.5 years, possibly 4 because I need one additional math class. This is supposedly a very good program and school, with very small class sizes, and the reviews I have heard from people is because of that, you are able to engage more with the teacher which can help with learning the concepts.

**WGU is another option,** its inexpensive, and has the option to accelerate, but that also means the timeline is undetermined. There is no internship option, and you do not take advanced math courses, that may come in handy when being successful in the career, as far as solving logical problems. The way it was explained to me is that you dont use the math itself, but the problem solving skills.

Then there are t**wo web development programs, from 2 others schools**, and they have a graphic design class, and all the classes focus more on the web development component rather than the more comprehensive software engineering degrees. I am worried these options will be of less value when finding a job, and the income potential. Because with a software engineering degree, I could also be a web developer, but I would have more knowledge, and have more skills for other paths in the tech field with a software engineering degree.

For **Accounting**, I have basically identical options, public university, private university, or WGU. My biggest concern with this option career wise, are being able to secure a remote position as an entry level candidate, and that I would also need to pursue a masters for cpa. Which can be more expensive for the masters program. And with getting a cpa license, you need 2,000 hours under a licensed cpa, which I have no idea if I will be able to do remotely. I know that you don't actually have to go that route, but at least right now, in my head, that would be the path to maximize income potential. And the other thing to think about is that, I have read that people are leaving the field due to being overworked and underpaid, whereas you may have the same experience as a software engineer, it does seem they at least have a higher wage.

I guess one more thing that I can point out is that, I am not really interested in coding. Which doesn't make sense that I would consider going into this, but I have to be realistic about my health and disability, and what fields I can work remote, and this is one of the best options. At the end of the day, you have to do what you have to do. I took 2.5 courses on coding at my community college, plus 4 other tech courses. But the coding was just uninteresting. Accounting I took in my first semester of college, after having been out of school for 12 years, and I did decent in the class for that situation, but would have faired better if I had taken it in the last year or two, after having turned my brain back on lol. I really liked journaling, but didn't like to read about the legal and business topics, obviously that is the important part. I have heard the joke that the only accountants who are creative are in prison. I did enjoy microeconomics though which was taken last semester, so again maybe I wouldn't dislike the business topics in accounting now as I did when I first took that class 4.5 years ago.

Obviously because I lack experience, I can only reach out and ask people about these things, as no one in my family or friends circles are ""professionals"", they are all in construction and manufacturing, without college degrees. It would be nice to hear from people who have gone through all of this or who hire college grads to say, ""this matters"", ""this doesn't"", etc. 

How important is an internship, is it better to secure them on your own, or go with the program that offers it as part of the curriculum?

Should I go with a degree that gives me a faster route to working, or a more comprehensive education? Im willing to go a little longer if its worth it. 

So, if you have any advice regarding these options I would really appreciate it, I need to transfer in May so I can start on my bachelors path. It is coming up fast, and I am at a standstill. Thank you all so much!!"

The more business side of technology interests me more, which is why IST sounds perfect for me.

I have some questions that I would love to hear from current students or recent grads. I noticed that there are so many great options for majors in IST, like cyber security, data science, entrepreneurship technology integration, and security risk. While they all sound great, I am wondering if there is a suggested major or concentration that has the highest salary potential in the college? I know that salary should not be the only factor in choosing a major, but I am curious about the earning potential in each field.

Additionally, do any majors in particular have an easier time finding a job straight out of graduation? I am very excited about the required internship in the school of IST, and it sounds like the program sets you up with great technical skills for a successful career. I would love to hear from anyone who has graduated from IST and their experience with finding a job after graduation.

This is the best piece of advice I've ever heard: If you intend on pursuing summer internships, then do your best to schedule the majority of your ""harder classes"" during the spring semesters prior to each summer, and schedule the majority of your ""easier classes"" during the fall semester prior to each summer.

Why? A given fall semester is the prime-time recruiting season for the following summer, meaning the majority of internship applications are released during this time. A lighter course load would allow for more leeway to dedicate towards interview prep, applications, etc. without sacrificing too much from academics.

You could use this advice as well for fall or spring internships but adjust accordingly; two ""seasons"" behind the very season you want to intern during should be the ""lighter"" semester."

About me: 

&amp;#x200B;

35. Have a degree in Finance with a minor in economics. Graduated from a state school (dad said if i wasn't going to Harvard, it's a waste of money to go elsewhere). 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated about the time of the 2008 financial crisis. Needless to say, I couldn't find any jobs in the finance industry other than ""Financial Advisor"" which paid zero dollars and all commission, so i didn't pursue it at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a twin brother who has serious mental issues and was/is suicidal. And so I used that as an excuse for so many years as to why I never left home and pursued goals. I cared about him so much that i said to myself that I wouldn't leave him until he found his own career/way in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have a girlfriend during this time and wasn't social with anyone, because I didn't want to go out when my brother was at home by himself. He was my best friend and everything. So i stayed at home with him. We bonded over video games and other small things. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, we always told our friends that we were ""working for our dad."" Which was true, in a way. He had an antiques business, and my brother helped with the technical side (he was good with web design), and I helped with the business side (but in reality, i didn't do too much. Just some marketing and physical help every now and then). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked jobs all my life, but never any serious, long term career jobs. Here are the jobs i've held:

&amp;#x200B;

\- First job was working at the mall at a clothing store folding clothes.

\-  I worked as a tutor for math/English. 

\- I did some work with the university of notetaking for students with disabilities (I can type 100+ WPM).

\- Ref for Youth Soccer games

\- In College I was a Teaching Assistant for Computer Science 101. Very basic stuff, it was part of a course I was taking.  Instructed a class of college students on the Microsoft Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) as well as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, HTML, and SSH. 

\- During college I was accepted as a Jr. Analyst for a ""Wall Street type job"". It was pretty much an internship for traditional Investment Banking jobs, except I wasn't in a feeder school, so I was never going to be accepted at a Wall Street NY Bank, especially during the 2008 Financial Crisis. So I learned some Financial Modeling and Pitchbook stuff, but it's pretty much all been forgotten by now. 

\- In 2015 I was accepted to the Air Traffic Control Program. It was an accomplishment in itself to be accepted. But unfortunately, I didn't pass the final exam. And then I went back home. 

I didn't mention that I always loved Aviation, and I always wanted to be a pilot but My 18 year old self would never mention it to my dad, so I went the ""Professional"" Route. So when this opportunity came along, I applied and it was amazing. But it didn't work out (I think because I probably have mild ADD, but never diagnosed). So that's a good thing for air travel =)

\- In 2019-2000 I had a connection in the Restaurant Business. He was a owner of a Restaurant Franchise, and he said he needed some ""Good men"" to help with his business. So at age 30, I started working for a Pizza franchise. I never worked in a restaurant before. I did every job possible, from working dish pit, to the line, and eventually to management. I did every single thankless job out there, and I enjoyed the heck out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

His goal was to eventually put me on as a ""Business Coach,"" which is a regional manager of sorts for the franchise. 

And after 1-2 years working in a restaurant (and I told nobody of my connection), I finally got promoted to the Business Coach position, which was amazing.... 

&amp;#x200B;

And then COVID happened. Restaurants were one of the biggest hits of all industries, and I was laid off (being the newest employee to Corporate). 

\- Then for a few months, I worked for him in an unofficial capacity to help him build a ""Legacy Restaurant."" But in reality, I was just doing odds and ends at his estate like mowing lawns and being more of a property manager. This was also cool and an amazing opportunity. I learned all about landscaping and different aspects of property zoning. But after a few months, i realized that this was not a long term opportunity and I left (I didn't mentioned that my twin brother came over to where I was living, and was living with me on this mans property because my dad suggested he come here, away from his mom who he was living with. And he made it clear that my brother wasn't pulling his weight, so he wanted him out). 

I developed some very bad skin conditions, probably because of the stress of all of what was happening. I hated that my brother was seen as a burden. And I made the decision that we both leave and go back home. 

\- Fast Forward to 2001. I had some money saved up and during my recovery at home (at my moms house), I really got into Stock Market Trading. Which is essentially what I was first passionate about when I went to college. 

Long story short, I made some OK money trading in 2021. This was during the market BOOM. And I was smart and stopped trading after I made some money. But in 2022 I made zero dollars because I didn't want to risk anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's 2023, I'm 35. I have a girlfriend who i intend to marry, and she has a son who I consider like my own. They both make me very happy. 

I thought perhaps that trading could be a career for me. But it's simply not stable enough unless I was single. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after my life story. I'm at a point now where I would like to start a career. But I need advice. How should I start a career at 35? I'm considering working for an airline or firm that needs a finance position. Except, I haven't worked finance jobs in 10+  years, so I would not quality for any jobs that require any levels of experience. 

I'm also not qualified to accept the internship positions to get experience since these are reserved for college students. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i need help. How do I get experience if I don't have any, and if the internship jobs are mainly for people that are currently enrolled in college?

Should I go for a brand new career or at least used my Finance BBA to help me out in some way? I'm open to anything. 

Thanks for listening this far, I've never told anybody any of this."

I'm on my 3rd year of Bachelor's (Program Engineering), I learn python/Django, i've only built couple of simple projects with it like TODO list and smth similiar with CRUD operations, we don't have much of internships from where I am (international university), so I haven't had one yet and I'm not really familiar with Canadian study/internships environment. So my questions are:  
1- What would you recommend to built unregular for entry - level devs that could make my resume look at least on the same level as canadian student's resumes do;  
2 - Is it possible for me to get an internship here in Canada? (my theoretical knowledge is really good, I tested myself with a lot of questions for entry-level positions, but i don't have much on my Github yet and I see that requirements for internships aren't really high)   
3 - I know about current market state, but would be glad to hear your honest opinion about my chances to get a job over here (I currently live in Canada), maybe some recommendations how to get my chances higher (location doesn't really mean a lot to me, I'll move to any where I get offer if it required)  
 4 - Maybe some general advices or iformation (I don't know a lot of things about all this stuff, but I know that network can help a lot if u know right people, I saw a lot of postings people got hired with no internships, pet-projects etc and I understand they're not majority but it still makes me not losing hope)  


thank you a lot for your time."

So, this is what I woke up to. This was probably the only program for which I had done extensive background research, spent countless amount of time with previous year admits and tailored for application specifically for it.

In all the good hope and encouragement they have provided, I thought I had a good shot at this but turned out to be otherwise. This was hell of a learning experience and a wonderful ride of introspection. I've had the opportunity of meeting some wonderful folks here on reddit and various groups who've been nothing but kind and generous. Thanks for all that.

Congratulations to all the admits. Well deserved and Im damn sure you must have worked hard for it!To all the rejects, this might seem like the end of the world. but it isn't! Its only the beginning!

My GPA is around 3.5 right now but its probably going to be around 3.3-3.5 by the time I graduate. I go to a great university for engineering, and it kind of encourages me to want to aim high for grad school.

I want to start research asap, but it seems like a lot of cool research is also being done in fields like astronomy and physics(they have EE/CS components to their research, but the research isn't in the ECE department). Will it be more beneficial to try to stick to research within the Electrical Computer Engineering department? To that end, does the field you do research in as an undergraduate matter for grad admissions (or do they just want you to have experience doing research)?

Furthermore, I know my GPA isn't awful, but its not great either. Will my GPA be a weak spot for me? If so, what would be the safe threshold for GPA so that it doesn't bring down the rest of my application?

Also, apparently I need three letters of rec? How do I get them? Are they with professors I do research with, or an internship boss, or with a professor that teaches a class?

I am deciding whether to choose U of T as the university to go to so I had a few doubts. (I am mainly confused between UWaterloo and U of T)

I am an international CS student and have been admitted into St. Mike's College. (St. George Campus)

&amp;#x200B;

Please answer these questions:

1. Since there is no coop at UTSG, I will have to find internships myself. So, is finding internships difficult or does UTSG help in providing internships?
2. What should be the total duration of the internships I do during the 4 years?
3. I have also heard that U of T is more hectic than UWaterloo. Is this true?
4. After graduation, I wish to stay and work in Canada. So will I get a better paying job in Canada from UWaterloo or U of T?
5. I also thought about doing undergrad at UWaterloo and grad at U of T. Is this a good idea? Or would it be better to do both undergrad and grad at U of T?

&amp;#x200B;

It would be of great help if you could answer these questions. Thank you!"

I’ve been looking for a internship to gain some experience in the CE realm before graduation and have been applying to internships and coops. Got an offer out of state where they’re willing to pay for housing and I am being asked to make a decision within the week but it will delay my graduation for a semester as it is through the summer and fall. The positives are that it would be in electrical engineering which is a current weak point in my resume and gives me additional experience before graduation. Negatives are all the logistical issues of moving to a new state for 6 months and delaying my graduation a semester. Not overly interested at working at this company after graduation. At this point in my education what should I be prioritizing my graduation or work/tech experience?

I'm just asking for somewhat more tailored input which is why I made my own post.

Hi everyone! I'm a CS major (obv) that will be starting Fall 2023, and I was looking for some general advice. I'm going to go over what I've already done as well as what I plan to do. If you have any generalized advice to supplement/augment my plan, it would be extremely appreciated.

I'm currently on a gap year because I had a kidney transplant in August. I've decided to use this extra time I've been given to learn, network, and overall grow as a person.

In December, I started CS50P and I am also taking CS50X (Harvard's intro CS courses, the former being for Python). Aside from that I've been working on some little projects just to increase my knowledge overall. Each week I learn more and more, whether it be programming language-specific or general theory. I plan on buying a book or two on DSA related stuff to gather a decent understanding.

I know that much of this is far from needed, but again, I have the time so I see no negatives. I have a friend who is a current TA for my college's intro CS course, and he was able to secure the gig as a freshman. I'm going to attempt to follow in his footsteps and TA second semester provided all goes well. I've also secured an on-campus job first semester.

Aside from that, I'm in contact with a few current students (some CS, some not) who I've been discussing the curriculum with as well as planning out my general course of action. Connecting and expanding my network of people is huge and I've been succeeding at that lately.

Later on, I am going to attempt to get involved in some undergraduate research, provided I make the most of opportunities presented to me. Also, I want to join some clubs and possibly get some leadership experience there.

Aside from all of this, I'm obviously going to be grinding Leetcode, seeking internship opportunities (and applying) and all that stuff.

Anyways, do you guys have any suggestions? Not sure if my plan is comprehensive enough and I'd just like any input that may help me (or others!). Thank you in advance!"

I am creating this post because I find it very difficult to find a job that fits me.

Some background as reference: I studied a graduate in programming 4 years ago (C# web development), after that I decided I didnt want to become a programmer because there is to little interaction and its just sitting at a desk all day. I worked as a medical technician for 2 years in a hopsital and I loved some parts: first line dispatch (on-site all the time), picking up phones, some deeper knowlodge of some devices. Left because if internal difficulties in the organization (saw 3 differt CEOs in those 2 years, so it wasnt a very stable company).

After that I decided to study System- and network engineering. I'm a last year student now, doing my internship of 5 months in a IT-integrator. But... i hate it. Again, sitting at a desk all day, its pretty complicated stuff and everything is cloud based and they hate it to go on-site. This is very different than my previous job where it was normal to go on site instantly. I had one meeting, thought it would be fun: doing a teams call with 1 guy working at home and the other guy sitting next to you but still doing like you arent there in person... how... .

So here is the question im facing, i dont know what to look for in a job.

I like IT definitly: switches, cables, access points, end-devices. I also like the end-user side: applications and software, explaining to non-technical staff.
I love technology, worked in a electronics store as a student.
I want to walk around, connect and talk to people, be active on the job.

But I just dont know what im searching for. Account manager, pre sales, support in a bigger company.
Its important for me that it isnt to 'complicated', i dont what to go very deep in techical thinks (ex. Security specialist, Azure enigeer).

Hope someone can help me with this.
Thanks in advance!

My master's internship (which was a continuation of a previous Phd student's work, said student had already defended when the internship started) was done in the same lab as I am doing my Phd. The subject of this internship was unrelated to my Phd.

We are working toward publication of the work that was accomplished during the master's internship.

However, we hesitate between publishing 1 or 2 paper.

Either group the contribution of the previous Phd student and mine in one paper, which we will then submit to this journal : ""IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems"". I would be second author for this article, the first author being the previous Phd student.

Or make one separate conference paper for my contribution in this conference : ""Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference"", where I would be first author. Another paper would then be made to present the previous Phd student contribution.

I've worked my butt off these past four years, never grinded as much as I did and I'm proud for how far I came but now that it's coming to an end, I'm honestly super scared. I have an internship lined up which I know is something I should be grateful for but after being in school for SO long it feels absolutely surreal to be entering a new chapter in life. I've made great friends who support me, but there's this constant emptiness I feel. Maybe it's anxiety...where im nervous my friends won't be friends in a few months or maybe its the process of officially adulting. Being here at UF has changed me. I feel like I've become a stronger person and I've made so many great memories here and part of me doesn't want to leave but also I feel relieved because the emotional turmoil I've had to go through to make it out alive academically is another level of insanity.

I'm currently considering grad school...but I've also never felt so burned out in my life. I'm not sure if I want to take a break and come back and get my masters degree or if I should just push through one more year. And even if I did want to, the GMAT has been kicking me hard and I don't even know if I will be able to get the score I need. Idk...its a lot but I've been trying to reflect but life just keeps pushing me in different directions every time.

Hope everyone is having a great spring break!"

I have a B.S. in health care management, worked very hard through undergrad, graduated one year early (2020) did two internships, worked PT and full time. 

I live in a small town, and I just seem to have bad luck with jobs. 

In undergrad, got an office assistant job in a practice where the lead dr was absolutely nuts — so nuts that they drove all of the full time employees to quit at the same time. Also took a CNA job where I was absolutely overworked and ended up quitting there shortly after. 

After undergrad, it took me about 7 months to land an office job that required a bachelor’s degree. Paying $35k. But I took it because I couldn’t find anything else. I worked there for about a year, and I obviously needed to make more money. 

While employed, I submitted job apps consistently and was strung along by a regional health care system for 5 months before I learned I got the job. They blamed it on some of their systems being down. I accepted the position because even though the HR/management was a red flag, I wasn’t having any luck anywhere else. The job description looked interesting and it was almost a 70% raise. 

When I started there, the environment at the job was just weird. Cubicles in a basement, one window in the corner away from all employees. All you could hear was the heater/AC running constantly. No one ever talked to each other. Tried to spark convo but all were just very disengaged. I’m an introvert and I don’t care if I make friends with people at work. But I didn’t realize that I really needed to talk to someone every once in a while on the job. This was silence about 8.5-9hrs a day, 5 days a week, in a basement with really no windows, accompanied by a blasting heater/air conditioner. 

Boss at this job was just bad. On the first day, gave me a packet of about 2 pages to read, didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day and then went on vacation the next day. Boss was gone for two weeks and when they came back, they didn’t really give me instruction. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing despite seeking help multiple times. Boss took multiple vacations and then was out for about 1.5 months due to a medical procedure. I just sat confused for about 9 months until I went completely stir crazy and quit. During that job, I went through about 3 phases where I applied for jobs for about a week, realized I wasn’t going to find a new one, then quit searching and settled with the job I had. 

My search has been riddled with mishaps: multiple recruiters not calling me for the phone screening after scheduling it, getting to the 3rd round of interviews and not getting the job or learning that they didn’t have money in the budget for the job so they aren’t filling it, applying for multiple govt jobs that were outdated (they had been already filled or placed on hold and the website wasn’t updated), rejection emails for 100+ jobs before the chance to interview, and not hearing back from the majority of companies where I applied etc

I’m just frustrated. I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining bc I know there have been people who go years without having a job or have jobs with conditions that are much worse. 

I don’t know what the point of this post was other than to vent. If you’re reading this and have gotten this far, thanks. If you resonate with my experiences, you’re not alone."

To put it simply, my question is not about personal/intellectual fulfillment (be sure that I have already asked myself the question, and the answer is positive) but rather with a view to optimize my future career.

I am still very young and I would like to take advantage of your advice to make the right decisions for my early career.

I wanted to know if doing this second master could bring me added value in my profile and help me stand out from the crowd from a purely professional point of view.

I have the somewhat naive idea that a mixed profile ""Applied Maths - CS"" can be something rather well seen in the world of Data &amp; AI, especially since the OMSCS (cheap) would allow me to work and therefore to accumulate 3 years of experience (with 2 masters in hand).
Btw I know that this world is not easy to integrate at the Junior level, which is why I seek to maximize my chances.

I don't yet have a very precise idea of the kind of job I want to do, but let's say that the Data Scientist / ML Engineer descriptions speak to me a lot.

Typically I'm the type of guy who likes to rack their brains and solve problems with ML. I always try within the limit of my knowledge to build a ""clean"" solution easy to re-operate/deploy/maintain (even if I am extremely far from the level of an SWE).

To briefly describe my profile:

- I already have some professional experience including an internship as a Data Analyst (4 months) and an apprenticeship as a Data Scientist (currently doing until my graduation)

- I like to code, I don't think I'm excellent but let's say I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty when necessary (I do it to my heart's content if it's in python lol).

- I have very basic knowledge in computer science, but I am extremely comfortable in mathematics.

- I do a lot of solo projects to feed my portfolio and improve my skills

- I follow a lot of MOOCs (Coursera, EdX...)

- In the very long term (more 10-12 years of experience) I see myself switching to a more management/strategy oriented career if I stay in a company (why not thinking about a MBA), or else trying to start my own business with all the skills I could have acquired

Thanks in advance all those who will take the time to answer me!

My job hunt has been extremely frustrating as it seems that very few people are hiring for entry-level, especially in data science and AI.       

I’ve got a few options lined up:      

1) Move on to a PhD.     
2) Become a Data Engineer (SQL, Spark).    
3) Go for standard web development with Node.js / React / Typescript.      

Option 1 sounds like doubling down on a bad bet.           

Option 2 maybe will lead me to the same situation again, but now as a would-be data engineer having to deal with no entry-level jobs available.          

Option 3 sounds like it could definitely work out, although it seems like it doesn’t fit my background very well, and I’d be running against a competition that has been focused on web development all the way long.

We made a lot of assumptions in our conversation and I am writing this post to hopefully gain some perspective on things :).

My friend and I are both final year computing students in university and recently we were having a conversation about fresh graduate roles. I specialise in Web Development and have a preference for frontend dev. My friend however, has focused much more on the backend side of things in both his internships and university education.

He mentioned that since we are computing students, it might be wiser if we start our careers as Backend Devs since he feels like the barriers of entry are higher for non-computing students. 

Additionally, it’ll be easier for us to hop from Backend Dev to Fullstack/Frontend Dev as compared to Frontend Dev to Fullstack/Backend Dev because you learn much more (“technical”) things that are harder to pick up later in your career such as writing code for business logic, diving into some infrastructure stuff, learning how to set up load balancing properly. 

I was also wondering if it is easier for a Backend Dev to rise to a management role/promote as compared to a Frontend Dev since you might have a better understanding of the business logic.

What are your thoughts on this matter?"

So there is a small company that has been doing really innovative work in the field I am interested in, I was trying to get on a call with them for almost 3 months, everything worked out and we got on a call recently, Me and the CTO,
Before anything was said, he clarified that at this point he is not sure if he can pay me for the internship, since they do not do internships and are currently looking for senior roles being a small startup, but they were willing to make an exception, I agreed to it at the moment because I felt there was a great learning potential here even if I didn’t make money.

He expressed that he was highly interested in my profile because it was similar to his when he was at my age. And we got talking and shared a lot of ideas. (He was visibly more interested than I was, and I was very interested Ngl) 

The company isn’t based in Ireland, he offered that I could work remotely from Ireland or they could arrange a work visa for me if I wish to work from European office location in Stockholm.

For context- I applied to 110+ companies for internships and I got rejected at most since they were looking for a third/ fourth year student and most that did get back to me with an offer couldn’t help with work permits or was offering a longer internship than just summer. Which is an issue for me because I am an international student here.

Now I don’t know if I should be taking on an internship that is unpaid and I need your advice on that."

Idk if anyone feels this way, but I feel like I’m stuck in this loop where, because I’m not the smartest/have experience, then I don’t get into internships/research, and that causes me to not gain any experience or knowledge, etc. and it’s just so annoying.

We the students of SGRR tried to protest against the same and were opposed by a determined violence and harsh words from the authorities who appointed goons to beat up my fellow students,  our tents were broken and torn apart and tractors and bulldozers were used to suppress our voices, even media wasn't allowed to capture the mistreatments against us, many were injured physically but the greatest scar is still the mental scar given to us by this college.

Such acts by a reputed college is utterly shameful and irresponsible, this incident has left us with depression and suicidal tendencies as all lights of hope and all path forward have been closed to us, who will be responsible if, god forbid, something happens to a student, if someone tries to take his/her life in this deep pressure, the parents are highly burdened by the financial strain and seeing this condition of their children. In a country like India where doctors are considered as gods and life savers, such behaviors against the future doctors is totally unacceptable and totally obstructs dream of many MBBS aspirants.

I request your kind support and demand help in these desperate times, I also request all my fellow students and all my fellow medicos to unite with us against this misconduct and tyranny, This is a hard time for the students of SGRR and we students are the voice and the future of India and we should unitedly stand against this.

So I basically want to study Comp Sci abroad as a third-world-country national and then subsequently settle in the country of studies. Have posted here recently seeking guidance on my predicament. In that post, I talked about how English-speaking countries like UK cost about 50k per annum in their national currency with living expenses included, whereas countries that cost significantly less, like Germany, require you to learn their national language up to C1 before applying. The deed that will take me 2 years to surmount. I'll be 25 by that time. Now, some of you suggested that I should look into EU/Nordic countries whose fees are moderate for non-EU students with a handful of English-taught programs to choose from. The problem I see with this is that it will be extremely difficult to network and procure internships when studying in a country with zero knowledge of its national language. So I'm basically setting myself up for failure in the subsequent job-hunt. What are your thoughts? Should I really just bite the bullet, learn German and begin my undergraduate ed at 25?"

11rfvew,44,2023-03-14,Should I accept SWE Internship offer or Data Science/data engineering Internship offer?,just_tryna_get_it_tg,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11rfvew/should_i_accept_swe_internship_offer_or_data/,"I'm a 3rd year CS major and got 2 internship offers and stuck on which to choose. My data science internship is for a top 15 fortune 500 company and the SWE internship offer is around \~50 of the Fortune 500. I initially wanted to go with the data science one but people are telling me that if I don't like it it'll be harder to get a SWE role while on the other hand its easier to switch from SWE into data science later on. Is this true? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I heard its hard to get a full time data science role without a masters and I'm not sure if I want to pursue a masters. I'm kind of stuck on if I should just go with the SWE internship role just because its ""safer"". (and I don't know if I want to pursue long term because I don't have real experience yet with SWE or data science so not sure what I am more interested in)."

I tried to get this done by my junior/senior year of college but the pandemic hit and most employers dipped out of my application pool and those that remained declined me... but now I'm starting to post across different message boards to hopefully build connections as well as get python certified with google via Coursera. Am I going in the right direction? should I be doing more? Is it too late for me? or am I just a complete idiot? Regardless, I have a retail job that pays decently for me at least but I would like to pursue my career even if it means being paid less.

11rgdu0,6,2023-03-14,Take somewhat related job to software engineering while I continue to look?,Exkadrill,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11rgdu0/take_somewhat_related_job_to_software_engineering/,"I graduated in May with a B.s in CompSci and have made 2 final interviews for a SWE jobs but no offers. I recently got an offer for a consulting job.  There is a marginal amount of coding involved, and in a proprietary coding language similar to Java.  Basic SQL statements are also used.  Other potentially transferable experience would be working in an Agile environment.  A CS degree is not required for the job, and most of the people in the role have an IT degree or an Information Science degree to give an explanation of the actual amount of CompSci expertise they were looking for.

Due to life events/trying to get through school in a shorter amount of time, I took summer classes instead of taking an internship during college (a mistake I know), and I know this is one of the reasons it is so difficult for me to find a job.

It seems like most of the people who were in my position eventually go into data science or another consulting or management job.  I was only able to find a few people who went into software engineering after holding my position on LinkedIn, and they either had a Masters in IT prior to taking this job or a prior SWE internship.  The pay is decent (65k/yr remote work + benefits) but would taking this job hurt my prospects of eventually going into Software Engineering?"
11rhcih,13,2023-03-14,Master's at GSU vs Bachelor's at Tech,Fantastic_End4507,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11rhcih/masters_at_gsu_vs_bachelors_at_tech/,"I'm currently a freshman at Georgia State University Honors College doing a math minor and a bachelor's degree in CS. I have the option to apply for an integrated master's program which means I'd be doing a master's while I do my bachelor's (also called the 4+1 program). Currently, I am also a junior by credits - which means I can potentially graduate w just my bachelor's in as little as 3 more semesters. Moreover, I have a scholarship at GSU as well, which comes out to about 1.5k a semester on top of my Zell Miller scholarship.

However, for those who aren't aware, a lot of people are always saying that Georgia Tech is more prestigious and a better name to have on your resume, especially for Computer Science. I suppose they have a better/more rigorous CS program as well compared to the one at GSU. And yes, because of the prestige associated with the name, it is easier to get a good internship at Tech.

Tech has a BS/MS program too, but I would have to add on like an extra 2 years or something and the courses are already so stressful I'm not sure if I'd even opt for it there. I'd also have to retake a lot of the classes I've taken at GSU. I also would not have a scholarship at Tech, and I would have to take out student loans (something I don't have to do at GSU).

I want to go into academia, maybe even aim for a pHD. I'm heavily considering doing an MBA after graduating if I stick with GSU, possibly at Tech or at even higher ranked schools if possible. The research opportunities at Tech and GSU are pretty much equal, especially if you're a part of the Honors college like I am. I want to be able to fall back on working if academia doesn't work out, though.

Even as I'm writing this I can't help but lean towards staying at GSU, but I need some unbiased opinions here instead of only opinions from GSU or Tech subreddits (posting there results in all the GSU people telling me to stay and all the Tech people telling me to transfer, lol).

So, given all of this, is it really worth it to transfer to Tech?

Tl;dr:

GSU

* Scholarship
* Honors college
* less rigor
* no student loans
* graduate early with a Master's
* worse internship options
* equal research opportunity

GA Tech

* No scholarships
* no Honors college
* more rigor
* student loans
* graduate late with probably no Master's
* better internship options
* equal research opportunity

Which one should I choose?"

First, I want to learn a new programming language which can help me understand core software engineering nuances, I am not a big fan of shiny libraries and frameworks, I have considered learning between Golang JavaScript or Python (Django specifically) to get started with Web Dev, but not able to make a choice.

Secondly, I am searching for a SWE internship for this summer but haven’t gotten a single interview (Not being in the co-op program now hurts), not even basic data analyst roles. I already have an existing SWE internship under my belt which was at a good tech startup company. 

What I have noticed about myself is that I tend to be more interested in application engineering ( Like writing my own compiler, create things from scratch) and tend to ease my way out of web dev because of trends changing every single day and they don’t teach us pure software engineering. I request all my fellow engineers and computer scientists to guide me with these two problems."

I originally started out as wanting to become an App Developer, learnt Flutter for a while but then turned my full attention to iOS Development. I got pretty comfortable with designing the frontend using Swift and SwifttUI, but then I was extremely demotivated after a bad internship, release of ChatGPT and rumors of App Developers being outdated. 

I then switched my focus to Cyber Security, mainly Penetration Testing. I’ve acquired pretty good knowledge about network testing, MITM, OWASP, etc. But I still have miles to go. However I still miss iOS Development sometimes and have been feeling extremely demotivated to study anything in Cyber Sec these days.
Now the dilemma is that I want to leave my part time job as a Videographer in the next 2 to 3 months and join the IT Sector full time, But I am extremely confused about which field I should get into, iOS Development or Cyber Security.

TL;DR: Software fresher confused between iOS Dev and Cyber Security as career path. Basically need help choosing a career path that won’t become obsolete and will still offer good pay in India/Abroad. Any help will be greatly appreciated."

I really didn't like my major and I was going through some personal issues...I had to lwd a course and also had to cr/ncr an elective.  So obviously I got a 2.0 for my first year cgpa.

Coming up to my second year, I decided to change and now I'm studying harder and I also switched my major to which I actually care about.

My gpa is looking pretty ok right now, hitting a 3.5-6.

Now my concern is that my cgpa is still pretty low because of my first year gpa.  Although I'm doing way better and is expecting to maintain a 3.3 and higher GPA throughout my upper-years, I'm just really worried that my first year GPA would give a negative impact in terms of job searching, internships, RA position, etc.

11rlhdd,86,2023-03-15,Intervention for those who want to do an UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE ON A LOAN: DON'T,attofreak,Indians_StudyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/comments/11rlhdd/intervention_for_those_who_want_to_do_an/,"my_qualifications: BE in India, MSc in UK, PhD in Germany, Working in Germany for over a decade.

Seeing a lot of these posts lately: literal high school kids, who betray their lack of understanding of financing loans and job market (ignoring the mess of politics and bigotry abroad), fishing for guides on how to do an *undergraduate* course abroad, *on a loan*.

##**Exceptions**

Now, if you were from a rich family, that can afford the costs of undergraduate course abroad - go for it. If you have already proved your acumen and wunderkind talents, and already got a scholarship (partial/full) lined up for an undergraduate degree abroad - go for it.

\*should add one more from u/AverageBrownGuy01: if you are going to some countries that offer reasonable costs of education/living + where you can defray education costs through part-time work (i.e. don't require a loan), in countries like Germany, maybe France too, then it's still okay. You just have to handle balancing between studies and part-time job. Also, you might need to learn the language (especially in France, they are very anal about it).

There are other ""cheaper"" destination like Poland, Italy, Hungary, and all of east Europe - but seriously, it's not worth going there. Things are already bad enough, and how they treated Indian students during Ukraine refugee crisis should be warning enough, if one pays attention.

##**Back to Reality**

But if you're a middle-class kid (or worse) who thinks they can just

1. get an acceptance letter for an undergraduate course,

2. get a loan north of 70-80 lakhs at an affordable interest,

3. get a job immediately after graduation, with a salary to service the gargantuan debt you just hefted on your shoulders,

you are seriously underestimating the scale of this whole ""enterprise"", and very likely overestimating your abilities. Everyone has a Bachelors these days, these countries abroad are saturated with their own citizens with 100,000s in debts and a Bachelors degree that didn't get them a job - you have next to 0% chance of getting a job. You cannot be given a special treatment because you're a minority with a Bachelors. Almost all the employers in these countries have to justify to the Immigration Authorities *why* they selected you over the millions unemployed at home. You are not making your case with a Bachelors degree. And the racist demographic just doesn't want you there, no matter what (mental gymnastics you do to justify the racism against yourself). Your only ""best bet"" is to get a Postgrad degree from abroad, where there is some kind of shortage.

If you really think about it for a second, **you have an advantage over the students in developed countries:** you can get a *globally recognised* Bachelors degree at home, for fees that are still cheaper than the costs abroad (even at lakhs in fees, it's cheaper), and then you can apply for a Masters in these developed countries and still have a chance! **Why the hell would you throw away this advantage, when you already have so few to begin with?** If you cannot score a seat at home, for a Bachelors degree, you are not ready to get anything abroad.

**I am not trying to discourage you**, but someone has to make you confront the truth. If you cannot grow up to reality now, you're setting yourself to be stuck in a spiral of frustrations and failures - a lot of which would be your doing. I have seen this mindset before: inflate yourself like you're some ""underdog"" in a cringe Indian movie who, ""will show everyone!/sabko dikha denge!"" how awesome you are, and maybe an equally cringe background music will play while you walk off in slow motion (with the optional gori ladki/ladka by your side). Then you crash and burn, blame everyone but yourself, and keep reaffirming that mentality through the rest of your life. Meanwhile, you are wasting the most crucial years of your life chasing fantasies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##**What might work: aim for the moon but with your feet on the ground**

For this demographic (middle to lower class aiming for bachelors abroad), a more realistic approach is needed, with a ""backup plan"", so at least you will have a foundation on which you can earn a respectable living (and maybe apply *later* for studies abroad):

1. **do your undergraduate *at home*.** I know, we all want to live abroad, in the supposed heaven where there is absolutely no racism and you'll be welcomed with open arms in the community and at work. But you need to work with what you have got. Study diligently for your boards, prepare for entrance exams at home. Get a good college at home first, before you build air castles for anywhere else.

2. **study diligently even at college.** First 4 semesters, build your academic record. Try to aim for a high CGPA/GPA (8/10 or 4/5, pass with distinction, whatever the scale). Build a good rapport with the professors/seniors who do projects with professors. Attend competitions/engineering fests, build your extracurricular skills. 2 years is a long time to do all this, and take advantage of this time and ""energy of youth"" that you will likely never experience ever again in your life - use it to build foundations of your careers, rather than fool around. By end of 4th semester/beginning 5th semester, look for starting projects under the research-inclined professors in your college or any other college. It might be possible to start a serious project earlier, depends entirely on you.

3. **do good projects, get internships.** You are now preparing for LORs and SOPs you'll be writing. You have to show that *despite* the cards you were dealt with, you did all you can to make the most of it/reach the max of your potential. College Administrations are looking for students who are capable of adapting to their circumstances, to achieve the best possible versions of themselves - these are the students worth bragging about as Alumni.

4. **complete all the GRE/TOEFLs/what have you, a year before the end of your college degree.** If you are graduating in 2025, by May-June of 2024, you should be giving your GRE/TOEFLs/what have you, at the latest. You will start applying the summer of 2024 for Fall Semester of 2025. You will get a decision by late 2024/early 2025, and then you will begin the visa application process.

5. ***now*, with the acceptance letter in your hand, apply for loans/arrange funds.** You have a better chance of getting hired with a Masters. Companies can justify it, Immigration Agencies are inclined to accept it, there is less political friction at that level.\* As a Masters holder, you will also get better remuneration to service your debt and live a good enough life, save for future.

\*Ideally, plan for a PhD abroad. There are many really good institutions for Masters in India, even if it's very difficult to get in. Just to let you know, there are many paths, don't shackle yourself up early to one that destroys your career before it even begins.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I get the desperation. And with the pseudo-intellectual harangue of tv shows/web series/movies on the misery of your life, you feel a new era of ""peer pressure"" to throw away every real opportunity you have to chase those you don't - you are setting yourself for massive disappointment, with no one else to blame but yourself.

If you take a second to think about it, you kind of know you are lacking the motivation/abilities to score in entrance exams in India. You are hyping yourself up to hide those inner insecurities/anxieties/uncertainties of your future. It becomes a desperate escape from reality where you push all your hopes and happiness on a future version of yourself that doesn't exist. As painful as it is to acknowledge it, you need to come back to reality and work with what you have.

There is, ""a way out"", but you have to set realistic goals first. And stop lying to yourself."

I was fortunate enough to get an internship for this summer as a Data Management Analyst Intern at a bank with the potential for new grad offer at the end (assuming all goes well). This internship is the closest position to a career in Data Science that I was able to get. From what I’ve seen (correct me if I’m wrong), I will probably need to pursue a Masters in Data Science if this is truly a field that I wish to pursue. 

Here’s where the advice comes in: would it be better to go straight from undergrad to Masters program in DS or (if I receive a return offer) start my career at this company, see how I like it and where it takes me, and then pursue a masters later if it’s still something I desire? 

Currently leaning toward the latter since the act of getting a Masters does not necessarily mean I can secure a job in the field, especially with how new grad roles seem to be as of late. Also if it makes a difference, my university offers a 5 year masters program in Computer Science (meaning +1 year for masters) which I was considering if I wanted to get into Machine Learning, but would a Masters program as broad as “Computer Science” be any helpful for this anyway? Or would I instead want to pursue a more specific program. Any input is welcome!"

1- software development (mostly web/database classes and some compilers classes)

2- data science (similar to software development but replaces some of the webdev classes with stuff about big data, data mining, and statistics).

3- Intelligent systems (has an expert systems class, virtual reality.. Etc)

4- Machine learning (replaces some of the mentioned with deep learning, big data, internet of things..)

5- systems and networks (I've always been interested in systems and low level programming, but I am not a fan of the nature of must jobs involving networks).



I know many people argue that these specialisations are not important when you graduate, and an internship is much more useful but I am trying to work with what I have and I feel like the type of classes that I take even if they won't prepare me for a career, at least they would push me toward a general direction.

If I was to consider what I find 'interesting' then I would say data engineering jobs sounds cool, or something to do with working with low level languages idk, I just hate web/android dev.

I know there is a whole world I haven't explored yet but a couple of things I have been exploring are implementations of models in AWS or Azure. Also, I started learning SQL and DBMS, and I started learning web development with Django as a framework but I don't feel like these two are benefitting me as much to learn.

Company 1: 

Big well known company, you will see their products like 20 times a day by just taking a walk in a big city. Dominates the market.

Lower pay, chill work, I will mostly learn soft skills as the technical tasks are not very challenging. I would work in a group of 5 interns.

Small unknown defense company (like 50 employees) , nobody has heard of it, dominates the market however it does not sell to civilians.

Higher pay, very challenging work, I would learn a lot but might be stressful. I would work alone on the project.

I am thinking that first company would be better long term, as it would look great on my resume, however the things I will be doing there won’t impress a future employer as much as the things from company 2, (will impress the HR tho),I could always emphasize on the team work aspect from company 1 however.

So for a variety of reasons (including getting sick, and a really bad depressive episode that started week 5 and is ongoing) I didn't necessarily perform as well as I wanted to this quarter. suffice to say I dropped from a 4.0 to a 3.3. 

I do acknowledge that a 3.3 is nothing to be ashamed of at all, I just want to know if I just blocked myself from internships and on campus work opportunities (like CSE tutor) this early into my college career. If I did, how do I get myself back on track. 

I know this post seems paranoid, but my performance this quarter was quite bad and I only barely passed my classes and I've never done this poorly before in academics (I consider myself a serious student) and I just want to know if a single ""bad quarter"" is going to set me back by a lot. I've never had a ""bad semester"" in high school so this type of thing is a first for me."

I enrolled in an economics programme at the top university in my country, had to take a break in between due to COVID and mental health, then after completing 5 semesters realised that this was not what I wanted to do at all and decided to switch majors. I had to wait 6 months for readmission (since changing majors was not possible due to being in my 3rd year and low gpa) and here I am, almost done with my second semster in CS, not unhappy but quite overwhelmed atm.

The only cs related courses Ive completed till now are intro to computing and intro to programming. While i do enjoy programming and feel like I have a knack for it, I dont think I fully understand the theory behind it or its real world application, since we only use intellij at our university. This wasmt helped by the fact that my intro to computing instructor is famous for passing students without teaching anything, and so I barely have an understanding of how the machines work, DNS etc. I wonder if ill develope a better understanding as I continue with my degree or these are issues I should focus on now.

I'm also curious if, with my level of skill, its possible to get some part time work or internship in this field. My financial situation hasnt been great and i  would prefer improving my knowledge while earning whatever I can at this level.

Cheers."
11rs1fc,3,2023-03-15,iOS career questions,PsychoticBolt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11rs1fc/ios_career_questions/,"Hello everyone, i have been having a dilemma recently about the path of my career and since im pretty new to it, it would be very helpful if someone could help me out and answer a few questions. Im pretty sure theres people in the iOS field here and they worked for a while.

A couple years ago i decided and went to intern in iOS programming and liked it very much. 

Now with a couple years experience im searching for a job and im having no luck. iOS junior's are not really wanted that much. Im studying and still helping out this senior freelancer who pays me descent but its part time and not really viable.

I want to maybe start working on an own project that would be cool you use but thinking about it being iOS only and the app store is literally flooded with all kinds of app juniors are able to build just discourages me to start. 
When you see web dev or anything for windows is just much more able to produce on their own.

Will i ever be able to become anything more than a senior developer who works for a company his whole life? 

And how do i even reach senior level experience when everyone is hiring only seniors?"
11rsu7v,2,2023-03-15,Feeling lost in the search for the first tech related job,ana_non,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11rsu7v/feeling_lost_in_the_search_for_the_first_tech/,"I've been looking at job offers to get an idea of what to expect once I finish my bachelor's degree, and also because I've been trying to find a part-time to help my family pay for my University fees.

While I've been as open as possible when i was looking for a part-time, since the kind of job doesn't matter too much to me as long as it allows me to keep studying, it would be nice if it was something tech related, as i can get some experience under the belt and an idea of what it's actually like to work in this field 

 The problem I'm facing is that all of these entry positions are usually full time and require being proficient in 5+ coding languages with 2+ other languages added in where they dont ask proficiency but expect you to still be able to read/modify code in.

While I like the courses we've studied, most of the classes we've had so far are pure math and logic, the only coding language we've actually studied is java, with some touches of SQL and Lisp (though I have been studying python on the side, and i think i can code in both java and python with the same proficiency).

I've been mostly looking through Indeed, and I live in Italy.

My questions are:

\-  is this considered normal for those kind of positions? 

\- am I looking in the wrong place? 

\- should I try harder to find tech related jobs even if in a year or so there would be a period of internship where i would be guided by my University?

TLDR: Student is trying to get into the tech/coding field early to help pay for the University fee and to get experience early, stares at the pc for 4 hours every night looking at entry level jobs with an ""x (Needed)/ x (Proficient)"" list that makes him scroll more than 2 times to reach the end."

I am writing as someone who has finished a 4-year bachelor of science degree with a year-long research project in my final year. About a year since my graduation I've been struggling to find any work as a research assistant. My application attempts have left me either completely ghosted or a rejection letter and for what it's worth, I've sent out about 70 applications. 

I recognise the fact that I don't have any work experience as a research intern or lab technician does not help my chances, but I am trying my best to leverage all the other jobs I did in undergrad, by highlighting the transferrable skills within my cover letters. 

I am applying to mostly lab-based molecular biology work, I've had extensive experience in conducting PCRs/Gel electrophoreses, DNA/RNA extractions, and microbial culturing in my research year. I do also have a decent-ish GPA, with it being in the mid 3s/4. I understand I'm not the most stellar candidate, but I am trying to navigate out of this situation to the best of my ability. 

My question was: what avenues are open for graduates like me to get into research work? I do plan on pursuing a career in research and I really wanted to get in work experience before pursuing further education. Would emailing labs and asking to volunteer be a viable option? 

Thank you"

Offer 2: This offer if a Software Engineer Intern position for a less known Tech company. In this role I would be working alongside people who are Software Engineers and working on a Summer-long project specific to Software. The location of this internship is perfect and I believe I will get much more experience in the field I am interested in. The only downside is they are only offering me $22/hour compared to the $40/hour for the other position.

Now I on the other hand, barely had any experience, just an internship of \~3 months under my belt when I accepted this offer (I've been 11 months with this company so far).

The salary is very good for someone in my position and my fellow co-workers are enjoyable to work with, however I am learning nothing; it's mostly just dealing with people processes, administration, and sending emails... which is very demoralizing and monotonous.

I've constantly asked for more and more technical work, but I'm not getting any. I hate sitting around and doing nothing for almost the whole day. Everyday I worry about if I get laid off, I won't have the technical expertise to land me another job.

I can say with 100% confidence, any other job out there will not even come close to what I'm making now so the question here is, do I jump ship and try to find another job that will grant me lots of learning potential or do I stick with a high-paying job with no learning potential.

Hi! I'm 26 years old and I'd like to work in Renewable Energy Project Finance, preferencially in a bank. Here's my path/cv until now:

1) i have a masters in electrical engineering, and i chose the field of Energy and the Specialty of Electricity Markets (all of this within the masters)

2) i did my thesis in a retail electricity company where i developed a tool that helped to create electricity tariffs to be charge their clients (nothing special, was all done in excell)

3) i have been working for 1.5 years in a research center. My field is renewable energy communities (REC) and im in a project with a company to devellop a digital app to manage a REC. Here's a resume of what i've done at work so far:
_coded part of that app (not much, just a little  bit in python)
_done some economical feasibility studies for the company to present the savings their customers can have by forming a REC instead of being just self-consumers
_done several tests to the app using excel to confirm that the values presented are correct
_formulated and computed an optimization problem to size the assets (pv and storage) of a REC, which includes its investments and operation
_co-authored and presented a paper about governance and business models for RECs in the european energy markets conference Last year
_probably gonna present another paper about REC regulation in the same conference this year
_im co-orienting a master thesis and an internship

Besides that:
_ i have done the google project management course,
 _im finishing the financial modeling and valuation analyst course (by corporate finance instiitute, it's pretty good!!) 
_i will do the commercial banking and credit analyst course (by corporate finance instiitute)
_ I will also an online course of project finance for renewable energy ( at financialmodelonline)

My next dream job is project finance of renewable energy in a bank

AND in an european country that pays very well (switzerland is the dream but i like the idea of going to London too)

 I intend to start applying at july.

So, i'd be very thankfull for any tips/suggestions/recommendations that you can give me that will help me land this job, specially considering that i will be competing against candidates with more financial background than me 🙃"

I am a part of my college's computer science club. I have become the project manager overseeing the development of a basic advertising website for a HVAC company I used to work for. The team consists of about 11 people, all of whom are more or less newbies at programming. As such, the website will be built using basic HTML, CSS, &amp; JS. I am also aiming for an internship for the summer or fall this year.

Question: Is using vanilla web dev tech acceptable in this scenario? I mean in terms of having an impressive resume that I could get an interview over. I'm scared that the vanilla tech used will not be appealing, but the fact that 1) I am a project manager dealing with not just with code, but people &amp; logistics, and 2) at the end of the day, the website will be for a real life company, and not just a demo of sorts.

If I transition the team to use something like Next.js for example, I'll probably lose mostly all of them. Is it okay to use basic web dev tech if it means I get to have ""project manager"" experience? Will that title appeal to employers?  


Thank you"

I could really need your help!,ReturnFree6471,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/11s4fie/tus_or_maynooth_i_could_really_need_your_help/,"Hi Redditors, I'm struggling in deciding which Higher Diploma program I should do, and I'm really in need of your precious advice. 

Background: I have Social Science degrees and looking for a career change, and I have no programming experience. My goal is to finish HDip and apply for a master's program, and eventually become a developer. So here are the two options I have:

A. TUS Athlone - Higher Diploma in Agile Software Design

I was told that this program offers practical training, but the program pages reveal very little about the program's curriculum, all I know is that we'll be learning Object-Oriented Programming, Agile Design and Testing, Databases, Network and Cloud Architecture, and Web Technologies.

The main reason for me to hesitate is that life cost in Athlone is affordable, and there's a big plus - TUS has an Ericsson sponsored Master's program, which provides opportunities including paid internship and even a return offer (I don't know if an HDip student from TUS has some advantages when applying for this Master's program).

B. Maynooth University - Higher Diploma in Software Development 

I am aware that this program is pretty intense, and comparing to TUS Athlone, Maynooth also includes  Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Systems and more in its curriculum. The training I'll be receiving seems to be more solid. But I need to get first-class honor grade to apply for the Master's program at Maynooth University.

Also, he tuition of Maynooth's program is much higher, and the accommodation in Maynooth can be a huge problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry that I have taken you so much time, but I'm really bad at making decisions. Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you all!"

I also have an offer for a 3 month internship for Publicis Sapient in London.

Im totally conflicted on which one to pick, so I'd like to hear some thoughts from people in the industry or have gone through similar decisions. 

The reason I like PS is because it gives me variety of projects to work once I graduate/start working in their grad role if I get an offer back and I get experience in a lot of sectors once I graduate. Whereas Visa is more of one product but I get a year to work on myself and its a huge brand name as well. They both offer grad schemes once the internship/placement ends.

I'm really not sure which one to choose because they are both great options.

What do you guys think ?"

Recently, many peers of mine have been receiving offers for internships with return offer potential for investment banking in Summer 2024 as well as superdays for various large scale firms. I haven't even started to think about a career in finance until now and don't have anything lined up for Summer 2023 let alone Summer 2024.

I got a job offer for one and am waiting to see if I’ll be selected for a second interview for the other one. Either way, I feel really good about my chances and the value I bring to both teams. 

I’m a marketing major and haven’t had too much experience in the field other than volunteering positions, for reference. I would like to pursue the career out of college. 

However, I’m at a crossroads between these two companies and would like some guidance.

This first company is larger and more well known, so that’s a pro, it also pays more and they pride themselves on a low attrition rate and would most likely invite me back for a second internship if I do well in the position. However, the internship would be a field I have no experience in (Merchandising Control) and I’m not sure how applicable it would be if I wanted to pivot to Marketing in the future. 

The second company is smaller, but still impressive. It’s a company I truly use in my day to day life and overall I’m more excited about this opportunity. This internship is in my desired field (Marketing). However, I’m unsure if there would be any opportunities for growth outside of the internship or if I would be invited back for a second internship - assuming I do a good job and am offered a position. Also, it pays a good amount less than the first internship.

This is my first real career kickstarting summer internship, so I’m really thinking about this decision. My biggest dilemma: Should I go for an internship pertaining to my degree? Any guidance on this situation is greatly appreciated."

I found my work tedious and repetitive, and I want to switch my career track to research. I think it’s a great job, but my brain needs more stimulation. I am posting this question because I don’t see many people discussing these kinds of PhD programs, especially for research.

## My background:

I graduated from a state school 2 years ago. I studied undergrad in computer science and physics with a minor in math. Since then, I have been working as a software engineer at an enterprise. I do full-stack development and web architecture.

## What am I looking for:

I used to set total compensation as my target, probably due to the pressure from my student loan. However, I feel TC no longer matters to me. I am good at my job being a software engineer, but I don’t think it’s interesting to me. I feel like I know the answer to most tasks I do at work before I start. I want to do research either in academia or at an enterprise. I enjoy math, and I want to solve open-ended questions!

## My strength and weaknesses:

I think I have good computation skills. I am active on GitHub. Back in school, I had good GPAs (magna cum laude). I think I can get one or two strong recommendation letters out of three.

Nonetheless, I have zero research experience, not to mention publication which might be a deal breaker when applying for PhD application. I bet my career in the industry back in school. I didn't do any REU or undergrad research. I only did SWE internships. All the projects I did were only for applications.

## Why computational science, not computer science:

I don’t mind doing scientific research, and CS PhD programs seem incredibly competitive. I saw reddit people say it takes 1-3 top conference publications to get into a good program, while I have none. But I still want to go to a top school, so the research I involve in can be more impactful.

I am looking at Stanford iCME, MIT CSE, and Caltech CMS. Do I stand a chance with no publication? And is it worth it? I notice iCME is just an institute and not a department. Will it be hard if I want to pursue research in academia after graduating from an institute?

Also, another track I can take is to do a research-focused master's and apply for PhD later. I saw the CS masters at Berkeley and UCLA are the ones where they claim they can lay the groundwork for PhD. (although Stanford MSCS also claimed that while most people on reddit disagree.)"

11s8xsk,0,2023-03-15,Best way to pay for summer internship accommodation in Canada as a UK student?,reza359,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/11s8xsk/best_way_to_pay_for_summer_internship/,"Hi. I'm a UK student starting a 3-month summer internship in Ontario at the end of May. This is my first time traveling, so I'm a bit clueless about the best way to pay for things. I'm hoping you can help me out!

I found accommodation that would cost about $3500 after tax. I want to know what the best way to pay for it is. Here's my current plan:

1. Move about £2500 ($4100) to my Revolut account (£7.50 fee)
2. Exchange the money into CAD
3. Pay for the accommodation and use any leftover money in Canada if needed.

I'm wondering if this is the best way to go about it, or if there are other options I should consider. 

Bit of additional info: My internship requires me to open a bank account once I'm in Canada, and they will pay me into that account, but only after I've landed. So, I don't want to add too much to my Revolut account for other expenses right now.

Do you have any recommendations or advice? Should I make a direct bank transfer or exchange funds to CAD currency and then pay? I would appreciate any insights you can share.

How can I avoid being underpaid as a Software Developer in Canada? I have 5 YoE, I am female, and I've never even been able to break the six figures yet. I've done everything that is usually suggested here:

1) I have a Computer Science degree at a well respected university and I have had amazing internships. 

2)  I have worked very hard over the years to get better at my craft, always. 

3) I've landed very prestigious jobs over the years.

3) My resume is well crafted: I almost one for one land any job I give my resume to, with little exception. 

4) I hopped jobs every year or so for a better salary, successfully. 

5) I am fluent in many languages, and have degrees in other areas that can prove useful for my work.

All in all, without fail, I get all the interviews in the world, all the job offers I could ever want, but every single time, the proposed salary is a disaster. All of my jobs have been like that. They've always lowballed me. Even during my internships, guys I went to school with that barely graduated, still landed jobs where they were paid 2$ more per hour than my Summa Cum Laude student ass was.

I've pretty much tried everything I could think of. Getting certifications. Getting better at my job. I've gone above and beyond, and still, I'm paid like shit, and the work I'm given is always fucking grueling. I always end up in jobs where I need to wear many hats for no added benefits. Meanwhile, many guys I went to school with have been hired in jobs where they don't do a whole lot and are paid triple my salary.

What am I doing wrong? What can I do to make myself more appealing to employers? How can I get a good salary in this economy? I'm at a loss...

Edit: I see some commenters taking offense at me stating my gender. Please ignore my gender if it causes you pain or anger. Stating my gender was done in the hopes that it would garner the attention of other women working in the industry that could perhaps share their wisdom. I did not think it would bring incels out of the woodwork. Please avoid making this post into a feminism diatribe; thank you!"

11sad54,84,2023-03-15,"Hey, EFC Zeroes! Some Practical Advice.",rebonkers,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/11sad54/hey_efc_zeroes_some_practical_advice/,"I'm on this sub as a parent who will likely be paying in full, but 25-ish years ago I was a very poor white girl who had no idea what she was doing. Here are some, possibly dated, things to keep in mind as these acceptances roll in and you are trying to choose where to go and what you need to do.

1. Consider Logistics. I applied from California to a bunch of schools all over the country that sounded cool. It was fun to dream while awaiting results, but even when aid packages came back covering tuition and living expenses, they didn't cover immediate things like a cross country plane ticket to actually move to, say, Chicago to attend Northwestern. I wouldn't have even been able to book a ticket till the last minute (expensive!) when my aid hit my bank! Not to mention the need for luggage, boots and a real winter coat. How would I get back for holidays or summer? If your EFC is truly ZERO, these are real concerns that will limit your options so be aware of them before you get your heart set on a school. People make it work all the time, but it can be super stressful.

2. Banking. If you don't have one, as soon as you turn 18 set yourself up both checking and savings accounts. That fin aid has to go somewhere and you want that totally separate from your parents. Those grants and loans are going to be in your name and the account needs to be in your name too. I suggest a credit union for lower fees, typically. Make sure it's part of an ATM network that has locations on or near campus if possible. Nobody uses cash anymore, but when you need it you don't want to have to pay extra to get it.

3. Transportation. Know what you are getting into as far as locations. If you are poor that very likely means no car... so can you buy socks without having to beg for a ride from a classmate? Will you be able to get to jobs or internships off campus (like at the college's Medical Center for pre-meds or the city's downtown for finance bros) because public transport is awesome? This is the difference in non-car quality of life at UCLA vs. Boston. Both big cities, but you'll need a car in LA sooner rather than later. I went to UC Irvine for 2 years before transferring to UC Davis and not having a car was such a minor thing in Davis and a major obstacle at Irvine. After freshman year my friends wanted me to move to Newport Beach with them, but I couldn't make it work without a car. Meanwhile you can walk the whole town of Davis in under an hour, the school itself runs it's own bus system, and everyone rides a bike. Practically nobody lives outside of town.

4. Get an on-campus job ASAP. Yes, off campus might pay more, but they are also not on the same calendar, are less understanding of scheduling around things like finals, may not ""hold"" your job for summer, etc. Campus jobs open up at the beginning of each semester as people's schedules change, but if you a wait a few weeks after hitting the dorms Freshman year those jobs will already be filled. A bunch of campus jobs will be work-study only also which is a form of aid I always found went to middle class kids instead of the grants poor kids get so there is more competition for the non-work-study positions among students who have to work.

5. Go to the bookstore ASAP. You NEED the used book prices and those go quick. Lots of options online now (I have to buy my son's private high school textbooks currently, the internet is amazing) but you need to keep an eye on those shipping times (and edition numbers) because you'll end up behind in class quick without them. Textbooks ""on reserve"" at the libraries are great if you really can't afford even used books, but also be aware there are often 1 or 2 hour limits to checking them out and people waiting before and after you.

6. Greek Life. If frats and sororities are a big thing on a campus, you are going to be on the sidelines as a poor kid. That's just the way it is-- make it part of your decision process. There are programs within some that can help with the cost and some spots have more affordable houses, but a lot require not just fees and (typically) a year minimum living in the house but also incidentals for spontaneous outings and matching sweatshirts and gifts for your ""Little"" and so-and-so's birthday and extras like ski trips/houseboat trips, formal wear, etc. No part time job is going to cover all that on top of normal living expenses that you'll need in addition to your aid, no matter what. All those social commitments will limit time you can work and will limit time you can study if you need to keep a GPA for scholarship or honors college purposes. 

Good luck EFC Zeroes! Consider your options in full and ask questions of current students on those college's subs."
11sb1pn,48,2023-03-15,The real way to get your 1st engineering internship is through emails. This is how I did it:,Bikael-Jordan,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/11sb1pn/the_real_way_to_get_your_1st_engineering/,"**I made a youtube video where I break down emails I sent to get my first 3 internships check comments for link**

**I'm exTesla,** I did mech design internships in 1st,2nd and 3rd year. What I see most people do wrong is that they believe that by simply increasing volume of job portal applications they can get an internship. While volume does matter, **job portals have a very low probability of working out for you if you have no engineering experience on your resume.** So how are 1st/2nd year engineers supposed to get an internship? The answer is EMAILS. I straight up email engineering managers at startups. This is the workflow that I teach in my Youtube video:

1. Find companies I like (startups are easier to get into)
2. Find key people at the company to email (engineering managers, mechs, head of mechanical etc.) Don't bother talking to human resources, they aren't the ones making the hiring decision (very common mistake
3. Find their email address using rocketreach.io
4. Send them a wonderful email where I sell myself. Most students are afraid to sell themselves, but all job interviews whether you like it or not are a matter of sales. ""The best way to get what you want is to figure out what other people want"" - Dale Carnegie. FIgure out what issues the startup is dealing with and show them that you can solve it.
5. Keep repeating process. As you get better at writing good emails, you will get more interviews

I'm graduating now and will be getting my full time job this way. Subscribe to the channel I have lots of interesting content coming out!

11sb24s,1,2023-03-15,Should I ask for a text-based interview?,Significant_Ad_6731,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11sb24s/should_i_ask_for_a_textbased_interview/,"Me again lol sorry

17f here, future cs major, class of '24 

I just checked my emails and found out that I have an interview with a nonprofit tech company for an internship position!! This is super huge news to me, seeing as I'm only 17. The problem is that I have major anxiety, and I don't know if I'm going to be able to go through with it. The interview itself is only 15 minutes long, and while the time would definitely pass quickly, I've never had a job before, nor have I ever had an interview. I'm hesitant to respond, and I might just ask if I could do something over text, but I doubt they would allow that. I really don't want this opportunity to go to waste, though, because this could potentially be my only chance. Does anyone have any advice?"

3. Water Well construction: Money made from organization was put directly into constructing wells and dams in the rural villages in my hometown so they can have access to clean water (before water was causing many to go sick). I also donated bikes, lots and lots of canned food, and a 100,000$ village townhall with my name on it so the citizens can have a stable place to live when weather was bad.

11sh189,45,2023-03-15,Struggling as a fall 2022 grad,myonebraincell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11sh189/struggling_as_a_fall_2022_grad/,"Just a heads up this is gonna be the standard ""job market is so ass rn and I'm giving up"" cry for help that you've probably heard enough of lol. Just want to get it off my chest I suppose.

I am going through quite possibly the most discouraging time of my life at the moment. Throughout undergrad I slacked off and just didn't apply myself as much as I should have. I didn't really feel passionate about software engineering until around senior year which is right around when things started to go downhill, just my luck.

As it stands, I graduated fall 2022 with 0 internships and have been feeling completely lost. Even if I do somehow build a decent portfolio of projects, I then have to face a competitive, over-saturated junior dev job market.

I have applied to startups, government jobs, looked into contracts, anything you can think of to get my foot in the door, but nothing. When I was applying to new grad roles last fall, I got a couple bites, but since those roles have been filled I have not heard back from anyone. I apply to around 10 roles a day on average. I have considered grad school but it's just too expensive for me and my family.

I no longer qualify for new grad roles, which means I now have to go for roles that require 2+ YOE.

I am grinding Leetcode everyday and just trying to pick up new tools (React/Express) in the meantime to build projects so I keep my mind sharp, but it's getting super discouraging.

I know that my lack of internship and professional experience is my fault for not dedicating myself in undergrad, but it honestly feels like I will never land a software engineering role at all and I'm terrified that I'm gonna have to let my degree go to waste and find something else.

I will try my best to keep trudging along and building projects/grinding Leetcode, but is there any hope for me? Do I just have to wait out this bad market? Recent news about SVB just added onto my anxiety rip

Any encouragement would be appreciated but if you have any honest and harsh words just lay it on me lol."

I graduated from my bachelor's degree program (life science major computer science minor) a year and a half ago, and I've been actively searching for junior software engineering roles and internships since then, but I've had no luck so far. I've applied to a lot of positions, but most of them either require more experience than I have, or I don't hear back at all.

I have done some open source contributions, some research work for 6 months where I developed an experiment in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and have also developed several personal projects. Some languages/frameworks I have worked with include HTML/CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, PHP, Java, Kotlin, and Python. I feel like I have a good foundation in programming and I'm eager to learn and grow as a developer.

I was wondering if anyone here has any advice for me in terms of finding junior software engineering roles or internships? Or, if there are any other steps I can take to improve my chances of getting hired? I'm open to any suggestions or feedback. I have applied to around 400 software engineering/front-end developer/back-end developer roles so far.

The majority of people I have spoken to (who work at companies like Google, Intel, Mozilla, and some startups in Toronto) have told me my resume looks fine for a junior swe but it has still been tough hearing back from companies. I'm not sure what else I could work on and I find it's becoming harder to not question that perhaps I need to move in a different direction. It's also been a rough ride mentally.

I have interviewed previously with companies like the Bank of America, and a few smaller startups. I did hear back from Amazon recruiters on 2 separate occasions only to get ghosted after responding to their requests for a quick chat.

I am searching for roles in Toronto, Ontario Canada btw. Not sure what to do or where to go from here. I feel like things are not going anywhere and not sure where else to turn for help.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you so much in advance. You are all awesome and I am happy that a community like this exists where people can have a discussion on these topics."
11si2ug,1,2023-03-15,Internship Dilemma - College Freshman,lilmophead,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11si2ug/internship_dilemma_college_freshman/,"Hello, I am a first-year cs major and I am trying to decide what my strategy should be for internships. I feel pressured because I hear that internships make studying cs at uni worth it. At the moment my only skills are python and java. So I have a long way to go in terms of learning. Is it best for me to try to have a basic understanding of numerous skills in order to stack up a bunch of internships before graduating? Or should I focus on perfecting a set of skills and only try for internships where I could see myself working at that company or field?  


One of my professors recommended I take the second route while a lot of students I see usually follow the first approach. I am conflicted because I am not 100% certain what career I would like to pursue but I would like to keep as many doors open as possible. My thought process was that stacking internships would let me get past the resume stage whenever I find companies I would like to work at in the future. But now I am unsure.  


I am brand new to the scene so I apologize for any logical errors in my post. Any advice is appreciated!"

11sjcjo,0,2023-03-15,Can you provide guidance on applying to CS Master's programs at public universities in a realistic manner?,ExcuseAccomplished97,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/11sjcjo/can_you_provide_guidance_on_applying_to_cs/,"Hey guys, I'm looking to apply to CS Master's programs and wanted to get some feedback on my profile with school recommendations.

Here's what I've got:

* Undergrad GPA: 3.152/4.0 (it wasn't great in the first couple of years, but I improved in my senior year and upper major courses)
* TA experience in major courses
* Internship experience at a Silicon Valley startup, a high-profile (political power) government office (in cybersecurity)
* 3+ years of general SWE work experience
* Volunteered to establish a computer lab for students and maintain networks at a technical college in Ethiopia for 2 years, and led several short-term IT workshops in Asian countries
* TOEFL score: 102
* No GRE (I've heard it's not necessary for a lot of schools, but should I take it anyway?)
* LoRs(expected): Excellent letters from my current manager, and expected good ones from 2 university professors who I worked with as a TA and on projects. Also can get one from a PhD alumni (from UC Davis)

I know there are a lot of different universities out there and the application process can vary a lot. But I'm particularly worried about my GPA being below average, so I'm hoping to apply to 7-8 schools strategically. I know that top schools like Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCLA are probably a long shot given my GPA and no related research experience, even if I meet the minimum requirements quantitively.

I'm particularly interested in UC Davis because of personal reasons, but I'm not sure if my profile (with the low GPA) is realistically possible to get accepted to their program. Does anyone know of any other public schools in California or other areas that might be a good fit for me given my GPA and experience? Can anyone give me a rough idea of what schools would be realistic for me?

Also, should I consider applying to 1+ year professional master's programs for safety? I really want to challenge myself and find new talents in an academic environment, but I also want to make sure I have some backup options.

Any opinions or information would be greatly appreciated! Good luck to everyone else who's waiting on admissions decisions right now."

I have no fucking clue what im doing? I go to ucla which I thought was good going in, but now I'm having a crisis that I should've prob chosen cal since its somewhat of a target school, whereas my school is nontarget.

Im a 4th year and I have a degree in Math &amp; Econ and a minor in CS, problem is that until three months ago, I've had a hard time with school exams, until I was diagnosed with ADHD. To be completely transparent my ending gpa last quarter was 2.95... This quarter I had a crisis and decided to give up all my hobbies and focus on schoolwork. I've talked to my schools disabilities education department and i've managed to get 10 more minutes on exams and am prescribed aderol which have helped erase 99% of the stupid mistakes that caused my exam grades to be B's/C's. What sucks is that I have 95%'s across all 4 of the classes going into finals this quarter but, obviously its too little too late in terms of affecting my gpa. So far my financial experience was: last year (my junior year internship) a NW mutual internship that i quit after 1 full week, and the SEC internship this summer. The reason why I opted for an internship role this summer is since I frankly dont feel prepared with enough professional experience to work FT at a good firm, and initially I was planning on graduating \~Dec 2023 and taking some extra classes.

This brings me to my current sort of dilema. Currently if I keep getting A's until I graduate my gpa will be around a 3.55, which still frankly seems low for a competitive job afterwards. I could graduate at the end of summer and be ready for FT work \~Sept 2023, but for the industries i want to go into (in order QTrading/S&amp;T &gt; MBB Consulting &gt; PE &gt; VC), most of the top firms already rejected me for an internship in the summer, and, since my gpa will be pretty shit until I graduate, I figure probably wont want to take me on \~Sept 2023.

So, my initial conclusion, more school until my GPA is good! Since my school offers concurrent masters in economics (and math if i wanted), I was thinking about enrolling in these programs that gives me another 1/2 a year to finish the program and get my gpa up to 3.7/3.8? But after reading another thread on here bashing people for going to a graduate degree out of undergrad, im stuck with a dilema of what to do? Also my school's MFE program contacted me and are really eager about me joining, but since the tuiton is 95k, im not sure that is a good choice, especially considering once again it still is a graduate degree.

Any input? Should I do the SEC Internship and look for FT work in Sept? Do (internship then) my concurrent masters in economics till February then look for FT? Back out on the internship and look for FT work starting in summer? Become a high school math teacher?

EDIT: I am doing Optiver's and IMC's trading competition and a small quantitative personal project, as well as some small campus clubs, but unless I manage to win these competitions I don't see them changing my outlook in a big way  


tldr; im finishing with school at the end of summer and i have an internship this summer. I think my experience / gpa is subpar for recruiting for FT roles starting in the Fall. I wanted to extend my stay at uni for another 1/2 a year for a concurrent masters in econometrics, but im unsure since i've seen on other posts that doing grad school right after ugrad is a bad idea? Also im unsure if since my internship this summer isnt that relevant to the fields i want to go into (QTrading/S&amp;T &gt; MBB Consulting &gt; PE &gt; VC) maybe i should just do a passion project or do FT school over summer and start my masters"

11sn0pk,1,2023-03-16,Learn Haskell together.,kindaro,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/11sn0pk/learn_haskell_together/,"**TLDR**   Want to Learn Haskell Together? Go to Discord. `Ignat Insarov#5672` Write a Personal Mission Statement. Work on Open Source Projects. After a Year of Hard Work Hopefully Attain Supernatural Powers.

* * *

## Why Haskell?

I like Haskell. It is a beautiful and handy language. But it is somewhat austere. You ask for a tutorial, they give you an academic publication. There is a big space between a beginner that somewhat grasps the concrete syntax and a wizard that throws lens and free monads about with ease.

I want to bridge this big austere space.

**before you ask**   — Is Haskell useless? — No, Haskell is useful. They use it [in the NASA][4]. You can write web sites with it, too.

## How will it go?

1. We shall gather on a Discord server for now, since it is easy to set up and join.
2. We shall build open source Haskell projects, all together or in small groups, starting with something easy and going upwards from there.
3. We shall peruse technical literature as needed.

So, this is kind of like internship, but for free and open source.

## Who am I?

* Have been learning Haskell and Software Engineering by myself on the Internet.
* [This is my most recent open source pull request.][1] Dig in for more.
* [This is my profile on Stack Overflow.][2] _(Abandoned since the Monica event.)_
* Moderator of /r/CategoryTheory.
* Get paid to write commercial PostgreSQL–Haskell–PureScript software.
* From a far land, no formal education, avoid speaking of gender, ethnicity and religion.

### Why am I doing this?

* I want to pay it forward. No one taught me, but many helped a little at a time, so I still morally owe some teaching to the world.
* There is plenty of places on the Internet to ask specific questions and illuminate small spots of knowledge. But there are few if any ways to build a personal connection with someone who will care about your growth over a length of time. I needed this and it was not there. I want it to be there for others.
* Shared projects and interests inspired me before. I am hopeful that more inspiration will come this way.
* Remember those academic publications I mentioned? I learned some stuff, but there is still so much waiting ahead for us to conquer together.

## Who are you?

* You want to become a strong software engineer.
* You can put an hour a day for a year to it. [I do not say _«ten years»_.][3] But some commitment is needed.

**before you ask**   — Do I need to know Haskell, other language, Mathematics, before I show up? — No, you only need commitment. Everything else will come.

### Why would you be doing this?

You tell me!

Even reading one technical book on a new topic takes weeks, months. Learning a whole new language, or a new trade, takes longer. At the same time, online study groups tend to exponentially decay with the half-life of about a week. For this setup, I want the decay to be slower.

This is why I ask an upcoming fellow to send me a personal mission statement. It is not hard; you can look examples up on the Internet. I shall never share it with anyone. You can change your mind at any time. I only want everyone to have some express commitment from the outset.

* * *

Comment with your questions, I shall try to answer.

Like, share, and see you there!

Last summer I had a job at a smallish software company where I built a good amount of full stack experience working with an Angular front end connecting to a .NET Core web api backend. I got to build a few features that went all the way from the data to the UX, so I’d feel pretty comfortable if I landed in another job with the same stack.

However, I don’t know how common it is at bigger companies or how much I should branch out to new tech or a different approach to move up next summer. I also haven’t spent much time on leetcode and don’t have any personal projects to point at since I’ve been spending all of my time focusing on that company and surviving college applications and senior year work.

Any advice on what I should do to optimize chances at a major internship program? I’d really love one of those ones where they bring in a bunch of summer interns who live together and there’s a whole experience outside of the job itself. My former coworkers told me about their amazing times before the pandemic and I’d like to do the same."

It has successfully passed the test of time, and until recently - it was the incontestable leader on the microprocessor market. 

However, a company like Intel couldn’t become so successful without opening offices and facilities around the world, each serving its development, manufacturing, and sales processes among others. As it was expected a company with $[79,02B](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/financial-statements) yearly revenue is well established on almost every continent.

my\_qualifications: Currently an undergrad student at a private engineering college in Bengaluru.

Most flights that I see have a transit in the US which requires a transit visa and as far as I know, getting an appointment at a US consulate is nearly impossible.

That leaves me with EU and Asia (Japan/Hong Kong) transits. Of the two I see that the flights that go over London Heathrow are cheaper, so I am deciding to go with that one.

But my question is if I would need a transit visa for having a layover in London (12 hours overnight stay). I checked the UK immigration website and it was not very clear to me if it was needed. If any members of this sub have gone via this route please share your experience.

Thank you."

Between now and then, my career goals have changed a lot and I really don’t see myself working in the Big 4 full time. 

I started a business in Nov 2022, and in the recent months, that has seen some traction and what I would like to do is take this summer and next fall off to put 100% of my effort and focus into this business rather than working 40+ hours at the internship and school.

I don’t want to go back on my word because I’ve liked everyone I’ve met from EY, but I think it’s best for me to take advantage of this opportunity, and how I see it is Big 4/Public accounting will always be there and most likely always be hiring, especially in audit which is what line of service I was in. 

Has anyone in here had experience or know someone who accepted an offer originally and ended up not doing the internship? Just wanted to hear other’s opinions that may have had experience with this, and if there is anything I’m maybe not considering. Thank you!"

I've read thousands of threads here but it's actually the first time I start one. 😱

To provide some context, I am a student in a French ""Grande Ecole"", which is one of the best engineering school in France, and I study applied maths, engineering and finance. I am currently doing the first year of a Master of Science there, and I have the opportunity to di a double diploma elsewhere (I chose the US).

I was admitted to Berkeley Meng IEOR in Fintech track, witha 30k Grant and I am still waiting for ICME's answer (for the general track).Both are very computational, that I like. In Stanford, as I won't be in the Finance Track, I am afraid though I won't be able to take as much selective finance course as I want. Also, Stanford is two year long, which may give me time to do 2 summer internships.

What would you consider ? Di you think it makes a big difference and especially is there a real difference in level between both ? Thank you so much ! 🙏"
11svuir,10,2023-03-16,I am a 3rd year law student in one of the top NLUs. I am not liking studying this course at all and want to pursue something in finance in a different field. I am thinking of leaving the college and pursuing my interest in finance.,SkillfulShoe781,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/11svuir/i_am_a_3rd_year_law_student_in_one_of_the_top/,"myquals- 3rd year B.A.LL.B student

Hi,

I am currently pursuing law in a Tier-1 NLU, currently in my 3rd year (will be entering in my 4th year in June 2023). However, I do not want to pursue law (not wanting to do that for sometime now but was sucking it up). I do not understand, what I should do? Should I leave my college and pursue my bachelors, in the field I am interested in, again from the beginning? I have consulted with my parents regarding the same who were quite against it but they were not totally against it, they were open to me quitting if I absolutely do want to leave but still they do not recommend it. So, a couple of questions have pop up in my mind which I hope you guys can assist me clearing up.

1. Is it worth it leaving college right now? I am currently in my third year (2 years left) and will be graduating when I turn 22. If I leave college right now, I will have to pursue another bachelors degree costing me another 3 years. However, there is one more viewpoint, that my final 2 years in the college will however be wasted. So will I be saving 2 years in pursuing another bachelors or will be wasting the 3 years, I initially put it. I am not sure if this gamble is worth it or not unless I take it and find out. However, there is one more point, that I can go back home and start internships in the field of finance full time which I cannot right now.
2. Sucking it up and graduating- Should I suck it up and complete my course? and then pursue what I want to in the way of an MBA/ CFA or another degree. Some important points to note are that my grades are completely screwed up and there is no coming back from that. I am just passing in any subject. So by that come to the question, will my law degree from a Tier- 1 institute be that helpful if I want to make a career shift in finance after graduation because if I want to pursue studies in finance by the way of masters, my UG grades will matter and those are screwed till kingdom come.
3. Lastly, I cannot be objective at all in this point, I hate this place, I hate it here. Initially, I did not like it (didn't hate it in the beginning but, yes did not like it) here but now I hate it here. By here, I do not mean the course but rather the place. I constantly get homesick even if I have just come back from home. All I can think about is just leaving this place and never return.

Conclusion:

I have stated my 3 questions which I am seriously confused about and am not sure what to do about. I would be highly obliged if someone who has been in the same shoes or someone with experience or anyone who has any advice can share their opinion.

Thank you."

For some context , we have multiple sentences (tasks) and each one has its own price tag .

My mission consist of finding an alternative to the Knearest neighbor method  by feeding the sentences embedding to a regression(or other) model .

I was admitted to Dphil in modern language at Oxford, French PhD at Brown and French PhD at John Hopkins. I have a few other choices, but I’ve turned those down.

Im choosing mainly between Hopkins and Brown and your help/pov would be so appreciated. Here’s a pros and cons list:

Hopkins pros: 
- wider access to publishing 
- offers solid training in Francophone studies and more traditional French disciplines. 
- very well known supervisor in the field of francophonie (which is basically what all schools are shifting to these days) 

Cons:
- seems to be a hyper competitive environment
- I don’t want to live in Baltimore 
- comparatively weaker stipend 
- not as clouty I guess 
- the faculty seem not to care too much about students well being 
- larger class size
- 3 fucking years of course work even though I’m coming in with a masters from oxford.

Brown pros:
- strong in ecocriticism (which is my concentration) 
- faculty who seem very interested in student mental health + well being 
- really influential supervisor in the field  
- small cohort
- only one year of course work 
- stipend is by far the best 
- providence is cute 

Cons: 
- no publishing press/ fewer opportunities to get internships or publications 
- providence is more expensive 
- scared that won’t get a “solid training” 
- scared that future employers won’t look  at my degree with a high level of value because brown is not well known for its Francophone department

11sxhv6,5,2023-03-16,Last semester of MSc. Delay graduation for internship?,SomeoneMyself,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/11sxhv6/last_semester_of_msc_delay_graduation_for/,"Hello everyone.

So, I am in the last semester of my MSc and thinking about the future.

I currently have nothing to show on my resume, except for 6 months as a ""research assistant"" (between my bachelor and master's) in my uni where I helped this PhD guy in making a paper that we did not end up publishing, so I think an internship would be great to get some experience and improve my resume.

At the same time, I am currently in the last semester of my MSc, and I just need to pass one exam and do my thesis (internship is not mandatory), so I could easily graduate in 6 months from now and think about work later.

However, I see that many internship positions require one to be enrolled at a university for the whole duration of the internship.

So I was considering delying my graduation so that I graduate in a year and do an internship in the meantime. Obviously I would apply at decent companies and not just any random one.

I know it would have been better if I did internships before, during my bachelor even, but I can't do anything about that anymore.

I just want to hear your opinion about this.Is it that important to be a student to get an internship at a nice company, and do you think it would be worth it for me to postpone my graduation to do one?Currently I can't decide between the two options, so I'm not applying for internships but I also did not start to work on a thesis either.Thanks."

&amp;#x200B;

Sunt la primul meu job in domeniu de mai putin de un an, pe post de ajutor de programator in Nord-Estul tarii, fulltime si vreau sa va cer parerea sincera. 

Inainte sa lucrez aici am facut un internship tot la ei. Acolo mi-a fost destul de usor pentru ca am mai folosit framework-ul si nu au fost batai de cap. Ei nu aveau posturi disponibile pe ceea ce stiam dar mi-au propus sa incep sa lucrez in Magento(la inceput ca support, dar cu scopul de a evolua la programator) si cum am avut parte de luni bune fara oferte de munca si cu disperare am acceptat. Primele luni pe noul framework au fost destul de grele, nu prea ma pricepeam cu el dar au fost  rabdatori cu mine. Curand am inceput sa inteleg cu ce se mananca si ma descurc cat de cat ok, lucrez atat task-uri de support cat si task-uri de dev. Acum cateva luni am fost anuntat ca va incepe un proiect in care voi fi introdus si am sa lucrez cu un framework pe care il cunosc bine, dar a fost amanat impreuna cu evaluarea mea unde speram sa pot negocia cu ei un salariu mai mare. M-am obisnuit cu noul framework si lucrez mai eficient acum decat inainte.

Nu mai sunt multumit de salariul pe care il am, era ok la inceput cand eram tamaie si lucram pe support dar acum am acumulat niste experienta si fac si lucruri care tin de dev mi se pare prea mic.

Tin sa mentionez ca sunt o persoana loiala si incerc sa lucrez ca sa indeplinesc obiectivele firmei, dar totusi trebuie sa ma gandesc si la cariera mea. Este un lucru de prost gust sa plec dintr-o data cand ei ma cheama sa lucrez in noul proiect ? Ma gandesc ca daca fac lucrurile cum trebuie, tot nu imi vor acorda o marire de salariu multumitoare la evaluare si am impresia putin ca vor sa traga de timp ca sa continui sa lucrez pe bani putini.

Ce sa fac?

\-Sa caut sa plec direct la alta firma cu prima ocazie?

\-Sa mai stau pana intru in proiectul nou si imi fac evaluarea performantelor? 

\-Daca nu ma multumeste noua oferta sa plec?

11syd6v,2,2023-03-16,I'm completely floundering at my bad internship and don't know how to move forward (apologies for the long-winded rant),throwway1996_18,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/11syd6v/im_completely_floundering_at_my_bad_internship/,"I started my MS program in order to change careers, because I have no professional experience in engineering. I finally landed my first internship for summer 2022, as a mechanical engineering intern with a very small robotics startup (&lt;10 employees). The startup is my boss's thesis project which she turned into a company; she had hired software people, but had been doing all of the mechanical work by herself with no former training. So I was essentially hired to be the head &amp; only mechanical engineer, as an intern, with no guidance or mentorship (red flag #1), for a stipend that worked out to less than minimum wage (red flag #2). I decided to take it, because I had no other prospects and thought hey, I can tough out the insulting pay and it'll look great to basically be head engineer as an intern (oh, how naive I was to think I could handle it). 

Come end of summer, I had the option to extend it through the end of the year and decided that 8 months at a company looked better on a resume than 4 months did. In this time, I basically redesigned the entire robot from the ground up, getting it to a functioning prototype that we can show off. I'm being a bit vague, but my boss's vision for the company portfolio is essentially two robots: the one I'd developed in the 8 months and a second bot that interfaces with the first one. And because my MS program requires either extra coursework or two semesters of a thesis project, my boss suggested I make the second robot my thesis project, as she had used the first robot as hers—and hey, I figured, you know what looks better than 8 months with a company? A year and a half AND a whole second project. So now I'm set in a track of working part-time at this company and taking one additional class a semester for the next two semesters. And I'm still being paid absolute dirt, because the company is entirely grant-funded as investors have thus far been uninterested. My boss keeps dangling a $25/hour breadcrumb trail in front of me, but I'm largely viewing that as horseshit at this point.

So on top of ALL the problems evident with the above, the thing that's really causing me to break down is that I'm simply drowning in overwork and inexperience. This second robot I've been tasked with is a very non-trivial design problem, and I have no mentorship or meaningful support to turn to (my academic advisor being the closest, but he's been largely useless so far). Additionally, I'm barely even getting time to work on the second robot, because the first robot is still in the finicky prototype stage and needs constant maintenance, attention, and minor tweaks and redesigns. So my time at work is consumed with playing full-time support for one complex robot while attempting to design a second complex robot, and when I sat down with my boss to tell her I needed time to work on my thesis, she essentially replied that my thesis is personal work and I need to be attending to it on my own time. I brought this up to my academic advisor and he basically shrugged and said ""yeah, that sucks"". So now I'm gradually realizing I've been conned into doing product development for my barely-paid internship on my own free time in the name of academic advancement.

All of which is to say I'm 3 months into my 8 months of thesis work and have next to nothing to show for it, and I have no idea how to proceed. The thought of toughing it out and just getting through this feels like standing at the base of a sheer cliff and also the handholds are on fire. And as if to add insult to injury, my boss has talked about the potential for me to stay on after graduation, with a MS in Robotics, for $40k/year with no benefits. I could not be less motivated to work here if I tried. But at the same time, I feel like I can't bail on the company entirely, because my boss's mentor (who I've now connected with) is an engineering lead at a company I've wanted to work at for years, and I don't want to look bad in his eyes by quitting mid-internship. I'm also enjoying an extremely flexible office environment at the moment, which is my only saving grace; there's no formal policy and we're all friendly 20-somethings, so I can basically take time off whenever I want. AND I'd be bailing on my thesis, which would then require an additional semester and another probably $20-30k in student loans. I think the only way out is through, but I truly feel so helpless. I don't know what to do."

&amp;#x200B;

Besides what's on there I also did a data engineer internship and some TA classes should I add those considering they are more like student suff?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, any advice would be greatly appreciated it, thanks !"

11t1xbj,0,2023-03-16,Recent grad worries,yuyevin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11t1xbj/recent_grad_worries/,"Hello everyone. 

I just graduated from UMD in the winter with a BS in computer science, and I’m pretty worried about getting my first job…

For starters, I am an older graduate, turning thirty next week actually, and so throughout college I had to work full time. I worked in retail and restaurants to support myself. Consequently, I didn’t ever get an internship, and work sometimes interfered with my studies. My gpa was only around 2.3 after a long and complicated college career spanning from age 18-29. I also never really had time to develop personal projects, so all I have to put on my resume is my degree and class projects. I still put my work experience down for now, but am planning on taking it out…

As of now, since I’m out of school and have free time, I just apply everywhere I can, and decided to start some projects. My best class was web development with JavaScript, so I decided to learn reactjs, and I want to develop a MERN stack app to put on my resume. Right now I’m doing some react tutorials to get a feel for the framework and refresh from the class, since I took it a while ago… but I think the career path I want to go down is full stack development. I enjoy all aspects of it, designing ui/ux, coding server side logic, setting up and populating databases, I want the whole package. But obviously I’d take the first job I can land. 

So far I’ve had to turn a couple of interviews down because they required security clearances which I don’t want to deal with (am not eligible). I started applying in the beginning of February and have had 4 phone interviews so far. I haven’t had a technical interview yet, but I’m kind of terrified of them tbh. I do get emails from company’s like Synergystic, but it seems kind of scammy and maybe more of a last ditch effort kind of deal.

So I guess my questions boils down to this: is my plan… good? Am I going about this the wrong way? I look at the requirements for entry level jobs and I feel so unprepared from university. And I also know the job market is less than ideal at the moment (to put it lightly). I’m trying to not be too disheartened, as I’ve read about people on here who took 6-18 months to get a job post university, but it still feels like I was thrown into the deep end after just learning to swim.

TLDR: 30 yo fresh college grad with 0 industry experience, trying to land first job, looking to see if my plan is bad or not."

And so the MD sent me a link to the job application and said he would recommend me for it. I’m just confused as to how being overqualified is a bad thing. They wouldn’t have to teach me anything.

I'm a bit confused as to which one should I pick.

Dalhousie offers a 16 month program. Out of which 4 months is compulsory co-op.

ASU offers a standard 2 year program.

I would require a loan in each of the two cases.

I will have 4 years of experience when I start either of the programs in September 23. Since Dalhousie allows me to get back into the market in essentially a year I'm leaning towards it, however, I am also aware of the painfully low market rates in Canada.

ASU requires a 2 year investment and loads of money in Loans which I'm sure I'll be able to pay soon after getting a job however the H1B visa scares me as I'm always at the mercy of my employer. Also, the current job market in the US seems to be a bloodbath based on what my friends have said to me. As some of them are struggling to find even one decent job or internship and might have to come back home with a massive loan to their name.

overall, I'm a bit confused and would appreciate any thoughts or inputs so that i can have a better understanding while making my decision!"
11t2xg9,90,2023-03-16,MAANG or AI research at prestigious university,Brilliant_Ferret_897,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11t2xg9/maang_or_ai_research_at_prestigious_university/,"I am a Junior CS student at a low-level university. I have an offer to work at a MAANG company as a SWE Intern, but I also have an offer to conduct AI research at one of the best CS/AI research institutions in the U.S. I am unsure on which opportunity to go with. The research opportunity would give me a leg up to get into their graduate program, and the project I would work on is something I am really interested in. The MAANG opportunity would give me great work experience, a solid payout, and having this company on my resume would open a lot of doors. Also the possibility of receiving a full-time offer.

I was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation where they had to choose between industry and graduate school? I would love to hear someone’s perspective.

The reason why this decision is so hard is because this would be my first MAANG internship and I am really proud of myself for securing it. It is hard for me to let go of that for a possibility at getting into the top graduate program on my list.

TLDR: Industry vs Graduate school. Which should I choose?"

(expected graduation 2015)  The courses I've taken so far were Data Structures, Discreet Math, a class on Computer Forensics, and currently Im taking an Algorithms course. I just had an interview for an internship this summer and the only requirement was to be skilled in Java. I have some knowledge of Java and some knowledge of Python but have not dove into anything too complicated that wasn't necessary for any of my courses. The interviewer asked me 2 things on Java/OOP and then asked me questions like what is front end vs back end? and what are servers and clients? and if I had experience with databases. I didn't know the answers to these questions or have any experience with databases. I feel very behind overall and a bit lost. It feels like there's so much I don't know and so much I need to learn but I don't even know where to start. I don't have a path or goal for my career yet, right now I just want to gain as much experience anywhere I can. Could someone help me figure out what I should be doing?

My question: How through development career I can develop my business acumen as I want to start my own or should I switch my role and if yes then which role will be good to start with?

Little about me: I am going to graduate (B.Tech -C.S.E) in 2023,I have done two full-time  paid  internship of 3 months each ,with freelancing based projects (static websites for real estate and corporate) and have an app on Playstore too that I uploaded on playstore in 2020 in the beginning of my second year.My college is 3 tier college in haryana and my location is Delhi NCR.My tech stack is html, css, Bootstrap,Php and a little bit on django and Java+ Android studio. During my college I have also done trading business(middle man) of corrugated box, where buyer lead was based on father reference.

Interest,intenship and challenges: From the beginning after my board exams my interest is to start something of my own but at the same time I'm not able to get how I can start ,so as aforementioned based on my father reference I started trading business which lasted 8 month and after then based on his reference I got my first internship, howsoever my plan was to learn the business fundamental but the company director based on my background gave me developer role,I struggled in development so left that company after 2 months and then I joined Escorts group(tractor manufacturer)  their I was comfortable with development and my internship extended but I was only limited to html ,css and basic php that's why left it after three months and then from fb group got a lead for freelancing that  I'm still continuing.



During all these 4 years goal was always to start business but due to circumstances I was limited to development only.

Now the problem is I'm getting job opportunity in small web development agency in Noida and Gurgaon in which I don't want to work ,plus I'm quite confused and very much annoyed that how I can start my own business 




So how shall I proceed?"

I've begun looking for internships or other roles to be my first real experience. As for target roles, I'm really just going to be applying to CS internships that I think I could qualify for--I don't have any specific jobs in mind like front-end developer or anything like that.

Since I've made this change fairly recently and far too late to switch majors, I feel as if I'm behind a lot of my peers, so any help would be appreciated.

Some other questions:

I put my certificate first under education since it's most relevant, but should I switch it to BS first?

Should I remove my high school? Should I remove my college GPA? It's not the highest, but since I'm still a student, I feel as if I should have it on there. Also, I've been told to not put the amount of experience I have in terms of semesters, since it makes me seem ""humble."" However, I've also heard the opposite, and the people who gave me the former advice aren't in the CS industry, and I don't want to make myself seem way more experienced than I am. Additionally, is it all right to list things that I will have learned at the end of the semester? For example, I haven't learned much about SQL yet, but we'll be covering that next in my class.

Any other advice would be appreciated as well. Thanks!

Take Action with Ownership 🤝
Don’t wait for someone to give you permission to get things done. At Coder, we find leverage quickly and generate outcomes while staying lean. We don’t want you to “stay in your lane” - we want you to get curious, go after problems, and ship smart solutions together with your teammates. If you pick something up, take it to the finish line.

However, after getting laid off from Amazon, I'm looking to dive into the game development world since that's where my passion is, and I've taken several courses in college related to game design and animation.

However, my resume keeps getting rejected since I don't have any professional game experience, and it seems like game dev companies are only looking for Senior programmers with past experience on already developed games, or interns.

I'm wondering if it's smart to apply for internships in this industry even though I've already worked as an experienced software engineer in the field. Some are saying to me that my resume will look strange as I'm ""going back"" to being an intern and could potentially come off as something wrong with my skills. On the other hand, an internship might help me get my foot in the door for potential game dev jobs in the future.

Any advice?

Thanks!"

I’m currently a junior double majoring in HR and IT. I don’t have any internships yet and so far it’s not looking good for this summer but I was wondering what I can do to be a strong candidate when looking for a job when I graduate. Do I get certifications? Do I get my masters? What can I do instead of an internship to better my chances? I want to work in HR at a tech company.

It’s been hard to find internships because of my lack of experience so I’m thinking I’ll take summer classes and work on side projects. I’m also looking into research opportunities. One of the classes I plan to take requires you to build 1-2 apps each week which I think will look good on my resume. I’ve heard that if you can’t get an internship during undergrad you should go to grad school. And luckily my school has an early entry program where I’d only stay for 1 extra year. If I can’t get any internship experience will it help me in my job search to have a Masters in Computer Science? Or will they still be looking for internship experience? Would this impact my pay if I do get a job? Anything helps, thank you! (:"

What would be some tips or better to say the correct steps to take to ensure my success at becoming a Lead Engineer? I know I am asking for a cookie cutter answer with something that can’t be baked. But knowledge is power and I want to see what you all might think. What are some principles that I should be sure to follow? Any books, articles, or other resources that helped you along your journey? Is it just experience and exposure to the applications? Should I make sure I understand computer architecture?

After some self-evaluation of my future career, I realized I don't think I would be happy with that degree or the jobs that would come with it. After taking a CS class in my first semester of sophomore year and loving it, I decided to switch my major to CS.

I am currently a second-semester sophomore majoring in B.S. CS. Essentially, if I were to stay in a B.S. I would graduate a year late. If I were to change to a B.A. in CS I would graduate on time and even be able to take some B.S. classes to bulk up my degree for job applications. I could also focus on projects and internships since I'm already late in the game. With all this being considered...

Is it more worth it to stay in B.S. and have that degree title or switch to B.A. and save time and build up my experience? Or should I just stay in B.S. and still work on building my experience?

I've gotten a lot of mixed answers saying it does or doesn't matter if you're doing a B.S. or B.A.

Next year, I want to take EECS 370 and 376 not together, but I'm not sure what order to take them in.


## Fall: 376, Winter: 370

- Pros: I kinda sucked at 203, so I should probably take 376 before I forget too much of the information. I'm also going to be taking easier classes in the fall semester and harder classes in the winter one, so taking 376 in fall will balance things out.
- Cons: I might get fucked in 370 because I will be taking a semester off from coding.

## Fall: 370, Winter: 376

- Pros: Taking right after 281 and a summer internship, so my coding skills will be fresh.
- Cons: My 203 skills might be rusty. Also, I will likely be taking harder classes in the winter semester than in the fall semester, so taking 376 in the winter might just be too much.

My own sister from Sacramento with 4.0 GPA got waitlisted from UC Davis and rejected from UC Santa Cruz. When she heard that some people in her school got accepted, then I told her not to compare yourself with them. You don't have the same circumstances.
I am a low income, first-generation ESL immigrant and transfer student whose dream back home is to study in US high school. I came late to the US, so I ended up attending CCC. 
I didn’t compare myself with anyone nor complain about my circumstances. Rather, I studied hard and got 4.0 in each and every course.
I got accepted to every school I applied, including UC Berkeley UCLA UCSD and both Cal Polys.
I ended up going to Berkeley, and you know what I am graduating and I still don't have the internship because I am transfer student, have different circumstances compared to freshmen who land internship in their first year (also Covid sucks).
First of all, we should be thankful for what we have. Second, rather than comparing yourself with others, compare yourself from your past. Where you come from, don't forget that. You will see improvement and progress in the next few years, no matter if other people from privileged backgrounds earn more than you. It doesn't matter 
I came from a remote village of Pakistan, and I know how my entire community invested me because they know that if I be the first one to be successful, then I can help their kids.
I heard this sub reddit people complaining about older siblings helping younger siblings. Yes, I do help my sister during her admission process.
But you know what? I have much more knowledge because when I started community college, I had no one to guide, and I spent time on internet researching all the days about all universities and made Assist.org my best friend. That's given me the upper edge against those who were privileged, yet they asked me my help.
So take advantage of yourself and make your weaknesses your power. Try to learn to see things from different positive perspectives.
I hope and pray you guys get into your dream school. If you get rejected, then it is not your lackness, but these public UCs are screwed themselves with housing crisis and over enrollment.
Feel free to ask me questions about UC and CSU admissions. Thank you"

Think Salesforce but for other business cases. I do coding in python, JS, and SQL but not as in-depth nor do I spend my time coding as much as a regular developer would. My manager confirmed that he will give me a return offer.

As I am only an associate's student, my knowledge of the industry and of theoretical CS is not as fleshed out. Therefore, I would like to ask some questions.

Should I be expecting a higher-than-average salary for a junior developer role (relative to where I live) considering that I am expected to specialize in obscure low-code technologies that do not have as much overlap with regular developer roles, therefore it makes me less employable for those roles later on? If so, by how much? The average here for a junior dev is 40-45k in USD with a bachelor's degree.

Is OpenAI allowed to attempt to automate proprietary technologies which they or Microsoft do not own such as the Apex language for Salesforce? Yes, I am asking this for job security.

Am I making a mistake to go down this path if my end goal is to be a developer? Should I look for a relevant summer internship instead and go to university full-time afterwards?"

11tv45b,215,2023-03-17,Advice for Naive MBAs (like myself),BlueCornTortill4,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/11tv45b/advice_for_naive_mbas_like_myself/,"Currently in my second year at a Top 15 and wanted to share some thoughts about the past 2 years that I don't think are unique to my program. Of course, these are my opinions and mistakes/regrets. I came from a liberal arts background, so I didn't really know many people who went to business school through the full-time program. Sharing this so hopefully, you won't be as naive as I was.

1) Don't fall for the marketing! It will seem that business school is a great place, you'll meet a bunch of friends easily, challenge yourself academically, and have a lot of opportunities.

My experience: 

a) The school is a business first! It can be bureaucratic and despite paying loads for the tuition, they don't fund much (i.e. case competition funding is limited, MBA program social events are stingy with the funding). The school also makes it very difficult to put on programming at times as well. Admins seemingly know nothing and are not that helpful.

b) It's not that easy to make friends. People are cliquey and actually less open to talking to everyone than you think. Conversations are shallow, and sometimes I feel like I'm talking to a rock. Heck, a rock may even give me more feedback. Some people also don't even see you, they see through you like you are transparent. B-school feels very transactional and people only want to talk to you if you provide some type of value.

c) depending on which school, academics can be really quite bad. I discussed this with some friends and honestly, we can't name more than 5 courses that we really thought were worthwhile. 

d) career office is also a mixed bag. Some counselors are way too into themselves and honestly care more about protecting the school-company relationships than your interests.

2) Choose the money. Despite what people are telling you here, rankings don't matter all that much if you're looking within the same peer group of schools, but having an extra $70k does. I was between two similar-level schools in T15 one where I had 50% scholarship and 0% scholarship. I ended up choosing the 0% scholarship because I thought it was a better fit for me after talking to a bunch of folks. However:

a) once I got to school and the funds started coming out of the bank account, the impact is a lot more real. The stress you feel to land an offer to make the investment worthwhile is real. Having the flexibility of not panicking because it's not coming out of your pocket is a real gem and can do great things for your mental health. Also then you can actually afford all these insane treks that cost thousands of dollars.

b) you feel like a second-class citizen, especially when seemingly everyone else around you has a scholarship. Of the people that have the scholarships, a good portion come from very privileged backgrounds. I don't want to underscore their achievements, but you had resources your whole life, whilst I grew up in an underprivileged background, which feels even worse.

c) beware of ambassadors and fellow admits! When making my admissions decision, I joined program-sponsored events to meet other admits and ambassadors. I expressed that I wasn't sure about my decision and they mentioned the reasons why they chose the school. I also talked with many students so that I could be sure that I was making the right decision. However, it wasn't until after the fact, that I realized a lot of these people either had full or significant scholarships, which felt quite misleading for me. My advice is always to ask your ambassador (after you've been admitted) if the scholarship/how much influenced their decision. 

3) Consider an admissions consultant (if you can afford it/if you want to). I know it seems ridiculous to spend $6000 on a counselor. But if you have the resources, and by working with a counselor you can potentially get a 50% to full scholarship, that can be worth it. I used applicant lab, and thought it was okay helpful. I ended up getting into all my Round 2 schools in the top 15 range, with about a quarter of tuition scholarships. I ended up bumping up to a half-tuition scholarship through negotiation (but of course idiotically chose the 0% scholarship admission). 

4) Look into different admissions networks (Consortium, MLT, Forte, etc.). Heck look at it even if you don't meet the demographic, you never know what you find. 

I know I sound bitter...because I am : ) and I only blame myself for not understanding the full picture and being so naive. Despite all these gripes, I have to admit that I achieved the goals that I set out for myself in attending business school. I interned at my dream company and got a return offer. I am moving to my ideal post-grad city. I did the triple switch of industry, location, and function (twice - through internship and re-recruiting). I got to experience some pretty cool things. Socially, things are also finally looking up, and I feel that I have found my community and friends. Was business school worth it for me? Only time will tell."

I would appreciate any insights or advice from current or former students in the program or anyone familiar with the field of computational biology. Thank you in advance for your help!"

Hi, I've been accepted to MSU and UMass CS programs but I'm in two minds about where to go for the next 4 years. If you went to or currently studying at these two schools, can you elaborate on your experience there?

\- How is the CS program in terms of professors, staff, students? Are they friendly and willing to help?

\- How is the workload for the Honors College of MSU and UMass? Would it make a substantial difference if you graduate with a honors degree? Did it make socializing/ reaching out to profs easier?

\- What do you think about the overall atmosphere? What about the surrounding areas, is there anything fun or interesting?

\- Which one provides better assistance for internships and career development?

\- Is it possible to do undergrad research? UMass has a higher ranked CS program (#29 or #32 according to usnews while MSU is #58).

Also, MSU is 5k cheaper than UMass.

I would really appreciate any help, thank you for your patience :)"

I've been developing internals tools for this company but I don't work with a team so there's a lot of self-learning and lack of standards. I only just recently (past year or so) started learning and implementing a more modern tech stack on the stuff I've built (React etc).

I've been trying to get a new job for 2 years because there's no more room for growth here and my pay is measly (just over 60k). I've been able to get a handful of interviews (somehow even Google and Playstation!!) but I haven't been able to get close to an offer yet. The problem is I don't have the teamwork experience or experience with industry standards that companies are looking for. My resume probably looks ok because I've worked on a bunch of stuff, but when it comes to interviews and talking about it all I feel like I'm just so behind and lacking the experience expected from someone with my YOE.

I just need some advice on where to go from here. How can I make up for my lack of 'typical' software dev experience so that I can get a new job soon? Are there certain companies that would accept someone like me? I really don't want to waste any more time in my current position. Thank you."

11u041v,5,2023-03-17,Worried my career interests are just another hyperfixation,daveydave1987,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11u041v/worried_my_career_interests_are_just_another/,"Hello all! I graduate this May with my bachelors degree in film and media studies, and am considering going for a masters degree in communication to really prepare me for the workforce. Although, I’ve only just recently thought about going for a masters and I’m afraid this is all just another hyper-fixation thanks to ADHD. 

Some background: I came to college initially as a film/tv production major, but then I pivoted to a film art major(the difference between the two is that the later is focused on the arts, and the former is focused on the technical side). Then two years into this film art degree, I pivoted to a bs computer animation degree. This lasted a year before I moved to a bfa computer animation degree. Then, the summer before my senior year (now my fifth year), I thought I would change to nursing, and did, but then I changed it back to bfa animation. Before even completing the fall semester of this fifth year, I changed to film and media studies and added a minor in art, since I already had done so many art courses to fulfill the minor. 

At the same time as when I changed to film and media studies, I got myself to psychiatric clinic and found out I have ADHD. Looking back at my whole college (and pre-college) experience, it made a whole lot of sense to me as to why I pick up and drop hobbies and interests so impulsively. 

Throughout all of this, the only thing that has remained consistent is my interest in mass media, art, and improv (unrelated tho). But now that I’m graduating in May, I am unsure of the career path I should take. Of course, I have a lot of experience in film production, but I do not love set life nor do I have the mental energy to work on crappy, exploitative, non-Union sets. I have thought about doing video editing, but I haven’t edited something serious in quite awhile. To be frank, editing is too much of an art for me to be able to receive constructive criticism gratefully. I have also thought about going into communications or marketing, as film and media studies touches on aspects of both, but I just don’t have enough experience working in either. 

Recently, I have been volunteering at my local nonprofit LGBTQ+ community center and that so far has been amazing. I’ve really enjoyed feeling like I’m a part of a community and it feels nice to be doing something that will have a positive impact on others. Because of this, I have thought that maybe I should consider doing communication work for a nonprofit or business that makes a difference in people’s lives. Even more, my local nonprofit LBGTQ+ center has even given me an internship where I would be doing some communication work. 

So because of all of this, I thought that maybe it would be in my best interest to go for a masters in communication to broaden my knowledge on the subject and give myself the experience I need to be able to thrive in my career. I think this could be a cool opportunity for me to really apply myself, now that I’m medicated, but I also worry that this is just another hyper-fixation that I will drop eventually. 

What do you all think?"

I got an internship with an engineering company (buildings) last summer (2021-22) and after that was able to work part-time with them through 2022 as I finished up my last year of uni. Company had a good culture, I had a good relationship with my boss and the job was good for me at the time, as I was happy to get experience in engineering rather than working in my old hospitality job. 

I was offered a graduate role for this year but I had to put it on hold. I got offered an internship over this summer which I am 2 weeks out from completing now. The job is out of state and in a field I couldn’t turn down (space). I am very passionate about the field and it’s a competitive industry to break into (in my country anyway). My old employer was fine with it, told me to give it a go, explore and was overall happy for me. He said he would call me regularly to consult with how I was going and that my old job would be there when I come back if I wanted it. It was the perfect situation really. 

The internship has been great and I’ve learnt more in 3 months than I learnt in 1.2 years at my old company. I wasn’t offered a job to stay with them and I want to move back home anyway. My plan was to go back to my old job as a safety net and apply for other jobs I am more interested in. 

The first reg flag was my old employer never checked up on me like he said, but I thought he was probably just busy. I got in contact with him yesterday and he told me he can’t give me my job back due to work slowing down and budgets. I feel blinded sided because he really could have told me earlier so I could have more time to have a new job lined up. Arguably I also could have contacted them myself throughout the internship. 

I am looking for guidance for my next steps. A problem I have is that I have a 6 week overseas trip planned in august (that my old employer said I could get leave for) and that isn’t going to look good starting a new job…"

I was unable to find an investment banking internship for this upcoming summer, but I worked in Wealth Management last summer and I have a Software Development internship this upcoming summer.

If I'm interested in Investment Banking or other Corporate Finance roles after my Senior year, what is the process for breaking into that?

1. Should I be trying to get a ""post-grad internship"" for the summer after senior year? If so, when does the recruitment process begin - when are jobs posted, and when do the good jobs disappear?
2. Should I be trying to apply for full time positions? And if so, when are jobs posted, and when is the ideal time to apply?

I'm also interested in quant or management consulting jobs and I don't know how those recruitment cycles compare.

Sure, no problem, here you go.

Hours go by, and the frustrated intern knocks again, saying he wasn't able to find the IP address I gave him.  I asked him what he meant by ""find.""  Apparently he had been plugging his laptop (configured for DHCP) into every unused network drop in the building looking for it to pick up the IP I had given him."

I’m almost to the end of my freshman year and I really don’t love my college and I feel like I don’t belong. I have very few friends but I wouldn’t consider them close friends and we don’t hang out very often. I chose my current school over another school that has a really good technology program. Both schools are in-state. I’m majoring in computer science so it sometimes makes me wish I had just gone for the better school for my major. Both schools have a tech program, but so often I end up thinking back to the other school wishing I had chosen differently. Though, the one good thing about my school that I remind myself is that the tech program is smaller here, so less competition and more chance to stand out. I already have an in internship here too. Social life wise my school is a party school which means a lot of the students here cater to that lifestyle, which I’m not really interested in so it feels harder to relate with others.

Wondering if I should try and transfer after my sophomore year if I’m still not liking it, especially since both schools are in-state and forfeiting the scholarship wouldn’t cause any problems at home. Anyone else not like their college but eventually learned to love it and have advice on how you learned to love it? Or did you transfer and end up liking that better? Just feeling a little lost and would advice on how to like my college or advice on whether transferring sounds like a better option down the line.

Edit: Others not other. Also it’s worth mentioning that a lot of my family (outside of parents) and people around me go there/have went there and I feel like a bit of an outcast whenever college is mentioned since my current school is like a rival school and the other school just seems to have a lot more supporters and alumni that have good things to say about it."

I'm trying to get a job in software development and am struggling a lot.

I'm in the first phase of recruitment for a company I applied for and they made me take one of those tests that assess your cognitive ability. I completely botched it. 

Even though I took my medication, I just couldn't focus for the life of me. I'd start to overthink the question, or get distracted by the smallest noises (like a distant airplane or some \*\*\*\*). All of the sudden, a question that should have taken me 15 seconds to answer takes me 2-3 minutes. Then I'd start thinking, ""You're taking way too long to answer these questions... hurry up!"" Of course, this only makes me think more about hurrying up, which slows me down! I couldn't finish the questions for any of the sections of the exam. I feel like a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* failure. 

The worse part is I feel like I'm a burden on my mom. I help out as much as I can (i.e. taking out the trash, doing and putting away the dishes, tidying up, fixing things, teaching her how to use certain software, lifting things, etc.), but no matter how much I try, I know that I'm inevitably a hindrance because I'm simply another thing she has to worry about.

All I can do is keep apply for jobs and internships which seems fruitless at this point because less than 10 percent of them actually reply and most of them are rejections.

tldr: I'm terrible at taking tests, I haven't been able to land a job, and I feel like a useless burden."

**Letters of Recommendation**

I asked my English teacher from sophomore/junior years to write my first letter, because I believed that those had been some of my best classes. We developed a good connection with each other, and hopefully she was able to attest to my analytical writing skills/conversational skills. (I also completed all the homework assignments for one month in one weekend, so maybe she mentioned that too XD) (8/10)

For my second letter, I asked one of my math teachers - I don't think it was my best class ever, but I feel like I demonstrated my desire to succeed in this class by always making sure to attend the office hours she hosted (she was a really awesome teacher, she hosted one hour of extra learning time literally every other week!!), and I always submitted any optional assignments she posted. Hopefully this letter provided a balance to the previous letter. (8/10)

For the additional letter of recommendation, I asked one of my private instrumental teachers - since we have worked closely together for many years, I have no doubt that she provided a really good recommendation letter!! (10/10)

**Interviews**

Princeton Interview: This one went really well!! I was able to connect with the interviewer really well, and we shared some common interests which was really cool. At the end, they mentioned that they wished they could accept me!

Dartmouth Interview: Also went really well, and the interviewer got me super interested in Dartmouth! :D

UPenn: Good interview as well, we didn't have much in common, but I think we still had a nice conversation :)

Yale: This one didn't go so well - instead of flowing as a conversation, it was just a very standard ""going through the list of questions"" kind of interview. Oh well lol

**Essays**

The amount of time I spent on essays between all the schools I applied to varied, so I'd say most of them fall in the 7-9/10 range lol. I mainly focused on how writing connected to personal experiences in my life, and about how much I truly love studying the environment despite not actually having any extracurriculars related to it. I also devoted some time to mentioning my love for studying the classics (I've been studying Latin/Greek/ancient history since 1st grade lol!), and chess.

**Additional Information:**

Genuinely had no idea what to expect as a prospective T20 applicant. When I compared my stats (test Scores, AP's) to other applicants, they seemed fine, but I wasn't sure if I needed to have even stronger extracurriculars to prove my worth as a homeschool applicant (for example, I was worried that colleges would think the courses I took through online schools were really easy or something like that). If you are applying as a homeschooler to T50's/competitive schools in general, I would HIGHLY recommend explaining your situation in the additional info section of the Common App and trying to explain messy bits of your transcripts. It would even be a good idea to explain why you are homeschooling in the first place!!"
11u9nwu,1,2023-03-17,I hate my post-mba job...should I do another master to switch to tech?,PiccoloNo456,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/11u9nwu/i_hate_my_postmba_jobshould_i_do_another_master/," Hello,

I graduated last summer from a top 25 business school. I am working at Amazon as a [Pathways Operations Manager](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/pathways) . First I had done an internship for the same job but the experience was really different to the full time role.

During the internship I was basically only working on a project, diving deep, analyzing data and coming up with creative solutions to a problem.

Now I am basically in charge of half of the building, over 400 people's work depends on my decisions, and I am super stressed. I received constant pressure from my Sr. managers, and I have to deal with enormous amounts of bs from the managers under me and the associates. I had no previous experience managing people, the processes are complex and I am expected to own everything in my department, people, production metrics, safety, continuous improvement, etc.

I have been some months in this job already and right now my stress is so high that I am having headaches and have nausea even in my off days. I have the feeling I am not doing as good as I should at work that is contributing to this anxiety. I have a family too, wife and kids and this is affecting the time I spend with them.

So long story short, I think I should change jobs. It may be just Amazon culture, but I feel that I just don't like operations. I have always like computers, I have recently finished the MOOC of Java by Helsinki University (I &amp; II), I learnt sql during my summer internship to retrieve data I needed and I really enjoyed my VBA class during the MBA. That is way I think I would enjoy working as a developer or in IT in general. I am thinking if it would make sense to do a master like [this one](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) to switch careers but I don't know.

Honestly, I feel a little bit like a failure for not been able to do well in this job, but at the same time I think I should try to do something that makes me happy.

The other part of the story is how much financially sound this move would be. In Upenn Online master the salary ranges are pretty wide. Right now I make 140k as base salary, I got a 56k signing bonus and 33k bonus next year. The good thing about the Upenn mater is that I wouldn't have to leave my job while doing it (I cant afford to do that).

The cost of the Upenn master is around 30-35k ($3200 per course), I have some savings but also I have 20.5k in student loans and 28k of car loan that I am paying.

What do you guys think? Would it make sense? can I get a compensation somewhat similar to what I am making now after doing an online master? or should I just try to recruit for another job right away?

PS: I studied mechanical/industrial engineering in college, so I have a good technical/mathematical base."

It had much better pay (although after living expenses in this city not by much lol) and opportunity to learn new skills. I had gone though the interview process, checked off all the boxes I wanted, and thought everything would be okay. Shortly after I started, they hired a couple interns to do some extra work in my area (but reporting to someone other than me). Since then, I've basically been getting cut out of my job. I'm sure some would be thrilled to collect a check for doing nothing, but not me. I feel like I was lied to on my interviews so I'd come out then they basically replaced me anyways.

I can't just quit, I need health insurance and a minimum salary to pay my lease, and I can't afford to pick up and move again. But I feel like I need to find a way out that won't hurt my future career options, cause the way I'm getting cut out and told to do the bare minimum is killing my mental health."

To make matters worse, in March, I caught COVID, which was debilitating for the rest of the semester due to Crohn's being an autoimmune condition. I went into remission over the summer and caught up on missed coursework and have been a straight-A student since. This is also the reason for my lack of extracurriculars during 9th grade.

With this being the case I need to actually learn essential parts of Software Engineering that will assist me for a future career, but seriously where do I get started? I have multiple friends in this line of work and they all say, ""Build your own projects first"". What does this even mean? How do I build something if I don't even know how to do it? What do I build? Where do I start to learn how to build this thing if I even find out what to build on? 

It actually makes no sense to me, in most lines of work you're taken in by someone else, are taught what to do, then do it. But with Software Engineering it's like everyone expect you to just... Know? Every extremely low position job or even no-pay internship for Software Engineering I can find requires me to be experienced with a certain programming language. How in the world am I supposed to be experienced if I don't have anything to even start off with in the first place? 

Can someone help me figure this out and show me how to get started? I'm sick of people telling me to just do my own projects, I literally don't know anything about Software Engineering, I can't just open up notepad and make my own internet browser you know? I seriously want to get into this line of work but I don't at all understand how to even start. My family is pressuring me into getting an internship for this line of work, but they don't understand how actually confusing it is. I really need this help."

 Death is inevitable, death is without pity, death is relentless, death is... Bored out of his skull.   
    
  In the middle of nowhere, to the right of somewhere just above women's wear sat the skeletal figure of the Grim reaper, waiting for the Big Bang.   
    
  *STUPID SHAVED MONKEY JUST HAD TO DO IT.*   
    
  A Human scientist had just finished building the first matter transporter and for it's unveiling chose antimatter as the cargo.   
    
  *THAT WAS STUPID ENOUGH BUT THEN HE DOUBLED DOWN AND PICKED THE SQUARE ROOT OF MINUS ONE AS THE DISTANCE.*   
    
  At which point, like any sensible lady would, reality picked her things, flipped life the finger and slammed the door on the way out.   
    
  *NOW I'M STUCK HERE ALL ALONE, WAITING FOR FATHER TIME TO WAKE UP AND RE-START THE UNIVERSE...*   
    
  This was not the first time something like this had happened and Death was starting to wonder if there wasn't a better way.   
    
  *IT IS ALWAYS A HUMAN WHO ENDS THE UNIVERSE PREMATURELY, IF THERE WAS A GIANT “DO NOT PULL THIS PLUG” SIGN FLOATING IN SPACE THE PAINT WOULD NOT BE DRY THAT A HUMAN WOULD HAVE ALREADY PULLED IT... TWICE!*  
    
  There are many rules that everyone and everything needs to follow, even Death.   
    
  *THEN AGAIN, THOSE RULES APPLY ONLY WHILE THE UNIVERSE EXISTS.*   
    
  Death grinned and began to turn back time, an idea forming in his not so empty skull.   
    
  \*\*\*   
    
  David Sands was about to flip the switch that was either going to earn him all the scientific awards or tear apart the universe.   
    
  *Either way, this should be interesting!*   
    
  Before he could reach the switch however all the lights went out, he and the dozen or so colleagues of his looked around in confusion.   
    
  David: “Okay, can someone go check the circuit breakers.”   
    
  Kira a young Horuous intern spoke up.   
    
  Kira: “Sir, Darwin station is powered by solar winds and everything is made in such a way that a power surcharge is impossible.”   
    
  David pondered the response for a moment.   
    
  David: “Did we forget to pay the electric bill then?”   
    
  A half a dozen hands simultaneously hit their owners' face with an odd clapping sound at the lame joke.   
    
  David smiled then became pensive.   
    
  *Pretty sure one of those sounded like someone dropped a bunch of dominoes on the ground.*   
    
  Death was about to make his grand entrance when he heard the joke and had facepalmed, he quickly rallied and appeared in front of the scientists.   
    
  The lights turn back on and now stood in the middle of the room the skeletal figure of the Grim reaper.   
    
  Death: “I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA...”   
    
  The shadow cast by his cloak started to grow and lights flickered.   
    
  Death: “I WAS THERE AT THE BEGINNING AND I WILL BE THERE AFTER THE END...”   
    
  His eyes began to glow a sinister red.   
    
  Death: “GODS AND MORTALS ARE NOTHING BUT WHEAT TO MY SCYTHE. **I. AM**!”   
    
  While everyone was either in the process of panicking or running away David was not amused.   
    
  David: “... Yeah we get it you're Batman, could you kindly frack off? We're kind of in the middle of something here.”   
    
  The shadow of Death disappeared, the glow of his eyes died down and the lights returned to normal.   
    
  Death: “... BATMAN, SERIOUSLY!?”   
    
  He moved towards Kira and in a deafening whisper, asked:   
    
  “IS HE LIKE.”   
    
  And made a crazy gesture with his finger.   
    
  Kira barely managed to shake his head “no” while behind him a couple of scientists, more familiar with David, shook their hands indicating “sorta, yeah”.   
    
  Death turned to face the man who would destroy the universe.   
    
  Death: “YOU CANNOT ACTIVATE THAT DEVICE, IT WOULD DESTROY THE UNIVERSE.”   
    
  David calmly walked towards Death and looked him straight in the eye sockets.   
    
  David: “Listen Gary, mind if I call you Gary?”   
    
  Before Death could answer David continued.   
    
  David: “How do we know you're telling the truth?”   
    
  Death was still digesting the whole Gary thing so it took him a moment to answer.   
    
  Death: “WHY,  WHY WOULD I LIE?""  
    
  David scratched his chin.   
    
  David: “Fine, we'll stop the experiment... You know why it fails thought?”   
    
  Death: “USING ANTIMATTER WAS ALREADY PUSHING IT BUT USING THE SQUARE ROOT OF MINUS ONE WAS SEVERAL STEPS TOO FAR.”   
    
  David: “So what you're saying is that antimatter is okay?”   
    
  Death squinted at the insane, barely evolved monkey, until one of the senior scientists slapped David behind the head.   
    
  David massaged the back of his head.   
    
  David: “That was a joke! Fine we'll be careful, I swear!”   
    
  Death: “HOPEFULLY I WILL NEVER HAVE TO PAY THIS STATION A VISIT EVER AGAIN.”   
    
  As he faded away Death pondered what had just happened, how he basically broke the laws of the universe, how he made his presence known to mortals and about something far more important:   
    
  *GARY HUH...NEVER HAD A NICKNAME BEFORE, I LIKE IT!*   
    
  end."
11ue1mx,4,2023-03-18,Am I moving to a new job too quickly? Is it wrong to feel guilty?,Dazedf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ue1mx/am_i_moving_to_a_new_job_too_quickly_is_it_wrong/,"So I (22M) just graduated college last May and started working remote for a pretty standard engineering firm. It has amazing PTO (5 weeks) and ok insurance. But the actual job is more entry level engineering and not at all in my field of interest nor is the pay anything special. It’s honestly taking a toll mentally not bc it’s difficult - rather I feel like I’m not contributing to anything useful from the same spot at home. I find myself struggling to stay motivated. It’s a nice job for entry level but just not engaging enough for me. So I updated my resume and reached out to a few companies. 

Today I learned one of the companies I found interesting wanted to interview me a week from now. I said yes but now feel a little hesitant as I’m leaving a comfortable reliable job for one in a nearby city. I haven’t worked the current company a full year (about 9 months to date) and don’t have too much experience as I couldn’t land an engineering internship during college. Also moving away from home but not too far. 

Would it look bad leaving before a year? And what would you do in my situation? I still will do the interview to ask further questions but wanted to get some feedback."
11ueo3w,126,2023-03-18,Is anyone else feeling uncertain about pursuing an MBA in the current environment?,heretol3arn,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/11ueo3w/is_anyone_else_feeling_uncertain_about_pursuing/,"Personally, I would like to pursue consulting post-mba, but I have a strong feeling that recruiting outcomes may be less than ideal for this upcoming year. My thoughts:

1. With Tech taking a huge hit and hiring freezes across the industry, many who were initially interested in pursuing Tech may flip to consulting recruiting.

2. Anecdotally, across many different forums, it seems that this past year’s recruiting cycle was rough + w/ tons of people sitting on the bench, I’m making an assumption that the firms are going to reduce overall hiring / intern opportunities as they try to figure out how to downsize their existing headcount. 

Now, I understand that it’s impossible to predict what is going to happen in the next year, however I do think a lot of signs are pointing to a particularly tough year ahead + the additional concern of taking out huge loans doesn’t really help.

Am I the only one feeling this way? Anyone else worried/trying to risk manage?"

ReactJS - 3 months (internship)

Native iOS Development (Swift/Objective-C) - 1.5 years

Flutter - 1 year

And now, nalipat naman ako sa backend role using Typescript and AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework, and I’m thinking of leaving kasi naisip ko na parang magiging “sayang” yung mobile dev exp ko

1.	Is this kind of experience as a generalist good for a dev? Hindi ba parang mas ok kung mag specialize ako sa isang field like iOS development or Flutter to get senior roles?

2.	Do you have any advice for my situation specifically? Parang di ko kasi masyado trip yung backend pero I’m willing to power through it as long as it can help my career and future job opportunities though I’m not sure which positions to apply for in the future lol

3.	Speaking of, common ba ang fullstack roles pero mobile ang frontend instead of web? Ito lang kasi ang nakikita kong future ko if i push through with this backend role kasi sobrang onti pa lang ng work exp ko with React and mas mobile talaga ang expertise ko.

Most likely without pay, but hey I'm all in if i can learn something new and work along. Meanwhile I also can apply to another company that would be willing to hire jr software dev's. They most likely would pay below average wages (almost minimum wage in my country). But the company provides software solutions and most likely I would have many projects to do but little mentorship. Both choices would only be from April to June. What do you do guys think (research / job/ or studies) ?

I am interested in pursuing masters abroad (assuming that it would be feasible for me to do so) but I currently don't have any inclination towards any specific field (in computer science, in which I should do my masters in). AI / ML is a hot field but I am not particularly interested in it (if it has the ability to pay well, I just might do it for money). 

Even if I don't do masters and keep on working as SDE, how can I grow my career in a situation where AI has the ability to make things obsolete? What steps should I take to ensure that in the coming decades, I am not unemployed? If needed, what are the side skills I should learn to ensure that I will have at least some potential to earn money?"

My experiences
Made a minting website for my own NFT project in the past using node.js
A little bit of basic C language coding and a little bit of basic HTML 

I’m currently following youtube guides and lessons regarding HTML and will soon reach CSS and next is JS.

I wish to be a cloud engineer because I feel that that would be a necessity in the future.

But as of now I want to be a full-stack web dev and that explains the reason of the youtube HTML lessons. 

Would this be enough in applying for junior or internship roles in companies?

Any replies would be a great help, thank you po!"

I am a junior industrial engineering major. I was offered and accepted a position earlier this week for a supply chain internship. The internship is at my dad’s former company and a coworker who he was friends with has given me great general career advice and was helpful in my application process. I have already informed him that I accepted the offer and thanked him. However, yesterday I received an offer from an internship that originally rejected me in January. This internship is labeled as an industrial engineering internship, so I feel it is better for me because it is exactly my major. It is also at a large, very well known manufacturing company and pays at a significantly higher rate. 

I would feel awful turning back on an accepted offer. But, the new offer is at a dream company, is more specific to my major, and pays significantly better. I am looking for any advice on what I should do. I had no way of foreseeing this situation and I am in an extremely tough spot."

So I just realised I had submitted my not so great GRE scores during the test day itself to Upenn. While applying to courses, I came across MCIT on-campus program which makes GRE optional this year. I ended up applying as this is the perfect course for me being a non-CS undergrad but is extremely passionate about programming and Data Science. I have 161Q and 149V which aren’t great considering I’m an international student. But I do have strong LoRs, internships and projects in CS domain and now I’m tensed as I feel my GRE scores will dilute my profile.

11us5bv,426,2023-03-18,Dummies full guide and tips on getting interviews and getting hired on to an IT or security role,bcjh,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/11us5bv/dummies_full_guide_and_tips_on_getting_interviews/,"Here’s some tips below I’ve outlined that may help you land an interview or even get the job. I’m doing this because I’ve seen a lot posts lately asking for help and asking what the job market is like right now as I’m looking for my next role and I wanted to consolidate everything I've learned in the past 6 months. 


**Tip #1:** Tailor your résumé for the security or networking job that you want. I know this is a lot of work if you’re applying for 3–5 jobs a night but it can make all the difference to the recruiter and the software they push the résumés through. Utilize some of the keywords that they have in the job description so that you get looked at. I like to search google images for tech résumé examples as I'm building mine to borrow from ideas. 

*Example:* If you have experience in ISO 27001 at your last job and it’s listed in their job description add that in to your professional skills section. 

*Bonus tip:* Re-write you experience section so it's worded more towards the IT world. An example would be: ""assisted customers with their mobile phone plans and phone issues"" but instead I would say ""Consulted and trained clients in troubleshooting mobile phone issues on new and existing wireless hardware and software"" (you're using more technical words).

*Bonus tip 2:* You can add ""key responsibilities"" and also ""key achievements"" under you experience with a job, this will help you stand out, [here's an example of that!](https://imgur.com/a/81OOhhw)


**Tip #2:** If you see a job listed on Indeed or LinkedIn, do not apply on those job boards, go directly to that companies website and try to apply for it there. There’s several reasons why and to make this post shorter, u/Milwacky outlined it very well [in this post here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/w29epj/lpt_dont_use_linkedins_easy_apply_find_the/)


**Tip #3:** Feel free to find the recruiter or hiring manager and message them before applying. This will get you noticed, get your name in their mind, make a professional connection with them, and it just helps cut through all the noise in the hiring process. I realize this isn't always an easy thing to do. Here’s a template I found online that might work if you need a start:

*Example:* ""Hi Johnny, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to learn more about the entry level security role you posted about. I'm currently a _____ at ________ university with _____ years of internship experience in the tech industry; including roles at _______ and ________. I’ll be a new _______ graduate in _______, and I’m looking to continue my career in the IT and security space. I’m passionate about ______ and I’d love the opportunity to show you how I can create value for your technology team, just like I delivered this project (insert hyperlink) for my last employer. I hope to hear from you soon and am happy to provide a resume! Thank you.""


**Tip 4:** Have a home lab and some projects at home (or work) you’re working on. This shows the recruiter that this isn’t some job you want but is a field that you’re truly interested in where you find passion and purpose. It also helps you get things to list on your résumé in your professional skills section. Lastly you’re gaining real-world knowledge. You don’t need a fancy rig either, you can get a lot done with just your computer and VirtualBox. 

Currently I’m personally working on configuring my PfSense router I bought and a TP-Link switch, I’m finishing CompTIA Net+ (already have Sec+), I’m taking an Active Directory course on Udemy and also a Linux Mastery course. Also a ZTM Python course. Below is a list of resources. 

r/HomeLab

r/PfSense

r/HomeNetworking

[gns3.com](https://www.gns3.com/) - network software emulator

[https://www.udemy.com/](https://www.udemy.com/) - most courses will run you around $15-25 I’ve found and a lot of them seem to be worth it and have great content. 

[zerotomastery.io](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/) they have great courses on just about everything and the instructors and the communities are really great, some of their courses are also for direct purchase on Udemy if you don’t want to pay $39 a month to subscribe). 

[This is a great 20 minute overview](https://youtu.be/4O_MxTPmah4) on HomeLabs for a beginner from a great IT YouTube channel!

Also check out [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) on YouTube, he has great content as well, arguably some of the best IT related content on YouTube. 


**Tip 5:** Have a website! This is where you get to geek out and show off your current projects, certifications, courses you’re working, and overall your skills. [NetworkChuck does a great course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w) on how you can get free credit from Linode and host your own website here. 

*Example:* Don't be intimidated by this one, but one user in [this post here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityJobs/comments/11abexl/how_many_of_you_want_to_share_your_cybersecurity/) posted a pretty cool showcase of his skills on his website with a cool theme: [https://crypticsploit.com/](https://crypticsploit.com/)


**Tip 6:** Brush up on those interview questions they may ask. You mainly want to be prepared for two things: **technical questions** around IT and security, and secondly you want to be prepared for **behavioral based interview questions**. 

For technical questions check out these videos:

[12 Incredible SOC Analyst Interview Questions and Answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfNr1vx3lEM&amp;t=255s)

[Complete GRC Entry-Level Interview Questions and Answers](https://www.youtube.com/live/p6E1PQtQIow?feature=share) - this one is obviously GRC but still very very helpful and goes over how to dress. Personally I like to do the suit and tie thing most of the time.

[CYBER SECURITY Interview Questions And Answers!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j06Kg7OkoR0&amp;t=474s) - I love this guys presentation and accent. 

For behavioral based questions check out these videos and channels:

[STAR Interview Technique - Top 10 Behavioral Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSbN-0swDgM&amp;t=368s)

Lastly be prepared for [""tell me about yourself""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZvwSnPT1T0) in case they ask that. 

*Bonus tip 1:* Always have a few stories that you can pull from for these different behavioral based interview questions, it will make answering the questions easier if you prepare them. *Example:* I have a situation where I ""disagreed with a manager"" and my story explains how I was professional and turned our disagreement in to a big win for both me and my manager. 

*Bonus tip 2:* **ALWAYS** ask questions at the end of the interview. Here's my list of great questions to ask, some/most of these are forward thinking for the most part which makes you appear like you want to succeed in the role. 

* If you hired me today, how would you know in 3 months time that I was the right fit?
* How will you measure my performance to know I'm making an impact in the role? 
* Tell me about the culture of the IT department? 
* What are some qualities you want in a candidate to make sure they're the right culture fit for the company/department?
* What's the most important thing I should accomplish in the first 90 days?
* What are some of the most immediate projects that I would take on?
* What kind of challenges for the department do you foresee in the future? 
* What do new employees typically find surprising after they start?
* What continuous learning programs do you have at your company for IT professionals?
* What qualities seem to be missing in other candidates you’ve talked to? (this is definitely a more **bold** question to ask)
* Can you tell me about the team I would be be working with? 
* Can you tell me about a recent good hire and why they succeeded? 
* Can you tell me about a recent bad hire and what went wrong? (you don't have to follow up with this one if you don't want to but shows you want to succeed and give you a chance to talk to how you would succeed)


**Tip 7:** Get with a local 3rd party IT recruiter company. I got with a local recruiter by finding him on linked in, I also used to work for a large financial company as a temp and remembered them by name so when I saw them I immediately called/emailed to present myself, my situation, and we set up a meeting. Not only did the meeting go well but he forwarded my resume on to his team and then immediately sent me 3 SECURITY JOBS that I had no idea were available in my city and were not even posted on those company's websites. 3rd party recruiters get access faster and sometimes have more visibility to the job market. 


**Tip 8:** Do a 30-60-90 Day Plan for the hiring manager. This is what directly got me in to interviews and got me offers. This is a big game changer and I had CTO's telling me they're never seen anything like this done. You're outlining exactly what you want to accomplish in your first 30, 60, and 90 days and your tailoring what it says based on what the job description says. I had to re-write this for a couple of more-GRC-based roles that I applied to and I *only* did this for roles that I really wanted and for some of the roles the recruiter found for me. 

*Example:* [30-60-90 Day Plan](https://imgur.com/OfHRINa)

**Extra tip:** You could look in to certifications. I got my Sec+ and a basic Google IT Cert to get me started. [Here's a roadmap of certs](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/) you can get, take it with a grain of salt but it's a great list and a great way to focus on your next goal. 

r/CompTIA is a great community to look in to those certs.

Also ISC^2 is a great company for certs as well as GIAC.

#GOOD LUCK FRIENDS &amp; GO GET THOSE JOBS!

I started out with a very low salary with no internships. About a year ago I got an offer from another company and accepted a counter-offer to stay for a salary in the low six figures. I’m happy with my job and the company is still doing well despite the economic downturn with no signs of slowing down.

I worked remotely out of state for a couple months last year and have been looking to move there since. My job required a return to office 3 days a week 6 months ago and almost no one including upper management shows up more than once a week. We also have a bunch of employees out of state that will work remotely indefinitely, but HR is not allowing “remote conversions” at this time.

I’m in a weird situation in that I’m well respected at my current job, but I can’t find a new job that will pay close to what I make with the market downturn. I’ve had around 10 interviews over the past 6 months and received a couple offers below my current salary so far, but I wasn’t really interested in these companies anyways.

One thing I have to my advantage is that I have a good rapport with my boss and the tech VP and they have struggled with attrition over the past year, so I don‘t think they are willing to just let more people go. My boss said he personally won’t enforce any office mandates and won’t be complying with RTO. The company can clearly accommodate remote despite HR policy, as they have remote employees around the country. 

I feel like it would be foolish to leave a solid job in this current market as it puts me on the top list for layoffs, but at the same time it has been rough for my mental health living here and looking to move asap.

Any advice for pushing to be allowed to relocate and work remotely at my current job? I’m trying to make a case in a way that I don’t risk losing my job, while also conveying that relocating is something that’s really important to me."

I am looking into internships as I am already a junior and it’s best to start as early as possible I was told. My desired field is cybersecurity and am currently working on my Net+ before moving on to Sec+. i applied for an intern at Mckenny’s and was selected to make it past their interviewing stage before i found out it was a co op requiring 3 full time semester rotations. with that being said I’ve come across three paths I can take,  i can look into help desk It support (but everything in my area appears to be contracted for 1 year), go the mckenny co op route, or continue my education and get as many certs as possible. 

if i go with the help desk i hear it’s an awesome place to start as it’s the starting point for most everyone in IT, but cons are it’s 33k yearly, i have to commit to a 1 year contract working full time with an hour commute, and possibly put my education on hold

if i go with mckenny’s i would also possibly be putting my education on hold however i’ll be getting hands on experience with a full time workweek and their website says they hire a lot of co-ops straight out of the program (although idk what this entails)

if i go the education route i’ll be finishing my BA degree and have multiple certs under my belt by 2024. I come from an asian household so education is pushed very hard 

i know experience is more important but when i’m this close should i put a pin in my education now or just see it through? what are some paths that u recommend for someone starting out fresh like me?"

Wrote about how seeing a homeless man scratch off a lottery ticket every day inspired my love for inquisition and research and gave me the hope to come out to my sisters 😭 everyone who read my essay said it was great but idk i think i shouldve talked about something else

*Extenuating circumstances*
 Basically j a lot of bs tht prevented my from going to school and doing my work (being homeless, not having a car, having to babysit, etc) . My teachers mentioned this in my LORs. Read my previous posts for more on this if you want🤷🏽


RESULTSS (and i know my list is super scattered but there are things I like about each school and im super adaptable)

RIT - &gt;!Rejected!&lt;

Agnes Scott - &gt;!Rejected!&lt; (but I think it’s because my spanish teacher accidentally gave me an F and tht mid year report got sent to colleges lmfao. I got an early rejected a few days after they received it too LOL. She fixed it and the report got resent but i still dk how much it impacted my other decisions. I emailed them about it but waiting for a response)

Penn State - &gt;!Accepted Altoona w/ 26k scholarship!&lt;

UAkron - &gt;!Accepted // 40k STEM scholarship, waiting on other scholarships, finaid, and honors college info!&lt;

Ohio State - &gt;!Accepted main campus for physics w enough aid to make my net price 4000/yr!&lt;

Deep Springs College - &gt;!Accepted first round - Waiting for final result. I really really want to go so we are praying (#1 choice, I love the school more than any other on this list)!&lt;

Skidmore - &gt;!Rejected!&lt; I showed as much demonstrated interest as I could, I LOVE skidmore, i even have a shirt and bookbag frm them 😪

Case Western - &gt;!Rejected!&lt; (ISTG it’s not possible for a human to show more demonstrated interest than me😭 case pls i promise i can handle it i just went thru some bs during hs)

Howard - &gt;!Deferred!&lt; 

FAMU -  Waiting

Ohio University - &gt;!Accepted // 14k scholarship, rejected honors college!&lt;

Stony Brook - &gt;!Rejected (but got matched with some other SUNY schools I won’t apply to)!&lt;

University of Mary Washington - &gt;!Deferred (?)!&lt;

UDub -&gt;!Rejected (tbh i knew id get rejected but I rly love the school lol)!&lt;

Hampton -  Waiting

(i applied to northeastern and vtech but my applications were incomplete. northeastern was incomplete bc my teacher (not mentioned above) never submitted my rec :/ and for vtech i meant to withdraw my app but forgot to so idk if those count😭)

Conclusion - 

I'm actually so disappointed getting rejected from 2 of my dream schools. I tried super hard to do what I could despite my circumstances. I didn't apply to more schools because I was discouraged by EVERYONE and felt insecure. Apps were SUPERRRRR competitive this yr so I'm not thattttt  down. Maybe I should've applied somewhere need-blind 😭 Even if I get accepted to the HBCUS (I'm thinking I'll only be accepted to Hampton) they would probably be too expensive for me to attend. My mom tried her hardest to stop me from going to college and it seems as though she got what she wanted 😣 Sometimes I feel like the unluckiest person ever lol 😭😭 If all else fails I can probably afford UAkron and I have friends there. Just gonna keep praying for deep springs w/ my fingers crossed :()"

11uzz6p,0,2023-03-18,"First week of work after graduation, work environment feels too toxic, demanding and frustrating, Is it just me or is it with most of the startups/ companies?",Pronoob_me,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11uzz6p/first_week_of_work_after_graduation_work/,"To start with: I'm an international student on F1 visa - so quitting is not an option unless I've another offer. I've already used 70% of my OPT unemployment days as well (and it's very difficult to land a job in this market).

**TLDR:** Poor onboarding, worked 55hrs on weekdays, expected to work on weekends, my opinions are not valued or even acknowledged, super ambitious goals - at least from me and super low pay to justify any of the above. Week 1 into work and I'm frustrated, annoyed and pissed. I was 'expected to solve some problems', but here I'm just thinking over my decisions to join this company. Is this because I've never worked in the industry? Or is this beyond being crazy? **TLDR ends**

A bit of my technical background: I consider myself to have strong hold on programming, particularly Machine Learning. I do not have any ""industry experience"", but I've had few interns, about a year of freelance and loads of 'good' academic projects; if it matters, I've a Masters degree. I fairly consider these to make up for lack of experience and put me in a batch of 1-2 YoE. I've always loved the idea of working at a startup for following reasons: working on comparatively cooler work, brainstorming, value for my opinion, high paced work (not the work-is-life kind of high pace though).

A bit about my behavior (based on how I see and what my close one's have told): I'm (brutally) honest, and upfront about everything - if I don't like X, I'll let you know; and in terms of work, I'll expect you to work on it. The current codebase is trash. I'll let you know. The current build is not worth to make it to deployment. I'll let you know. I don't agree with you, I'll let you know.

Longer version:

Now, to start off with the actual scenario (warning: 90% rant below):

*Everything in italics are the founder/ other member's comments summarized.*

So, I start working with Company A as a Machine Learning Engineer (in theory, there's one more MLE for the past 2 years - but he knows NOTHING about ML except maybe ResNet18). Apart from me, there are 3 core engineers, the founder and a few non-tech people. Company is in a very early stage, seed phase, but already in profits so unsure about the next investment round. Below is my journey so far.

Day 1: A 30m call to tell me what project I've to work on - no examples, no samples, no onboarding, no introduction to current codebase. I was invited to the repository and asked to do everything else on my own. I was even on the wrong track for half of the day. I told myself, okay it's day one, let's see how things go.

Day 2: I come up with 'suggestions' that these are some models, techniques and ideas that we explore and see what works. *""le them: good, now deploy it in production by tonight""*. Wait what? I suggested we can spend time to figure out how this works, what options we've. Keeping most of the part anonymous: we're trying to build a model for a task that has NEVER been done in the domain. There's no dataset, there are no examples, there are no leads. To sum it, I've to come up with a solution which should takes at the very least 2-3 weeks (possibly even months) of work; and finish it in a day. EOD: I tell them this is best we've right now, and it doesn't even look like 5% accurate.

Day 3: *We're still going to push it, so do it.* All frustrated, clueless, I wrap the code, tell them it's done and guess what? I have to integrate it with existing code without any knowledge and the other members denying to hop on a call because it is supposed to be *""my task"".* All they did was point me to 2 utility functions that are a part of what I'll use after everything is done. Other than that, I've no clue what's happening (there's no documentation/ comments - only way is to go line by line and trace process; this triggers me because they can literally hop on a 10m call and explain me instead of asking me to spend 4-5hrs trying to do it on my own). Finally, I push out the model, as expected, it barely keeps up with expectations and that's done.

Day 4: *Okay you deployed it, but it's not exporting correctly.* Wasn't I using YOUR code to export? Why am I to debug that? Anyways, I do that, and I'm directly assigned another task which is to be deployed by end of next day. To ensure we're on the same page, I confirmed it with 2 people (founder and 1 team member) that I see a function which uses external API in location X, which I'm to change with an in-house model. They agree and I start working on it. Summary: Change X with Y.

Day 5: I had commitments in the evening, so I login earlier (8am) and let the everyone know I need to leave at 6pm (10hrs of work is already MORE THAN ENOUGH). I make a deployment, not happy with the results, I rollback to previous version and 5:30pm I let them know the status. History again, forced to deploy *('if it doesn't work, we'll take the responsibility').* I push it back, deploy and done. Now guess what? They don't just want it to be \`X -&gt; Y\`, they want it as an API - which is pain, because of its dependency on the existing codebase. I let them know I've a commitment to keep up and I need to leave. If needed, I can take a look when I return, or have it on priority on Monday (PS: the old X works as well, so it wasn't like the customers would see any difference). But no, I'm to build the API and push it today itself before leaving. Fair, I do my part. I test locally, everything works; I let them know. The other co-worker, who takes care of pushing the deployments, wasn't around - I waited around 10m. I was already 2hrs late for my commitment, so I sign off letting them know that I've pushed and left.

Day 6 (today - we schedule a 'chat' for yesterday's events): *You weren't allowed to leave before you test everything* (FFS? I TOLD YOU I NEED TO LEAVE AT A PARTICULAR TIME. I'M STAYING BACK FOR YOUR LAST-MINUTE CHANGES AND YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT MORE FOR A COWORKER TO COME AND DEPLOY FOR WHICH I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN?). *Since your joining, your work isn't meeting our performance criteria* (Hello? You want me to understand the complete problem statement, come up with a novel solution, collect the dataset, research all possibilities, experiment with the models, implement the final one and test it - all of this in 2 days while also dealing with your existing codebase? Sorry, but this is not ""select \* from table"" we're talking about: not saying SQL is easy by any means\*) *Now, I want you to fix the yesterday's deployment before Monday AND work on your previous model and give me an improvement.* (Um, I thought you were taking the responsibility for the yesterday's work? And why am I asked to work on weekdays if I already poured freaking 55hrs on the weekdays? And for the previous model, I WILL NEED MORE TIME, A LOT MORE THAN 2 DAYS). *So, get working on it, and finish it before Monday. Also, we need further improvements on the previous model before next Friday and you're being assigned to 2 other tasks as well.* (No comments, I was just quite after this part).

I'll break down both perspectives, so it'll give a better understanding of where my frustration is coming from.

Their POV:

* I'm one of the initial hires, which makes it fair for them to expect more from me.
* The current employees had never followed 'best practices', which explains the current state of codebase.
* They may have some deadlines to meet, which explains the quicker deployments, even if unfinished.

My POV:

* If you're expecting me to work 55hrs on weekdays, AND THEN work on weekends; I'm not taking 55-60% of what an average engineer is paid in my region (I'm paid way less than average pay for a SE).
* Fair, your current codebase isn't too easy to deal with for a newcomer. Care to have an onboarding to tell me where to look for? Right now, I just have access to the repository, and the rest is on me to figure it out because apparently, ""it's my job.""
* I don't see how putting out a useless model to production makes any sense - this is available to all the existing customers. Doesn't that have a negative impact over your reputation?

For me, no matter how much I try to improve my mood and push myself to start liking the work; all of the above keeps pushing me further away and makes me want to see the job only as a placeholder for my visa till I get another job. I tried having a conversation with the founder. For any doubts I've regarding existing codebase, *""this is your job to figure it out""*; and for any questions regarding the work culture/ quality/ ambitious goals: *""this is how we work""*.

So, at this point, I can't tell if I'm being overwhelmed by the amount of work, or frustrated because of being ""bossed around"", or angry because they ""don't care"" for my personal life and commitments (this is what the founder said outright to me) but they expect me to care about their product and take the responsibility. I had a talk with few of my close ones and everyone had a different opinion. Some say it's almost how everyone works (or every company has its own issues), let few weeks pass. Some argue it's too much and I should start looking for other offers ASAP (if so, how do I justify my 1 week of experience?).

Am I being the crazy one here? Or are my points valid?"

Posting it here just cause I wanted to see what other RU folks do.

Edit 1: I don't have a lot of money in my account. I was just being a bit petty about the interest rates. I could be getting like 6 bucks instead of a couple of pennies a month. 

Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments. I made this post because I have an internship coming up and I don't want to put the money I get into a bank that gives me 0.01% on it.

11v2rw6,0,2023-03-18,Help!,Interesting-AS,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11v2rw6/help/,"I’m really sad right now and here’s the condensed version of what’s going on. I had a resource fair I needed to attend for my internship this morning. My husband had plans to do these challenges with his buddies (they do it maybe 1x a year or ever 2 years) where they usually eat and drink gross things. I made sure to leave the fair I was attending early to be able to drive the hour home and my husband be on time to meet his friends. It had gotten moved to 1 and so I was quite surprised and sad that when I got home at noon he wanted to head out the door early to hang out with them. I was sad but figured okay it won’t be a crazy amount of time I’ll see him later. It’s now almost 5:30 and he’s still there. Maybe it’s my fault because I didn’t ask how long this would be but from what I remember in the past, it’s maybe 2 hours tops. So here’s where I need advice. I know I need to talk to my husband on how it makes me feel. Do I talk to him way later after he’s home or right when he’s home? I don’t want to feel or be considering a jerk by ruining his good mood with this conversation the second he’s home. Am I overthinking this? I’m just feeling really hurt. For context, I do have mental health problems but can be spot on with observations or sensations sometimes. I just also don’t want to talk and feel like this is all in my head."

I'm an admit for the class of 2027 at UF! A little bit about me, I'm from Texas, and I come from an early-college program for high schoolers where we are enrolled at a university and take all university-level classes for our 11th and 12 years as a high schooler. This means I would have nearly a full year of college credits applying into college. I applied to major in biomedical engineering with intentions of being a premed as well. With my main goal to go into medicine, and also having an interest in BME, I'm curious what life would be like as a premed with an unconventional major. I hope the UF community can help me with a few of my questions below. 

1. What is it like being a premed at UF? What are the opportunities that UF offers? 
2. What are the pros and cons of being a BME premed? Does it make sense to major in engineering while also trying to pursue med school? How can a background in BME support (or hurt) a student in med school applications?
3. How would the BME major work as a student with a lot of college credits? I've already completed almost 1+ year of preBME courses. I know I can only start BME in the spring of sophomore year. Is that true or are there any exceptions? Any recommendations for what I should do during my fall semester of sophomore year? Would co-ops be a good option?
4. What co-ops are available? Any specific ones that are open to Sophomores?
5. Opportunities for research and internships starting the summer before enrolling? Any reputable internships for BME students you would recommend looking into?"

I cried for no reason almost every day, didn't eat, didn't study for tests, self harmed, and had overall bad mental health for all of my teen and college years. I went to an expensive private college and incurred debt because I didn't have good study habits and I wasn't sure what to do in college. I decided to go to a community College and get a computer programming degree and I just finished it in December. My mental health is alot better now and I'm at the 4 year school doing well in all my classes and am ready to take on the next semester and the semester after that because I just want to be done with everything. I'm mad at myself because I feel like if I didn't have the issues I had when I was younger, I could've had a 4 year degree by now instead of having to wait another 2 years and incur debt where I didn't need to. Instead of being negative, I could've focused on getting an internship, improving my skills, working to save money, going out with friends, and just overall doing things that would benefit me. I'm doing those things now, but I feel like I wasted alot of time doing nothing."

11v5mqg,3,2023-03-18,At a crossroads: Do I give up on my academia pipe dream?,bob_major,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/11v5mqg/at_a_crossroads_do_i_give_up_on_my_academia_pipe/,"I'm an undergraduate junior studying Math and Computer Science.

In  high school one of my teachers started teaching me about all the data structures and algorithms and I thought I found what I wanted to do with  the rest of my life. I learned about Turing Machines and mathematical proofs at the end of high school and kept learning more and more about  them. By now I'm taking graduate theoretical computer science and algebra classes.

I had three different software engineering internships during this time. I really liked the people I was around and got paid hourly more than my entire family combined, but the work itself felt meaningless. I was always still reading about Math, which made me feel more alive.

After returning this school year, I've felt dead academically like I've never felt before.

* I started doing computer science research with a professor since I heard that I need research to get into graduate school. In this particular lab, there were dozens of researchers and PhD students applying menial optimizations to previous papers to create slightly faster algorithms, over and over again to produce papers for the next conference. I never felt a sense of purpose like I did when I was learning theoretical computer science or algebra, it just felt like software engineering to me.
   * Will graduate school just be the same thing? Can I just study problem and subjects I enjoy or will I eventually have to grind for publications/funding?
* I reached a point where I could not follow any of my pure math classes on the blackboard. The corresponding chapters in the textbook make complete sense and I can follow them perfectly fine, however. At some point I just quit showing up to lectures (which I've never done before), and although now I can understand the content in a lot less time I go days without talking to anyone. I honestly asked some other people in each class if they knew what  was going on during lecture, and most of the others didn't either.
   * I can't shake the feeling that there's something wrong with me for not being able to understand these lectures.
* I've been rejected by every single research or REU program I've applied to.
   * I feel a legitimate sense of doom that graduate programs will not accept me either.
* When I grew up, my family lived in poverty. I don't care about luxuries, but I also want to have enough to live.
   * Will graduate school force me to live in poverty?

I've reached a  point thinking about this where I can barely fall asleep at night. Can anybody give me some advice on what they did in my shoes?"

Edit: Thank you all for the advice, I’m definitely making changes in my schedule and organizational skills. I’m going to work on certifications so I can get internships, even jobs. I will continue to save money and do activities to connect with others. Also, I wanted to pursue political science to become a lawyer. 

College for me, let me just say, it has been a bust. I was not the best student in high school and I had a bunch of life stuff that happened. I couldn’t really do a lot of extracurriculars or hang out with friends during high school. I just was so socially stunted and I never felt like I had the chance to be a teen or kid. My parents were super strict and I just feel like I had resources for me to succeed and I didn’t feel like I was in the environment to grow and be fulfilled. I had health issues senior year of high school and I had to go community college. I thought I could go for two years and maybe transfer to cool place like Columbia or NYU. But since I was an AP and IB credits, my parents forced me to graduated CC early, even though I had no money or scholarships to be on campus. It was awful. Living at home for almost two years after high school has been hard and I have no irl friends. My parents were super controlling and picky about my education. I never got the chance to grow and meet new people. I know I know, College isn’t always about people and friends. But I can’t concentrate on classes and have any will finish any homework because I feel exhausted and tired all the time. It’s so draining living at home. I’m thankful to be in a situation that all of basic physical needs are met, but I just feel like dead inside. I know I like helping people and I was thinking political science, but my parents shut that down and I won’t make any money. I said Data Science, but I feel like I’m just doing it mainly to please my parents not because it makes me fulfilled. Also I’m currently taking CS classes and I like them, but I don’t feel a strong connection. I just feel so isolated and lonely not being able to interact with any people. My parents are so oblivious thinking they did no harm. I felt like they made college more stressful and draining than better. Bro I j just want to grow and be happy. I can’t think about my academic and professional future . It feels like my life is over and I’m just surviving. It’s just really hard that my parents are expecting thrive in an environment that not meant for me thrive. 

TLDR: Don’t know if I have an academic/professional interests, I think my parents did not want me to stay Cc long, so they forced me to graduate early, I felt like any opportunity to grow an advance my career or academic was ruined. Should I focus on scholarships/internships to go in person or apply to another school as a transfer? Idk what to do with my life"

I was far from the “average” applicants that the U accepts, if anything i was below average. I had a downward trend in my grades tbh😭 My midterm report was also terrible. I had about an 80 UW gpa and multiple Cs and not a single A 😳

I credit my acceptance towards my LOR/Essays. I also had pretty good ECs - nothing crazy i didn’t start a Non-Profit or intern with the governor like most of y’all in here😭 I did have a couple hooks going for me tho ( URM, First-Gen, Low- income).

11v9y2y,0,2023-03-18,A case of Imposter Syndrome?,jdichh,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/11v9y2y/a_case_of_imposter_syndrome/,"**Maybe a long read for some, so beware.**

I’m a 21-year-old graduating student with a candidacy of Latin honors in IT from a well-known college in Laguna. Throughout my college life, my classmates and professors have been impressed with me, or easily impressed with me from the way I think, answer questions, perform tasks, and my straightforward, no nonsense, but kind and humble attitude according to them. Two of my professors who are IT practitioners even told me that I have great potential in the IT industry. And my family told me that, too.

This notion of me having a great potential in the industry was enforced when I found out that about 80% of my classmates paid to have their application/system for their capstone be done for them, ranging from 30k-70k, when our group didn’t even pay a centavo to an external developer. And we still got a 90%.

I’m experienced and/or kind of knowledgeable with the following:

* Computer Systems Servicing
* Office Applications
* Web Development (HTML, CSS and JS + Vue.js)
* Programming languages such as Python, C++, Java and PHP
* IDEs such as Android Studio, VS/VSCode
* Git and GitHub
* Video and photo editing (Paint.NET &amp; Vegas, only the basic stuff)

Right now, I’m expanding my knowledge by learning .NET, Azure, other JS frameworks, UI/UX designing, other relevant programming languages in the industry, and revisiting previous programming languages that I encountered.

I also did freelance work with building and fixing up computers, though my clients were all my classmates or someone they know and referred them to me. The largest I got from it was about P700, which involved cleaning up internals, reformatting, and installation of applications that they need. I don’t charge them a large amount as all of them are still students like me.

Currently, I’m taking my internship at a government agency and surprisingly, they’re nice people to work with. I even got told to slow down as I accomplish tasks too quickly. Though most of my work involves clerical stuff, video editing, etc., there are jobs here and there that involve being knowledgeable with software and hardware. I admit I’m pretty good with those, and if there are issues that are new to me, I can quickly find answers to it.

However, with graduation looming by, I just can’t get the idea out of my head that maybe I’m just not good enough to be involved in the industry as I mostly rely on StackOverflow and YouTube for guidance when programming. I understand that not every syntax can be memorized, you just have to be good at understanding code, good at understanding your problem and looking for answers for it, and formulating good questions. But still, the idea that I'm not good enough is still in my mind. And when I look at possible jobs that I could apply to, I always think about if I don’t do my job correctly, I’d get humiliated and maybe fired from my workplace.

What do you think? And what path would you recommend for me to take in order to be successful in the IT industry?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** For those of you who think that I'm bragging, I am 101% not. But I can understand why you would think that way. This is how I really feel, I don't have much exposure to the 'real world' yet, so I can come across as harsh, arrogant or whatever when communicating with people when I don't mean to be. Trust me, I've been told that a lot, since when I was just an elementary student. As a result of that, I just talk when it's needed. But I'm still working on how not to come across as what I mentioned."
11va2ki,0,2023-03-18,Is SAP PMO a good field to start working?,MajesticDovah,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11va2ki/is_sap_pmo_a_good_field_to_start_working/,"Hello, I started studing a couple of months ago and this year I started college, I got an oportunity of internship in a nice company, but its something I dont have much knowledge about.
Its on SAP PMO, and I did a bit of research about it,  but what I am getting insecure about is that I personally dont see much being talked about it (around my circle at least).
The thing is, I am getting into IT because it is a profession that is relatively easy to find a job (on my country most fields are over saturated and its hard to find a job paying even the minimal wage, but IT is really blooming), but what I see a lot is job opennings about developing (like frontend, backend stuff, java, python, coding, etc, etc).
So, is SAP PMO good to get into, like is it something companies need a lot? I am afraid to graduate and dont find a job as easily as a developer would and this is kinda the time for me to decide either going SAP or learning a common programming language.
Dont get me wrong, I am willing to study hard for whatever field, but coming from a poor family I finally got a chance to 'upgrade' this year and I mostly want something stable to pay the bills... that whole ""follow your dreams, do what you love"" is bs with my social background, work is work and I really wanna do this right, sooo should I go for SAP?

(Pardon my ignorance if I am saying something wrong about any of it, its all very new to me)."

Thank you for submitting your application to the Computer  Science major. At this time, it has been determined that you are  ineligible to declare the CS major due to a prerequisite GPA below below  the minimum required.

Below, please find a few resources to support you in creating a successful academic plan moving forward.

**Alternatives to the CS Major**

While you have not been admitted to the CS major, there are  still a number of ways to incorporate computer science curricula into  your undergraduate education at UC Berkeley. One path would be to pursue  the [Computer Science Minor](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/minor)  which currently requires a prerequisite GPA of 2.0; you may have  already met the prerequisite requirements for the minor through your  completion of the major requirements. Though minors do not receive  enrollment priority, there are increasing numbers of minors who  successfully complete the necessary coursework and go on to successful  careers in industry as well as graduate school.

Another path is to incorporate CS coursework into an allied  major that allows upper-division CS courses to count towards their  respective major requirements. These majors include (in no particular  order) Cognitive Science, Statistics, and Applied Math. You may use up  to 3 upper-division CS courses for these majors and count them as a  cluster or emphasis, though some majors may require prior approval from a  faculty advisor. Some students combine both paths and complete the  minor and an allied major with a CS cluster; in this case, you would  complete the same number of CS courses required of majors and the  employment outlook for these students is very good. Also, if the  coursework is applicable, you are able to overlap one course between a  minor and a major on the UC Berkeley campus.

Another option is to simply take those upper-division CS  courses you are interested in without formally applying them to another  major. Students from a variety of other majors do this and many find  this route still offers good post-graduate prospects in a variety of  fields. You should definitely not feel compelled to major in another  field simply because they will utilize upper-division CS courses. Taking  the same number of CS courses in addition to your choice of major,  whatever it may ultimately be, can often be just as effective in  achieving your goals as pursuing an allied major might be.

**CS Major Appeals**

To [submit an appeal](https://goo.gl/forms/RQsPCTp5SFTpfB4V2)  to the CS major application decision, one must demonstrate  extraordinary circumstances such as those involving health or mental  health, injury, work obligations, family crisis, etc. Students must  submit a personal statement describing how they have overcome these  circumstances and the activities in which they are engaged to support  their learning in computer science, and submit at least one strong  letter of recommendation from internships, or professors in CS61A, 61B,  70, or 61C. Appeals must be approved by the Vice Chair of LSCS,  Professor Hilfinger.

If you feel that there was a miscalculation or other  administrative error, or would like to discuss strategies moving  forward, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment with any  available CS Advisor through CalCentral or contact us at [cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu](mailto:cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu).

We've put together a page about coming back from the  difficult moments that happen to everyone at Cal. We hope that it is  useful for you to hear from students like you through the [EECS Resiliency Project](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/undergrads/resilience).

11vdsfy,1,2023-03-19,Should I quit my job?,Creepy_Result_1223,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11vdsfy/should_i_quit_my_job/,"Ive been working at my job for several years. Its a relatively small business with only 3 locations, so pretty much everyone knows the general managers and even the owner. I started working there part time when I was 16 alongside my now ex girlfriend (staffing birthday parties on the weekends). More than a year in to working there we broke up. Around the same time i moved to a regular staff position.

We weren’t initially on particularly bad terms following the break up. She had dumped me over the phone after we’d been dating for 3 years. After a while i managed to get over her and started realizing that our relationship hadn’t been as good as i had made it out to be in my mind. I was worried to tell people at work we broke up at first because i assumed they liked her more than myself, but was surprised to find out that she was/is almost universally hated among the staff. Over time i became more and more cold towards her realizing shed been quite controlling and terrible to me (it had been my first real relationship and id had nothing to compare it to). Still i bore her no ill will, i just didn’t want anything to do with her. At this point she was still only working weekends on and off. After a few months I found out that the reason she had broken up with me was because she had been cheating on me for a while and a friend of hers threatened to tell me about it. Looking back there were a lot of other signs and things i should have noticed. It was only a couple weeks after that that i heard she had applied to get the same job as i have. My direct boss the assistant manager was very against it and supportive basically saying she would never let that happen. Later that week i had another conversation with the manager who promised me that they would never hire her i told her that if they did i would quit. I later had a similar conversation with the general manager of the company who handles all hiring to main staff. Not a week later i find out that she is hired to our youth program 2 days a week. The manager apologizes to me saying that the youth program manager doesn’t approve his hires with them and reaffirms that they would NEVER hire her to my position. A month or two goes by and two days a week turns to 4. The schedule makes it impossible to avoid working at the same time as her monday through thursday. I get myself through by telling myself that its only until this july when she leaves for an out of state college. All the while i am becomming more and more miserable. At a time when a coworker was complaining about scheduling i hear that we may be looking to hire someone to pick up shifts on Thursday nights. When i heard about this the manager happened to be working so i talked with her again and she assured me they would not hire her. I reiterated i would quit if they did. A couple of weeks ago i found out that the gm has had her consistently working part of that shift (only part because she is a minor and cannot be the sole employee in the facility). When i found that out i was quite angry and almost quit that day. Two weeks after that the gm had me on the schedule while i will be out of town which he already knew about. I texted him to make sure he saw the error, and he responded saying don’t worry about it the new guy is taking your shift. Now that raised red flags in my mind for a couple reasons 1 its one of our busiest shifts and he is just starting his training. And 2 more importantly, him miss-scheduling is a pretty regular occurrence but he had never once told me who was taking my shift. That prompted me to take a look at the master copy of the schedule on the work computer where i found it to say my ex’s name and pending. Which is his way of noting he asked her to take the shift and she hasn’t confirmed. I was furious. I ended up yelling at the assistant manager which i felt really bad about because she had nothing to do with it and has always been on my side for it. She told me that my ex couldn’t even work that day. The next schedule was not sent to me, but i saw it and her name is on it. I dont mean to be petty but she is not a good employee. Supposedly all of her coworkers complain about her to management, there have been multiple safety concerns and the manger said she has been an unreliable employee at best.

The part that bothers me at this point isn’t having to see her, yes im miserable whenever i have to be around her, but ive had to deal with that nearly every day since January. The part that bothers me most is the fact that the gm is trying to hide it from me. I understand why he asked her. One of our full time employees is away on medical leave and me and another full time are both going to be out the week that she is scheduled. And really this is just an inciting incident. Ive been miserable at work lately because of her. This is a dead end job with no chance of raise other than the ones ive already gotten when minimum wage goes up, or promotion. It is not related to my chosen field of study. I could make more money and get better experience somehwere else. With my qualifications it wouldn’t be difficult to do. The thing thats been keeping me at my current job is that it used to be a place i loved being. I dont want to quit because that would mean a lull in my income and i would have to look for another job or internship. But im only becoming more and more unhappy in my current situation. I feel like my manager and gms promises have been chipped away to the point that i am as little a man of my word as they are if i stay because of my very real threat to quit. What should i do?"

With my job luck too I don't want to place the risk of dropping 40k to finish my bachelor's and probably going to take a break after this semester, my local community college is coincidentally now offering a bachelors program there for only a fifth of the cost as well which I'm considering.

This company doesn't offer internships for comp sci but they do for consulting. I was thinking of messaging this guy on LinkedIn. I have a message prepared. Should I send the message with he connect request, or wait until he accepts to message him (would this make him more likely to reply). I also have his email, so i that is my backup plan.

Will this score automatically reject me? The next stage is a casual chat with the Chief Risk Officer and then they extend offers to the top two candidates. This is my first time applying to internships so I have no idea if a score like this would normally eliminate someone outright in the tech industry, but they seem to really like me, and again, didn't place too much emphasis on the assessment so it might be used as a way to eliminate one of us if they cannot decide.

I could say some shit like don’t lose hope, but really I have no idea what goes into grad school decisions and I don’t want to give anyone false hope. What I will say is grad school applications are taxing and hard work. If you can afford the energy and jump through all the hoops that is an application cycle, you probably have the kinds of habits where you can work hard enough to get where you want to. But most importantly, you need to live your life and do stuff that makes you happy. 

Setbacks will only keep arriving in your life, so if this cycle has not gone well for you, then just keep working towards the type of person you want to become. Even if you get into grad school, that’s just one path out of many you can take in life and won’t inherently fix any issues. At the end of the day, what you get out depends a fair bit on what you put in, so don’t forget to live your life and be someone you are proud of or work towards that."

I managed to get a few internships, interned at like 4 dental labs during the 3 year period from which I was either fired or left due to not liking the job itself and not pushing myself hard enough to learn the trade from the people there.  


After finishing Dental Tech Uni, I found a place to work, at the start I was working for free for 4 months, then I got paid lower than minimum wage for 2 months before quitting due to not advancing or learning anything there, because the people there were too busy to teach me anything, so at this point I would have interned at 6 labs so far and nothing fucking sticked, so I decided to leave Dental Tech altogether.

At this point I was 22 and bought into the whole ""just learn to code bro"", so I decided to pursue that. I told my mom I was going to try to pursue coding, she told me only if I enrolled into Uni again (Uni was paid for by the government since I had good grades in highschool).

So I went to Uni for IT and my first day there I met the biggest shithead 18 year old dude which I became friends with to not be suicidal and lonely for 3 years again, this guy wanted to do alcohol and drugs every single day while his parents drove his ass to Uni and back everyday and paid for everything.

On Monday there is a work event for everyone else so no one will be at the office, and they told me I can either show up or work somewhere else or come in a bit later etc. I also have an event on Monday at 1pm that I was originally going to skip for work, but now that this is the case I'm wondering if I can go and just complete my hours some other time like later in the evening or throughout Tuesday or something.

Would I be allowed to do this and should I even let anyone know if I do it? Or would it seem unprofessional to ask? Or should I just suck it up and skip the event?"

Hello,

As I approach the completion of my PhD in computer science, I am looking for some advice on preparing for my future career.

About me:  
\- I have a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computer science from a German university.  
\- I will complete my PhD in approximately one year, at the age of 27.  
\- I currently live in Munich and have German citizenship. I'd prefer to stay here but am open to relocation, both within and outside of Germany.  
\- My PhD research focuses on compiler optimization and formal methods, although the actual topic is probably not that interesting for companies.  
\- I did a 5-month internship at a national lab in the US, working on compiler optimizations using LLVM.  
\- I have three years of experience as a student/research assistant at a University prior to my PhD.  

My interests include compilers, high-performance computing (HPC), static analysis, formal methods, and related topics. I am not interested in continuing in academia. I'd like to work in companies such as FAANG, Nvidia, Intel, ARM, AMD, Oracle, JetBrains, and SonarSource. I am also considering research organizations like Fraunhofer and Max Planck Institutes.

From my personal experience of applying for internships at FAANG-like companies, it was difficult to even get an interview at such companies. Given the recent layoffs, I am not sure how likely it would be to get an offer from such companies. I have published several papers, some in prestigious conferences, but I am also not sure about the competitiveness of post-doc positions at Fraunhofer and Max Planck Institutes. 

I basically have 3 questions that I'd like to get some advice on:  
1. Is there anything I can do in a year to increase my chances of being invited for interviews? E.g. things that I could do and put on my resume?  
2. Based on my background and interests, which companies in Germany or Europe might be a good fit? They don't have to be big or pay extremely well.  
3. What steps can I take to further develop my skills? Although I have gained considerable programming experience as a PhD student and intern, I believe working on large codebases with bigger teams is different. I was thinking of contributing to open-source projects like LLVM.  

Any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Hi guys. Ideally, I want to be a Game Programmer(On the coding side). I have published 2 games on Playstore and I enjoy working in this field but spending a few years in a different software industry is not a problem for me either. I can deal with hobby projects in my personal time. But I couldn't find exactly what I need to study, Uni(Bachelor) or Ausbildung and which Uni field or Ausbildung field.

I've heard that almost all undergraduate fields are in German and in English fields it's so difficult to get accepted. I believe that too and I think it's good to study in German.

&amp;#x200B;

**I found these relevant university fields:**

Computer Science

Informatik

**and I found these relevant ausbildung fields:**

Anwendungsentwicklung

Assistent für Informatik (less software related, I don't like IT very much)

Fachinformatiker (less software related)

Softwaretechnik (less software related)

Note: I know the conditions for studying in Germany and I meet them

More about me: I am 21, I know B2 English and B1 German(Of course I'm working on it), I graduated from Computer Programming for 2 years and I have an associate degree(Vorlizenzzeugnis). I did an internship at a company that distributes and supports SAP products for 3 months. After graduation, I started a job related to application development for 4 months then I resigned to focus on german to move Germany."

What do you guys suggest would be the way to go getting that first job as each place has its own hidden recruitment methods? I did a 4 month internship before starting my masters. 
From other people's experiences, it appears like responding to ads on LinkedIn and Seek is shooting in the dark with that 0.01 probability.

Note: I am not an AO, nor have I ever been a player in admissions. I've just done tons of research and base this on that + observations alone.

Everyone seems to think that having the best stats ever will get you into T20s, but I actually believe the opposite. In the past, admissions worked in a ""who is the best"" sort of way. But now, we have too many ""above and beyond"" students. So, why does this matter? Well, because more than being a game anymore where you could work your way through the system, now it's become what people say ""a lottery."" But here, I disparage this ideology again. Rather than a lottery, I think what it seems to be is a placeholder selection. Like a ""who fits what we are in need of?"" For example, I saw 10 posts from A2C users who all had OUTSTANDING ECs like writing best-selling novels, 3x world-champions in math/science olympiads, an internship with the president, etc. But none got into ivies. Who did? 3 users with 3.9-3.96/4.4-4.7 UW/W GPAs, test-optional, worked part-time jobs, strong leadership roles, lots of volunteering, and passion. One was a URM. One was a tuba player. One was a ball of fire with very strong (but not ""world-class"") extracurriculars who made you want to listen to them: future president voice. Now you may be asking, **why them?** It's exactly for that reason. Why them! When reading a portfolio of these world-class applicants, you know exactly why they ""deserve"" to get into ivies based on stats. Because they're ""the best."" But then, let me ask *you*. Why do these people need an education at a top school? They're so good at what they do that they could go anywhere and do amazing things. So what will the education at an ivy actually give them that, let's say, Emory wouldn't?

What I'm getting at here is that nowadays, top colleges want people who will take advantage of what they have to offer, as well as future prospects into what they can offer them. For example, Harvard needs a tuba player because one just graduated: oh look at this! An applicant with nice ECs and stats is a really good tuba player and loves archeology. Perfect. They fill up the tuba spot AND they'll help to fill up our archeology class spots. 

Oh, what's that? We're lacking in diversity which is not a good look on us and constricts the ability to have multiple perspectives on campus? Well, would you look at that! A URM with nice ECs and stats, oh and they're first-gen, low-income, AND they want to be a cancer researcher? Perfect! We can get them to be an amazing biologist while they help balance out our diversity on campus. 

And lastly, we really just need someone who can serve as a representative alum in the future and will use our courses to really benefit the world. Oh, looky here, a person with really nice stats like 200+ volunteering hours and president/leader of all these things with tangible impact added on! Hmm... we have a few of those though... OH! but they have a really interesting life story about how they had to work a 40hr a week job to provide for their family because their single mom suffers from a debilitating injury.  And because of this backstory, they want to become a politician so that other kids don't have to go through the same hardship! Awesome. Let's give them the help they need, and we can get another successful politician added to our alumni. 

These are just a few examples, but I hope you see what I'm saying. Now, I'm **not** saying that this is the absolute truth. Once, again, it's just my opinion based on research and observations, and this only really applies to T20s. 

My conclusion is essentially that these top schools want someone who fits what they NEED to keep the business going, but also someone who will truly benefit from all the endowment, education, and opportunities they offer!

Let me know what you all think! :)"

My only issue I am adhd but regurgitating this IT information is painfully dreadful, basic, and boring. 
This test only tests how much bs information you can retain, should be putting us on a command line writing scripts and executing powershell or bash commands instead..
 
Anyways, as I digressed Is there any learning resource that aren't awful to read.
like I know what a keyboard is, i don't need a description of how a trackpad works "" as you swipe your finger across"" 

I can't my adhd flares and send me into mania.. I can never read books because of the writing style, I like concise information and not trying to be funny..

11vudmc,1,2023-03-19,Really conflicted between ML/CS PhD vs. fully funded MSCS,6ottle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11vudmc/really_conflicted_between_mlcs_phd_vs_fully/,"Crossposting from r/AskAcademia \- thought I could get some useful knowledge from a different group of folks.

I'm in a really tough situation and have been feeling acutely ill over making a decision. I would be really grateful for some advice.

I graduated from a prestigious university with a bachelors in CS last spring, and have been working and making a really comfortable salary in a big tech company (return offer on a summer 2021 internship). I had worked with an assistant professor on ML research for the last two years and had a good and productive time; the professor really believed in me, and towards the last semester, suggested that I apply for PhD programs in that area.

I did not believe that I could get into any PhD programs this cycle, as this particular subfield is extremely competitive, and so figured that I would not seriously decide whether or not to do a PhD unless I get in. I only targeted very competitive places and applied to my undergrad's fully-funded, research-focused MS program (most likely I'd be working with the same advisor again) as a backup.

All my results came in, and I have gotten into a number of very good PhD programs, as well as the MSCS backup. Among my PhD offers, one is from a non-top 4 CS school which ranks among the top 3 of my subfield, and the advisor that I got is very, very good. The prospective PhD advisor is extremely well-connected and super nice, and my undergraduate advisor was previously affiliated with their group and could not have anything more positive to say.

Among the academic folks whom I've spoken to, the overwhelming consensus is that I should just go to the state school and work with that professor. And I feel like if I were to pursue a PhD, I would definitely take up the offer. But I've been getting very cold feet about the whole business of doing a PhD; my undergrad experience was very stressful and I just could not imagine 6 more years of lowish pay (that particular school gives the lowest stipend, despite being located in a fairly expensive city). I have zero interest in becoming a professor and would ideally like to be in research-oriented roles in the industry, and that's why I'm seriously considering the MSCS backup. At this point, I'm pretty set on going back to school, given the turbulence and ongoing layoffs in the tech industry.

Here are some direct concerns about going into the PhD:

1. Earning a livable wage and having savings are definitely very important to me and I can't justify walking away from an six-figure annual salary and living for 5-6 years on a $30K-ish PhD stipend. Comparatively, the MSCS stipend is on the higher end (\~$50K) with a good exit opportunity to industry after 2 years.
2. I love parts of the research process, but I won't deny that it was highly stressful and I came out of undergrad feeling extremely burnt out, with horrible work-life balance and a lot of unprocessed emotional issues. My quality of life has greatly improved since getting into a normal 9-5, but I just can't imagine 6 more years of going through that again.
3. Maybe the one slightly negative thing (and it's not a big issue) is that the PhD advisor is pretty hands-off given that they already have tenure and are affiliated with some industry connections. I am definitely not a very skilled researcher and would need a lot of hands-on guidance, especially in the first few years. The group is very nice, with senior students, but for the most part it seems decentralized (some people are remote / WFH), so I worry that I wouldn't be getting enough mentorship.
4. Not a huge factor, but something I'd have to mentally come to terms with: the PhD program itself has incredible prestige within the subarea, but the school's lay prestige is much lower than my undergrad's.

The primary reason for moving forward with the PhD is that this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; this advisor is the dream advisor for many other applicants and I feel that I would not get as good of an offer again were I to decide later on in life to pursue a PhD. I am also feeling extremely pressured by a lot of people in academia to just go do the PhD and not even consider the MSCS (not a good feeling)."

Background/context - I am looking for job, and not able to get an interview calls, not even any accessment. I know that I am qualified for the role. I believe that there is a systematic error in the way i apply. Role - Data Scientist / Data Engineer / Data Analyst Internship roles.

My question is what exactly does ATS Systems prioritize to filter out applicants? Subquestions -

1. When I autofill with resume, I see everything is recognized except for dates. They are currently in ""May YYYY - Jul YYYY"" format, I have tried a lot of other format but they also don't seem to work with workday. My score on resumeworded is 93/100 so I think I should be good here.
2. Workday generally doesn't add my skills automatically. I have to add them manually, which i skip most of the time. Could this be a big mistake ?
3. I don't add cover letter if it is not mandatory. Is that a big problem ?
4. When asked expected salary , I write 4000 per month , or 24$ an hour ?
5. When asked my graduation I put 2023 ( if month is not asked Actual - Dec, 2023), could this be a deal-breaker for internship programs ?

I have applied to 250+ positions till now and not received a single interview call, I think either I am messing on my application or my resume is not really well aligned for the position."

I definitely don't want to pigeonhole myself into a full time sdet/qa role after graduation since it seems difficult to transition to swe from that.

That said, will taking this testing role this summer hurt for new grad recruiting this fall (swe only) compared to returning to previous company and getting cooler work, or might the upside of the company name outweigh that?"

I (25F) would like to live abroad, maybe not forever but at least for a few years. However I need to decide on a place to go and I was hoping you guys could help me. The only thing I'm sure about is that I want to live in East or Southeast Asia, I just can't choose where.

Some context : I'm French and I have a Master's degree in ""Languages applied to business"" (LEA in French) which included courses about translation, interpretation, law and economics amongst others. During my Bachelor, I had the opportunity to study in China for 4 months. In 2019, I also travelled to South-Korea for a month.
I speak French and English (I don't have a native level but I would say C1?) Also Chinese was my third language during my studies and I can speak at an intermediate level. I also had Japanese as a fourth language during my Bachelor only, so I don't remember everything but I can understand basic sentences and speak a little.

During my last year of Master, I did an internship at a global car manufacturer company (PSA Peugot Citroën) as a translator and English coach. Then, I got into administration as a training coordinator. I manage three training courses as a whole, from interviewing future students to paying the teachers and managing schedules. The downside is that I don't use languages at all. It's not a job that I want to keep doing, so I don't feel too bad about leaving it.
Ideally I'd like to go back to translation, but I don't mind doing something else if it allows me to live abroad.

I have wanted to live abroad for a long time, but Covid prevented me to do so as I graduated in 2020.
My current contract ends in August and I've told my boss I won't be renewing. I'm looking to leave either with a work permit or a Work-holiday visa.

One of my best friends wants to go to South-Korea for at least a year, and it's also a country that I love. However I don't know what would be the opportunities for me since I don't speak Korean (and I know competition is fierce there). I also wonder if NK can be a threat in the near future.
I don't speak Korean but I can read Hangeul and know basic words and sentences, although that obviously won't be enough to land a job.
I really like the culture though and I'd have at least a friend there, which would be less lonely.

I thought about China but now it's very different from when I was there in 2017. It gives dystopian vibes and I don't like it, their government it awful.

Japan sounds very nice, I know some downsides of living there as I'm very interested in the culture, but it seems like a beautiful place and relatively cheap compared to other East Asian places (I'm looking at you, Singapore). It also helps that I know a bit of the language.

Taiwan seems awesome but I'm too scared of the political climate with China right now...

I'm also thinking about other places like Vietnam or Malaysia. Don't know about the culture at all so I'd love to hear from expats living there and their experience. Also is it safe for women?

Mostly what I'm looking for is a safe place (especially in the current geopolitical climate) with no sky-high prices (I live in Paris so my definition of ""cheap"" is rather extensive though). If there are good opportunities for someone with my profile it would be great, but I know it won't be easy in most places.

Thank you so much if you read everything!"

However, I feel that this will signal to employers that maybe I'm less skilled b/c I'm Not writing the solution in more complicated lang (C++, etc.). **From experience, how true is this?**

Like I know some companies have leetcode easy's (and mediums) as part of coding assessments and some easy in pythons is like 2-3 lines and I think this looks bad?

11w324p,6,2023-03-19,"Laid off, dad died, student loans closing in",Satans-Left-TesticIe,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11w324p/laid_off_dad_died_student_loans_closing_in/,"Got laid off right before Christmas from being a Jr Software Engineer, after only 5 months of work. I got the job right out of college due to a huge stroke of luck with the help of my (now former) best friend who still works there. Shortly after in January my dad passed away from esophageal cancer, that’s when I began drinking heavy and started smoking cigs again after having quit 3 years ago. When cigs got too expensive I began smoking the cigars that come in 99¢ packs at the gas station. They’re rough on inhale.

Now I’ve been unemployed for almost 4 months, there’s almost no Jr Software Engineer jobs on the market because of mass tech layoffs, and now I don’t have enough work experience to get any other jobs in my field. Had 11 SE interviews since January, almost every one ends with the hiring person saying “we’re looking for people with **more experience**”. Furthermore I’ve been laughed out of interviews for smaller jobs like data entry and even a barista, because I have a 4 year degree in tech with 3 internships relevant to my degree. Nobody wants to touch someone who’s gonna dip at the next best opportunity.

Get this, internships apparently don’t count as job experience anymore. Go figure. After doing almost 2 years of paid SE internships before graduation, it ultimately meant *nothing*

I’ve got monthly student loan payments summing to $1500 a month. I only have $3500 left, so I have 2 months before shit really hits the fan. My mom refuses to tell me how much the life insurance policy she took out on me will cover — go figure, even *less* peace of mind. My stepfather is a white collar corporate narcissist who’s wholly convinced I was fired for being lazy, when in reality I was already working myself 10 hours a day into an awful anxious depression. Both of them send me job listings weekly — none that I even qualify for, but they use that as a means to further demean me.

I’ve been living with my girlfriend for free who’s been somewhat supportive of everything except for my lower sex drive (can you wonder why?). I’ve recently found out that she takes opportunities when I pass out after drinking to molest me, to “help” her sexual frustration. She does this knowing that I was raped multiple times as a kid by the neighbor boy my mom had babysit me after school. I’m no longer attracted to her at all now because of this but I have nowhere else to live, rent in Philly is insane and the weather has been too cold/windy/rainy to sleep on the streets. There’s no shelters for guys like me, so if I want a roof over my head that’s not a jail cell I have to put up with being sexually assaulted, i guess

I just want out. I won’t be able to endure this much longer. I have an interview this week for a Jr Engineering position at a big health insurance company that doesn’t require experience beyond a bachelors degree. It’s obviously gonna be super competitive and smarter people in better situations than me will surely apply and most likely get it. If I don’t get the job, I’ll most likely end things by the end of April.

I turn 25 on July 1st and I don’t think I want to live to see that day. If I do, I’ll most certainly be broker, drunker, fatter, and sadder than I already have gotten. As it stands, I have not much left to look forward to other than more pain and more misery."

UMD has great CS and impressive published research by the professors as seen on: https://csrankings.org/
Researching outcomes, salaries in CS seems to be higher for RPI at $92K (UMD $76K, Case $69K). Can’t help but wonder if RPI is ultimately a better ROI for education despite all the impressive research coming out of UMD. Definitely taking many other things into effect - travel costs and methods to home, rural vs city, safety, class size, research and internship opportunities. Appreciate any info in helping him make the best choice for him."

11w6dch,22,2023-03-19,"About that Illini Career Fair coming up... Wednesday, March 29, 11am - 3pm",LASCareerServices,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/11w6dch/about_that_illini_career_fair_coming_up_wednesday/,"[The Illini Career and Internship Fair](https://app.joinhandshake.com/edu/career_fairs/38361) takes places in the Illini Union on Wed., March 29, 11am - 3pm.

A few things to know about career fairs:

* Spring career fairs are known in the career services/recruitment world as **""just in time"" fairs:** just in time for recruiters to hit their annual hiring goals, just in time for graduating seniors to land a job or other students to secure a summer internship. 
* Career fairs represent **a distinct subset of the job market**. For a lot of employers, career fairs just aren't an efficient way to hire, so they don't attend them. If you don't see your preferred field represented there, it just means you'll need to look elsewhere to find out who's hiring. 
* If you are hoping to walk away with an interview, then **don't just ""go to the career fair."" Go to talk to a few specific employers that you have identified in advance by looking at the info available on Handshake.** The success you find at a career fair is going to be proportional to the amount of time you spend researching the employers who will be there and preparing to have a productive conversation with the ones who interest you most. 
* Career fairs can be an excellent **low-stakes way to practice talking to employers:** asking good questions, talking up your skills, having a professional conversation. The more you do these things, the easier it gets, and the beauty of a career fair is that if you fumble your words or come off sounding like an idiot, you can just walk away and try again at another table. 
* Students are often surprised at just **how friendly and personable recruiters can be**. There are exceptions of course, and employers with highly specialized needs may not have patience for small talk with people who don't fit them, but for the most part, the people who represent their companies at these events tend to be ""people persons.""

There are a lot of resources on campus to help you have a positive career fair experience, including [advice from LAS Career Services](https://lascareerservices.web.illinois.edu/career-fairs-3/) and from [The Career Center](https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/instructable/career-fair-preparation).

Unsure which to choose,nanonomo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11w6lrt/i_have_a_choice_between_a_job_on_security_vs/,"To give some background I have been working for a semiconductor company as a validation engineer for almost a year now. A year before that, I graduated college and have had about a years experience as a software engineering intern, so I don’t exactly have the most amount of experience. 

Recently there has been a cancellation of our teams next project, and management suggested that if we would like to move domains that now would be the time to do it. I expressed interest in a security validation engineering role and an automation engineering one. What ended up happening is that I got both offered to me. 

Now that leaves me to my dilemma, I’m not sure which of these to choose. Security validation would be more similar to what I do now, but automation would involve more programming which is something I’ve kind of missed. Im just trying to figure out which one would be better for the future. 

Any advise?"

Mostly applying to Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto area. I have no internship experience which is a big regret of mine. I got an OA and one interview after about 30 applications which I bombed because I was sick at the time. I'm at about 70 ish applications now and trying to get that number up.

Here is my resume: [https://imgur.com/a/6X9JDQH](https://imgur.com/a/6X9JDQH)

Extra information: I'm currently trying to expand on the the first project to include more relevant tools. I was considering deploying it to AWS because I see a lot of places looking for that. Any tips would be of any help. I just want my resume to reach its full potential before shooting out more applications. I also attended 2 Career Fairs where I was told to expect an interview so I'm hoping that leads to something.

Open to any suggestions! Thank you for reading."

\-I am currently a junior and am missing some info such as specific SAT/ACT stuff

\-I am not sure how lenient the awards section is, so I will just put down whatever I think could go there (pretty sure it is my worst category though.)

\-I struggled with depression induced by COVID my freshman year, which skewed my GPA poorly, so I will give both my GPA with and without freshman year.

\- My school only offers 9 APs and no computer science classes and requires AP Calculus AB as a prerequisite to AP Calculus BC

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Demographics: White Male in Eastern Colorado at a small charter school (bit less than 100 in my class) with very competitive english and arts programs (as a STEM kid the difficult English tortures me). Family Income is about 130k.

&amp;#x200B;

Intended Major(s): Aerospace Engineering / Mechanical Engineering with Emphases in Aero/Astro (considering also majoring in Computer Science or Mathematics)

&amp;#x200B;

ACT / SAT (or least least as much as I can give): 1430 on the PSAT 11, prospective 1500 on SAT. Planning on taking ACT but not sure if I can still sign up for it.

&amp;#x200B;

UW + W GPA: With Freshman Year: 3.65 UW / 4.05 W | Without Freshman Year: 3.80 UW / 4.25 W

&amp;#x200B;

APs:-Sophomore Year: AP Statistics (4), AP European History (5)

\-Junior Year: AP Physics C Mechanics, AP Physics 2, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP United States History

\-Senior Year (Signed up for currently): AP Government and Politics, AP Literature, AP Chemistry, AP Calculus BC

&amp;#x200B;

Awards / Certifications / Achievements:

\- Certification in SOLIDWORKS CAD from Colorado School of Mines

\- 1st place in Marching Band for 2021 and 2022

\- State Mathematics Competition at UNC in 8th, 10th, and 11th grade

\- Various Awards for National Latin Exam in 8th, 9th, 10th grade (soon to get some for 11th)

&amp;#x200B;

Extracurriculars:- FRC Leadership 10th and 11th grade (very likely 12th grade as well)

\- Marching Band Leadership 11th grade

\- Currently getting a Quiz/Knowledge Bowl and STEM Olympiad club started, which I will be president of

\- NHS

\- Jazz Band since 8th grade (I play drumset and vibraphone)

\- Wind Ensemble since 10th grade (first year I was able to do so)

&amp;#x200B;

Work / Volunteering Experience:

\- Full-Time Work Experience at a School Supplies Warehouse over summer of 2021 and 2022 (45 hours a week)

\- Software Engineering Intern at Lockheed Martin for summer 2023 (planned 30 hours a week but I will probably see if I can get more

\- Currently have various volunteering hours adding to a total of 100 hours

\- Currently volunteering at a Space Museum, will get about 500 hours from them within the next year

&amp;#x200B;

Potential LORs: have 3 people I will ask, being my AP Physics C teacher, my AP Physics 2 teacher, and my principal since I have helped him and the college/career counselors with integrating things they want into the school.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I finish up, I would like some advice on what I could do to build up my awards and extracurriculars up as I feel like those are a bit weak for competition.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to anyone willing to help!"

I’m switching into CS pretty late, as a junior in uni and will begin taking cs coursework.  I currently have very little knowledge and am not sure where to start in terms of projects and finding experience.  

Basically, do you guys have any advice from when you first started out in CS?  I’m worried that since I’m starting out so late I won’t be able to find any internships or relevant experience since my resume is practically empty.  And of course, no internships will make the job search post grad a lot lot harder from what I’ve heard.

Also, the coursework at my uni is taught almost entirely in C and C++, so should I focus on those languages or should I spend time to learn a different language like Python or Java and do projects in those easier languages instead? 

Thanks."

6. Leadership in coding club (not president)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: likely very generically positive, I knew her decently and had many talks with her but there was no real personal connection. She did give me a perfect score when she rated my course rigor, however.

History Teacher: Really liked the guy, but again, likely generically positive. No real connection, and I only have him during my junior year.

C++ Professor: It was a self-studied class over the summer. I was the first to finish his class so he offered to write me a letter. I accepted, but the trend continues. No real personal connection.

**Interviews**

UPenn Interview: Went really well. Very nice older lady, she helped me get more enthusiasm for my ED school before promptly getting rejected.

Stanford Interview: Almost perfect interview. I managed to elaborate on my first EC greatly while also showing a high level of intellectual curiosity. Very comfortable interview.

**Essays**

UC Essays: These were decent but not my best work. Displayed some of my passions as well as my service hours/leadership.

UPenn Essays: Pretty bad. I'll leave it at that.

USC Essays: Slightly better than UPenn but still not great.

Stanford, Duke, Brown, Rice: My best works, simply as I had the most experience writing at this point. Stanford in particular was very good imo, I was able to express my intellectual curiosity. The important part of these essays is I was able to write (imo) strong Why Us essays.

**Additional Information:**

Note: I am an early grad

I know that many people might be concerned about my lack of safeties. However, part of the idea for me graduating early was that if I didn't get into any schools I liked, I would simply take senior year like normal. When/if I apply again, I will apply to actual safeties.

When looking forward, I feel skeptical about my further decisions. Given my results so far, I am almost 100% certain that nearly all my awaiting schools will just straight up reject me. UCSB is my last hope but at this point, I am really uncertain about whether I want to attend or not."

It seemed like a great opportunity, so I applied for it.

But, then I got a message from the recruiter to pay some money for the internship. And also, I couldn't find anything about this Cybersecurity Council of India. 

I have heard of the Data Security Council of India, but not this.

Is this a scam?

If no, then is the internship good?"

I have a couple of options but a bit tricky due to my situation as a non-EU/non-UK citizen!

My background:
- Bachelors in Software Engineering and Master's in Natural Language Processing. A year of experience in web development and two years part time working as a data engineer along with my masters. Some research experience here and there as well

- I have an internship with Barclays in the summer in their glasgow office and would want to continue after that as UK gives me the easiest possibility of settling and citizenship. 

- I have a job offer from a company in Netherlands. The thing is they want to start the process of sponsorship from June but I don't want them to go through the whole process, for me to just say no to them if I get something in UK. Also, NL is not the top option due to no option of dual citizenship. The pay is also the least the could offer for a visa sponsorship. I have to give them an answer by may end. 


- I am waiting for an offer from deloitte but it seems the work life balance along with their pay is certainly not worth it, from what I have heard.



My decision is to go for the barclays one and simultaneously keep looking for jobs both in UK and EU, and hope for the best. I just don't want to end up without a job by September and end up applying for a job search visa somewhere!


Does any of you have any advice regarding the situation? Here's my resume if that helps: https://imgur.com/a/GpjU7Rf. Thank you!"
11wf1qt,3,2023-03-20,Could I drop out of school with a job offer?,settlingbelowdegrees,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11wf1qt/could_i_drop_out_of_school_with_a_job_offer/,"Hello, I’m currently a college senior who is supposed to graduate in May, however due to failing classes last semester and this semester I am no longer eligible to graduate on time. I can’t graduate within the summer either. I could possibly go to school again in the fall this year but I don’t know if I can get FAFSA anymore since i didn’t apply for it again. I’m also really poor right now barely able to afford meals with $5k in CC debt and no income, only savings from past internships. 

However, I have a job offer I accepted which is one I got from doing an internship last year. The offer is $160k/ year and after talking to current employees who were former interns, they said the company didn’t check that they graduated college, which makes sense because they didn’t ask to verify my degree when I got the internship. Although they maybe could’ve done it silently. 

Therefore I wanted some advice on what I should do going forward. I could potentially graduate by December if I worked hard and found a way to fund just one more semester of school. But this is unlikely because my parents are poor and I have large amounts of debt. And I could likely lose my upcoming job because it has a start date in August. Or I could basically drop out of school and begin working at the company in August with no degree. Maybe going back to school one day for one semester after saving up or trying to work on my career without any degree. Although this runs risk of my offer being rescinded on the off chance they actually do check my degree, despite employees saying they didn’t. 

I’m not sure and I feel like i’m kind of stuck at a crossroads right now. Obviously none of this would happen if I didn’t blow all my internship money and go into debt and party instead of studying hard in school, but this is who I am right now. 

Given all this, what would you all say about my situation or what I should do?"

11whzlc,7,2023-03-20,Importance of Summer Internship,captainjolt,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11whzlc/importance_of_summer_internship/,"I want to start this of by saying that I am in a somewhat unique situation. My wife is active duty in the US Air Force stationed in Germany and I am finishing my third year of college online at UIS and I'm on track to get my bachelor's in CS next fall. I don't know if it's relevant but I got a transfer associates degree in engineering at my community college and had a REU physics internship last summer at UIUC.
I married my wife and went with her to Germany last year, and we will be here about a year after I graduate. My plan was to either take summer classes to try and graduate early or get a summer job on base, and I wasn't planning on pursuing an internship this summer but I'm starting to question that decision. I keep seeing posts about the importance of internships and I started wondering if I should be applying for them. And then I started getting contacted by recruiters through my school with internship opportunities. The only issue is that none of the internships are remote and I didn't want to leave my wife here alone this summer as she was here alone last summer because of my physics internship as well as waiting for the paperwork to go through for me to be able to move out here and it was really hard for her. I guess what I'm asking is how important are internships? I don't want to leave my wife here alone for another summer, but I also want to be able to find a good job before her contract is up because she doesn't want to extend her contract.

Thanks in advance for any advice."

I’m in my early 20s, joined an MBA program after a couple years in IT &amp; Education. Did a finance internship as well. 

I’m nearing graduation this year and can’t help but see that the school I went to, has a certain path set for MBA grads. And I’m not a huge fan. It’s not what I want. 

Is it true, that some MBA schools are for certain students? Meaning, if you want to ultimately work in DC you would complete your MBA at UPenn? Versus if you are in your mid 30s and looking to get promoted at your T Mobile job from associate to manager, you would go to University of Phoenix?

Even though I only gave suggestions now I am also caught. 
I thought the reviewer knew everything and they asked to tell the whole truth and I foolishly accepted that I have helped my friend a little bit. 

So I got an email regarding the same that I have helped the person in assessment and also didn't pass the assessment. Now tomorrow there will be a meeting with the manager.

They took consent from us that any indiscipline action from us and they can do whatever they want.

I am scared.

I'm stuck between two options for my final year project and I'm not sure which one to choose.

Option 1 is a recommendation system/model that will be used for a competition on the Kaggle website. It involves using data science techniques, which I have zero knowledge about. This option would definitely challenge me and I'd be learning something new and interesting.

Option 2 is to create an app for movie censorship, specifically for parents. I have some knowledge about this topic and I think I can make it work. The road ahead seems pretty clear to me.

The thing is, I'm also planning to land a short internship for three months during this busy year. So, I'm not sure which project would be better for me in terms of time management and workload.

Should I go for the challenging and interesting option 1, or stick with the more familiar option 2? I appreciate any input you may have!"

i am hearing a lot of horror stories of even domestic students applying to 300-400 internships and not getting any, offers and international students who applied to like 600 internships who did not even get a single interview. however, in a recent post from this sub, one international student who got internship commented that he/she/they was/were possible to get inernship due to its name value in the industry. i understand that UIUC has been t5 for its CS program for a pretty long time and has a really good reputation in the field, but considering how tough it is to get internships rn especially for international, is it true that it's much easier to get into an internship just because you attend UIUC? i mean you probably still need to work really hard and i'm not trying to downgrade anyone who probably worked really hard to get those offers, but i feel like UIUC is definitely a better choice than NEU if UIUC name value gives similar or even more benefit than NEU's co-op opportunity. 

sorry if this is kinda stupid question... this is pretty much the only place pretty much where i can ask these questions."
11wm5ul,3,2023-03-20,What to do when you've already tried a major and other basic skills but still don't know if a career is right?,ThrowThinkAway,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11wm5ul/what_to_do_when_youve_already_tried_a_major_and/,"I graduated with a summa cum laude in college for Business MIS, but tbh it means shit since I did so without an internship, and the internship and experience and network is the critical key to landing an entry level job in those fields, not the shitty piece of paper. I haven't been able to land a full time job for 2 years now... And I feel furious and humiliated that I've been reduced to this state and misled by the false promises of college. Also I have mental illnesses going for me, am in therapy and getting medicated for ADHD but it's not helping much. 

To be frank the major doesn't even teach much, it's too broad to be useful unless you choose to specialize yourself. I made a mistake under duress and misguided by what others thought would be best for me and chose this major. Except I actually despise corporate and late stage capitalism, and being neurodivergent, business would be an uphill battle. Also I have mental illnesses going for me, am in therapy and getting medicated for ADHD but it's not helping much. 

I have to sacrifice something, but what and how? And for what even? I've already made losses, and I shouldn't fall for the sunken cost fallacy. And ofc the only real answer is try, fail, try again... Except I did try and I only ever failed, and I don't have the talent or mental fortitude to endure until ""it all works out"". 

Ideally I should try to skill up myself by self teaching or certs or courses in something in order tk break into IT, tech, or something else lucrative. But again, with only some sparse knowledge in some softwares and programming, I can't do much. And I've forgotten most of it, and I remember how much I disliked the frustration of not knowing what to do with code. 

So I've given it a try, and I didn't like it. Also tried Intro to CS with Java and I just found it frustrating, not interesting. At best I was only driven (hyper fixated) when I had a specific goal related to a fleeting interest at the time, but that's not something I can willfully harness, and there's simply too much outside of my skill level. I'm a slow learner and with tech constantly evolving, I hardly even know what the hell all these terms like stacks or git or stuff mean. 

Meanwhile I do like various hobbies, but they are all consumption oriented, and the creation and skill based ones I've tried like streaming have been pretty fruitless for me. I use and consume technology, but I'm not someone who actively learns it for fun outside of work, and I don't know if I can force myself to become a person who does. And it's not like content creation or art will ever pay off, society doesn't value that. And I live in the Bay Area, USA, so it's absurdly expensive here. 

So what the heck am I supposed to do? Do I keep lying to myself and trying to break into tech even when I lack the smarts, talent, structure, money and motivation? Do I try to ""give it my all"" even when I'm already regretting it and there are signs I'm simply following something not inherently meant for me? Do I try to pursue something else even when I am basically a blank slate and it guarantees a shaky financial future? Or am I supposed to do something that just feels bad and tough rn because I'm mentally ill and unable to properly discern what is enjoyable and fulfilling?"

Hi, I am interested in pursuing a research-oriented career which preferably requires a master's and then a PhD abroad, hopefully from the US but I am not too picky. I am a CS student in a tier 1 engineering college. I have a stellar academic record **before** my undergrad. However, I stumbled a bit in my first two semesters. Now I have gotten somewhat back on track, but the screws from the first two semesters haunt me. I have managed to push my GPA beyond 8, but it is barely there. 

As we know, in India the grading practices are really harsh, with average grades going as low as 6. Now I agree my screwing up was my fault, but even then pulling it back up is so goddamn hard, especially when you are graded on a curve in a system which wants to give you the lowest grade possible. I just don't find it fair to compare grades across universities where practices vary so widely, for example, the best ones here have high competition + the worst grades. How do I deal with this issue, and perhaps explain it to the application reviewers? I have a good amount of research experience and I am on the way to hopefully getting a paper published in a reputed journal. I also have a good deal of programming experience from work at the university as well as my internships in well-reputed companies, but I fear my grades are getting in my way (they already have), and it is driving me crazy. If anyone with a bad grade has overcome this please let me know. Thanks!"

I am an international student and I am interested in applying to universities in the US.

I am currently a student in the top 3 ranked UK high school and my academic profile includes A\*A\*A\*A\* in Math, Further Maths, CS, and Physics for GCE A-Levels (British Curriculum), and I have IGCSE grades of 999999777 (9 Max 1 is the lowest) and an IELTS score of 7.5.

I am curious about what my chances are of getting into a US university with these credentials. I know that admission to top US universities is highly competitive, especially for international students. I am interested in studying Computer Science or a related field.

For the UK I applied:

Cambridge (Rejection after the interview, the admission test result was top 2%) / Imperial (Rejection) / UCL (Waiting)/ KCL(Waiting) / Edinburgh(Waiting)

For the US:

UPenn, Cornell, NYU, Northwestern, BU, Wisconsin, WashU, UVA, VT, ASU, OSU

I got an offer from VT, ASU, and OSU and a rejection from UVA....

No Financial Aid

Some of my EC includes: Head Boy in current high school, Internship at HSBC Digital Department, National Cipher challenge 5th etc. 

Can you tell me what my chances are of getting into a US university with these credentials since I am not very an expert in US unis?

11wpvb4,1,2023-03-20,Exhausting friendship,nicole_kidnap,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/11wpvb4/exhausting_friendship/,"Hello all, I'm here because I have had an argument, (or, I was on the edge to) with one of my best friends and I'm considering taking a break. 
I'm still clearing up my mind as I write so please bear with me. Long read ahead so buckle up. 

A bit of context: we have been living in the same city for years and same social circle but we actually started going out together like 3-4 months before me leaving for good. From there, we met a lot around on trips or visiting each other, and a lot of talking online since we're both internet people. 

She's a very interesting person, she has a lot of interests and is very funny in a random/nonsense way so I really like her. She is maybe the first new friend I made in adulthood (we're both btw 30/34). We used to go to a lot of parties together and such. 

She has problems with self esteem and depression, and I suspect with a good sprinkle of hypo/cybercondria. I think she's trying to make sense of her feelings, and everything new that can help her explain how she feels, she has it. I'm not trying to invalidate her and I told her about this many times and I think she agrees with me sometimes. 

Last time I saw her she wasn't in a good place mentally (i mean from the outside she was actually doing an internship in a cool company, new town, getting to know all kinds of cool people in her field etc but you know how companies work, she wasn't renewed and probably a new cheaper intern was hired in her place. She was also caught on talking shit about her boss in the group chat so that too lol). 
The time spent together was weird this time. She invited me over because she felt lonely but she would do stuff like rolling her own joints and not passing them and going out with me like 2-3 times in a week, also rather going out with her work friends or staying home instead of being with me. I tried to keep my cool because that's what I do but I felt very bad and explored the city by myself. 

She's now getting in a new relationship (her previous one was with a vanilla guy, nothing wrong with it but se was just very eager for experience and the guy was much more calm so she almost went mental for how startled and exasperated she was).
The new guy is a renowed ladies guy but it really seems like he's putting the effort in (like, going back to her 3 times after she rejected him and then asking him to go back), other than a lot of bad communication from both parts but that's normal for a new relationship... Right? 

This is where it comes to us. Conversations with her have been exhausting lately, it's just her texting walls or like 20 vocals trying to explain to me how she feels and the things the guy says and what she things they mean, and dwelling and spiraling until things make no sense anymore and lose touch. Also she has a blind trust in her therapist and whatever she says. 

 Today she posted a meme on the notes of ""mentally unstable people are hot"" and i jokingly said ""I can't wait for the day when you'll stop romanticizing mental illness"". 
She then went on a rant about how she's neurodivergent now and i really tried to talk about something else and be lighthearted about it and then she went on to explain more also using the words ""crazy"" which I'll never dare to say, and I don't think neurodivergent has anything to do with mental illnesses but maybe it's just what memes are for idk. I immediately felt drained from the 20+ audios and quit whatever I was doing.

I told her I'm tired of her coming at me every time like a bull and I understand her feeling bad but she doesn't have to explain to me and maybe think twice before self diagnosing things. 

I told her many times that if she wants to pull herself up from things she needs to loosen her grip on stuff and her problems and that's how they're becoming less and less important and easier to face, and she doesn't need to convince me of anything. I've also been there through tick and thin, we have spent hours and days talking to the point i put my work away to catch up with her. I know how important it is for her not to feel rejected but I also need her to chill and have a laugh on stuff sometimes because otherwise it's just us talking about the same problems over and over and everytime is always from the start, not a step forward is taken. 

I feel sorry because now this is making me feel like it could be me lacking empathy?

After all I decided to move away from everything that used to hurt me and now I live a much more balanced, silent life. I'm in a healthy relationship because I wanted one with this person and was willing not  to *be* my trauma and let it define who I am. I was willing to reprogram some toxic shit I'd do for the love of my SO, it's a long way but it can be done out of will.
That's the advice she's been asking for and I always give to her. Stop dwelling on your damn drama

It hasn't been easy for me either, I had to start it all over again at 30yo and I went through a lot of darkness and silence. Now I'm seen like this kind of health guru that has everything sorted and it's honestly crap. I just realized what worked for me and put it to work but it took a lot of renouncing and I don't know anyone that would do the same honestly. I'm not an emotional dump. 

This is also the same person who told me ""i think you'd be a good mum"" while I was pregnant and contemplating abortion so yeah I don't know if it's really me but I really think I need a break from this.

You can either agree with me show me another point of view or roast me. You do you

I graduated from rutgers May 2022 with a bachelors in IT. I had a job as a software developer in training with a company that wanted to fake my resume so I left for integrity reasons. I’ve been looking for employment for months , got a couple rejections but just got an offer to intern as a support specialist for a good company with good people. I definitely want to accept, just wanted to know if you guys think this is a good way to get some experience and break into the real world tech field"

Doresc asta pentru a ma sustine financiar pt a putea ramane in Bucuresti pe perioada vacantei dar si pt a incepe sa capat experienta . Acestea fiind zise, nu am pretentii prea mari referitoare la salariu sau program (poate fi atat full cat si part-time ).  
Cat tine de cunostinte, stiu c++, c si putin sql lucrand in oracle in liceu . Nu am cunostinte tocmai extraordinare iar planul este sa le cultivez prin intermediul unor cursuri online. Sunt foarte dispusa sa invat orice atata timp cat stiu ca se cauta. Doresc in acest sens sa stiu:

1. Ce limbaje/skill-uri as putea sa invat ca sa stiu ca sunt cautate inclusiv la nivel de incepator/internship ? 
2. Care ar fi un job realist si dupa ce/unde sa ma orientez? 

Va rog sa scuzati nestiinta de cauza si faptul ca sunt poate putin naiva cu vedere la asteptari dar orice indrumare ajuta ! multumesc !"

Hey! I’m currently a sophomore at a cuny, and I’m not sure what specific fields i’m interested in… I’m just leaning towards data science and general software development. 

I feel like all choices seem fun, so it just comes down to what looks best on paper for future internships, what experiences I could leverage the most when talking about them in interviews/just applying this knowledge in the future

Everything listed is remote, and tbh I don’t really care what my pay is but I’ll put it down anyway. they’re all only until the summer (except for breakthrough tech)

Upperclassmen or just anyone, please lmk what yall think!

**Choice 1:**

* Breakthrough tech ai 
   * (12-15 hrs a week in summer 2023, 5 hrs a week in academic sems until spring 2024)
   * program geared towards female students in tech to get them interested in AI, data science, machine learning. A bunch of training over the summer + networking, then pairs me up with a company (like Verizon and Accenture) to do a project until spring 2024
   * $2000 stipend at the end
* Cuny career launch
   * (19 hours a week)
   * pairs me up with a company (most likely a small one) where I can do either software engineering or data science, and i think it’s pretty flexible since I can switch to other projects if I’m not interested in what I’m currently working on 
   * paid $20 an hr

**Choice 2:**

* data science/front end intern OR backend intern at a B2B SaaS company 
   * (40 hrs a week)
   * their work environment sounds welcoming from what I heard in my interview and i can visit their nyc office whenever I want to
   * will be paired with a team internally and there’s a capstone project for all the interns to do by the end
   * i MAY be wrong, but it just feels like a more “full fledged” swe internship compared to the other ones, which i got from the help of a program i applied to. i could be wrong though
   * paid $25 an hr

**Choice 3:**

* Qubit’s EQCI program 
   * (40 hrs a week)
   * internship program geared towards getting students interested in quantum computing. training for the first few weeks and then you get paired an internship to work with companies like IBM, Google AI, bp
   * maybe not good if I’m not planning to go into the quantum computing field…? but i like the idea of working with IBM and etc. lol
   * $4000-8000 at the end 

All choices seem like they’re great for opening new doors for networking. What I’m unsure about is if the name of the company to be paired with makes a huge difference, and if i should lean towards choices that align with what i’m interested for in the future. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!!"

I do have knowledge about front-end and I've even learned React for a while in the past. Unfortunately I couldn't find a job. 

Earlier this month I was offered an internship in some gamedev company, but they want to me write some game in PhaserJS. I thought I can do it considering they've gave me a link to the tutorial from the official site, but their game is a complete oposite of what was made in the tutorial. I did manage to understand the ""structure"" of Phaser, but honestly I have no clue how to actually do anything in it and if it's (the whole internship) worth it, considering their web page doesn't state anything about there being any projects their work on in Phaser. 

I know I can code, I can think logically and break down problems to smaller steps. The thing I can't figure out is what type of programming is for me. I feel like whenever I program in order to finally start a career or something like that, I lose all the drive after a short while and it just gets frustrating... Maybe I should program stuff for fun, but I can't come up with ideas (not that there's much you can do with front-end).

I had an idea that maybe I could try Python, but I'm not sure what I could do with it. Or maybe learn C# and program video games in Unity, since I already draw pixel art."

I have had this issue for about 2 years now and tried a few things but it never bothered me to much untill i was playing project zomboid and lost my 50 day streak.

so they both pretty much switch off simultaneously for pretty much no reason, sometimes if i nick my tower with my foot or touch a cable it will do it. however when I try to trigger it by violently shaking the tower or the cables, nothing happens. with no way to trigger it I'm really at a loss here. 

Also i should mention that when they come back on all windows get transferred to left monitor so that one must always come on first even if its by a second. 

Also the windows disconnect/ reconnect sound affect plays before they switch back on, implying that the PC detects a disconnect/ reconnect, which intern implies that it cant be a software issue, however something that isn't a software issue without a hardware trigger seams quite unusual to me.

No i haven't tried using different cables as (and i may be wrong) i believe the fact they both switch off at the same time means it cant be a fault with a singular cable, (the cables them self's are a VGA to VGA with a VGA to DVI adapter (yes i know its strange to run VGA with a 1080ti but the only working port on my secondary is unfortunately VGA , and a normal HDMI to HDMI on my primary.

also cant be GPU related because i went from a 1050ti to some Random card that couldn't run Minecraft at 40fps gt1030 to a1040ti back to a gt1030 then to a 1660 and finally to my 1080ti (with two power supplies in-between current one being gold 800watt) and the still issue persists.

Coming up on 2 years of experience in IT Help Desk/Support roles.

Currently WFH full time as a IT Help Desk guy for an MSP, pay isn't too bad ($20s hourly) but I get no vacation time, and we have to rotate weekend coverage.

I currently have about a dozen IT certs ranging from CompTIA to some Azure (AZ-104) - AWS (Solutions Architect Associate) and a JNCIA (Juniper CCNA sort of), AAS in Information Systems, and am about 2 classes away from my BS in Cloud Computing from WGU.

Unfortunately, I couldn't land internships while going for my BS degree. WGU isn't very helpful with internships like brick and mortar schools, and I don't live in a big tech hub. So my experience so far has been support type of roles, but my MSP job lets me access some network stuff for configs and I get to do some Intune MDM stuff at times.

I'm worried that even with my BS degree, I still won't be able to land a network admin or sysadmin job. My passion isn't really troubleshooting printers, but being able to work administering routers, switches, that sort of stuff. I plan to aggressively pursue my CCNA and maybe CCNP after college is done.

I've tossed around the idea of joining the active duty Army to get a network admin MOS or a cybersecurity MOS - so I get training in AIT and get hands on experience hopefully for a few years. Maybe use my benefits to go attend grad school or pay for some cert training. And a clearance hopefully would be pretty good.

I've already passed the ASVAB and a medically qualified to serve.

Thoughts? How is IT in the military, and can joining help me escape support roles?"

Right now I'm considering:

\- Applying aggressively to any and all remaining startup swe (fintech?) internships for summer 2023

\- Finding a programming language/systems research gig (possibly concurrent with internship) for summer 2023

\- I plan to be a course assistant for a functional programming course at my school next fall

\- Grinding Leetcode

\- Any particular concepts I should self-study? Book recommendations?

\- Any relevant side projects I should build?

\- Any particular extracurriculars I should consider pursuing?

I had the mentality of “approaching computer science from the scope of human cognition” as I’m passionate about breaking into artificial intelligence. 

These past few months I’ve come to a shocking realization, nobody wants to hire someone who on paper has a minor in computer science and an unrelated major. I go to a good school and all my friends with the usual majors (comp sci, software eng) have found internships but I’m 0-a bunch.

I would still very much like to complete my degree and I'm currently in week two of my internship. My supervisor gave me the assignment to learn [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core MVC using .NET 6.0, Visual Studio 2022, and SQL Server 2022. I had a hard time following .NET programming subject during my studies (it was during lockdown) and long ass videos from Indian tutors who speak in monotonous tone just doesn't work for me.  


I know C#, SQL, and HTML but I don't think it would be a good practice to just rely heavily on Googling each problem I encounter when I should develop a better understanding of what I'm working on.   


I checked out some books by Adam Free on [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) but I'm not sure how applicable they are considering some of the recent editions came out a few years ago. Then again, I can't identify whether they're relevant or not now because I can't differentiate much between different versions of .NET and Visual Studio.  


Your book suggestions would be much appreciated, thanks."

11x8ed8,1,2023-03-21,Data v. Distributed Systems v. Back-end Engineering Internship,DirtyDan2202,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11x8ed8/data_v_distributed_systems_v_backend_engineering/,"Hello,

I'm a third year uni student and I'll be having my first internship this summer. I have the opportunity to rank which domain I'd like to work on and I'm having trouble deciding which of these I'm most interested in as well as which of them have the greatest prospects for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

For context,  I'm also a data science student and I'd say that, by far, I enjoy data science the most and is likely what I'd like my future career to be centered around at this moment in time. I have experience working with tools like Hadoop, Spark, AWS, SQL,  and have a pretty decent understanding of ML and deep learning topics and frameworks. Unfortunately, there is no Data Science division that I'd be able to work under and right now I'm grappling between these top three choices.

&amp;#x200B;

My inclination is to go towards the data engineering route as the best alternative but there are a few small things holding me back. The biggest of these being SQL. I hate SQL, with a passion. I haven't had the greatest exposure to it but my time using it has been annoying to say the least and, more than anything, unsatisfying. To any data engineers out there, how essential is SQL to your everyday work? Do you find your work satisfying?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of back-end, I don't really have much experience with this kind of work. I did take a course where I had the opportunity to design and implement an API for a Java Chat App using a pub/sub architecture. It was pretty challenging but also very rewarding and fun to do at the same time. I don't really know if this is entirely relevant to back-end production but it's the sort of image I'd have in mind. I'm also currently working on developing the back-end of a social-media-esque mobile application w/ TypeScript for students at my school and I've found the work to be fun and engaging. Overall, I quite enjoy the technical aspects of software development and wish I could explore it more, but don't know if it's worth the opportunity cost of not going with Data Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know much about what distributed systems engineers do, but from what I've briefly read online the domain seems pretty interesting and challenging.  I'm currently taking a course on operating systems and concurrency that I've found quite challenging but rewarding and have taken multiple courses on parallelism and  parallel / multi-core computing and am wondering how relevant these topics are to this field. I've heard that this is a growing field due to the rise of cloud computing, and I like the idea of designing systems that are fault-tolerant and resilient and enjoy thinking about concurrency problems. I'm drawn towards this route because of the opportunity to learn new and challenging topics and also feel as though this field has a lot of opportunity for growth. Is there anyone with experience as a distributed systems engineer that could share their experience with it, as well as what is typically done on the job and the kind of problems you're expected to tackle?

&amp;#x200B;

Like I mentioned earlier, I'm leaning more toward going with Data Engineering as I think it aligns best with topics I'm already familiar with and I also think I'll continue to learn and develop skills that are essential for a Data Science-oriented future. Also, in terms of future marketability, I think a previous Data Engineering position would make me more desirable for future Data Science roles. However, I feel like if I take this route I may be losing out on an opportunity to dip my toes in another field that I might not have the opportunity to learn about in the future (distributed systems) as this will be my first internship and pretty soon after I'll be looking for a full-time job that will likely be related to the work I do this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on this topic would be appreciated be it your personal experience with any of these roles or  experience you've heard from others. Thank you!"

Now I just got a new part time job at a shiny place with actual devops and code reviews and I get to work as a real programmer instead of a powershell script kid who gets random maintenance work fobbed off on them that nobody knows how to do or make report forms.

At the new place I'd be making 60k a year if I were working full time, so it's not a magnificent salary but decent and they have a really solid training plan to get me up to speed instead of basically leaving me to rot and having to teach myself everything like I've been used to. Yeah babyyyy!

I sent out three applications in the past half year, got two interviews both to the last round and got one job out of it. Now that's good stats :)

I have work experience because I started as an intern at this place before I started my CS bachelor's (having 9 months work experience was a requirement for the degree here as it's a trade school. I'm sure I sent out 50 applications before I finally got this first job. Cobol and Crystal Reports.

I hope you're all doing great!

I would appreciate some advice on my career path please.

In 2021 I graduated with a degree in architecture from a decent Russell Group university, getting a 1st class, and graduating with one of the highest grades of the cohort. However, the degree killed my passion for the subject and I no longer want a career in architecture. Whilst on my degree I fell in love with programming, but finished the architecture degree anyway as I was already half way through (and due to considerable pressure from my parents).

After my degree, I went on to another decent Russell Group university where I undertook an intensive one year master's degree in computer science where I learned some Python and SQL. Unfortunately, I contracted long covid incredibly badly whilst on the course which resulted in me not graduating.

Currently, I am at home with my parents and taking The Odin Project's course in full stack development which I am really enjoying, it's a lot of fun. I would love to develop my full stack skills further as I'm finding it to be a fun adventure, but ultimately the area of software development that really makes my orbs fizz is blockchain. It really appeals to me intellectually and ideologically.

Going forward, I'd like to know if anyone has any advice for how I should go about getting back into computing. My current plan is to continue with The Odin Project to build up my portfolio for another six months, and then apply for apprenticeships, internships, graduate schemes and junior positions.

11xmgvg,1,2023-03-21,Applying and Doing IT Internships as an Inexperienced SWE Major,EddieMnemonic,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11xmgvg/applying_and_doing_it_internships_as_an/,"Hello everyone!

I was wondering if it's worth doing IT internships and/or part-time jobs as a Software Engineering major. Though nominally a junior, I'm a sophomore with my major due to switching from a non-STEM degree. I've already taken 3 hard programming classes &amp; 1 soft computer course and have a good GPA (3.9), but I don't think my resume is good enough for any SWE internships this summer (and it's already pretty late to apply). Additionally, I already have interviews for full-time IT Support internships this summer. 

Would doing these internships harm me at all? I know by the time next summer rolls around, I should be able to get a SWE internship. I'll be applying for those opportunities starting this summer and will be taking many more relevant courses that will also give me projects to show on my resume. But in the meantime, am I alright to take IT jobs/internships just for the experience? Let me know if that's advisable."
11xmjcb,443,2023-03-21,It is crazy how much the expectations for entry level IT has changed.,blueberryman422,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11xmjcb/it_is_crazy_how_much_the_expectations_for_entry/,"When looking for jobs, I occasionally check LinkedIn to see the kind of experience that people working at companies have. It's not uncommon to see people with 10-20 years IT experience and zero certifications. Sometimes they don't even have a college diploma or university degree.

Comparatively, people that are new to the field are expected to have degrees, certifications, internships, homelabs, projects, professionally written resumes, work experience (even though you need a job to get experience which can be tricky as a new graduate). And even with all of those things, it's still not uncommon to have to send out hundreds of applications for near minimum wage help desk positions with night shift expectations and still get no response.

Employers always talk about the ""skills gap"" and ""talent shortage,"" though it seems that employers still seem to prefer experience over everything else, even if the people applying for jobs don't have much interest in improving their skills.

It's quite discouraging as someone new to the field that actually enjoys studying and learning new skills. I frequently see posts on Reddit from experienced people that don't enjoy learning and yet they get all the jobs and good salaries. It's starting to feel like maybe I missed the chance to pursue an IT career and I'm wasting time and money learning in-demand skills when employers still only want to hire based on experience."

I am a 17 year old competitive programmer with 5 years of experience and some notable achievements in the field (selected for IOI training camp multiple times, kickstart rank 250, currently teaching programming to many undergrads including IITians, etc.)

Sorry if I sounded like I'm bragging lol, but point is, I'm pretty sure I'm good enough for internships. Issue is that I don't have any good projects, or experiences with SWE stuff.

I'll be finishing 12th soon, and I'll have a few months to burn. So I want to make the most of the time I have and intern for some good companies (preferably abroad).

I've applied for a Google apprenticeship two days ago (got some referrals too from people I personally am friends with). I haven't heard from them yet unfortunately.

But I want to have other good options ready too, considering the current hiring freeze. Like Microsoft, IBM, etc.

Idk many companies, nor am I very informed of these things. Can someone please guide me? I'd really appreciate it.

11xpok2,1,2023-03-21,I made a mistake in choosing my major and have reached a point where I don't know what to do anymore.,Octavio_al,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11xpok2/i_made_a_mistake_in_choosing_my_major_and_have/,"So, long story short I (22m) chose three years ago that I wanted to become a computer engineer. From the very beginning I felt like that field wasn’t for me, but I decided to keep going thinking that maybe I just needed to give it a chance. As the semesters passed, I realized more and more that not only I don't like computer engineering and programming particularly, but also that I'm not that good at it tbh. I mean, I have certainly learned a few things, however, seeing what some of my classmates who have been in the same course at the same time are capable of, the truth is that I feel that I am far behind in terms of skills.

In the meantime, I thought several times about changing my major, my university or even moving to a different country. But then there was the pandemic and there were not a lot of opportunities for change, not to mention the most important part, which is that I am not the one who pays for my tuition, but my father. I can't even imagine the disappointment it would cause to tell him that I don't like what I'm studying, plus the shock of telling him that he has already invested completely in vain around $40K in my degree, which definitely is a lot for my home country.

Right now, I am in the middle of my sixth semester. I have a little over a year left to graduate and it is perfectly clear to me that I don't want to work in this field. I am supposed to choose today what I am going to do during my seventh semester, which could be an internship in a company, specialize in an area (which could be AI, cybersecurity or video games) or go on exchange to another country. 

I wanted to go on exchange, I took my language exams and was even accepted at a university in Australia. But the economic scenario didn't look so good. My dad lost his job earlier this year and the experience would cost about 20K for 6 months and I would have to start paying right away. Although we have the money, spending it like that might put us in a tight spot financially in the short to medium term, because of what I mentioned before. I didn't even tell my dad that I was accepted or that I declined the opportunity in Australia.

Going on exchange was one of the few things I was looking forward to all this time. Now I only have the option of either getting accepted in a company, which I think is almost impossible, or specializing in something, which I won't like either.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have reached a point where I feel completely and utterly lost. I don't want to work in this, I don't want to get a degree in this, I don't even want to continue studying it, I just want to run away. I feel like it's a waste of money, a waste of time and above all a waste of my life, I would rather be doing anything else. There are days where I wake up feeling completely burned out, feeling almost as if I were sick. I feel incredibly drained mentally and emotionally from doing this and pretending that everything is fine. If I just didn't like it maybe I could cope, but I don't like it, I'm not good at it and it's costing us a fortune at a time where my family is not getting any sort of income.

But I don't know what to do. I’m thinking that I should probably keep going, since I only have a year left.  I don't even know what I would do if I were to leave. I'm just as lost as I was when I chose this major in the first place."

11xr1qp,10,2023-03-21,Self improvement journey,mcmonthebeat,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/11xr1qp/self_improvement_journey/,"I'm 25 and from the northern Himalayan parts of India. Growing up, I was socially anxious and very insecure about my looks and everything. I have a birthmark-like scar over my eye, and I used to be chubby. I always thought people were judging me and walked in a weird slumped way with my head down. I was an extreme case of social awkwardness.

I started smoking weed, which grows everywhere naturally, and thought that doing drugs would make me cool. But soon, I failed in my 12th standard exams and got a kidney stone. I became depressed for many months over random things, even thought I had cancer. That's when I decided to become a sound engineer and went to a sound engineering college far away from my state with my dad for an interview.

During the interview, they asked me to rap since I said I liked rap. When I performed Eminem's Spacebound, I got nervous and had no rhythm. They made a mockery out of me, but I told my dad that everything went well. However, I knew I had messed up. For a long year, I stayed at home and did some freelancing on Fiverr to make some money. Then, I thought of enrolling in a civil engineering degree. By the time I got to college, I had become kind of skinny and started going to the gym to get big biceps, but my diet was messed up. I got fatter and chubbier every day.

In 2020, I got an internship at a construction site and realized that even the laborers at the lowest level had more knowledge than me. I didn't study hard in college and spent my time freelancing as a designer on the side, drinking beer, and playing video games. My seniors made fun of me every day, and it felt weird. Then, the lockdown hit, and everything changed. I started skipping rope and developing stamina, but I didn't know how to proceed.

One day, I stumbled upon a video called ""45 Minute Workout - David Goggins,"" and my life took a complete turn. I studied more about him, got involved in running, and got pretty fit with visible abs. I also understood how weights and diets work. I met an old friend who had almost died from lung clotting due to smoking, and we started running and training together. After a few months, we did a 42km distance with another friend, and now our group has grown to 5 folks with the same mindset.

Alongside that, I developed a work ethic of a maniac and took my freelancing business to a decent earning level. I was able to invest all of it to build a new home for us, and soon after, a company approached me to work as their visual designer. I realized that Silicon Valley is the real deal, so I sent out applications to companies every day to work as a consultant on the side. Almost a year later, I work with two different companies as a design consultant and am about to lock in with two more companies. In March 2022, before I was approached by the company, my freelance business took a dip, and I made a video talking about how I will change my life around and work with two companies that can help me travel the world. In fact, I traveled to Vietnam in January and Dubai this month.

Right now, I suggest anyone going through a similar stage to learn to take impulsive actions on the things that need to be done, like running exercises and work. Start small, keep growing, and don't think about the result, just perform the action. Follow the mindsets of folks like David Goggins, get into spirituality, and I suggest Nisargdatta for an in-depth incursion to the mind, Also maybe read about Karma Yoga (Shit will chamge your perspective) Remember we are all the protagonists of our own lives, And think of a movie where the hero is struggling, that is the phase that worries us. That is the phase that makes the story. Again my fight is nowhere near to where I want it to be, Onwards to more improvement, hardships, pain, suffering and Bliss."

More context:

I recently obtained my AWS SAA which led me to the f100 offer. And the team is production facing with alternating on-calls that primarily use AWS but some other cloud services. My current place is very legacy with intentions of using more modern stack but not yet executed.

My concern is do the risks overweigh the rewards? About 1.5 yoe, counting internship. Please share your experiences.

I've been doing an internship since last August that has been primarily coding and I'm getting burnt out on it.  I don't think this is quite the career path for me and it sounds like they won't be able to offer me a position anyways (they want me to stick around, but say the current budget only allows for my intern pay, not another salaried employee).  It's very interesting and I wouldn't mind having coding be maximum 50% of my workload, but not the 95% it currently is.  

I've found I really enjoy when I get to do anything hands on.  It's an R&amp;D job, so I occasionally get to work with soldering a test circuit or building testbeds for what we're working on.  It's great and to be honest I think it's where my skills lay.  That said, when I brought that up to my boss he told me that's never where the money is and I'll make the same amount my whole career.  He says software is the way to go today.  I wanted to check here to see what you all think.  Is there a good career path with options to move up where I can still do plenty of hands on work?"

I have been searching high and low for employment opportunities since January, but I have yet to get one interview. I applied to maybe 6 different places, tailored my resume and cover letter for each one, made sure I met the qualifications but nope. Nothing. It's infuriating.

The one place I did manage to get a short phone call with rejected me a week later because I applied too late, two places said ""no"" in automated emails within 48 hours, one said ""no"" 2 months after I applied, and 3 others have yet to get back to me that I applied to back in January. It is near impossible to follow up because there is no contact information listed.

I feel like a deer constantly staring into the headlights of an incoming car at this point. I feel like I am failing. I have above a 3.8 GPA for both my undergrad and graduate degree. I have 3 years of hospitality/customer service experience as well as 2 internships with a tax and insurance company. I am not sure what the problem is.

I hear companies are laying off workers left and right, so maybe a recession is coming soon. Is it worth it to apply for jobs now - or should I hold off and wait for this tsunami to pass? I plan on going back to waiting tables at a local hotel near my house this summer, which will guarantee me income. Only time will tell how long I can stay in this field.

I welcome any advice or opinions about this, I know this is a rant, but I am tired of getting nowhere.

**EDIT (3/22/2023 12am):** Holy - I did not expect this much attention, but I appreciate everyone's comments and advice! It seems like I'm not the only one having trouble. I am still early in my career search so things will change.

**EDIT 2 (3/29/2023 1am)** Sorry for being MIA some work stuff came up this past week. I'll do my best to interact and respond where applicable. I appreciate all of you greatly. I ended up accepting a full time offer to go back to a hotel closer to my house and waiter there for the upcoming summer until I can find something permanent. Any further advice is greatly appreciated. "
11xu81u,7,2023-03-21,UC Berkeley MEng EECS vs. Stanford MS EE,Common_Barber1174,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/11xu81u/uc_berkeley_meng_eecs_vs_stanford_ms_ee/,"Despite thinking I had almost no chance when I applied, I have been admitted to both programs. I know there is really no wrong answer, but I have been having trouble choosing between them as I feel like both have their pros and cons. I was fortunate to get to visit both campuses recently, and, although they are very different, I could see myself at each one.

Background: I completed my undergrad in biomedical engineering at any state school (Big Ten) and have been working in industry for the last 1.5 years. Wanted to go back for master’s in EE (signal processing) because that is truly what I was more interested in during college but have had trouble getting interviews or job offers for those kind of positions.

Berkeley: 9 month (2 semester) program. Campus felt a lot more familiar to what I am used to. Despite what I had read saying the opposite, I thought it was a beautiful campus - almost like someone had decided to build a major university in the middle of a forest. Also actually had a city and things to do directly adjacent to campus. A lot more people walking around, but insides of buildings were not super nice. Not great opportunities for funding through TA or RA since I will only be on campus for 2 semesters. Program has a professional tilt (MEng).

Stanford: 1.5 year (5 quarter) program. Campus was amazing, inside of every building seemed recently renovated, but it didn’t seem to have a whole lot to do outside of campus. Was also surprisingly empty, even on a weekday. People were VERY excited to talk to me, even without prior appointments, which was a huge green flag. Seems to have better (but still not abundant) opportunities for funding through TA or RA positions.

When I was first applying, I was just about dead set on a one-year program so that I could get back to a job and quickly pay off any loans, but now I am wondering if doing a 1.5 year program at Stanford would be more beneficial since that would give me an opportunity to complete a summer internship - especially since I do not have prior professional experience in the field. However, the computer science and professional tilt of Berkeley’s program makes me think that program will be better suited for industry than MS EE at Stanford.

Finally, I do not particularly care about attending the most prestigious school or getting a big tech position. However, I know that these schools will open the most doors for me relative to the other schools I applied to, and I am excited to get out of the snowy midwest for a couple of years :)

Any advice you can offer for a small towner who never expected to be in this position would be very appreciated!

TLDR: Programs at Berkeley and Stanford each have their pros and cons, and I am asking for help deciding between them."

Due to all the layoffs, they decided not to convert any interns.

My graduation date is December 2023.

After north of 400 applications this round, I landed two internships for the Summer of 2023. Unfortunately, neither of the companies is willing to move the internship to Spring or Fall. I like both opportunities for different reasons.

Company A has much higher pay but negative reviews about culture. It is a start-up with some promise. Does not have a clearly defined path for internship conversion.

Company B is a more established company with far lower pay but more of a program for internship conversion, with intern buddies and things of that nature.

I'm thinking of starting one a month before the other and then attempting to do both simultaneously. I have a family with kids so the positives are two paychecks instead of one and I need the money and a higher chance of receiving a return offer. Conversion to full-time is perhaps my most important factor.  My concern is that my performance will suffer at both companies, and it may be more than I can chew, and I could end up with nothing in the end and screw myself over.

Has anyone been in a similar predicament or attempted to work two internships simultaneously? How did it work out? Curious about your opinions."

&amp;#x200B;

So im an undergrad student whos graduating in May, and I really dont know what to do with my life. Im kinda in a rut, feeling uninspired and not too happy. All my life feels like its leading up to a boring and stressful job in corporate America with little chance of adventure and genuine human connection. Everyone around me keeps saying ""life aint sunshine and rainbows"" and that ""you need a job to do the things you love"" ... and they are right, but i see videos of people on tiktok and in movies and crap that seem to be so happy and doing ""what they love"", and I want to feel that happy as well and i dont feel like my life is moving in that direction atm. Problem is i have really bad anxiety and i also romanticize everything ... not a good combo.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually broke down and ended up reaching out to the company that I interned with the year before. They offered me a contract position for 6 months to a year and with a wage of around 60k that comes with no benefits except payed holidays and payed time off (although thats not in writing, my ex-manager and i have a good relationship so i didnt press it too much). This job is near my parents house, so costs would be low for me personally. Its a safe option. The internship was a little bit stressful and boring at times, and i got a bit depressed while working there because i was so dedicated to making a good impression. Im assuming this contract position will mean more difficult tasks and probably more stress as well. Im not really excited by the prospect and imnot really interested in potentially being awarded a salary position there.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah ... thats really all i got. Im young, and i feel like if i spend my youth slaving away, i will never be able to appreciate and explore life later on. I have a good amount of savings, but dont really know what to do with it nor how to spend my spare time if i ever had some. I just feel so conflicted, i dont want to miss out on this opportunity but it also doesn't excite me at all. What do yall think? Should i take the job, or decline and take some time off to do whatever (i dont even know what)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any feedback!"

I'm a junior in high school who just moved here like 6 months ago from a different country.(9th and 10th grade in India, 11th and 12th in USA.) I want to do everything I can to strengthen my college applications. so basically this is my SITUATION:

1) my counselor would not give me any good classes this year. resultantly, I only have one AP class ( AP literature) and am self-studying for the AP chemistry exam. My past hs grades from my old school are good.

2) I have one D on my 1st-semester transcript because I joined this specific math class EXTREMELY late and was made to take a test about three days after joining. I dropped the class and now have a very good grade on a higher-level math course I'm taking online. my current gpa is an 3.4

3) The rest of my grades are good and I'll be taking a lot of AP classes (6-8) next year to increase my GPA.

4) I will probably take college courses at the local community college. is that a good decision?

5) I only have two years of foreign language (hindi) from my indian school which my counselor was fine with

Extracurriculars:

1) I am a library volunteer at school

2) I tutor kids

3) I got accepted into the girls who code online summer immersion program

4)I got accepted to a paid internship at the TAC museum but I can't go bc I can't legally work. but I want to integrate it into my application somehow to emphasize the juxtaposition of my abilities idk-how do I do that?

5) I applied to a bunch of free stipend summer programs but idk if I'll really get accepted

6) I got accepted to volunteer at a cat shelter but then left it cause idk how helpful it'll be

I REALLY need tips on how to strengthen my application, specifically extracurriculars. i don't wanna go to community college lol. what other extracurriculars can I do? my major is mostly computer science but I aim to be a prosthetic engineer or just a software engineer."

If you go to any of the schools below for MS, could you tell me a bit about how rigorous the coursework is? like I mentioned earlier, I tend to take a bottom-up approach to schooling but since master's programs are more aligned with specific specializations of CS I wouldn't mind putting in the work for a great degree.

So im an undergrad student whos graduating in May, and I really dont know what to do with my life. Im kinda in a rut, feeling uninspired and not too happy. All my life feels like its leading up to a boring and stressful job in corporate America with little chance of adventure and genuine human connection. Everyone around me keeps saying ""life aint sunshine and rainbows"" and that ""you need a job to do the things you love"" ... and they are right, but i see videos of people on tiktok and in movies and crap that seem to be so happy and doing ""what they love"", and I want to feel that happy as well and i dont feel like my life is moving in that direction atm. Problem is i have really bad anxiety and i also romanticize everything ... not a good combo.

I eventually broke down and ended up reaching out to the company that I interned with the year before. They have offered me a contract position for 6 months to a year and with a wage of around 60k that comes with no benefits except payed holidays and payed time off. This job is near my parents house, so costs would be low for me personally. Its a safe option. The internship was a little bit stressful and boring at times, and i got a bit depressed while working there because i was so dedicated to making a good impression. Im assuming this contract position will mean more difficult tasks and probably more stress as well. Im not really excited by the prospect and imnot really interested in potentially being awarded a salary position there.

So yeah ... thats really all i got. Im young, and i feel like if i spend my youth slaving away, i will never be able to appreciate and explore life later on. I have a good amount of savings, but dont really know what to do with it nor how to spend my spare time if i ever had some. I just feel so conflicted, i dont want to miss out on this opportunity but it also doesn't excite me at all. What do yall think? Should i take the job, or decline and take some time off to do whatever (i dont even know what)

Thanks for any feedback!"
11y45fu,1,2023-03-21,Why can’t I get an interview?,_GH0STED_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11y45fu/why_cant_i_get_an_interview/,"I started an apprenticeship when I was 16 (IT Admin), by the age of 18 I was the IT Manager, overseeing an IT admin and reporting to the board of directors. I was the person with the most technical knowledge so I was essentially given full authority with guidance from the Managing Directors. I had that job until Dec 2020, (I resigned due to some personal problems) and since then I’ve been doing crypto trading. With the huge dip recently I’m trying to get another IT job, but I’m really struggling. I’ve had my CV rewritten professionally and it documents my voluntary work prior to my job (head of web development for a small NFP providing free IT services, and a programming internship with a U.S. company both when I was 16.) I think because I’ve been out of work for just over 2 years, and me  still being young are the largest problems, but I also think I’m struggling to get IT jobs because I haven’t done much hands on work since the IT admin job back in 2016, and  I haven’t got much management experience - 4 years is probably seen as a bit of a risk for management jobs. So I’m not seen as ideal for either category. 
I have various certifications ranging from Microsoft to First Aider training, and management training also. I also acted as the ICO Data officer (GDPR Trained) for my employer (£25m turnover per year so a sizeable operation)

Can anyone give me any advice? Im not even getting interviews and I can’t understand why. I’ve built a LinkedIn and documented all my skills as I’ve been advised by friends but that hasn’t helped much either. 

Appreciate any thoughts!"

I am clearly really late to the cycle. Looking to apply to top schools that have rolling or stay at my undergrad alma mater and transfer in the spring. I'm wondering how much of a shot I have as I have somewhat of a unique background. Started college extremely depressed - bad grades, no extracurriculars. Completely turned it around my junior year and have since been doing exceptionally well - several internships at FAANG+ companies 

Stats:

&gt;3.7 / 4.0 GPA, Average CS state school (T50). pass/failed a few classes around covid - unsure how negatively that will impact my application  
&gt;  
&gt;Internships on high performance compute engines (fairly well known), and an incoming one at a well known AV company  
&gt;  
&gt;LoR - two obtained that will be very strong (explicitly state that I am one of the best students they have ever had). good to average third letter.  
&gt;  
&gt;GRE - not applicable

I'm hoping that I can make up for my lackluster gpa and early-college mistakes by writing a strong personal statement about my growth as a person and passion for the subfield that I choose. 

do I have a shot at any top schools? Some I'm considering right now:

&gt;UC anything  
&gt;  
&gt;USC  
&gt;  
&gt;UIUC  
&gt;  
&gt;Georgia Tech  
&gt;  
&gt;UT austin  
&gt;  
&gt;Purdue  
&gt;  
&gt;UMD  
&gt;  
&gt;Penn State

Please let me know if I have no shot so I can save some application money, or if I am missing some schools."

**Intended Major(s)**: Neuroscience (Biomedical Computation for Stanford)

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): Before IB, 9.7/10
* Rank (or percentile): School doesn't rank but based on my knowledge, I'm in a third place tie. We were a small class of around 30 students.
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Full IBPD; HL Chemistry, Biology, English A and Spanish A, SL Mathematics AA and Environemntal Systems (lol). Finished with a 42/45.

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* Cambridge CPE title, if it fits here... 222/230 :)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. **Internship at a local university in my country**. I talked about what I do in the laboratory, didn't namedrop (I regret not doing so), 35 hours a week during my gap year. Nothing published yet...
2. **Volunteering: created my city's first tutoring program.** Administered over 100 volunteers and 20 families over a year. 14 hr/wk, 46 wk/yr. Grade 12.
3. **Speaker at international TEDx event**. Was given a scholarship to attend, the topic was neuroscience/pschology. Grade 12. I also did other TEDx events locally.
4. **MUN organizer and chair**. Just the school's MUN.
5. **Coding team co-founder.** Was named co-founder after enrolling in the Astro Pi contest. Self taught Python (with certificate from the University of Helsinki) for this project).
6. **Class president and then prefect during all years of high school**. It's funny because I went to 3+ different high schools, was elected class president at all of them. I mentioned my duties as class president (organizing sport comeptitions, arranging exam schedules...)
7. **Eldest sister.** As the first child of a monoparental family, I spent my summers and most evenings taking care of my sisters, cooking or tidying up the house. I thought it was something I should put in the commonapp because it consumed my summers and I couldn't attend many of the contests I wanted to go to.
8. **Dance**. Competition dancer (gymnastics and ballroom dances) until 11th grade (danced normally but without  the competition hours because of my studies). I have been dancing since I'm 6 years old, won 2 silver metals in a big city in my country.
9. **Film making.** Ludopathy advocating through writing, directing and co-producing an award-winning short film on the topic.
10. **Violin.** Obligatory mention for the nerdy aesthetic: the violin. Had to stop playing in an orchestra because I moved cities in year 10. I have been playing at home ever since.

I mentioned other ECs such as aiding with the creation of a vegan and religious-respectful menus at my high school, participating in chess tournaments, working now as a tutor.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Full ride to the most prestigious school in my city, which allowed me to study the IB. Valued in 28k, only one recipient per year.
2. My team was Astro-Pi finalist (I love you guys), it's an international coding competition and they send robots to space for investigations planned my teenagers. You should definitely try for next year if you're a sophomore/junior reading this.
3. First place in a local's university contest for independent research.
4. Mathletics: 1st place in school, 6th place in Europe (I spent 52 hours in a single week doing this. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Environmentals teacher: good, but I don't expect it to be great. His last referees have gotten into oxford and UCL and really good colleges, so it will definitely not hurt. We have an amazing relationship.

Physics teacher/tutor: He is my teacher, just not the physics one. I sneaked into his lessons anyway because he is genuinely the best teacher ever. I'm sure he wrote an amazing LOR.

English teacher: I read the letter, it's comedic, mentions me as bubbly and genuine and talks about me in a less academic light (still mentions my work ethic with examples, etc), which I guess is a good combination with a more formal letter.

**Interviews**

Duke interview: He was Spanish but he hated biology. It was fun and very very relatable when we talked about anything other than my major. Overall I think he thinks I'm not a fit for Duke, but I liked him and I'd love to go there.

Northwestern: the first and best interview so far. He told me I'm the type of students Northwestern wants, that he'll do anything possible for me to get in, and told me to continue with my current path in life. Very encouraging and now I'm praying to get in because I love Northwestern.

Princeton: The interviewer cancelled on me TWICE and then finally intervewed me. Very sweet man, had many things to talk about but I don't think the interview will have a negative or positive impact on my application. I think it was very neutral.

**Essays**

Maaaaaan I don't know. I don't like my essays but they made my abusive mom angry so HEY that's a good sign. I tried my best to show how much I love each university and how I see myself there as a student. I hope the feeling is reciprocal. I am often called a good writer but I don't think I would stand out from a really good applicant pool because of my prose.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Newcastle University in the UK :) for Medicine (I applied as an international there)

*Waitlists:*

* Deferred from Harvard REA

*Rejections:*

* Bowdoin
* U of Chicago
* Case Western Reserve
* Tufts
* Northwestern :(

Awaiting on other T20s. I know it looks like I applied to only reaches, but honestly, as a European student, if I'm going to University of Nowhere, I rather stay in Europe. There's nothing wrong with ambition!

**Additional Information:**

I am losing hope but as a test optional international seeking full aid, I shouldn't have had any hope to begin with. I am honestly looking for a miracle right now. I am blaming my results on my need for money, but maybe the fault lies somewhere else. It's not like I can do anything to change the outcome now, but if you see a mistake please point it out so other internationals seeking full aid don't make the same mistake."

There will be limited part time opportunities in NEU which I can avail from second sem. I think that I can bear the living expense in ASU. My biggest concern is the current tech recession and if I can get opportunities for summer internships in '24.

I'm a Uni student and I've secured a trading internship for the end of this year, but feel unprepared and undeserving of it because I don't think I know enough programming. I'm studying engineering but nothing which specialises in programming.

I feel confident enough in my maths ability and prior knowledge of financial markets, but programming wise I feel grossly inadequate, and what I do know in relevant languages (Python?) is largely self taught. I can make intermediate level programs (Arbitrage using APIs for example, basic-ish data manipulation, sorting etc). Compared to other people who I know applied for similar roles, I feel so far behind in this area


How do I get over this feeling? What can I do to best prepare to make the most of this opportunity (and hopefully secure a job)? Is it common/normal for people to feel imposter syndrome in the industry, even at an internship level?

I'm on casual/good terms with a few of the recruiters and employees because of firm-related events I've assisted them with, do you think it'd hurt future prospects to mention this feeling to them and ask what I can do to prepare/re-assure myself?"

I accepted a job offer about 3 weeks ago. Start date is May 15. I signed the offer letter and completed the requested forms and I-9 pre check. Last communication over the phone with my recruiter, he mentioned that info for drug test and background check would come soon and to reach out for questions.

I emailed him again last week following up on that since I haven’t heard anything. Just asking when drug screen/background check would be coming and also if they needed anything else. Also had some questions about benefits and healthcare I wanted to sort out. I still haven’t gotten any sort of response.

Is this normal when it comes to onboarding? This is only my second job out of college but I had similar experiences with my first job and previous internships too. They are very responsive during interviews and giving out the offer waiting for your acceptance. After you accept though, it’s radio silence when you have questions. My first job, there were a few items that were actually missing for onboarding that they hit me up about very close to the start date.

This offer also concerns me because it involves me moving to a different state. I need to sign a lease soon, but if there’s any chance my offer is rescinded I don’t want to sign a lease and be screwed there. Is it common for companies to rescind offers after you sign and complete I-9 prework? Not a huge issue, but I would love to know before I sign a lease and plan a move. 

Any advice at all is appreciated! Thank you all."

I recently received a job offer as an Intern where I will be working directly under a Senior Sys admin. I am a little bit nervous as this is not only my first job in IT but also my first Job in a professional office environment. I really want to do a good job and be a valuable member of the team but I am a little bit unsure what skills/technologies I am expected to be competent in as the job description was quite vague. I feel comfortable with basic stuff like configuring VMs and basic network troubleshooting but I definitely still have a lot to learn. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what I should become familiar with before I start in May? What tools/technology’s do sysadmins use daily that would make me stand out if I am familiar with? Any advice anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.

B. How would you order the majors from the Engineering Department at UF in terms of competitiveness to transfer into? Asking this because I'm still a little indecisive if I should study EE, CompE, or CompSci.

C. Does my GPA get reset after transfer into UF?

D. How long will it take me to complete an EE degree after I transfer over?

E. Does the EE major offer any focuses to help me get a job with a Defense Contractor? I'm interested in working on circuitry of aircraft/computers/electronic devices.

I, 23|F,VA worked at a county owned media company (local radio and cable). During my last 30 days of employment I was not paid, after countless emails, phone calls and texts, one of the employees paid me out of pocket via Venmo.

I made a complaint to a board member (also my mother.) the issue was brought up at a board meeting, and I thought the issue was handled. 

A few days late, I got a text from the CEO asking to  take me to lunch and talk. I felt weird about the situation, but I went. About 7 minutes into us sitting, and ordering food, she immediately asks me “would you rather be paid and let go or stay with the company” confused I asked where this was coming from ( and also started recording for my protection,it’s legal in my state)

She continued on to threaten my employment if I did not bend to her will, telling me my option does not matter because I’m an intern, etc (Threatening me for a complaint I made to a board member, because I never said anything to her)

After feeling very uncomfortable I asked for my food to go, she then ends the convo with, “you have until the end of the day to decide if you would like to stay with the company” and “I hope you make the right decision”

The next day, she told me I could not work, and about a week or two later told me I was fired. 

Fast forward to now, I have still not been paid, and they are stating “I will not be paid unless I return all equipment and items”. 

I also made a complaint to the board president, no answer.

funny enough, the company is run so bad, then never even made me sign any paperwork for any technical equipment, they just handed it over. So pretty much they have no leg to stand on. The CEO is so dumb, she thinks having an organized company is white supremacy…. She (a black woman) said that to me (a black woman) 

Any help would be great. 

Add on: I believe the company may have committed fraud as well (they get money from the county every quarter I believe, an employee told me she invoiced the county twice and never said anything)

Good news I finally got my internship offers for the next Summer. The situation is, I received 2 offers at 2 different companies. Here are the few things to consider:

- Company A (an IT consulting company):

Pros: 
+ They are very fast in the hiring process. They sent me the offer email and asked me to answer them in 2 days. Because of the short-time period, I accepted it. They just sent me an official offer letter and asked me to sign asap so I can move on with the onboarding process.
+ Good benefits + PTO for intern
+ Hybrid job

Cons:
+Small company, I’m not sure if it looks good on my resume
+ During the interview, I don’t find much interest in their intern projects.

-Company B (Retail company):

Pros: 
+ Well-known retail company
+ Interesting projects for intern

Cons:
+ No PTO
+ Very slow in hiring process. Every time I emailed the recruiter to ask questions, I received the auto-message saying that she is out of office for college recruiting event and will return in 3-5days. But today is the last day to give them my decision.

The salaries they offered are similar to each other. I don’t think negotiation is a good idea because I don’t have any experience.

Summary: I accepted the offer at company A. But I also want to keep company B as a back-up plan because most of my friends got job rescinding recently during this terrible market.  Is it legal to accept both? If so, will I be in trouble during the background check process if both companies find out that situation?"

The reason why I have a bad GPA was due to covid and doing virtual school. In my freshman year I got a 3.56 GPA, sophomore year I got a 2.821 GPA(My first year of taking honors courses I took 4) that year I didn't do very well, I had family problems and we were still doing virtual school with covid. Fast forward to this year we are fully in person and I’ve learned from my mistakes at the time of this school year for my junior year I have a 4.2 GPA (I only take two honors classes this year and one of them I still have a perfect 100). In addition, this year I also have 95 and above and all of my classes this year. Next year for my senior year I plan to take 4 honors classes and 2 APs, and hopefully get to retake SAT to get a better reading score.

I have been banking on getting a CS job, but every time I start looking up jobs again I get overwhelmed by stress because I absolutely hate the atmosphere of the industry.

I programmed in my free time a bit when I was younger, made a game with friends, and I think I'm good at it, but I feel I just don't have the heart to approach what looks like a socially and creatively desolate landscape.

matters where you get your first software engineering job.

Since September, I had been applying to multiple openings every week but had not received any offers. However, things changed drastically in the past 24 hours, as I received two internship offers from different companies. Here's how I did it:

1. I kept my spirits high: Despite the numerous rejections I faced, I never gave up hope. I stayed positive and reminded myself that the right opportunity was out there for me.
2. I tailored my applications: Rather than submitting generic resumes and cover letters, I tailored each application to the specific company and job opening. This showed that I had put in effort and was genuinely interested in the position.
3. I networked: I reached out to people in my industry and attended networking events to meet new people. This helped me gain valuable insights into the job market and also opened up new opportunities.
4. I practiced my interview skills: I knew that interviews were the make-or-break point for any job application, so I made sure to prepare thoroughly. I practiced my answers to common interview questions and also researched the companies I was applying to.
5. I stayed persistent: Even when things seemed bleak, I kept pushing forward. I continued to apply to jobs, network, and improve my skills.

In the end, all my hard work paid off. I received two job offers in the span of 24 hours, and I'm grateful for the opportunities. My advice to anyone going through a tough job search is to stay positive, tailor your applications, network, practice your interview skills, and stay persistent.

I'm a Data Science master's student, I like what I study, and I liked a subject concerning analyzing big data using network science so much, that I turned down two internships (one in a computer vision focused startup, one focused on time series analysis in a big organization) to collaborate with my professor for my master's thesis, with the hopeful goal to publish it

Now, this professor, who's very eminent in his field (his main research field is utilizing, as hinted before, models and tools based on complex networks to study data which mostly comes from social medias), asked me if I'd be interested in a PhD in the field, and I'm honestly seriously considering it

Now, before going on: I have no desire to stay in academia, I just think I'd enjoy spending three years researching stuff I enjoy researching, and then hopefully getting some money outside of the academic field

This said, I'm quite scared: my colleagues pursuing a PhD are mostly doing cutting edge research on new algorithms and models, while what I would do would take me a bit further away from the more traditional ML/AI stuff, and I'm not sure how good that would be in the future. I'm afraid that while PhDs focused on deep learning and the likes could open doors for research scientist positions, I'd just be ""another"" data scientist

I'm quite confused and I'm trying to understand how I would fare in the job market with a PhD like this

Thank you all in advance for your input, as you can see I'm quite confused and frustrated and I know this was in part asking for advice and in part something I wrote almost to vent"

For background, I major ChemE pre-med minor CompSci, and my current GPA is like 4.1~4.2. I’m also doing 19hr credits this semester.


I know getting 2 C’s shouldn’t hurt my GPA that much, but still, I really don’t want to have both the C for 1 semester. I know I would also have to get internships and stuff next year, and I don’t want to have bad grades on my transcript. 


Especially, since I’m an international student, my resume and grades rlly have to stand out to get an internship :) 


The thing is also that, I might have to graduate 1 semester late if I drop out of my Ochem class :) and I’m paying out of state tuition….


I got a 63 on my last Ochem exam, and I just took the second one today, and I bombed it. I also got a few D’s and F’s on the homeworks and quizzes, so I don’t know if it’s possible to bring my grade back to a B.

Some people tell me to learn Java since its widely used and many things are based on it but many more tell me that it's going to be outdated and replaced in a couple of years (Kothlind, C#, and Google's problems with it) and it's not worth it to dive deep into it and better learn C# and I really want the advice of what to do.

One of the interns at my workplace came out to me today and I feel like I mishandled a large portion of the conversation. 

I feel like race/general demographics are important for context: I am a white woman in my 30s. I would describe myself as asexual, but not out at work because no one has ever asked/the topic has never come up. The intern is a black man in his early 20s, about to graduate from college. He's very sweet and soft-spoken and I've long suspected he's gay but never asked because it's really none of my business and not relevant to our line of work. Our mutual supervisor is a black woman in her 40s.

I don't have supervisory duties over this intern, but I do occasionally assign him tasks when I need admin related stuff done that I don't have time to do myself. We have a good working relationship and share common interests in media/music. The intern is a psychology-major and I've been very open with him about my experiences with mental health issues and going to therapy as he has mentioned struggling with anxiety and considering therapy for it. 

He's been a little out of sorts the past few days I've seen him, but nothing completely unusual for him. Today however, there was something very off, so I asked him how he was doing when he stopped by my office and he asked me if he could close my office door. He then became very upset and asked if he could tell me something, and started talking very quietly about what sounded like a non-consensual encounter with a girl where he was the non-consenting party. He then told me that when he was a kid he and a boy did something (I couldn't make out much more than that as he was almost whispering at that point and I'm hard of hearing). I recognized signs of extreme emotional distress in his voice and body language and asked him if I could call and help him make an appointment to speak to someone about how he was feeling because I was very concerned about him. He said yes, so I called the company crisis line and put them on speaker phone and set up an emergency appointment for a couple hours later, at a time of the intern's choosing. I then told him that I know that sharing this kind of information with someone can be difficult and thanked him for allowing me to help him. 

I also told my boss (via webchat) that the intern was having a very rough day and that I'd like to keep him nearby until he could talk to someone. She told me to ask the intern to come talk to her (bc I said I was not willing to disclose why he was upset bc it was personal to him) and he went to talk to her. 30 minutes later she messaged me to escort him to our company crisis center for a warm hand-off because she was very worried about him and had called to get his appointment moved up immediately.

Long story short, he told my boss he was having thoughts of self-harm because he thought he might be gay. I completely missed that context (and to be honest any context beside him being in severe emotional distress because I am as perceptive a box of bricks) and upon mental review of my conversation with him, I originally thought he was attempting to disclose sexual assault.

I really feel like I could have handled our initial conversation a lot better. No one has ever come out to me in confidence before. I never experienced a complete crisis of self due to my sexuality (my mental health crisis was for other reasons) because I've always had zero interest in sex and have told my parents for years that I'm never getting married or having kids because those things don't interest me at all. My parents were disappointed about no grand-kids but accepting of not wanting to get married, so it was really a non-issue for me. I also have zero knowledge of how the black community in the Midwestern US handles black men being gay, aside from my boss telling me that it's not really accepted once I returned from the warm hand-off.

Assuming he's able to return to work in the near future, how should I apologize to the intern for not realizing he was trying to tell me he might be gay and that he's struggling with that? And how do I as a white woman support him as a (potentially) gay black man in a region of the US that is not exactly friendly towards black people or gays in general while he attempts to navigate his own feelings about his sexuality?"

I am an international student studying robotics and RL in a Japanese university (top 3 -ish). I will finish my undergraduate degree in September and have a few offers for grad school. Currently, having a hard time to make a decision on where to go for grad school. My options are the following:

1. My own Japanese university and the lab: PROS:  a fully-funded scholarship, familiar environment, better university ranking CONS: the research misalignment with head prof (assistant prof is ok) and poor quality of the courses in the MS program ( I have taken a few graduate level courses and they are quite bad), Japanese degree is useful only inside Japan
2. I am also waiting for admission results from German universities(Tubingen, Saarland, FAU Erlangen)  PROS: excited about the programs and research there, new culture and language, being in Europe, more opportunities in terms of internships and jobs CONS: not sure if I get accepted 100%, no monthly stipends, and I would need to work part-time. Takes time to learn the language.

So, financially, my Japanese university seems good and it is more comfortable staying there than going to Germany. On the other hand, the idea of staying in Japan for another 2 years seems a bit boring as I already spent 4 years here and I am more excited about living in Europe.

Any advice on where to go next would be appreciated, especially from those familiar with Japanese and German graduate schools. Thank you!"

The kind of person who took part in competitions, extra projects, started assignments early, thought out of the box for a lot of things, took the hardest classes, were always planning things like research or internships or camps for any of their school breaks. I feel like many of us on A2C have worked hard on so many different aspects of our application and we fall in love with colleges and apply with so much hope, and it really stings when we get rejected. 

Now this has probably been said a thousand times but I’ll just tell you guys again that the rejections don’t change you as a person. You are still capable and hardworking and you will continue to excel in things at whatever college you end up at. Some of you have done amazing research w/ professors, and participated in several olympiads, and created initiatives &amp; projects to improve your communities. You’re all extremely successful people who will continue to do so even at university, I feel like that competitive streak doesn’t die a lot of the time. Just because certain colleges haven’t been able to value your worth, doesn’t mean you aren’t/won’t be capable of the same or even more accomplishments as the students of those certain colleges. 

I still get that rejections still can mess you up, I just wanted to remind you that while the rejection can hurt, it can never fundamentally change a person who has been so hardworking and successful throughout their high school years."

To be frank, I don't have a chance to get CSE in top IIT and NITs(obviously). My only option for India is the 3rd tier universities although I am also going to appear for exams like BITSAT and VITEEE and also other private university exams.

But, I have got an admit from Arizona state university(with 13.5k-yr scholarship) , Iowa state university ( 10k/yr scholarship), UIC (no scholarship) for computer science.

My parents can pay for around 2-3 years for expenses for both ASU and ISU other than that I have to manage on my own from internship and other things.

Should I go for my undergraduate now or go for masters later. My end goal is to work in a good industry as a software engineer or as quant if possible.

Another question I have is in regards to my job search. I've been with my current company for 3 years as an IT Systems Associate. However, it is a smaller company so I am lucky enough to have experience with a broader scope of responsibilities such as VMs, server patching, limited firewall experience, limited Cloud Experience (helped migrate on-prem servers to Azure, was in charge of creating a few servers and setting up Log Analytics, Application Insights, and Anti-Virus), Anti Virus (migration, deployment, and management using Sentinel One), and more (please take a look at my resume). With this experience, I am really looking for the next step up such as a System Administrator position or SOC Analyst (would really like this but it is hard in the DMV without a security clearance). 

Just want feedback if these roles are obtainable with my experience and/or recommendations for similar positions. Reason for wanting a new position is because my company kept me after my internship, but my pay is on the lower side (45k). I love the job but I really need to focus on my future.

Now it boots up with the ssd installed but my hdd won't get recognized at all and my new ssd is only shown in bios but not in the explorer. Taskmanager Shows it. After taking it out and changing to uefi everything worked again. I also read that csm makes your pc slower. So my question is how can I install the new nvme ssd without losing any of my other hard drives or installing windows new or something like that. My mainbord is a b450 a pro max I think.

So basically I’m assigned to a project as the only Frontend engineer and given an overwhelming amount of tasks to do. I am experienced but if this was to get done in the way they wanted it done, it would take 12 hours a day every day. I’m constantly pulled around to do things that are usually only tangentially related to my job

Talking to a coworker, I come to find out that this project was initially made by an intern as a summer project and was only worked on when it absolutely needed to be, and never by Frontend engineers. Frontend engineers at the rest of the company comment on how unusual it is when I ask questions about it. I find incredibly frustrating bugs almost every day. Testing can’t be trusted, none of the tooling can be trusted. The types are also often just any, so I can’t even trust type checking

I struggle to get reviews on anything, ever. When I ask, people will say “yeah sure” and never review it. I have to ask multiple times, over and over. I usually never get reviews. I get a lot of comments on “communication skills” because I feel like I have to be diplomatic instead of saying the honest truth: this code is shit and that’s the core of the problem

My manager would constantly confront me. Some days he would be straight up _mean_. One day he said to me “I can’t believe you’ve _ever_ worked in the industry given how poorly you’re doing” and implied I lied on my resume. He implied my last job must just be some amateur garbage and rainforest is where the pros go. I felt offended and blurted it out: I’ve never seen code this bad. I detailed all the stuff I’ve seen here and how I found it to be poorly made. At my last job it was _hard_ to fuck stuff up because we had solid infra, good testing, good tooling, and very smart people. 

My mentor was also getting pissed with me because he said I didn’t communicate enough. Truth is I wasn’t sure what to say about a lot of things and be diplomatic, because it felt like he always had the “right answer” in his mind and whatever I said would be judged on how far it deviated from that. It bothered me when he asked my opinion cause it was usually followed with a “correction” about how I’m wrong. He basically said “I’m cancelling our meetings, I don’t want to talk to you anymore”

I have so much work to do all the time so the reviews keep piling up. I constantly ask people for reviews and no one does them. I have a deadline so I develop and put out new reviews. My boss gets pissed, and I ask what I should do. I can’t get reviews. He tells me it’s cause no one trusts me so they don’t wanna review my code

I get constant comments about how “the number of bugs is really bad”, if there’s even 1 new bug not even in production. Keep in mind I probably do 10-20 tickets a day. People start blaming me and I just feel stuck like I’m the scapegoat for all of this 

Is it a lost cause? Is there anything I can do?"

Not too long after I met this guy in my department who started talking about coding and how nice it is and how much value you can generate with it. So I looked into it and decided I was going to try to learn to code. during your second to last semester you're required to get an internship postion related to your field which I did. Luckily, the company I worked for was still small and there wasn't a lot to do so I could spend that time coding and studying. I kept coding and learnign all the way up until I graduated and started my NYSC (A mandatory service year graduates of nigerian universities are required to take part in.). After I finished my internship I was fairly decent at web dev and the guy that got me started coding told me abou this business idea he had that he wanted me to build. I thought it was a decent idea and I felt it was an oppotunity to learn so I decided to start building the web app and continued working on it till we graduated and started NYSC. for the NYSC sevice year, you can either work in a place teh government will provide for you (which will most lilkely be a teaching position in a school somewhere) or you can get a letter from a company willing to take you for that year and you can work there instead. So I started applying to literally anywhere and everywhere even remotely related to any kind of frontend development and had no success not even rejection emails, just nothing. Luckily my mum knew someone who worked at a wire and cable company he was able to get me a position there and I opted to work in quality assurance.

Unexpectedly, one of the places I applied to got back to me and was willing to take me on. It was just a wordpress position for a small start up and it was a 2month contract. I was a bit confused cuz I listed just react as what I was decent at. I had no idea how to do anything in wordpress but I accepted the offer any way cuz I felt I could learn on the job and it was compltetly remote So I could work for that job while also working in quality assurance at the cable company. It was fairly ok and I was able to balance everything but my friend kept calling asking me to work on the webapp and sending me features he wanted impllimented so I kept working on the three at the same time. Not too long after someone from the startup talked to me about a side gig we could work on. Just basic html and css for someone for quick cash outside of what I was doing for the company. I was reluctant because I was barely surviving juggling everything at the same time but He kept insisting it'd be easy and I could handle it so I accepted. Now I had stuff to do for the startup, my friends webapp and also this side project and the wire and cable company. It was a lot. Luckily, the things I had to do on the wordpress site ramped down after a while and I was only really working for the three places at once. It was still too demanding. I manged to get most of the designs for the side gig done but my friend kept calling asking me to impliment featureA and featureB and so on. It has reached a point where I can't even do anything anymore. I look at the code base for the webapp i'm building with my friend and adking myself why. before I  know it some the guy from the startup is sending messages to provide updates on the project I decided to take on all while I'm still working from 8am-5pm at the cable company. I can barely do anything anymore. In a 3-4hour coding session I just maybe add a few buttons to a page and that's pretty much all I can do for that day before getting exhausted. 

It gets worse. My Final year project supervisor called me over the weekend telling me he intended to publish my project in a journal but needed me to write a review article on it and even with everything I was dealing with I still said YES. It's been days since I agreed to do the article and I havcven't even lifted a finger to do it cuz that's the last thing on my mind right now. He sent me an email a few minutes ago telling me to deliver on the articcle I said I would. While my friend spams my phones with calls about the webapp I need to finish building for his business Idea. I feel like I'm drowning. I was never good at time management and this is just a mess I've gotten myself into. Like I don't know how to tell people HELL NO. My friend even keeps trying to convince me to quite the job with the startup and just build the webapp. He claims if I build it and it's successful that'll be a lot better for my resume thatn working for a startup or whatever. 

 I just needed to vent

TLDR

I'm working for a startup, a wires and cables company, picked up a side gig on the way to build a simple website for someone, building an ecommerce app for my friend while also still trying to learn tools and technologies I need for a frontend dev job. Oh, and writing a reviewe article for my professor. I'm screwed,"
11zvi0t,1,2023-03-23,Choosing Balanced Courses Help (Any Major Can Help Answer This Question),MuffinJets,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/11zvi0t/choosing_balanced_courses_help_any_major_can_help/,"**Background:** I am a computer science major. As much as I know school can be important, I dread school and prefer to work, which is why I do internships part-time. My classes are paid out of pocket. I am behind expected graduation (2024) because I had some life issues get in the way when I was taking CS1 and had to retake the class three times. 

**Problem**: I have about 21 courses left to take before I can graduate (including the minimum 6 electives). My strategy for the past year has been taking 2 courses (1 core CS class and 1 general class) each semester along with an internship. However at that rate, I calculated I would finish somewhere in between 2026. I don't mind finishing past my expected graduation, but I also want to get out of school asap. 

My new plan was to take 3 courses (2 core CS classes and 1 general class) in the spring/fall semester and 2 courses (1 core Class and 1 general class) in the summer along with an internship all year. The thing I am afraid of is taking too many hard classes in a semester and having to drop a class in order to maintain my other classes and internship, thus wasting money on that class. So, I want to create different class combinations with balanced difficulty, but I am unsure about how to do that. 

Every time I have seen an advisor, they just recommend me whatever my Pegasus Pathway says, and it just gives full-time schooling options. And, the computer science advisor I was assigned after the FE does not know anything about the CS courses (which makes me question what's the point of having one). Does anyone have a strategy for choosing classes for a semester that they know will not be very difficult? Maybe there is a feature in Pegasus Pathway made for this issue that I do not know about?

Thanks for taking the time to read this and appreciate any advice."
11zx6zg,1,2023-03-23,Extra Criminal Justice Major or Minor? (given current degree track),FloridaMan314,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11zx6zg/extra_criminal_justice_major_or_minor_given/,"I'm currently pursuing a BA, in Political Science and Minor in Law at The George Washington University (D.C.). I'm wrapping up my second year in May 2023. With this combo, I am currently on track to graduate in May 2024, in 3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need genuinely important advice. Do I add an extra Major or Minor in Criminal Justice? 

&amp;#x200B;

For context: I'm pretty solidly unhappy at my school. People are very competitive, toxic, DC is expensive, I'm not really happy with my degree, the weather is erratic and cold, and my friends are there for me...but the toxic culture still pervades. Will concede that the Professors are great + internship/work opportunities are solid (if you manage to snag them given all the competition and bureaucracy). It's D.C. This is a government-centric city, so many students and residents are narcissistic asshole. They come, work their gov't contract, and leave after a few months or years. It's very transient, little community or school spirit (which I value). It's great for some...just not for me, although when I first arrived, I thought differently. Living here has changed my perspective. My degree has lots of bullshit reading, dry theory, stuff I'll probably never use. I LIKE the concepts per se, but not the way it's taught. So serious depression going on, but I'm alive, attending all classes, getting A's/B's. I am surviving and can continue to survive, but unhappily. Gained weight too. My Mom doesn't seem to understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see an added Major as perhaps useful if I don't want to go to law school, but I'm not sure the added Major is even worth the extra cost (mentally, financially, time wise, etc). However, for job prospects, it probably looks better than a Minor...

&amp;#x200B;

I see an added Minor as useful if I DO go to law school, but law school is not set in stone now...and I'm leaning towards not going. Plus, (unlike Majors), Minors don't show on my diploma at GW. I can, however, flex the Minor on a transcript or Resume. This route would be more cost and time effective, but not look as good.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind I could theoretically add the Major and graduate in 3 years. This, however, would require 4 summer courses spread over 10ish weeks at a cost of $18k-20k. I would save money overall, though, as I wouldn't have to pay for a Fall 2024 Semester (3.5 years) which costs $30k to $40k. I would sacrifice my summer, a good amount of cash, and part of my mental health, regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

**A lot of this boils down to the following question: will the Major provide enough of a future/career boost for me to justify sacrificing my money, mental health, and time towards it?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Major**

*PROS:*

\- Looks somewhat better on the Resume

\- Have extra padding in case I don't go to law school (more to show for myself) 

\- Classes seem genuinely interesting

\- Would make my Mom happy because she's pushing me to do it, and I see why (wants me to take advantage of every opportunity), she basically threatened me if I didn't but she's most likely bluffing

*CONS:* 

\- More time in this hellhole, I would graduate in 3.5 yrs and not 3 yrs (I could prob suck it up) OR need to take summer courses 

\- Doesn't give me an extra Bachelor's, just an extra major. So, my diploma reads ""1 BA, Political Science &amp; Criminal Justice"" and not ""1 BA, Political Science + 1 BA, Criminal Justice""

\- Would cost anywhere from $18k to $30k/40k

\- Requires 9 extra classes, instead of 3 extra classes

\- Requires Internship off campus, which can be pain in the ass to get (although if I pull strings I can avoid this requirement by taking 1 extra elective instead, but pulling strings is not a guarantee to work)

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Minor**

*PROS:*

\- Still looks good on the Resume

\- Super easy to add on, only 3 extra classes

\- Interesting material still

\- No Internship requirement 

\- Graduation in 3 yrs for certain, not 3.5 yrs

*CONS:* 

\- Does not look as good as Major...it's just a Minor after all, and ppl tend to care less 

\- Would it really give me extra career boost? Eh...

\- Can be seen as ""cutting corners"" or taking the easy way out 

\- Would seriously piss off my Mom ALTHOUGH she can get over it (and will get over it)"

Greetings, Reddit community,

As a Mechanical Engineer with experience in software development, I have been working as a process engineer for the past four years. I have completed two boot camps, one in Data Analytics and the other in Web Development. Although both programs were informative, my love for web development has inspired me to continue coding full-stack websites to improve my skills further.

My biggest challenge is getting into Computer Science (CS) schools with a low GPA. While my GPA of 2.6 may not meet the typical requirements, I have two valid reasons for this.

&amp;#x200B;

1. During college, my friends and I developed a web application from scratch. We ran a Mechanical Engineering organization called ASME. It took a lot of work for us to promote our events and activities. So we built a software solution called WeWe. After two years of development, the school adopted it, and the Residental Assitance staff used it daily. We even met the AOL founder, Steve Case, to pitch him the idea.
2. I am an international student. During my senior year, I got an internship. As an international student, you must accept a job offer and become the best at it; if you don't get a job after graduation, you must leave the country.

 Currently, I need help to get into CS graduate school. I know that if I keep applying, eventually, I will get somewhere. Has anyone passed through this experience? Thank you for your time. :)"

I love both of these projects. I love coding, and I really want to make this career work, but ever since I started this internship I have been getting burned out so quickly. I'll get home and be able to focus for maybe an hour or 2 before my brain just feels fogged up if that makes sense.

My question is, does it make a difference in terms of securing FAANG internships + job after graduation based on the school you go to?

If CS majors could give me any advice, I'd really appreciate it."

I’m finishing up a 1 year long internship at a healthcare startup as part of my masters program (300+ employees) and it’s been going well! CEO stated he wants me to stay on which is great. I’ve been working for one of the C suite members and really like his department and I’ve expressed my interest to stay. We had a brief conversation around salary, what I’m doing good on and what I need to improve on as well. He also spoke about my graduation and I did express my interest in continuing on with the company and he said “that gives me a better idea” 


CEO gave him until end of March to make a decision on if he wants to keep me. He has mentioned to other people in his department I’m doing good. But idk, just the uncertainty is really killing me on if he wants to keep me or not. I’ll be pretty down if he doesn’t want me to stay.

My first offer is from some ed-tech company where I would basically teach kids about coding. I get paid about 17/hr and would work about 40 hours a week. This would amount to around 5800-ish (not including tax). The cons of this internship is that its like an hour away from my house bc I have to drive and take the metro (M-F) 8AM to 5PM.

My second offer is an undergraduate research opportunity from the university where I would get to research with a professor and work on software engineering projects. I get a 3000 scholarship and its on campus so I get free housing and meal plan. The cons of this is that its less money ofc.

Which offer do you guys think is better? Which one would make it easier for me to get more internships? Im currently leaning towards the second one."
1203jyo,79,2023-03-23,Had an odd conversation with a professor,Ox-Moi,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1203jyo/had_an_odd_conversation_with_a_professor/,"I was in my Chem lab class, professor finished up with the pre-lab lecture and we were sent to go upstairs to the actual lab. I take the elevator, everyone else takes the stairs and prof usually goes towards a different stairwell. 
Today he followed me into the elevator, and once the doors shut the convo went roughly like this

Him: do you have a scholarship, or are part of a summer internship or something? 

Me: No, I don't have anything like that. 

Him: Hmm. I thought that I heard somebody mention you and that you do. Are you from around here? Like live in ___ or ___ town? 

Me: Yeah, I live in ____. I'm pretty far from a scholarship. Im a returning student, when I was 18 I was a graphic design major and left with a 1.39gpa. I'm 23 now and this is my first semester back. 

Him: Ohh, okay. So you're a returning student? 

Me: Yeah. 

Get to lab door. 

Him: and you're an ACS chemistry major right? 
Me: Yeah, I am

Get into lab, he goes up to the front and I start to head to my station. 

Him: okay. I'm going to have to make some phone calls. 

I looked back at him but he didn't look at me and said nothing else. My lab is super late in the evening and the convo was a little odd so I didn't think to ask what he meant? 

I don't know if ""I'm going to have to make some phone calls."" means that there is a mix up somewhere with an internship or scholarship he needs to fix. Or if he's going to be trying to talk to people about getting me one??? 

For reference, I'm top of the class with an almost 100%. I participate in class, I speak with him here and there after class and he knows me by my name and face well enough to remember how I did on our first exam during a conversation. He even chatted with me and vented a little bit about the kinds of answers people give, which I believe means he knows I know the material well enough to have a convo like that.(he didn't say names or anything so wasn't really being sh*tty imo) 

If it wasn't for all of that, I obviously wouldn't even be pondering the latter possibility. I wouldn't of thought twice about the conversation either if it wasn't for that ""make some phone calls"" ending. 

I'm just gonna let it be, if something happens it happens but it was just so odd. I feel like purposefully bringing it up would be weird especially because 1) it could be nothing and 2) he didn't really suggest what he meant at all, just a random comment.





Edit to add: so this may be slightly relevant but also just wanted to share what just happened because I'm pretty excited about it. 

He hadn't returned the last 4 lab reports yet(think he's overwhelmed with grading lol). Last night he mentioned they were done, but he forgot them so he was going to bring them into the Chem class, not lab for us today(they split the class into 3 lab sections). I guess he forgot he had them and no one else from my lab mentioned but I asked him about them. 

He gave me 3 of them, and then flipped through the fourth stack. He said ""I want to keep this one for now, if that's okay? I want to photo copy it because the work is excellent."" he showed me the grade and HE GAVE ME 54/50!!! 

Why is that exciting??!!? BECAUSE this man was VERY CLEAR at the beginning of the semester that he does not give extra credit for *anything*, in the Chem class and lab.

He also doesn't typically only take off 1/2 pts. He will usually take a whole point or mark the entire question wrong but on my other lab reports he only took off 1/2 pts on some of my mistakes. I got 49/50 on each of the others. They were all silly mistakes, which is why I really wanted them back so I could see if there was anything minor I was doing incorrectly and needed to adjust. So my lab grade is *slightly* lower than my class grade but I imagine I'll still have a high A, especially now that I can see my little errors and fix my work going forward."

I have a very wide range of interests, such as chemistry, biology, math, space, and physics (not 100% sure because I find AP Physics 1 kinda boring, but I don't know if that's the teacher, the material being boring \[some have said alg physics is uninteresting, idk\] , or that I just don't love physics. Anyways, I digress). If I'm being honest, I haven't done my due diligence on careers yet, but I'm looking at maybe astrophysics, engineering (idk the specific field), or chem/biochem.

Now this brings me to my dilemma. An opportunity for a eng internship has opened up near me, and I don't know if I should do it or not. It is in a specific field of eng that I don't think I'll get into, but I've been told that any eng internship will look great on a resume and provide a good experience (feel free to comment on that). Also, my area is pretty opportunity dry for these kinds of things, so its a little rare. The problem is, I have no clue if I am going into eng. I have kinda found myself leaning slightly more towards theoretical sciences (like discovering stuff), but idk about the job opportunities there/if it is practical to spend my time pursuing that. I wouldn't want to waste my time doing an eng internship if I don't go into eng, because 1) I think it might look bad if I go into an eng internship, spend my junior year summer doing it, and not pursue it (not demonstrating my passion????) and 2) I might be able to do research at a nearby college by begging a professor to let me on (this is a maybe if they'll let me, but I'm not talking out of my a\*\* bc people at my school have done/do it). Any advice would be appreciated on what I should do.

This was long, but really, thank you if you read all of this. Constructive insight would be phenomenal!!!!!! Let me know of any clarifying questions.

Edit: also, the app deadline is coming up pretty soon, so I won't be able to take time and explore if I love eng. I have explored a little, but not enough"

I want to work in tech, I genuinely love building things and writing code. But I'm starting to think it's all hopeless because I don't have any internships.

I have been applying to internships this summer, but haven't heard anything back at all (not even an interview). Since my degree was only 2 years I'll be graduating soon. So I should probably be thinking about applying to new-grad positions as well.

I know tech is a popular career, so there are lots of people wanting to break into it. So I appreciate the importance of networking, projects and open source contributions. I'm fine with all that stuff, because it's things that I can do.

My problem is whenever I try to do that stuff, I get kind of bummed out because it just seems hopeless. I can't shake the feeling that my resume will go straight to the trash because I lack internships/experience. Which is the one thing that I can't get on my own. Thus even doing projects seems like a waste of time and it's killing my motivation.

Is having no internships and instant rejection? Are you someone who recently got hired without internships, or hired someone without them?  


Myself, and I think a lot of people in my situation too, would really appreciate people's thoughts on the matter?"

My 3rd internship my mentor absolutely hated me as well and she would talk badly about me and laugh with other colleagues.

My first job out of university, my boss grew to hate me. He would put me down in meetings and triangulate with other colleagues to get them against me. From there I started making more mistakes and eventually they let my contract expire with the company.

My recent job, I had a very good relationship with my team and at every one-on-one my boss would be telling me I was doing a good job. So I was blindsided at the layoff notice.

(My qualifications _ student class 12)
So i am in this dilemma regarding which college should i go to.
I got 94.8 percentile in mains only because maths saved it for me (99.8). But this isn't a good score as i want a computer based program only. Now i am from haryana and there isn't any good state based college that i could go to.
During my research i came across srm,vit,manipal, etc. but i don't want to burden my family with that much amount of fees and the return on investment from these colleges isn't worth it imo.
I also came to know about cic du and i am fascinated by its curriculum and 4 internships and also minimal fees. I think i can ace the cuet test as i am only good with numbers and only maths is in the domain subject. Also its programme it and mathematical innovation sounds perfect for me. I live really close to delhi so can also stay home and pursue my other hobbies.
The only main con of cic i came across is the lack of a placement cell but i guess college placements are kinda overrated and if i have the skills i can crack a good job anywhere applying offcampus too. Also they ask you to take up 4 internships and i might be lucky enough to get a ppo.
But this all what i collected about cic and i am sure that it isn't as rosy as it sounds. Would you all recommend cic to a junior or i should take a drop and focus on a top nit?
Also placements isn't my only goal for college and i might consider an opportunity to do masters too.  So should i start focusing on maths and give my all towards cuet or should i consider taking a drop a start preparing for a top nit?
Any input would be appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I have a latin honor from a premier university but I don't think it is significant enough. Mas useful pa siguro kung nag internship nalang ako at dun nalang nag focus. Medyo sinisisi ko rin sarili ko na late ko na na realize na mas importante pala yung experiences kaysa sa acads. Like nung nag-aaral ako akala ko talaga yun (acads) yung dapt i-focus, yung mag perform lang ako well sa acads okay na. Pero hindi. Ewan, sana nakita ko na rin 'tong sub na 'to dati pa.

I'm currently working in a role as a Data Engineer, I have already 1 year of experience at the same company.

The thing is, I'm still working as an intern, began as an intern for 5 months since I'm still finishing my degree (expected 2024) in Computer Engineering. And after finishing that, I got another internship in the same project and same team until June.

I mean, anything is better than nothing, right? But recently like 2 weeks ago had already 2 interviews with different companies, they offered me full-time job and really flexible with me finishing my degree, both 100% remote and not by time but by finishing my tasks every week so I wouldn't have any problem studying my subjects and taking exams.

Still waiting for a final call, but even though maybe they'll not call me again, I feel a little taken advantage of at my current company, because I didn't get any offer at the moment. 

I can get that it's because I'm still studying but:

- The things I work with, mostly Pyspark and Azure tech, I've learnt them at the job and through courses 
- I don't find the appeal in having on my CV in the future that I've been an intern until I finish my degree which will be putting it at more than 2 years of internship
- I'm in my late 20's so I'm not really a kid and I'm looking to upper my technical knowledge and well, get a better pay since I'm perfectly capable of learning fast. So I find it a bit odd to use with me just the degree reason.
- With one year of experience even though it's an internship, I think I could fit a lot of Data Engineering roles right now. There are a lot of students that have full-time dev jobs out there.


Currently I was looking at sites like ai-jobs.net and lurking through LinkedIn. I could ask past recruiters that offered me interviews in the past too. I was looking mostly for remote jobs or hybrid with the lesser office days. So, I could use that commute time every day to keep up with my studies, and be updated so I won't need to hyperstudy a subject within a week.

And now that it has been some weeks that the project is not advancing much, I'm not doing that much, and that doesn't help honestly, it feels a bit unfulfilling.

Maybe I'm exaggerating? I don't know, but at this stage in my life I would like to finish my degree and be able to help my family if needed, have my own car and in general to be able to travel a bit since I can't do that much now with what I'm being paid because I'm saving up mostly. I want to be a functional adult.

Anyone been through something similar? I've even heard of people being in an internship for 3 years and that it's crazy!

From Europe obviously, I wouldn't find much help asking the US subreddit.

Thank you in advance!"

Supplements: they're fine? can't really judge. My teachers liked them a lot and I spent an unholy number of sleepless nights on them.

**LOR**: 

US Uni Professor: I've worked with him in my robotics independent research. Dude appeared to be really impressed by my work, prolly like a 9/10

Summer program Professor: Unironically told me (in private) im her favorite student ever from the program, but the work i did wasnt THAT impressive imo, so prolly 8/10

Applied to about 40 colleges.  Admitted about 25... most rejects from UC and T10s. Scholarship from about 10 mid colleges.

Final choice is between RUTGERS and UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO . 

Proximity to companies weighed a lot. 
COA is almost the same after Scholarship and aid.
Both have fairly modern curriculum
Both offer almost direct admissions to MS
Both in urban setting 

RUTGERS
Higher USNews rank 50s vs 100
Higher brand value
Highly competitive 
Good alumni network 

UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO 
Small class rooms - avg size 25 vs 100
Close teacher monitoring even during internships 
Jesuit environment - or lack of Greek culture

Help me choose... please"

My question is what does it even mean to go to a good engineering school compared to one not as good? I feel like the rankings are so arbitrary and made up sometimes I would like more concrete info from those that have gone to both types of schools. 

Is it access to better professors, projects, or internships? Access to a stronger alumni network? 

Looking forward to hearing what you guys have to say!"

Stipend is only $1k a month, but Austin housing is def cheaper than Cupertino, so it may make more sense. Another thought was sociability with other interns would be easier, but would like to avoid sharing a bedroom for the summer (corp housing is 2b2b with 4 ppl).

Does anyone have experience subleasing in Austin/lived in Austin for a summer internship? Or any thoughts on corp housing vs stipend in your own experience? Thanks!"

I have submitted \~100 applications before this without much success (passed one resume screen). Important to note that most of these applications were with a much weaker resume and submitted later than the job posting. One question I have in particular surrounds my ""Clubs"" section. Should I replace that space with a ""Relevant Coursework"" or ""Technical Skills"" section? I tried my best to implicitly express my technical skills.

Hoping to get any feedback possible before applications start opening for summer 2024. I will be striving to land a NY or California position in tech. I really appreciate any help, thank you!

The company I was supposed to intern with this upcoming summer has recently told me that while all hiring for engineering is paused for the foreseeable future they would possibly be able to hire me in a Data Analyst role working with SQL.

Obviously it's better than nothing, but do I have to worry about pigeonholing myself by taking this offer? I see a lot of people on /r/cscareerquestions posting about getting pigeonholed into data related positions, but is this something I even need to worry about at an intern stage or should I just be grateful to have any tech related opportunity considering the job market?"

Between Mathematics of Computation major and Cog Sci major+ Stats minor combo, which one is better for data science internships? Or are both relatively the same? The main reason I am adamant about math of comp is because I still want to have an enjoyable college time and I think CogSci/Stats combo would be better for me in terms of that, but I am worried that cogsci/stats may not be as good for finding internships. 

Just as a note, for the cogsci major, I will be taking mostly CS upperdivs. the main difference between the two options is that I will be taking more Math courses of MoC major and more Psych courses for Cogsci/stats minor combo, but for both I'll still be taking the necessary stats/CS courses needed.  I'm also talking to career advising services at ucla but wanted to ask here. 

Anyone doing cog sci in the tech/data science industry have any insight to this?"

The company has asked me what my desired salary is, and although I don't mind taking the \~50% pay cut (as I know the cost of living is drastically different), I'd rather live at a somewhat similar standard of living.

Hi everyone,

I have admits from the MS Business Analytics programs at Duke, the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign (MS in Information Management), and the University of Maryland - College Park (MS in Information Systems). I'm hoping to connect with seniors who are pursuing or have completed these programs to gain insights and advice on some of my concerns.

I have a few questions that I would appreciate any insights or advice on:

1. How important is the ranking and prestige of the university when comparing different Business Analytics programs? I've noticed that Duke is ranked significantly higher in QS rankings compared to Maryland. Is it worth prioritizing the ranking of the university over other factors?
2. How does the length of the program impact learning and employment opportunities? The program at Duke is only 10 months, while the programs at UIUC and UMD are 1.5 years. Does the length of the program make a significant difference in learning outcomes and job prospects?
3. How relevant are internships during the program? I've noticed that Duke doesn't have an internship included during its course. Would it be challenging to find full-time opportunities without any US work experience or internships during the program?
I would really appreciate any insights or advice you can provide on these topics. Thanks in advance for your help!"

I didn't get into any colleges except for a few but I couldn't afford to go ( applied to US during Covid-19). Tried again. Some luck. Got a few good acceptances with some merit scholarships but still wasn't enough for full 4 years. Tried again for a 3rd time. No luck. Put a lot of money (my high-school asks for a very hefty fee which is high key illegal everytime you want your transcripts to be officially sent to universities) and work into my applications but still no luck. I can't do computers science in my home country since you need to have a math in a levels plus other entry exams for which I was too burned out to do and my country's education system is...lacking to say the least.

Reluctantly decided to do an online degree at University of London (Coursera). Just got done with first semester and got a first (which is like A and above in UK). I applied to internships (didn't get in to many of them and still waiting on the last remaining one). I also applied to University of Florida online and just heard back today after obsessively checking my portal every day. REJECTED.

I have to now pay the fee for the second semester which is starting in April if I want to continue with my education at University of London. I really don't care for it tbh. I find no joy in doing my courses online and the love I had for computer science is mostly gone because of all of this. 

I am told by my family to stick it out and maybe apply for a summer abroad at UCL or any other university (all out of pocket). Or I could visit my sibling in the US this Summer. 

Feeling stuck and lost in life. Any passion or interest i had in CS has gone. I am now wondering if CS or University is for me. I don't know what should I do now. Reapply again for bachelor's? Transfer? But I think most good universities don't accept credits online universities even if it is recognized and accredited institution. 

I had a lot of dreams and ambitions and life goals mapped out since I was like 13 and they have all gone poof. Every morsel of hope has been squeezed out of my body. I am depressed and I sleep in a lot. My potential is wasted. I so wanted to be independent and free and on my feet but I rarely ever leave the four walls of my bedroom at my parents house.. I highly feel like i failed my parents and teachers and feel like a joke in my sad pitiful situation. I am so not looking forward to the next semester of school or this year in fact. I just want the earth to swallow me."

My father works at this company, and has been involved with the management and some of the field service staff for longer than I have been alive. It is a relatively laid back workplace, I like my coworkers, and I love how close it is to my apartment. I can either drive 4 miles (roughly 6km), or take a bike path on a 30 minute ride in to work. 

I started off here working as a part time, 24hr/week intern with no experience, relevant degree, or certificates, making $15/hr, then to full time at the start of last year and have also been given decent raises each year. My work initially consisted of being in an IT Help Desk role, but has expanded as I have worked here to more complex roles, now managing the network and SaS email and web hosting solution, doing Web Design via WordPress and with some PHP/CSS coding, still being the only help desk guy, being a sysadmin who works on our 5 servers ( 2 Quickbooks servers, 1 Active Directory server, and 2 NAS computers. ), and looking to get into cybersecurity for meeting NIST/CMMC requirements.

I strongly feel as though the management don't allow me to actually move forward with solving a good portion of our issues due to a lack of resources, and a lack of knowledge as to what is important. I also am not given any assistance by basically anybody except my father, whom often is busy working on other things, or by our software programmer, who works in an entirely different vein of coding than me.

I am not certified in anything yet, though I am interested in acquiring some certificates. My interests lie mainly with Help Desk, System Administration for servers, client endpoints, and networking equipment. I am also interested in, though to a much less degree, web design and cybersecurity. I have found web design to be a consistently egregious, though rewarding once sections of projects finished, and I have found cybersecurity to be very interesting, though not something I would actually want to do, as I would rather make cool things like servers work and do cool stuff in the first place than keep them secure. 

Frankly, I should be getting nearly twice what I am now, a bit under $19/hr after 2 years, and the workload being given to me. I figure that it may be more difficult for me to negotiate higher pay due to my lack of certifications, and the overall quality of my work being done not being as high as a certified person's would be, though I do put a great deal of effort into my job, and I now have miles and miles more real world experience and knowledge than I started with.

**That brings me to these questions;**   
**1.)** How do I negotiate for more pay in my position?   
**2.)** What title(s) would be the most appropriate for what I am currently doing?   
**3.)** I love what I do, but I find the progress that I make to be very slow, and I feel like I am nearing the limit of what I can learn without backing from a better company. Do I keep the close, easy job, and work on certificates and challenging projects on the side, or should I leave for something more challenging, better paying, and faster paced? 

Thank you if you read through my essay. &lt;3"

**Letters of Recommendation (FERPA exists so I'm guessing)**

Government teacher- 7/10. Wasn't worried about this one until I received four rejections this week. Doesn't know me super well, but assumed she'd write an okay letter. Not sure anymore.

English teacher - 9/10. I know she wrote some unique things about me, and she is a FANTASTIC writer, so I really trust that she wrote it well

School FBLA advisor - 9/10. The teacher I'm closest to, knows me extremely well and is aware of everything I've done for the club and on the state level.

Counselor- 7/10. Wrote my nomination letter for a service award (which I did get), so I heard a blurb of what he wrote about me, and it sounded pretty good; it should be pretty standard, but nothing that could've hurt me

**Interviews**

UPenn- 8/10, interviewer was sweet and I felt like I said everything I could've, but I did screw up one question which could've been important (How do you find a balance between your academic and social life, super important to Penn culture)- freaked out and gave a super generic answer

Georgetown- 6/10, had internet connections on my end, so we had to move to a phone call. The conversation just didn't flow as well as I wanted it to, and Georgetown is one of my dream schools, so I'm really upset

Harvard- 8/10, interview was standard, was actually pretty disappointed in my interviewer- didn't ask any interesting questions and guided my interview in a very boring way. She was super sweet though, just didn't feel like I did the best I could've

Princeton- 12/10, absolutely perfect. My interviewer was older, but I felt super calm throughout the whole thing and was very happy with how I handled all the answers. He told me he's rooting for me to get admission, knows I'll have a lot of options (lol he was wrong!) and hopes that I'll choose Princeton out of all of them :) 

Cornell- 6/10, not evaluative, interviewer was older and barely knew anything about the school now, so didn't get me excited or anything

Northwestern- 9/10, interviewer was the absolute best, would even tell me what he'd write on my report as I spoke, very casual conversation and felt very good about it

**Decisions (a little disappointed at this point):**

*Acceptances:*

* IU Kelley
* UIUC
* UW Madison
* Boston College
* UMichigan (out of state- LSA, unfortunately didn't have time for Ross to meet the EA deadline)

*Waitlists:*

* Vanderbilt (first waitlist!!)
* Princeton
* UPenn Wharton

*Rejections:*

* USC
* WashU Olin
* Northwestern
* Yale (REA)
* Northeastern
* Columbia
* Harvard
* Cornell Dyson
* Georgetown SFS

*Waiting on:*
* Duke

At this point, I'm completely done and have lost any kind of hope I could've had of getting a T20. USC came as a massive shock, especially considering I'm a National Merit Finalist. Same with WashU, I did the video portfolio and everything, and it didn't work out. Extremely disappointed and feel like everything I've done was for nothing. I'm still in complete shock and genuinely don't think I can go back to school after spring break.

UPDATE: yeah hope is still down the drain. But I've definitely come to terms with my options and really love Michigan and BC. Still a bit upset after this app season though, and I think a small part of me always will be."

Started writing my essay the day after junior year ended and had a USC admissions officer review and help me edit my essay. I wrote about Demna Gvasalia (Balenciaga's creative director) and Kanye being an inspiration of mine before the pedo controversry and his antisemitism scandal and in hindsight regret it hugely. I talked about my passion for implementing CS to the fashion industry to reduce pollution and my interactions with underrepresented minorities through fashion as a medium for art.

**Additional Information:**

In hindsight I shouldn't have talked about Demna Gvasalia, Playboi Carti, and Kanye being an inspiration of mine in my essays (if you guys want to read it dm me lol) and I should have applied to more safety schools and oos private schools like Purdue instead of blindly believing that my stats and ec would for sure land me a spot in UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara. At the end of the day getting rejected by colleges I thought I would get into doesn't matter since what's more important is how well I perform at my college. Imma internalize Carti's philosophy of being a rockstar and not giving a shit cus he didn't go to college and is highly successful. Right now I don't know which school to attend and if I even want to attend any of them. Kinda salty that someone I know who is antisemitic, racist, sexist, and uses the n word in dms got accepted to UCLA. How competitive am I realistically with my stats? What are some schools I had a fair chance in my list?"

3. UFL’s is better ranked as well for Computer Science.

I will be finishing my btech in CS in 2023 July. I have had mental health issues for past 8 years and it was only in the past year that I opened about it to my parents and took medical help for it. I was originally diagonesed with severe depression and anxiety but have recently been diagonosed with adhd (inattentive type) which was the main reason for my depression and anxiety for so many years. Over the years, I have become a person with extreme low self esteem, confidence in self and lack of commitment towards any serious steps to improve my life . I am academically above average but somehow give off the vibe that I have got things together academically. I have found a lot of relief in finding out the symptoms of adhd that point out to the daily difficulties I faced while growing up and blamed myself for being lazy etc.

He loves making fun of everything &amp; everyone, he is absolutely never in the wrong and he always knows best. He even stated on multiple occasions certain people are just beneath him.

He even gets into debates with the college professors who have been doing their jobs longer then he has been alive!

On top of that, he loves dishing out random attacks or snide remarks towards me or others as well. For example, yesterday he randomly felt like telling me “he’s surprised I’m still in this course, as I expected you to drop out by this point”.

Last but not least, he’s extremely proud and full of himself. He “started from the bottom” and has now made it (according to himself) because his current internship employer wants him to come work for him after he’s finished with school. I’m also in a group project with him and he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to finish an assignment this Monday, that’s due for April 14th because “he wants to get it finished asap”.

So how do I deal with this? Discussing this will have no use, as this will result in an endless loop on him trying to convince others why he’s right and why you are wrong.

Advice will be much appreciated!"

1. “Bonus if have a driver’s license” granted this was a swe internship, for a self driving car company. I guess it might be bad if I don’t have a license and I start programming how the cars will work XD

2. “Need 8 years of programming experience”
Even after adding up my poly years I can’t match up, should have started from the womb, was too late for the race😩

3. “Please put other projects besides Duke or Orbital”
Who is putting Duke in their resume?? (For non-CS students, Duke is this simple chatbot project from one of our core mods)


Edit:
Just thought to share another ridiculous requirement, or requirementsssss

“Experienced in xxxx, and xxxx, and also xxxx, and xxx amt of programming, languages, know xxx and also know xxx etc”

Like bruh who right out the gate as a student know this many skills. What kind of god intern is that?? 

If I know this many skill I might as well be starting my own company already or joining as a senior software engineer &gt;:("
121jtnr,4,2023-03-25,UMass Amherst vs NYU Tandon for MS in CS,Uni-Confusion2023,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/121jtnr/umass_amherst_vs_nyu_tandon_for_ms_in_cs/,"I have received admits from UMass Amherst and NYU Tandon for MS in CS, and I'm facing a difficult decision in choosing between the two.

My primary interest lies in the field of AI within CS, and my ultimate career goal is to work as an AI engineer or SDE after graduation. While I'm not particularly focused on research, I'm open to available research opportunities.

From what I’ve checked so far,

1. I have heard that UMass Amherst has an excellent reputation for its CS (AI) department and research, but when I went through UMass’ curriculum, I found the courses more research-oriented and rigorous than NYU’s. As much as I would want to learn and explore more about CS (AI), I’m also keen on devoting more time to upskilling myself and preparing for internships and jobs. I’m skeptical whether UMass’ rigorous curriculum will allow me to do this. 

2. Both universities have similar tuition fees. While the living costs at NYU are higher, the on-campus opportunities, such as TA or RA positions, may offset the difference in living expenses.

I would appreciate your honest opinions regarding UMass and NYU for MS CS, especially considering factors such as course/curriculum (flexibility), job prospects, funding sources (on-campus opportunities), brand/reputation, location, batch size, alumni network, support and facilities.  


PS -  Your reasoning for the vote in the comment section would greatly help me take the final call.

Got admits from Rice University &amp; Indiana University Bloomington

Pros for Rice:

* Great campus
* Great Computer science department
* Better alumni network? (maybe)

Cons for Rice:

* Too expensive ($54000 for one-year tuition) so it will take longer to pay off the loan

Pros for IUB:

* Way Cheaper than Rice
* Larger Alumni network (because of more people)

Cons for IUB:

* The location is Bloomington, so it will be harder to get jobs &amp; internships in tech

If you have anything to add please tell me."

All tutorials reccommend the plugin so i try to use it, but it seems super unreliable to me.

For example, im doing the TicTacToe tutorial on the official webpage right now with codesandbox ([https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)), which has the tools preinstalled. Click a tile, state updates with an ""X"".   
But as you can see in my GIF below, it often doesnt load anything until you click around.   
Even then, the state is often straight up wrong. The X tile is updated, but as i click the others, it shows the same even though they are null? If i cant trust it, then i dont know how its useful.

[https://s2.gifyu.com/images/msedge\_PtaOwZzrJt.gif](https://s2.gifyu.com/images/msedge_PtaOwZzrJt.gif)

I am also an intern atm. The company uses React for their webapp, and very often when i open the React Developer Tools, it will give me an error ""We cannot find React on this page"". It doesnt matter that it was working fine 10 seconds ago, suddenly there is no trace of React apparently, and i have to click around hoping it fixes itself, or reload the entire page and login again.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience with it has been pretty bad. I thought others might have issues with it, but when i Google it, i find very little about it."

I sometimes don't know what is my worth or am I going in right direction by doing what I am doing. I first learnt basic HTML, CSS, JS, and then learnt Reactjs, nodejs, mongodb, CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, created several projects and then learnt about basic git, deployment, hosting of website. But sometimes I doubt that if I am creating right kind of projects or not.

**Interviews**

n/a

**Essays**

CommonApp (7.5/10): spent a lot of time on my personal statement, talked about my favorite game and connected it with my upbringing in the military and how it taught me to look at my life through a more dynamic lens. Struggled a bit writing it but I think it was decent, not excellent tho)

UIUC, UMass, &amp; Purdue (5.5/10): struggled hard writing short 100 word supplementals :/ but I tried to tie my crochet background to computer science and how I use it as creative fuel

UMich, Georgia Tech, UW-Madison (7/10): tried my best to research schools thoroughly and use it in the Why-Us essays. I think they were okay, but tying what I liked most about the schools back to myself was hard to do and felt quite stiff

*Acceptances:*

* UW-Seattle (got into pre-sciences RD, rejected from CS 😭 this one hurt the most ngl)

*Rejections:*

**Additional Information:**

So glad this process is over! Went about as good as I could expect, especially as a CS major. I'll probably be committing to UMich in the fall as my COA there is one of my cheapest :)

Though I wished some decisions turned out differently (looking at you UW), overall I'm just glad I got this stressful process out of the way. Good luck to everybody who is still receiving decisions! I hope you all get into your dream schools :D"

121szmk,0,2023-03-25,What is wrong with myself and what am I doing wrong?,thatsawce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/121szmk/what_is_wrong_with_myself_and_what_am_i_doing/,"Ill start off by saying that the field I'm looking to apply to is something in data science or a database developer. I'm currently in uni with about a year an a half left to go. Prior to uni I was at a community college and I got an internship there to build a database for the IT departments grades. I worked with about 5 other students and a project manager. I was excited to receive an opportunity like that because I was just not getting any call backs from anyone before the internship. If I had to give an estimate on the number of jobs I've applied to (including those before the internship, I'd say I'm somewhere around 200. That's been over the course of about 2 years - so 100 applications a year.

I'm done with the internship and now looking for a new job while I'm in school. I go to every job fair the uni has, and I've been applying to 3 jobs every other day, but still no luck. Outside of school I've been working on getting certified in different areas. Currently I have the AWS Cloud Practitioner Cert, and I am currently studying my Project Management and Agile Cert.

So please, any feedback on my resume would be great, thanks!"

121vbs9,1,2023-03-25,I feel like im behind,Adventurous-Weeb3007,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/121vbs9/i_feel_like_im_behind/," I'm a first year mechanical engineering major and I just feel so behind on everything compared to my peers. So for context, I had a bad work ethic during the fall and went out with my non engineering friends way too much. Because of that my GPA fell to a 2.0 and I am currently on academic probation. Right now I'm doing way better in class, having all A's and hopefully I'll be able to keep it like that til the end of the semester. I also failed chem 1 last semester and didn't take chem 2 this semester so I'll be taking both of those classes over the summer. All in all, I'm pretty confident that I'll be off probation as long as I keep working hard and once I retake chemistry, my GPA will bounce up to a 3.0+ before next fall. ( I verified this with a GPA calculator my advisor gave me). Now the only reason I'm making this reddit post is because, despite all my shortcomings and how far I've come since then, I still feel way behind compared to my peers. First of all, a bunch of people Ik in engineering have GPA's in the 3.5+ and for me I think I can call myself lucky if I manage to graduate with a 3.5 Secondly, A bunch of people I know are doing ARESTY summer sciences for research, trying to get an internship/summer job, or are taking summer classes to get ahead. And then there's me whos taking classes to be all caught up. Finally, a bunch of my peers are in clubs and already have positions as team leads and such and meanwhile I'm in only 2 clubs that I sometimes go to and I'm just a member. Idk, I just feel like everyone else is doing so much better than me and I'll always be behind somehow. I remember thinking I was gonna get an internship and study abroad and do all sorts of cool things while in college, but now I studying every day just to try to keep myself from getting dismissed. Idk man, am i going crazy or are my concerns valid. Any advice is helpful :)"

I’m currently a junior/ starting my senior year next semester in computer science. Once I pass data structures (this semester my university wants us to declare a minor since the classes correlate). I’m indecisive and can’t decide on either Ai or cybersecurity. 

I have no working experience with either and I’m basing this off of what I’ve been able to read and understand. AI, is extremely interesting as I find autonomous driving something I’d definitely like to work on, AI rendering used in gpu aspects are also another aspect I was interested in.

Regarding cybersecurity I feel like it’s definitely the safer route as a lot of companies use and are currently looking for workers in these fields. 

Overall I can’t tell if either will have an impact on my major and would my minor ever be able to be used for future job/ internship opportunities? Another aspect I forgot to mention is that I’m going to be moving, so I’ll likely be finishing my degree online. Although afaik most of this can be learned and done at home. 

Please let me know your thoughts thanks you!

Edit thank you to everyone who responded, great information: regarding cybersecurity minor. Is it worth taking the classes? I never thought about not doing a minor overall. Not sure if I’d be missing out or not."

Common App Essay: Talked about the US's dependency on cars and how it affected me in my high school career by being limited with opportunities for competitions/etc. Actually, I was accepted into an internship for Macquarie Group last summer but wasn't able to do it because I had no ride to get downtown. In the end, it was edited by EMERGE, so it was good Good. 9/10

Letters of Recommendation: 

1. Physics Teacher: Read it through and talked about my learning in how to write amazing college labs. Have him again this year and is quite fond of my passions, but grammar felt off. 8/10
2. English Teacher: Great person, knows me very well and supports me in my passions. She also said that she would vote for me if I ever were to run for congress. Never read the letter because she works at a community college now working on her PHD, but it's definitely good.

Interviews: N/A

I'm a second-year college CS student who's interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I've heard a lot about the importance of certifications in this field and was wondering if anyone could recommend some good certifications for a beginner like me. I've heard a lot about CompTIA certs, but I'm not sure if they're the best place to start.

Additionally, I'm looking for advice on how to gain practical experience in cybersecurity while still in college. Are there any internships, projects, or other opportunities that you would recommend for someone just starting out?

I'm really excited about the field of cybersecurity and am eager to learn more. Any advice or recommendations that you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you all in advance."

I need to take some summer classes so I won’t be able to get any internship experience this summer, and I have no internship experience previously as I was doing something completely different. Would it be harder for me to find an entry-level job without any internship experience? Should I push my graduation date to Fall 2024 to maybe get an internship somewhere next summer?

I interned during my pre-junior summer and first half of junior year at a buy side firm as an investment analyst where i had lots of fun and where my peers and bosses loved me, but left because i had to go on an exchange semester. I did not get offered outright because i was still far from graduating but my boss told me that i had the door open and would love to train me from the ground up, seeing that i was their best intern in years, 

The conditions as an intern were great but idk about the conditions for a full analyst, although my peers come from great places and seem to live comfortably. Idk if it would hurt my chances at career advancement too as the office was relatively small and is considered an ""exit opportunity"".

I have the following options:

a) Come back and most probably start my career there

b) Wait for the programmes i am waiting for, with the risk of not getting anything

c) Slave away for a Big4 with garbage conditions (programs recently oppened)"

TL:DR; I am an early-career Mechanical Engineer. At what career stage or experience level can I leave out academic projects from my resume?
 ——————

For context, I graduated with an MS in late 2020 during COVID (~2.5 years ago). But I only got my first full-time job at the start of 2022.
 
I failed to get any internships during either my BS or MS (did my BS outside US, MS was in the US)
 
As expected, I had difficulty finding a full-time job right after MS, and my financial condition worsened. I had no choice but to take a lousy career path of working on two consecutive ME internships during the entire 2021 year. These internships were in well-known Silicon Valley startups (who were also accepting new grads as interns).
 
My internships helped me finally get a full-time job in 2022. But I honestly feel ashamed that I'm too behind in my career now. My job hunt after MS was also challenging due to COVID; companies weren't willing to hire me as I required future visa sponsorship.
 
I was recently laid off from this full-time job and am now back in the job market. Since last month, I have submitted &gt;200 applications and only got 5-6 interviews. I am confused if I'm structuring my resume correctly. At the moment, I am using 2 resumes for applying (let’s fall them Resume 1 and Resume 2):

Note: Sorry these resumes do not show any job duties. I have added hyphens to represent the content in my job duties. I’m actually working on uploading a full resume on r/engineeringresumes for better feedback. Hoping to do that shortly.
 
[Resume 1](https://imgur.com/a/uhrvaov)

This is the resume I have used since 2020, and it got me the 2 internships and my first full-time job. I've been using this resume since even after my layoff last month (of course, tailoring it to each specific job)

I'm still an early-career engineer, so I kept my grad thesis and college projects in my resume.
 
[Resume 2](https://imgur.com/a/32n7T2H)

A few days ago, I met with a certified career coach who reviewed my resume and revamped it with some key edits. Their service seems well-known, and they told me their system is equipped to create ATS-compliant resumes.
 
As you can see, they made some key edits to my resume:

- Changed font type to Calibri
- Added a ‘Mechanical Engineer’ title at the top
- Used square bullets
- Removed academic projects from resume

Initially, the updated resume looked impressive to me, but I’m now worried that it was a bad idea to remove my research projects. I discussed this concern with the coach, who told me that hiring managers mostly care if your background aligns with the job description. It seems a recruiter takes &lt;10 seconds to review each resume. According to him, I have enough work experience at this stage to leave out my projects. He suggested that recruiters will care little about projects. I’m not sure if this makes sense, since I barely have full-time experience.
 
The difficult thing about my resume is that my recent full-time job was a rotation program, so I find it hard to list all my rotations in my resume.

I have been using this new resume (Resume 2) to apply for jobs for the past week (&gt;60 applications). I have not received an interview request yet, so I’m concerned if I should just stick to my original resume (which got me few interviews)
 
Again, it's difficult to say much without looking at the complete resume content, so I'm sorry if posting a redacted version is inconvenient. I'll try to upload the full resume soon with the job duties.
 
Any input would be helpful. TIA."

How is a newly graduated student with the most   basic ass education that our country provides supposed to possibly  even  know and fit all of this knowledge into their brain.

Those app build request aren't even unique   they just seem to copy paste it from google as I have received almost   identical app request from different companies. How is someone supposed   to trust this and spend their time and energy building an entire app   with zero guarantee of every even getting the internship.

WHY THE FUCK DO I EVEN NEED TO BUILD AN ENTIRE APP FOR EVEN GETTING AN INTERNSHIP?

But   the most evil off them all is the ones who call to give me an so  called  internship opportunity where I have to pay literal 60k or more  for just  three to four months of internship opportunity. How the fuck  is this  even legal.

How is  anybody  supposed to optimistic about the future with such shitty job  industry.  How long do I just sit around waiting that some company would  give an  opportunity. The entire experience so far has just been  sucking my soul  and putting me into depression. And what answer do I  even give to my  parents who thus far have been supportive and eagerly  waiting for me to  get a job on why I can't even land fucking interview  with some company.  They ask me everyday with enthusiasm if somebody  replied or called for  an interview and I feel like complete trash  answering no their question,   at this point I just fell like throwing  my degree in trash and getting  any random job that pays me."

Let me start from the beginning and make it simple. I am a fresh graduate coming out of college with a B.S. degree in Computer Science. I have never had an internship before (Yes, you heard me correctly). With solid knowledge of C++ and Java, I am now on my way find a full time entry-level Software Engineering job. Although I'm a bit new to the professional world, I believe I have a good idea on what is to come.

The problem here is that I've applied to nearly 60+ jobs and only 2 got to the interview portion (which I did not pass unfortunately).

**My point here is:** Shouldn't I have at least 10+ interviews lined up? For the past 4 months, I think I should have some progress under my belt by now. Maybe it's the resume? Maybe the recruiters are looking for experience outside of college? Understandable, but only 2 of 70 jobs? I have to be missing something. Are there any Senior Lead Software Engineers out there that can point me in the right direction?

&amp;#x200B;

First I would like to ask: 

\- How can I improve? 

\- How should a Software Engineer's resume look?

\- As I only went to college, I do not have much experience outside of school. What can I put in my resume that can improvise the outside-of-school experience portion?

\- I am coming from a C++ background. What are some big topics in Java that I should become above proficient in or focus on the most?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my current understanding:

M&amp;TSI:
-Taught by UPenn professors + earn college credit, so it's definitely legit
-I'm not very techy. I know the basics of java, but that's about it. Nothing about electrical engineering or complicated programming or anything. My strength lies more in the design aspects. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up and/or I won't be interested in it

LaunchX:
-Many websites said it's legit, but there was that one person on A2C exposing LaunchX. Then again, that was during 2020 and the peak of covid, so maybe things are different now?
-I know for a fact I would be really interested in the curriculum
-It's at UMich which is one of my favorite schools. I'll definitely learn more about that college from actually living there for a few weeks than from just browsing through websites (or a college tour if I get lucky)

2.      Students who are getting selected should not drop out of the internship, attend all the sessions without fail and complete all the assigned tasks. Any deviation would lead to deregistration from the placement process of all the companies.

4.      There may be assessments if the number of registration are more.
5.      Students who are getting selected after the training assessments (may be in the month of July/August) will be given a super dream internship offer by PWC.

6.      Students who are not getting selected by PWC for the Sales force Internship may still apply for PWC for other profiles when PWC visits the campus for recruitments. They also will be eligible for other companies, if they are not selected by PWC.

I’ll explain myself, I hope I don’t come up as ‘snob’ or anything of the sort, it’s far from that, otherwise I wouldn’t be here.

I’m a M37, with 22 years of experience on the field. Yes, I started very early and in my country I was allowed to work as an intern with 15 as sysadmin and bioinformatics.
I had marvelous work experience in 3 different countries including 7y in the US, I have extensive sysadmin, linux, CDCI knowledge then moved to be a developer - Java mainly, but also others, frontend, mobile, etc.

I worked my past 11 years as VP of Tech in a major US investment bank acting as Architect, project manager, team lead, mentor, I managed multiple overseas teams in huge important projects, always chose all technical stack, cloud migration, trading platforms, heavy integrations with central banks etc etc…
I decided to give up my green card and over 200k USD salary to move back to Europe, but since the past years, it has been EXTREMELY difficult to find ANY position (mainly looking in the Netherlands, but also other neighboring countries), even though I am an EU and need no sponsoring.

I am in a kind of a gray area, as either some companies think I’m overqualified and think I will get bored soon, others don’t even call me for interviews.
Some of the interviews that I get called, I’m having difficulties moving forward, I pass coding interviews but then not in final interviews or some other technical/algorithms/architecture stuff.

I think staying too long in the same company, especially a bank where things are always more delayed to get up to the bleeding edge, took a hit in my career and confidence, even though I never stopped learning by myself outside work, always have personal projects and keep learning. Also I think I need to “reinvent” myself and rewrite my resume from scratch, perhaps removing a couple of older stuff, but I’m not sure.

Given the scenario, is there ANY recommendation of things to do?
I’d greatly appreciate any inputs here!

If anyone could share a resume that passed recently in any company, that would be awesome.

Edit: wow, even asking for honest advices we get downvotes here. Reddit never disappoints hahah"

Which one should I take if my goal is to relocate to North America in the future (Canada probably) ? Which would be most appreciated on my resume from American or Canadian companies ?

I don’t really know which path I’m gonna follow for re-location yet so I’m open to anything on that part.

For additional information, I would say that Accenture is harder to get into than Deloitte and PwC in Belgium. I can also see that from the salary package they offered, which is +10% compared to the other two. 

In addition, I feel like the role at Mercedes is really operational and doesn’t take into account my university background.

122rxhy,1,2023-03-26,HELP!? Before Wednesday I need to decide between Community Collrge or College with LRAP.,joebobtheavenger,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/122rxhy/help_before_wednesday_i_need_to_decide_between/,"Hello, i made a different account so I cannot be tracked.  


I need help deciding between attending a community college or a low-diversity college that offered me an **LRAP offer and a 20k pell grant**. However, i can't decide which is better. I am studying computer science(Hoping to graduate into Machine Learning)  


**PERSONAL CONCERNS FOR THE COLLEGE:** For context, I am 3rd generation African, and have often attended schools with low and moderate diversity, and I enjoy some diversity. However with how much college has begun to cost; I wonder if I should still go to a community college close to home, or this college 2 hours away. I tried to research the school on diversity and have found little to nothing besides a statistic saying only 100 students are African compared to the 1250+ Caucasian students. I've also found a really old review(10+) from someone claiming to be African American being attacked by a group of people. the website of the university is very nice, and yet it seems their photos are all cherry-picked for diversity. They do have a promise on their website that you will graduate in 4 years otherwise it's free which makes me concerned about the dedication to education. They also make another promise to connect you to one internship with the options for computer science having decent starting positions at small companies. (one offer was for a 55k intern, which kinda goes against the lrap)  


**the community college:** from what I've seen it's a very nice place, with one bonus being its affordability and course selection. Not to mention it's a biking distance from my parents' house, and I'm already aware of the people inside the community which is already diverse and very open to people from all backgrounds. Of course, it's not a college itself, therefore, I can only stay for preliminary courses and then transfer to a 4-year institution however there isn't a guarantee I'd be accepted by the ones I desire.  


**IMPORTANT NOTES:**  


**LRAP:** It's the main reason I am considering the college. Essentially after graduation **as long as I make less than 45k** I am entitled to have reimbursements made on my behalf, of course, the catch is I have to live on roughly $300 a month($400-500 if I'm living with parents) which is nice but I realized a lot of the internship to entry positions they help you get with companies always pay just a bit over 45k which makes you instantly uneligible for LRAP. This would also make it very difficult to build a portfolio in the comp sci industry which is very needed for any field inside the degree.  


TLDR:  **deci**ding **betw**een **atten**ding **a** **low-div**ersity **coll**ege **wi**th **a**n **LR**AP **off**er **an**d **a** **20**k **pe**ll **gra**nt **o**r **a** **commu**nity **coll**ege **clo**se **t**o **ho**me **wi**th **mo**re **diver**sity **an**d **afforda**bility. **Th**e **low-div**ersity **coll**ege **ha**s **th**e **prom**ise **t**o **grad**uate **i**n **4** **yea**rs **o**r **it**'s **fr**ee **an**d **prom**ises **t**o **conn**ect **t**o **on**e **intern**ship, **bu**t **I'**m **conce**rned **abo**ut **th**e **dedic**ation **t**o **educa**tion **o**r **la**ck **o**f **diver**sity. **Th**e **commu**nity **coll**ege **ha**s **a** **ni**ce **cou**rse **selec**tion **an**d **afforda**bility, **bu**t **the**re **i**s **n**o **guara**ntee **I'**d **b**e **acce**pted **t**o **a** **desi**red **4-y**ear **instit**ution **fo**r **trans**fer. **Th**e **LR**AP **off**er **i**s **th**e **ma**in **rea**son **fo**r **consid**ering **th**e **low-div**ersity **coll**ege, **bu**t **th**e **inc**ome **lim**it **mak**es **i**t **diffi**cult **t**o **bui**ld **a** **portf**olio **i**n **th**e **comp**uter **scie**nce **indus**try."

122ww6o,18,2023-03-26,"Passed Sec+ yesterday after CYSA last year, what else can I do to get into SOC?",Seefahh,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/122ww6o/passed_sec_yesterday_after_cysa_last_year_what/,"Comptia success email just came through!  
It took me about 2 months to study for the Cysa.  
Passing score 763/750 which is to close for comfort!

  
It feels surreal to finally say I have both the Sec+ and Cysa from mid last year when I was particularly depressed about being in Service Desk

What made me go for CS in general was seeing a video on LinkedIn about a transition to a career in CS, from a quick search online I found that CompTIA Sec+, CySA+ were the most helpful certs to gain knowledge and I applied for a free CySA training course paid for by NZ government AND It was advertised as a way for current IT workers to transition into CS.  
I wanted to post about my experience to help others who might find it useful.

Here are my past posts here  


* [Passing Cysa in Nov 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/z5kx4r/skipped_sec_but_today_i_passed_cysa_002_by/)
* [Thinking about taking Sec+](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/zflebx/i_recently_got_cysa_thinking_about_sec_for_a_goal/)

Goal: Get a SOC role or anything cyber security focused (SOC is probably the easiest to get into)  
Currently: 3rd year in Service Desk, a bachelor of computer and information sciences.

I took it after Cysa, because Sec+ seems to be the most requested cert in CS jobs in New Zealand, not Cysa. I am glad I did the Sec+ because it covered some fundamentals that were assumed in Cysa.

The exam wording sometimes was very tricky, as others have mentioned one word could change the context causing you to re-evaluate. 

I did find it extremely stressful, however I did take the exam at 12.30AM on Saturday because I couldn't guarantee my cat/family would inadvertently make me fail the exam I took at home in my bedroom.

What now?

* Take a week break and play some Pokmeon :)
* I will go for Net+ to refresh my memory from my expired CCNA, essential knowledge for SOC.
* Complete more virtual internships relating to cyber security at [https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tech?ref=oJDfwhnHZFAYQL2qR](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tech?ref=oJDfwhnHZFAYQL2qR) to show employers I am actively trying to learn more.
* Keep applying for SOC jobs!

Resources: Professor Messer and google for things I was not clear on.

TLDR  
Taking this exam after Cysa+ was definably the wrong move, the Cysa should be taken after you get a role in Cyber Security as it expands on everything you know about Sec+.  


Hoping for advice on my career trajectory and also happy to give some encouragement to people studying for Sec+/Cysa!"

122yir6,1,2023-03-26,Have a bachelors in Computer Science but I hate help desk and I also hate coding?,iamyiyaj,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/122yir6/have_a_bachelors_in_computer_science_but_i_hate/,"So I have my bachelors degree in computer science and I decided to get a help desk job not even realizing that its actually customer service/ call center based and now I for sure know that I hate IT/ help desk. I also hate coding cause in school there were required coding classes to take and pass and I literally had to retake the classes more than once. Coding just incites something in me that makes me want to get a chair and throw it out a window or something. But the thing is I don't exactly know what to do with my degree. Unfortunately I don't have any internships as I didn't take college as seriously as I should have and my GPA shows for that (below a 2.5). 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I hate customer service I have been in those roles for 5+ years and I for sure know that I am good at that. I also wonder if the reason I hate IT so much based on my job is because it has to do with helping customers with Wifi and of course that is important to people if wifi is down or having issues or there is something environmental that is affecting the wifi, of course customers are gonna be angry.

&amp;#x200B;

What I really hate the most is being on call. Thats my least favorite thing. Honestly Id love a job off the phones or a job where you only have a few calls come in or make a few outbound calls. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been interested in office jobs but the issue there is the pay is so low. Right now I live at home with my family and I am making 16.50. I know to live on my own I will have to get a high paying job which is also why I chose the computer science degree route. 

I was a bit interested in data analyst at first but i see usually that requires SQL which is a programming language. 

Anyone know of any computer science paths without heavy on call or coding work?"

122ywia,14,2023-03-26,Advice for anyone struggling right now,pathtotech,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/122ywia/advice_for_anyone_struggling_right_now/,"Hey Reddit,

Ex-Google, Facebook intern here, and now a senior engineer at a well known company. It’s been a tough time in the tech market, and I wanted to share some advice that I wish someone had told me earlier in my career.

Job openings are cyclical and market dependent. **You** are not. Be good to yourself - spend less time optimizing your applications and more time working on you.

I know that sounds like something from a cheesy self-help book, but hear me out. I’ve seen a ton of people talk about sending hundreds of applications, and getting zero follow ups. I mean this in the most encouraging way - stop doing something that doesn’t work. The job application process is inherently broken. Your perfectly crafted resume is getting skimmed at best, ignored at worst.

Instead, think about building the experiences that will make you more marketable. I say “building” because this takes intention, planning, and time. Maybe it’s joining your school’s hackathon community, maybe it’s volunteering to teach kids how to code, or maybe it’s working on an app that you’ve always wished existed. It’s up to you to figure out what experiences you want to have. At the end of the day, you are selling yourself and these experiences.

If you’re getting stuck on this, here are some general questions that might help you brainstorm:

* Have you looked at the clubs at your university to see if there’s anything you’re interested in?
* What are other computer science students in your university doing? 
* Are there any mentor figures you can reach out to about their experiences?
* Is there anything blocking you from exploring your opportunities (ie: schoolwork takes up too much time)? What can you do to get around these blocks?

I promise you that taking a step back to think about yourself will open up more opportunities in the future. Good luck to everyone reading this!"

**Intended Major(s):** Computer science, hopefully doing a double major w/ buisness.

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 32 ACT Composite

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.6 UW; 4.1; top 7% of class.

**Awards:** Arkansas CS Student of Distinction (highest CS student award in the state)

**Extracurriculars:** 

* Software Internship with a Fortune 500 company, developing software that is used nationwide right now across several hundred stores.
* Varsity Mountain Biking Team
* Varsity Debate Team
* Hobbyist / self taught in electronics, java, python, etc.
   * Oracle Java Associate certified, as well as several other certifications.
* National Honors Society
* QxQ Quantum Computing Course taught by MIT instructors virtually
* Two full time jobs, previously. I was an opening cashier 42 hours a week.

**Demographics:** White Male.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Essays will be very strong. English teacher love me (citation needed). LOR's will be good as well, hopefully.

**Schools:** 

* Penn State (goal)
* Arizona State
* Virginia Tech
* UMass Amherst
* UIUC (reach)
* Purdue (reach)
* Safeties: University of Arkansas and University of Utah.

For context, I am a Junior in High School. Frankly, I'm unsure of how much I care about going to a great school like Penn; I want to network and be around intelligent people, but for Computer Science, I understand it is a ""show me"" field. I know my skill level is high, and I will ace interviews, so I am dubious about spending a fortune on college education. I really just want to leave Arkansas; it's a great place to grow up, but I need to go somewhere new.

I understand my low UW GPA will be a handicap. I also intend on retaking the ACT for a 34, as I didn't study the first time, and see that there are only a few categories that are holding me back.

I appreciate your time, thank you!"

I thought about it a lot and wondered if a Master's in Biology is really worth doing, as I don't plan to really do wet-lab things in the future. The PI that was granting me this opportunity said I could pivot and do more bioinformatics research in the lab, but then again plant biology is something that isn't something that really sparks my interest as much.

I wanted to know what your guy's opinion is on this and whether picking up a Master's is truly worth doing. I'm just worried that after I graduate that my bachelor's won't be enough to pick up jobs in this field and feel a bit of imposter syndrome that I don't have much experience programming compared to many others.

I have tried the Thinkful bootcamp but because of mental health and financial limitations I did not complete it in time and did not get any job assistance. 
So I have no ‘real world’ experience but I have a 4 year degree and over 40 repositories on Git Hub. 
I truly do understand so much about coding but do poorly on interviews and have a weak resume since the work I have been doing since college is unrelated, like serving and tutoring. What can I actually do? 


I’ve heard work on open source projects ? 
Does anyone know any recruiters I can talk to directly or maybe I am better off becoming a recruiter? 
I am going to be jobless soon and looking for another serving position for the time being but it makes me really upset that I am having a hard time making more that $20/hr I don’t blame anyone but myself I know it’s been a while but I don’t want to give up and I don’t want my degree to be a waste of time, I have a truly fundamental understanding of programming but I’m not the strongest coder, and with consistent practice I do produce pretty good results. 

At this point I’ll be someone’s assistant I just am tired of living with my parents and being in debt and never having enough money. I want to move within a year ? ANY ADVICE more than ‘ridicule’ like actual solutions.

Does it get any better?,Pretend_Pension_3767,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1237fcx/college_has_been_the_worst_4_years_of_my_life/,"I'm about to turn 22 in a couple of days and all my life I've had crippling social anxiety and an inability to make any friends. I'm in my last year of electrical engineering at a major public university and despite some academic successes, college has been the worst time of my life.

I came in as an out-of-state student and didn't know anyone from high school. Throughout college, I've struggled to make friends. When I finally started to make some connections during my freshmen year, COVID happened and made it even harder. A few weeks before the COVID lockdowns, my girlfriend, who was the only person I ever had to talk to, broke up with me and I went weeks without ever speaking to anyone. I have bad self confidence issues, don't have a very friendly face, and a ton of acne on my face. I'm incredibly bad at social skills and can barely even express my thoughts into words because I'm so socially impaired.

My schoolwork has been incredibly demanding, and with the pressure of maintaining a 3.5 GPA needed for my scholarship, I've had no time for hobbies or interests outside of school. Every day I spend all my time studying, completing the next assignment, and moving on to the next deadline. I used to have hobbies like video games and reading when I was in high school but haven't picked it up since. I've become incredibly inactive physically and was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Electrical engineering has proven to be extremely challenging, and I sometimes regret choosing it as my major.

I've managed to maintain a high GPA and have completed internships, even securing a job after graduation. But the cost of these accomplishments has been giving up my personal life. I've had no time for hobbies, fun, or building friendships, and it's taken a toll on my happiness.

Now, with just one semester left (graduate in December), I can't help but wonder if things will get better after college. Can I find a balance between work and personal life? I haven't had any close friends since I was in middle school. Will I have a chance to make friends and enjoy life more? I don't even know how to start any hobbies. If anyone's been through something similar or has advice, please share your thoughts. Thanks for reading."

Background: I am currently an engineering student in college. I have one more year left (considering I don't fail any classes) and I have a summer internship lined up. I am somewhat liberal in a sense where I do like freedom but I am envious of all the women who get to stay home after they get married or have kids while there boyfriends/husbands provide for them. I grew up in a family where both of my parents worked (although my dad did make enough income to support our family) because my mom was very career oriented. I spent majority of my childhood in daycare (which I HATED). My dad made sacrifices for me when I was little such as working longer hours/night shift just so I didn't have to go to daycare. However, he got laid off during the 2008 recession so he then worked regular hours. During this time, I went to school from 7 am - 6 pm because my dad ended up finding a job 50 miles away and my mom did all these afterschool programs at her work to climb in her field. I always wished I could get picked up at 3pm (normal time where school ends). When my mom picked me up or tried to spend time with me she was always tired and didn't really care to know how my day went. My dad cooked for me sometimes but most of the times I ended up eating fast food and suffered from obesity and bullying. My dad never forced my mom to work long hours but she chose to because she felt as it she got freedom from her job and it enabled her to take care of her poor family in India.

Current thoughts: I hated my childhood and in the future I don't want this to ever happen to my kids (if I ever get the opportunity to procreate or even find someone to procreate with). I feel like housewives have it easier. They only have to cook, clean, and take care of the children while working moms have to cook, clean, take care of kids and work 40 hours a week. Also, housewives have a providing husband who agrees to take care of the women while working women don't have that. I want a man to treat me like a woman and take care of me. Also, I NEVER in the future want to send my kids to daycare. I went through hell and if I were to have kids I don't want them to go through that. I want to spend time with my future kids, cook nice meals, stay in good health, and keep the house neat and tidy. Everyone in my house expects me to be a career woman like my mom. My mom also said that when I grow up she's going to pressure my future spouse to make me get a job even in case if he is traditional. I just don't want to be a working woman. My parents believe that a career is imperative for me but it's not the lifestyle I want.

Present situation: I feel like the best option if I don't get to be a SAHM is to be a mother who works from home. This way I have financial independence and I don't have to send kids to daycare. However, my top preference is to not work. I also am currently single and 20 years old. I am worried about the guys in this present generation and I know that most of them don't prefer housewifes or getting married in their 20s. I know many people in the country I live in (America) that get married in their 30s and sometimes even have kids in their 40s. I am really worried about that and don't want to end up in that category. As soon as I graduate I am expected to work but I don't know what to do with my personal life as I'll probably have none.

Thanks for reading.

Also I have received offer letter from UQ with full 4 year course on the other hand from UNSW, I have received only 3 year degree and I have received a good amount of scholarship from UQ but not that great from UNSW.

I also heard that there are more internship opportunities at UQ, which would make me more competitive when applying for master. Is it true or no?

what are the pros and cons for UNSW and UQ for Psych in terms of the quality of teaching, employment, internships and difficulties and pressure (especially for UNSW because of its trimester）？

Any insights on the quality of the course and teaching is much appreciated for both the universities.

123bk36,2,2023-03-27,starting to feel i don't have the right personality for working.,montagemachine,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/123bk36/starting_to_feel_i_dont_have_the_right/,"apologies if this is the wrong subreddit. to preface, i'm 25 years old. i have depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and i'm unmedicated for all of them. i am single, have no children, live with my parents and for the most part don't pay any bills.

i graduated college in december 2019. three months later the pandemic hit, and like everyone else i was struggling to find a job. by some miracle, a temp agency recruited me and i started my very first job in late april 2020, working as an administration officer in a courthouse. five weeks later, i would get fired. my co-worker found my twitter account that i specifically told him i didn't want him following and showed it to our boss, who didn't like some of my posts (tweeting about some of my co-workers being covid deniers, etc.). since i was only from a temp agency, i was just called not to come in the following week and that was that. i was 22.

my second job was at a call center. i started in late august 2020. our company was a contractor for the federal government, and our customers were unemployed and/or impoverished people on benefits. needless to say, there were a lot of rude and abusive customers, which were understandable since they were calling to inquire about their only source of income. my wages were just above minimum wage which didn't really motivate me to come to work, knowing i would only be abused by customers. on top of that, my direct supervisor loved to micromanage me and had a reputation of being the worst and most disliked supervisor out of the entire building. i was willing to tough it out for the rest of my contract (which was a year) because, other than the abuse, answering phone calls was relatively easy. but when i asked for one day of PTO and got ""waitlisted"", that was the last straw. i resigned in february 2021 and lasted 5 and a half months. i was 23.

by that point i had gone through two jobs in the span of 10 months. it wasn't looking great for me. i decided to enroll in a one-year course that would make me qualified to be a library technician. i started school in july 2021. while i was studying, i was on unemployment benefits which meant i had to apply for jobs on the side. i didn't have any luck. i got a total of 5 job interviews for library roles in all of 2022 and didn't get a single one. i probably sent out a couple hundred applications.

in march 2022, i had to do a 2-week internship working at a library as a requirement for my course. it was mostly shelving and checking people's vaccine certificates and not much else. while i thought it was fine at first, on my last day of the internship, i was told by a staff member that i was being mistreated by management all along. that i wasn't supposed to do that much shelving in one day, that i was supposed to have been taught more about how the library was run, and that some of the feedback i got was unfair e.g. not being smiley or friendly enough, when all i was there to do was my job that i wasn't even being paid for and even though customers didn't complain about me. while they gave my school positive feedback about me, management was talking about me behind my back all along saying they would never hire me or let me volunteer because i wasn't ""trying to impress them enough"". i was 24.

in november 2022, i applied to be a full-time ""trainee"" court clerk at a courthouse. i thought i might as well give going back to the legal industry a shot since they were hiring and i couldn't get a job at a library no matter how many applications i sent. the following december, they told me i was hired and that i was going to start in mid-january 2023.

so i started. i went through 4 weeks of induction where all we did was training via ms teams meetings and court observation. i lasted 10 weeks (6 weeks out of induction) before i finally called it.

two months in and i was already so burned out. the workload was insane, the expectations too high for someone who was still new, and my co-workers looked at me with contempt and treated me like i was a burden. the probation meeting i had on my last day was the final straw - my managers invalidated my experiences and basically told me i had to change my personality because my co-workers thought i was abrupt, unfriendly and defensive. i couldn't believe at first that half of their feedback was just about my personality and not my work. but i finally realize that when you are new and on probation, people expect you to, quite frankly, change your personality - be sickly sweet and people-pleasing and a bit of a kiss-ass. i don't remember being abrupt to any of my co-workers, but i thought that as long as i wasn't outright rude and that i was doing my job that i was fine. but i really underestimated how big of a part ""likability"" plays into being perceived that you're doing a good job by others. honestly i thought it was kind of unfair that they didn't even consider that the reason why i *might* have been abrupt was because i was already so stressed about being in court to smile or be friendly.

in the end they told me that they were willing to ""keep giving me support"" and that they would put me in easier courts but i had to call it. i really didn't see myself meeting their expectations or having a good enough work-life balance with this job or being respected by my co-workers (maybe race plays a part in it? who knows). it didn't help that i had to commute home 2 hours every afternoon since i don't drive and i would get home too exhausted to do much of anything.

right now i'm on my first day of indefinite well-being leave. my mom and i spoke to my union and they advised me that instead of outright resigning, i should ""apply"" for leave, go to doctors' appointments and/or therapy for the stress (and to prove that i needed the well-being leave), get paid worker's comp in the meantime, file a complaint, and then resign.

i was disappointed with myself upon realizing that maybe this job isn't for me and vice versa. i felt like i failed again. i'm lucky to be in a position where my parents are letting me live for free while i'm unemployed (although when i was still employed, we had an agreement where i would give my dad roughly 25% of my wages) but sometimes it makes me feel even more guilty.

i'm starting to think that i'm the problem. that going to work on time and doing the actual job isn't enough; that managers and colleagues expect you to participate in office culture and alter your personality especially when you are new. but it seems that i'm just unable to do this. when i'm in a new environment i am too focused on doing my actual job correctly to have time to chitchat and kiss ass. i guess i'm just stuck in the mentality where managers should treat me like everyone else even when i'm new and my personality shouldn't be under scrutiny so i just act like myself.

technically i can still go back to my courthouse job. i haven't resigned and they haven't fired me. but thinking about the sheer amount of workload, how far it is from my house, and how my co-workers either treat me like shit or i'm invisible, it just doesn't seem like it's worth it.

EDIT: forgot to add that during my probation meeting my manager said if i couldn't handle the stress and pressure of being a court clerk now that it was only going to get worse for me. that in 4-6 weeks they expect me to be able to handle the busiest court. she also had no positive feedback for me other than ""when another clerk is in court with you, you perform fine"". which really cements that this job really isn't for me and there's no point in going back."

(I forgot to change a 2022 to 2021 when copying&amp;pasting so it’s off by a whole year). Then I immediately sent the HR a follow-up email to explain my mistake and attached a correct resume. However the HR never replied to my follow-up email so I don’t know if my correct resume was received. 

Now they offered me the position and are asking me to do a background check, and I’m going to put in the correct employment date. However I’m very nervous because it will be a big issue if the HR didn’t see my correct resume and compares the background check report with the wrong one. 

Now I have two options:
1. Send another email to HR to confirm that he has received my updated resume. 

2. Wait until the background check is cleared and hope that there’s a chance the HR won’t compare the report with my wrong resume. If he does compare and question it I will explain my mistake. 

I know I should never make mistake like this on my resume, but this is my dream company so I don’t really want to lose it because of the typo I made on the resume, and especially when I proactively explained the mistake and corrected the error. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"

We are now waiting for H-1B lottery since I am non-US citizen. I am not even living in the US right now. I got the offer after an internship last year, right before the hiring freezes and all chaos began.

Anyway, it is a great offer. Both the money and the work are nice. I am not crazy about living in the US, but doing it for a couple of years to get experience and money is bearable.

The problem is: my start date is set for December 2023. I will graduate from my PhD in September 2023 (yes, it is a research/science job). The company is going for its second round of layoffs, which has not affected my department, but still is scary. My manager obviously cannot guarantee much and I believe he himself is a bit afraid since the team lost almost 10 members in the first round of layoffs.

Currently I am living in the EU where I am doing my PhD (non-EU citizen as well). However, here I have a few companies contacting me and offering jobs. Some are interesting (not as much as the FAANG offer though), but the pay is pretty low for all of them, specially considering cost of living. It is no joke when I say that maybe I have a better QOL now as a PhD student than I would have if accepting some of these jobs and relocating to HCL areas. Nevertheless, these are more or less ""certain"" jobs (the companies are not going through layoffs at the moment).

 I am at a crossroads of sorts. I am not sure whether I should stick with the FAANG offer and see where this is will go as risky as it sounds, or if I should let it go and take an offer in the EU for a lot less money and risking a downgrade in QOL for a while. What I am trying to avoid is having to go back to my home country, I would really prefer to stay in EU, US or Canada (but I need work and visa foe that).

What would you do? Any comments are welcome as long as reasonably constructive.

I know this is highly subjective, but even therapy is not helping much in making my decision easier. It seems that no matter what, I have the risk of losing a lot. Who knows if I will ever get an offer as good as the FAANG again, but then who knows if I will even have it by the end of the year! Hence why I thought that asking the opinion of random strangers in the Internet could be a good idea."

How to deal with a bad manager and internal transfer ?",thomascld22,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/123i1l1/tips_and_storytime_like_my_job_hate_my_boss_love/,"Hi everyone, so I've been in this 1 year internship position for 7 months now and I've got a little more than 4 months left. When I signed up, I did not expect AT ALL that things would turn out the way they did. For reference, I have about 2 years of prior experience with interships and trainee programs. This one should be, supposedly, my last student/intern position before I can encounter my ""big boy"" job. Now, for the positive things, I'm learning a lot everyday, I'm overall very motivated with this job and my professionnal projects (I adore the company I'm in and its values-- more on that later), it's an amazing opportunity on paper (well known company) and the job on a resume looks super nice and clean.

On the negative side now..., my manager is straight up awful. She's micromanaging me, she's super passive-agressive, she's absolutely unprofessional and thinks she's so important, when really she has very little knowledge and therefore never helps me or anyone. I end up having to do things on my own that I do not even know how to do. Some days, she does not even talk to me for hours, she ignores me, and then all of a sudden she's all nice and unctuous. Also, I have already quite a few missions/projects on the daily, but whenever there's a shit going on, she has a way of redirecting it to me that I can't stand. All in all, she's just good at speaking for herself and making believe the department would crash without her (when in reality it's crashing BECAUSE of her lmao). Our big boss likes her because she's got some ""temper"", well, I just call it miseducation and vulgarity. Anyways-- the overall daily isn't all that bad, I have nice colleagues, ""healthy"" work routines, a good division between pro and personal, and I guess things could be worst. What I don't like however is that everyone is bitching about everyone in the department, some people there are openly burnt-out (we share the same manager...), and most of the people I speak with badmouth her, even when they're ""higher ups"".

Hopefully, one ""good thing"" about me is that I'm a very calm person, so no matter the situation I know how to remain very professional and ""corporate"". My bitch boss actually told me a few weeks ago that I was super professionnal and well educated, which coming from her meant the literal world to me. Now my current challenge is that I've grown to love the company, its values and what we do, despite hating my manager. I've seen that internal transfer were pretty common in the company, they have nice policies in that regard. So I decided that I'd try and anticipate an internal transfer before the end of my internship.

To make sure I do things right, I red a lot about internal transfer and gathered advices from recruiteurs online and friends. So far, I've seen some interesting offers (both external and internal, I did not apply already), and I contacted one of the managers I've worked with a bit that's in an other department. I did so because I like him and I love his department, and luckily enough he told me they'd open a position soon and my profile could be a match (there's no certainty here but I think it's a good opening already)... So I told my *adorable* manager that I'd consider an internal transfer right before the end of my internship, and she surprisedly told me it was a great idea and that she'd support me??? Wow, did not expect that much from her lol. So thereafter I told the HR that recruited me as well that I'd consider checking out our internal possibilities before I go, which she encouraged me to do and then thanked me for my ""transparency"". So so far, even though nothing's certain... I think that there's a slight chance that I could stay in this lovely company a bit longer.

So that would be it for me. It's not easy everyday, between the stress of having a horrendous manager and the pressure I'm putting on myself to make this potential transfer work out successfully. **If anyone has any advice** on how to stick it out for an extra 4 month with my manager, or if anyone has had a succesful (or not) internal transfer and you have some tips, be my guest. Thank you so much for taking the time to read, have a great week and I hope you're doing fine.

*TL;DR*. I LIKE my job as a 1-year-intern, it's a great opportunity that's challenging and I learn a lot each day. I've grown to LOVE the company, yet I HATE my manager for multiple reasons. I have to stick it out for another 4 months, been through 7 months already. I managed to stay very profesionnal with my manager so far, but as time goes by I am less and less patient with her. STILL, I hang on because there could be a chance that I transfer internally to another department. Made some good contacts and seen some intersting offers, so fingers crossed!"

I'm coming to the end of my level 8 degree, and am starting to feel extremely nervous about joining the industry full-time. 

I have full-time work lined up with a very generous graduate salary in a very small company, but I'm seriously struggling to deal with the stress involved. I joined the company via a summer internship in 3rd year and have been working part time since returning to college for 4th year. The tech/languages I'm working in are very old and led to a steep learning curve (I believe familiarity with the old stack is the reason for the high offer). I'm constantly anxious about production problems that may be my fault, or mistakes I may have made previously. I'm terrified to look at work messages, or that I might receive a call from my boss about a production issue.

I just wanted to reach out to people and ask if this is a normal way to feel? I love to code, I enjoy it and I really feel like I can produce and have produced some great work, but I'm just so crippled with work anxiety I can't relax at all, and the 4th year workload on top of that doesn't help 😅. I'm scared going back to working full-time again will break me. Does anyone have any tips for coping?

After my master's, I plan to work in industry and am not planning to delve deeper into academia.

 Some important points to consider:

1. The tuition fee at CMU is very high. The CMU ECE program lasts 2 years(am considering the advanced study option cause wanted to increase my exposure to certain topics from a reputed university), costing around $105k(only for tuition), with the option of doing a summer internship. However, ETHz is very cheap, and won't come with debt/loan repayment.
2. Getting jobs in US after my masters from CMU would be easier and would be high paying compared to the EU(correct me if I am wrong). From all the web screening that I could do on any of the blogs/LinkedIn, I couldnt find any source on post graduate outcomes of ETH Zurich Msc. EEIT. I dont have much data to compare with and make a decision with respect to this matter. But CMU on the other hand as good enough data on the post graduate outcomes, with around $140k on the average, should be able to repay my loans in a years time.
3. My areas of interest hover around ML, optimization, controls etc. Both the universities are technically sound in these areas of interests. While CMU is more inclines towards the ML side, I have chosen my ETH areas of interest to be systems and controls. I am again not completely sure about how much flexibility i have in choosing courses, projects and internships related to ML. Kindly throw some light on this topic as well.
4. Finding a job in the EU: Im quite unaware about this topic and to compare it with the US. Even the payscale or the work life balance to specify. If you could throw your 2 cents at this, it would really helpful.
5. Personally, I dont have a proclivity to the US culture or something like a typical Indian to settle in the US when I grow up. So culture wise, both the US and the EU are same to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kindly help me make a wise choice. Thanks in advance!!!"

My friend, who has a similar profile, also got rejected today. Another user on this sub also got their reject and even their profile seemed really good.

Our profiles in brief:

* Myself: GRE 331 (170Q + 161V), 9.8 CGPA from a Tier 3 Uni, 2 research publications (IEEE Conferences/Xplore), 1 internship
* My friend: GRE 336 (168Q + 168V), 9.6 CGPA (same uni as me), 1yr work-ex at a startup
* Another reddit user: GRE 333 (170Q + 163V), 8.7 CGPA (Tier 2 uni), 1yr work-ex in FAANG

I hardly saw more than 10 people who got an admit on this sub and no one I know personally got in.

So I'm curious: Who got in? What are your profiles?"

I would like to make an informed decision about which uni to go to. The main aim for me pursuing this degree is to get employment as a robotics software developer (perception, computer vision, ADAS, etc \[I'm open to exploring and will converge to a common interest once the course starts\])

**Background and Context:**

I come from a mechanical engineering background. I have work experience in the electric vehicles industry in system engineering and data analysis, so I developed an interest in the software side of things. Hence I am choosing to do an MS in Robotics to successfully pivot towards more software-oriented roles. I am interested in technologies like SLAM, Navigation, Computer vision, etc. I do not already possess the robotics skills to get an internship in the summer, hence the university curriculum designed towards helping me make the switch is crucial.P.S. I would not like to consider the cost of the tuition in my decision. I am comfortable with a high tuition amount as well.

**Pros and Cons for SUNY Buffalo that I have come across:**  
\+ Research-based uni, great profs  
\+ ~~Inexpensive~~ (don't consider)  
\- Location. (Situated very far from industry hubs like Boston, hence tough to get internships)  
\- Course flexibility is less (Only 4 electives, required mechanical courses which I am not interested in)

**Pros and Cons for Stevens that I have come across:**  
\+ Location. NYC might not be a hub for Robotics but a better  place for networking opportunities  
\+ Great profs  
\- ~~Expensive~~ (don't consider)  
\- The website is very ambiguous regarding the research being conducted

TL;DR:  
\- Help choose uni.  
\- Aim: get a job in the end (and internship in between if possible).  
\- Background- Mech undergrad. Work ex in EVs system engg, data analysis and data science, knows programming in Python. Want to pivot towards Robotics SW dev.  
\- Tuition cost is not a constraint  
\- Please choose the option below and provide reasons for the same in the comments

Much thanks to you beautiful people! And wish you all the best for your respective goals :)

I applied for  the MS in CS with Game Development program and here is my profile:

GPA: 8.07/10 (3.36/4)
CV: 14 projects( Games, AR and VR) that I programmed with 2 internships
LORs: 3, one employer and two profs
SOP: I think strong, did convey my passion and goals
GRE: 323 - 168Q, 155V
Extra curriculars: Got special mention in 2 game jams and organised a global game jam in collaboration with my undergrad institution

I applied in December and I haven't heard anything till now and the wait is killing me.

What I need to know is, is there a chance that my glowing portfolio (yes I worked my ASS off for 3 years making games, AR and VR projects) can make up for my low GPA in a highly selective school such as USC and do I have a chance of being admitted? 

If anyone with a low GPA got into USC, I would love to hear from.you. At this point I'll take any closure I can get :/

Side note: I have 9 rejects and 1 admit for ms in cs so far and it is absolutely a bloodbath out there."

As an out of state student for both schools, I was accepted in Purdue as a direct CS student but undeclared in engineering for UCLA. 

Paying the $71k/yr for UCLA is quite a burden on my parents as we didn't apply for financial aid and my parents have 2 other children in college (one as an out-of-state and one as international)

Meanwhile, Purdue has quite a good computer science program but UCLA has always been my dream school. 

**Being an Undeclared Engineering student means you are guaranteed the Engineering major of your choice if you meet the following criteria:**

1. **Declare your major between the beginning of Spring quarter of your freshman year and the beginning of Fall quarter of your sophomore year.**
2. **Have a minimum 2.700 GPA in Engineering preparatory courses at the time you declare.**
3. **Receive grades of C or better in all required major prep courses for the major in which you are interested.**
4. **Take and pass an introductory engineering course from the major you are mostly likely to choose, or take and pass an Engineering 96 Freshman Seminar – Introduction to Engineering Design.**

**Students applying to Computer Science or Computer Science and Engineering must also complete COM SCI 31 with a C or better (not a C-) on the first attempt AND COM SCI 32 and 33 with a B- grades or better on the first attempt**

My question is, how hard is it to fulfill this requirement as a student with no prior experience in coding and should I choose UCLA where it would be a gamble or should I choose Purdue, where I'm set to graduate with a CS degree? Also, does it make a difference in terms of securing FAANG internships + job after graduation based on the school you go to?"

So, I opened my CIBC bank account way back when I was in high school. I'm in university right now. I have an AMEX Cobalt card with a 12k credit limit. I also have a CIBC Aeroplan card (I think it's the student version, but they're both the same) with a 2.5k credit limit. 

I've churned a couple credit cards before very successfully and want to apply for a product change for my CIBC Aeroplan Card. The particular card that I want to apply for has a minimum 5k credit limit. When I called CIBC to get my current limit increased to 5k, they said that they can't do that because I'm a student. I told them that my household income is greater than 100k (as far as the bank is concerned, I live at home with my parents), but they said that doesn't count as a ""household"". 

I'm starting a year-long internship soon which exceeds this card's minimum personal income requirement. I mentioned this to the agent, and they said that it doesn't matter. She said that no matter what I do, if my account has a ""student"" status, they won't increase my limit on my current card.

Should I just call them again and ask them to remove the student status? Do they ask for a diploma or some proof of graduation? What should I tell them when I ask them to remove the student status?

* Graduated with BS in Biology in 2017
* Took \~8 CS Community College courses (3.86 GPA--4.0 in core CS classes) and plan on finishing my last class in the summer
* Received 3 academic references from my CS-related community college courses
* Work in a non-tech field
* 0 internships

**Questions:**

* My resume stated that I will finish my last class to earn my associates of CS in August 2023. Is my acceptance into OMSCS conditional on me finishing my associates degree? I plan on completing the degree either way, but I'm curious what would happen if I failed that summer class and did not finish my associates degree. Would I still be able to attend OMSCS in the fall?
* My transcripts have not appeared in my checklist yet--should I be concerned? When applying for OMSCS, I paid for official digital copies from both schools and had them emailed to me. Then I uploaded them to the application. Did I do it correctly?
* How do I shake off imposter syndrome? I haven't been programming very long and I am concerned that my programming skills aren't up to par.
* Does Computing Systems specialization fit my goals? I've only started learning how to program 1.5 years ago and would like to eventually break into the tech field, ideally as a software engineer--ideally for a healthcare system.
* Should I try to squeeze in an internship between working 30 hours a week and taking OMSCS courses, or maybe take a summer off?

And the age-old question:

What are some beginner-friendly OMSCS courses I can take to help me ease into the program?"

Throughout school, on and off Paxil, I just never quite felt happy. I couldn’t ever quite relax or relate to my peers fully. When it came time to apply to college, I procrastinated and didn’t really apply like I should have. I kept thinking: I’ll apply to my dream schools when I feel better. I never felt better. Still, I got into two good schools. All through college it was the same. I tried to stay optimistic: eventually I’ll figure out how to be happy and find my people and then life would start. 

It never happened. In fact, just as things were starting to look up senior year of college (most popular and successful I’d ever been; starting to feel like I just got it), I had a major mental health breakdown. I was convinced I was going to throw up every day and stopped eating. I lost 20 lbs that I didn’t have to lose and ended up having to go home for a while. It ruined my success at school and my internship. I had to go back on Paxil and barely enjoyed graduating. 

My whole life has been like that. Things start to look up and then I crash. A few years out of school, I got the dream job. The one everybody in my industry wanted. I had a mental breakdown and got fired. 

Today, life just feels bleak. From the outside, I look like I have a perfectly fine life. I have an OK job and I’m married to a nice guy. But peek inside: my job is nothing I ever wanted to do. I don’t ever use my brain and it sucks. I’m treated like an entry level employee and talked down to constantly. Before my wedding, I noticed I was feeling suicidal around my period. My doctor figured it had to do with my hormonal birth control. So I got off and somehow that screwed me up, too. Around the same time, my fiancé (now husband) let me know he was $40k in credit card debt and also dealing with depression and anxiety. He won’t go to therapy. He panicked our whole honeymoon. He’s never been abroad before and it turns out that’s a trigger for him. I had to accept I would not get to travel in our life together even though that’s one thing I’d really looked forward to. Plus, I’m bad at keeping a clean house and my husband feels depressed when our space gets messy. He feels like the cleaning is totally up to him, even though I’m really trying to contribute to that. I’m just also balancing our budget and applying to jobs and trying to keep my mental health together. I’m tired all the time. 

I love him, but our first year and some change of marriage has just been one or both of us having a series of bad days interspersed with figuring out how to pay off debt. I got off Paxil because it felt like something to do, I guess. That was probably a mistake. My husband wasn’t equipped to help me work through this right now. 

I’m in therapy.  I’ve stopped waiting to feel better so my life can start. I’ve accepted this is my life and that I’ll probably never really feel happy. I have a good day here or there, and I just have to feel thankful for those. For instance, this weekend, we went on a trip with some members of my family and I laughed hard for the first time in a while. I thought it was the start of an upswing. But we got home and my husband let me know he didn’t really have fun because he’s been depressed for a while. My anxiety and angst is a big reason for his depression. It just threw a damper on everything. I feel like we’ll never really be happy together and it’s largely my fault. 

Life just feels like this big mess I have to deal with. At night, I fantasize about being anybody else."

I was offered a position recently to work as a contract engineer, and while there are some good things (location, good company) there are a few huge negatives. The main one being that the shifts are 12 hour alternating day and night shifts (work 2-3 days 6am-6pm, 2-3 days off, 2-3 days 6pm-6am). In addition, it is a 1-2 year hourly contract position with no benefits, no PTO, and no relocation. I've been job searching for nearly 6 months (medical device and pharmaceutical industries mainly) and while I have gotten to the final interview stages with 5 other companies, this has been my only offer. The gap on my resume is approaching 10 months now, as well.

I graduated from a top US engineering school with a high GPA, but most of my experience has been in research and not industry (did not do any corporate internships in college and worked in an academic research setting post graduation). I'm not sure if I should take this position just to get my foot in the door or if I should hold out for something better. I do have some health issues to take into consideration as well, so I'm not sure if this offer would be worth the potential risk. 

I am tempted to try it and just see how it goes, but I am not sure if it would be burning the bridge if I quit shortly after joining. Is it better to just decline now instead of wasting their time/money?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"
123t736,21,2023-03-27,New Grad Job Search -- Software and Hardware,CuteSweet310,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/123t736/new_grad_job_search_software_and_hardware/,"Hi all, I just wrapped up my new grad job search and thought I'd share my process. This post is more targeted to fellow CS students who also have a background/interest in hardware, but also applies to those strictly interested in software.

[Job Search Flow Diagram](https://imgur.com/oVAqVSJ.png)

**Background**

\- School: University of Wisconsin - Madison (Senior)

\- Major: Computer Engineering

\- GPA: 3.97/4.0

\- Previous experience: 2 internships (one in QA, one in Software Engineering)

**General Notes:**

\- I started my job search in mid October 2022, applying only for software roles. I quickly realized that I was on the tail end of the recruiting cycle and wasn't getting many responses. It took me a couple months to even land my first SW interview.

\- In late January, I also started to applying to hardware roles, most of them related to FPGA/ASIC Design and Verification. I started applying to some firmware roles as well. The response rate in terms of landing the first interview was much better for hardware roles than it was for software (even though I had prior work experience in SW but no work experience in HW).

\- Prior to the past couple of months, I had never really looked into the opportunities in firmware/hardware. Although I'm a computer engineer and have a background in both SW + HW, I kinda just assumed throughout undergrad that being a SWE was what I should be going for (even though I enjoyed some of my HW classes just as much as my SW classes).

\- Of the 15 interviews that I landed, about half were for SWE roles and half were for HW roles.

**Offers:**

\- 4 offers for SWE

\- 2 offers for HW (FPGA Design and Verification)

**Takeaways/Advice:**

\- This advice is echoed frequently on this sub, but you should be applying to anything and everything that you are remotely qualified for. Especially in this job market, you have to cast your net as wide as possible.

\- To my fellow computer engineers and anyone in CS who also has an interest in hardware, actually consider and apply to hardware jobs! The competition for new grad roles is SIGNIFICANTLY less stiff, and the pay is very similar to most SWE roles (TC was usually around 90-130k). 

\- I found it much easier to land the first interview for HW roles than for SW, and I had no prior work experience with HW. I simply put a couple academic projects on my resume from my digital design classes that demonstrated that I knew how to use Verilog. These kinds of projects are pretty standard in computer engineering curriculum. And if you took a course where you used an FPGA, put that on your resume too! The interviewers love to see that.

\- Once I landed the first interview for HW roles, I found the interview process to be much more manageable than for SWE roles. The HW interviews are still technical but at a more conceptual level (not leetcode style). This was a huge plus for me because I tend to struggle with leetcode style interviews, even after grinding leetcode for a few months. I was usually asked about how an FPGA works and common digital design questions such as timing analysis and metastability.

**Conclusion**

Throughout most of undergrad, I had been hyper-focused on becoming a SWE and never even considered the other opportunities that are available for someone with a background in SW and HW. I also never really thought about why I actually wanted to be a SWE, outside of the fact that it pays well and I liked to code. However, there are many HW roles that also involve coding, pay just as well as SWE, and are in a very interesting problem space. So if you're a computer engineering major, keep your options open and don't forget to consider hardware roles!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this post was useful and for those who are still looking for internships/full time roles, keep your head up and trust the process! It does payoff eventually :)"

Both are two month internships during the same time. One is in purely online mode while the other has a two day office mandate in a week. 

I want to do both of them. I can manage the time by working extra as interns have anyways less responsibilities.
Is it possible and would those companies have a problem if they find it out? Or should I ask them beforehand?

I in any case want a PPO from atleast one company and hence can't afford to violate their rules (I don't know what their rules are yet). I understand it might sound unrealistic. But I just saw an opportunity here and am curious to explore it.

Also if someone has experience in working at multiple places, how would it work when I'm at office for 2 days in a week in one of the companies?"

So I basically have no will to live anymore.

My life has been a nonstop rollercoaster of bullshit since I can remember. I have a bajillion mental disorders and I've seen an endless stream of therapists. Somehow, many years after what is considered normal, I ended up returning to college, succeeding really well, and shockingly transferring into Cornell. 

Now, in my senior year, I am taking required courses that I should have taken earlier. I already have an extra semester lined up after this one and guess what? I am failing everything all of a sudden, and these aren't even difficult classes.

I have amazingly bad gender dysphoria (which has gotten more palpable this semester for some reason) and am closeted about it to most people in my life, my boyfriend's country (which I was working on moving to) is now totally falling apart, I may not even see him this summer like I normally do (which is one of the few times of the year where I feel some kind of relief), somebody I know is now going to spend the rest of his life in jail, another friend died, I've developed a dramatically worsening drinking problem (at least I'm self-aware), I still don't have a driver's license and live with my very elderly parents who I am slowly watching deteriorate, I haven't taken ANY internships, and the only jobs I have ever actually had were a service job for several years and another where I got fired. When I'm not distracted by my own mind, I just spend my time watching youtube. That's all I do. I don't do schoolwork, I don't do anything useful. My current therapist's solution to every single problem I bring to him? Mindfulness and ""being in the moment."" That is NOT helpful in EVERY single situation, but he seems to think so. I can't even be bothered to look anymore. I have seen too many therapists. My last one tried to rip me off, another told my family that I would end up in a mental institution, another suggested that my parents call the police whenever I got upset in high school, another touched me inappropriately in elementary school. After all of that, I just can't deal with switching anymore. At least this guy doesn't do any of those things even if his advice isn't helpful lol. A couple of times, I have tried calling various hotlines. I was put on hold and hung up on, almost had the police called on me, was given what amounted to unsympathetic robot responses, and was told by a person that they weren't sure what they were supposed to say. Great stuff. I'm sure others have had more success and I don't want to totally discount them because they should absolutely be an option for everybody in need, but for whatever reason, I just have had very bad luck with those.

My life was actually improving substantially in the late 2010s. I was doing more of what I wanted, I was succeeding in school after many years of failing and giving up. I even started making new friends and was slowly learning to accept myself more. Now, it is all falling apart around me. I also have very severe apocalyptic-themed anxiety that basically never ends (ironically).

I am at the end of my rope basically. Everything is culminating to a point where I seriously don't know if I can keep going anymore.

I don't know why I'm posting this here. Cornell and shit..."

I'm always trying to do get some kind of work done. I try and try and try and try and no one sees how much I try. All they see, is someone who has not show up to discussion, or someone who has an essay overdue. No one understands. I cannot do this anymore. I even landed an internship at NVIDIA, which if you don't know is elite for computer science. And I did well, and delivered over my requirements too, despite having a manager who was on vacation for most of my internship, and ended up giving me a ton of new requirements towards the end of my internship. And I did this despite my RAGING ADHD. 

But then when it came to returning the internship equipment, which I had boxed and packed and everything, I procrastinated it for month. I can't explain, I forgot about it for some time, because of some overwhelming life circumstances, after which I did remember, but then now it was scary because I was now, owing to my anxiety, I had myself thinking about the worst case situations. But owing to that, I procrastinated more and more and it just got worse and worse. I always do this, and it's really not like I'm not trying, I am. 

But my brain feels like it's ALWAYS overwhelmed. ALWAYS. Like I sleep well, I don't, eat well, don't, hydrate, don't nothing matters. I am always drained, always overwhelmed. My thoughts are too much for me to handle. And I have been like, no pain no gain. But like damn, chronic pain is like so tiring bro, and like I am doing all these things despite the pain. I need a break. I need a goddamn break, but I can't take one. I spent the whole of spring break, alternating between all these tasks that would benefit me professionally, got only some of them actually done. I was literally guilty about sleeping 4 hours, AT NIGHT. I am done I am so tired, I just want to give up, and I'm already holding my good academic standing by a fucking thread and I AM SO TIRED.

It's always been this way. Other people just have to do task A, B, C and result is D. And thats what everyone tells me to do. But doing task A,B,C takes SO much effort apart from the tasks itself. I have always been ambitious, I have always overcompensated and made sure to make myself appear like an achiever. But what they don't know about is all the disappointments in between."

What's up? I'm a 19-year-old guy who's been designing for a while now. I mainly design movie posters, and I just applied for a summer internship at a huge marketing agency in Hollywood. This agency is responsible for 60% of all the big movie posters in Hollywood, so I'm super excited and nervous at the same time.

As an international student in the USA, it's a big deal for me to even get an interview chance for something related to Hollywood. The recruiter/interviewer told me that it'll be a 15-minute chat to get to know me and answer any questions I have.

What kind of questions should I ask? I don't want to say something inappropriate, so any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!"

But after looking through resumes and websites from people at my university who got top jobs and internships, and being told on reddit by current SWEs that my concerns about major/concentrations/minors are irrelevant and that many of them stop listing most of those things on their resume outright, I’ve been realizing that it doesn’t really seem to matter very much at all? A lot of successful resumes straight up omit GPAs, omit the college under which the student was enrolled (like Arts &amp; Sciences vs Engineering vs Agricultural Sciences etc), and list courses more like skillsets than proper courses (“Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures” became “Object-Oriented Programming”, “Data Structures”). Some even stretch the truth in little ways like calling an InfoSci degree a “Computer &amp; Information Science” degree or claiming to be in the “College of Computing &amp; Information Science” instead of Agricultural &amp; Life Sciences or the like. If one can control the information that they provide to employers to this extent, is it safe to worry less about any titles my school can grant me and work on leetcode and portfolios? I’m just still plagued by an insecurity in the title of my degree despite knowing that I love my major and my concentration within it, but want to be sure it’s not a decision that can hurt me, or at least how it can. A lot of info seems conflicting between not needing CS or anything fancy and needing CS written somewhere on paper or else being at a disadvantage, even if taking the same relevant courses."
124267w,37,2023-03-27,Danaher GMDP Comp,MBAGrad2021,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/124267w/danaher_gmdp_comp/,"There have been some questions lately on Danaher GMDP program salary range and increase per progression etc. I have done some networking with alumna in the program and wanted to share my findings. 

Info on Danaher MBA to GMDP full time offer package can be anywhere from $120-140k base (90% of people get $120k with no room to negotiate. Some can negotiate depending on the level band of the role you are hired for, location such as US vs. non-US, your experience, in person or more, technical engineering role or not and other factors etc but success cases are rare) 25k relocation, $40k sign on bonus, $25k stock vested over 5 years (50% RSU, 50% stock option), 15% of base as target annual bonus, $20k extra bonus for summer interns converted to full time. 

After a full year, you get a raise anywhere from 2-4% depending on your performance, annual $25k stock refresher (50% RSU, 50% stock option). This is usually just the annual adjustment. 

After 1.5-2 years, this is usually when you rotate to a different role. If you rotate to a new role for your next rotation and if it is a promotion, you get a raise on average of 7-10%. If it is not a promotion then it can be around 3-4%. The annual performance bonus of 15% does not change for the first rotation change. 

For the next rotation which is another 1.5-2 years, if you get a promotion your annual % bonus might change and increase from the 15% of base to 20%. At this time, you will be on year 4 or 5 at the company. Your $25k annual stock refresher might go up a bit as well.

Also, it is important to note that even tho Danaher’s GDMP program is well-known as in fast track to senior leadership but not everyone will make VP at end of the 6 year program. Most will exit as director or senior director which is equivalent to having 2-3 promotion since you joined the GMDP program. 

Also note that, each rotation is like another full time recruiting process where you do multiple rounds of interviews with people such as hiring manager, team members, key stakeholders, senior leaders, general managers and HR for each of the position you apply to and get invited to interview for. Which means, you often compete with other GMDPs, internal and external employees. Sometimes the limited timeline you have in each role (1.5-2 years) can either work for or against you.

Edit: lately, there also have been some greater than average turnovers within the GMDP program. GMDPs are leaving the program early for other opportunities."

Hello, i am currently on an internship at a company, it's been approx a month since i started and coding only started last week. My subject concerns the creation of a data quality framework, the main chunk of it essentially (i am a student on his last year, this internship is the last step before getting my master), i kind of read as much as i could and made some small diagrams (just high-level concepts) of how everything will work in the main part at least.  


Tools : At first i was supposed to use SAS but after asking my supervisor ( and then the fact that the enterprise doesn't have any license to spare to me), it was decided i could use python with Spark (with pandas as a back up in case spark fails due to some unforseen reasons).  


The provided enterprise computer consist of an i5 4th  generation and 8 GB of RAM with 2 physcial cores and 4 logical ones, the data i am currently processing is the first of many, and i am loosing my mind how slow everything is......  
the data has 3 Millon Rows and 700 columns. I am a beginner at Spark, currently learning it through this book : [https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf).  


I am a data scientist student, with some background in data engineering (part of it cuz i love data eng and the other part is the need to be in control of the whole data processing before doing my models)  


I am reading the data through jdbc to oracle. I don't know how to make many executors using one single machine (currently thinking of using a VM with 1 one core), and i have yet to try to grab the data and put it to disk temporarily then do my processing. I ended up understanding that running in local mode means everything runs through a single JVM and so everything end up bundled in the driver.  
Also i have noticed that my processor is not rising in usage while i am running tasks. I did configure a fetchsize and used the partition option when connecting to the jdbc, but still things are slow as shit.

(oh btw i ended up finding this stack overflow question and i don't understand how he has so many executors while in local mode [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41645679/spark-driver-memory-and-executor-memory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41645679/spark-driver-memory-and-executor-memory) neither if they are actually helping speed up the process)  


I am currently weighting weither i should continue to pursue trying with spark (but i am 99% i am not going to get more machines, cloud or a better computer) or switch to pandas and just try to optimize from there. I am currently in the step of data profiling (automatisation also of this step)  and i can't even get some basic stat about my data since it takes so long to just compute anything (it takes 16 min to collect the row containing the result of counting the nulls of 50 columns + one of the column cause an sql numerical overflow) which i am currently investigating)

(Oh also just personal curiosity but do you think that just basic SAS would be able to do it faster and better ? be it in terms of speed, coding etc)  


Any advice on what i should do or any kind of information that i am (certainly) lacking would be appreciated, i am kinda stuck and i can't progress anymore.  
In the meantime will keep reading the book....."

Pros for corporate housing:
1. No need to pay extra so cheaper
2. Can socialize with other interns much more

Cons:
1. No own bedroom. I’ve been having my own bedroom &amp; bathroom for a year now and it will suck to go back to dorm life
2. My bf is going to visit me for a week or two and he will have nowhere to stay
3. The housing hasn’t let us know the apartment name so no idea about if it’s going to be convenient to commute or get grocery
4. Chaotic if I’m going to work at home
5. Much less privacy

Pros for getting my own place:
1. Already found a great 1b1b that’s close to grocery and shuttle stop
2. Have the entire place to myself
3. Can work at home
4. My bf can just stay with me if he comes visit me

Cons:

1. Would continuing research over the summer or doing an internship in industry with a biotech/pharma company be more helpful for an application? I am approaching 1 year of experience and I've been able to learn a lot, but with the progress being made, it would be very unlikely to have any pubs within the next year. Besides the summer though, I do hope to continue with my current research until I graduate.
2. Does the title of an internship position matter greatly for admissions? For example, would it be better to have an R&amp;D internship position vs. a process development title (in the same field), even if both positions involve some form of ""research"" at the core of the internship?

Second - History Teacher 9+12 years - He's had me at the beginning and end of high school so he can speak to my growth, and I'm always very active in his classes. We share a series that both of us love and have talked about, so this one spoke more to my professional qualities - 7/10

**Interviews**

**Reed College -** Got an older alumni that knew what he was talking about. The conversation flowed well and I spoke about helping to found GSA in an environment that was not the most receptive to LGBT+ people, and how I want to bring that sort of confidence in myself to college. Not bad, but nothing special - 6/10

**Bowdoin -** Got a current sophomore - we shared a love for a similar type of music and recommended a couple of bands to each other(additions to my focus playlist), and talked about band and learning instruments. Was a bit more comfortable than Reed, but nothing phenomenal - 7.5/10

**Essays**

**Common App -** I wrote about coming out and how it helped me step into who I am, and how it gave me confidence to take leader positions and try out new things. It was solid and spoke to who I am and what I value, but it wasn't anything super special - 7/10

**Bowdoin -** I chose ""To gain a standard for the appreciation of others' work and the criticism of your own"" and talked about performing at State Solo/Ensemble, and how hearing other people perform is one of the best parts of the band season because you get to enjoy music and think about how to make yours better. It hit the prompt and was pretty well written, and I was happy with it - 8.5/10

**Reed -** I wrote about how I would choose to teach a mental health course for Paideia because of its personal importance to me and how often students face mental health issues. I'm really proud of my idea for this, but the essay itself was very matter-of-fact. 7.5/10

**Swarthmore -** Prior Experiences one - I talked about my change from ""straight Christian never-question-anything"" to ""agnostic gay try out new things because life is short."" It highlighted my growth and acceptance of myself and how I helped communities and people grow around me. Not bad, but kinda restated my personal essay. 6.5/10

**George Washington:**

**Honors Program -** Talked about how I advocated for my advancement in English and math, and how I'm the first person to take APUSH in my school. Good highlight of my academic success, but that's all. 7/10

**Honors Essay -** I wrote to Frank Kameny and thanked him for how he worked tirelessly to make people like me feel safe and sure in themselves, and how he gives me the courage to continue to live as who I am. I'm super happy with this one, makes me emotional rereading it(could be biased tho) - 10/10

**Richmond -** Prompt 2 - Talked about my environment and experiences in a small school and how I was able to make connections with a wide variety of groups and people. Not bad, but not my best - 6/10

**Grinnell -** Why Us - Talked about how I want to be in an open curriculum for the chance to pursue interests and how I want to be more than a number in the gradebooks to my professors. Solid - 7/10

**Additional Information:**

**Final Thoughts:**

I'm disappointed, but I know that I still have a good selection of schools. I'm waiting to get a complete financial aid package from TSU that will hopefully include a music scholarship, but after getting the rest I've narrowed it down to 2 options: Drake + URichmond

Drake is about $15k/yr after all financial aid before loans, but I love the music program there and they have a solid poli sci program. I'm going to apply to the Honors Program and am visiting in a couple weeks, so hopefully those will help me decide

Richmond is about $13.5k/yr and is far away, but I love that. I want to distance myself from my home town and want to end up on the East Coast somewhere. It has a music minor with ensembles I'm interested in and is definitely known for poli sci, plus you can take a law school class in undergrad so I can get a taste of that. It also has the summer internship fund which sounds very nice. Overall I think that I like it the most, but finances may be what stops me.

Truman State is the wildcard. It will likely be much cheaper(expecting about $5k/yr), and it's very difficult to justify going to Richmond when it's so much cheaper at TSU. I visited and loved the clarinet professor and wind band, and had an 1.5 hour talk with the Poli Sci department chair about what TSU offers, and I'm sold that it wouldn't be any lower quality of an education at all. The only thing that I dislike is how far away it is from a major city. Drake is in Des Moines and Richmond is in Richmond, which is a huge plus both professionally and recreationally. I'm going to wait for the official financial aid package, but unless something big changes I think I'm gonna be a Bulldog in spring!"

I am trying to 180 my life and I’ve chosen tech as my goal. I was drug addicted and goalless and now I’m clean and in school! Im 24, I currently work full time in a factory, and I’m taking full time classes online at my local community college. I will be graduating in roughly a year and a half with an AAS in Software Development, and I couldn’t be prouder of myself, but I’m worried that it won’t be enough to get a job. My plan was to get my AAS and while working in tech (the specifics are yet to be decided) I would be working towards my bachelors in either CS or SDev. I don’t really have time right now for an internship, maybe I will in a year, but as of right now I work 50 hours a week and they are unwilling to work with any other schedule, including school. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips to lend me? My main goal is finding a small coding job after I graduate so I can continue my education. 

I’m definitely passionate about software. I was in my computing logic class and I was having so much fun solving puzzles, correcting scripts, and I really like it, so I know this is the field I should be in. I apologize if this is a loaded question, and if I seem naive it’s because I am."

I'm definitely more business-minded, albeit I'm kind of awkward and don't do amazing in social hierarchies, but I do well enough to get by. On the other hand, I'm afraid of graduating and struggling to get a job in this shitty economy. We're about to be balls deep in.

Computer science does fascinate me, and I've always been pretty decent with technology, but I've tried to learn programming a few times and can never wrap my head around it. I was also pretty dogshit at math in high school, so that's kind of holding me back as well. Although I know computer science is a super versatile degree and it is pretty easy to get a job after internships and graduation.

124ccrc,3,2023-03-28,Thinking of switching careers from animation but I don't know what else I am good at or interested in....,throwaway0298827525,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/124ccrc/thinking_of_switching_careers_from_animation_but/,"I'm in my mid-20s and a first generation university graduate. I majored in animation (I specialize in 2D animation and character design) and I graduated debt-free. Last year I was able to get land my first job at a media company making 2D art/animation for a YouTube channel. It's a work from home  freelance/contract job though and while I'm grateful that I've had my contract renewed three times and am currently still with the company, I have no idea if they'll want me to continue working for them after my contract ends this summer. Also I earned less than what my dad made last year... 

&amp;nbsp;


 I've always wanted to work in animation ever since I was young (and i do enjoy the job i have atm) and I knew I wasn't going to earn the same money as a doctor/engineer but i honestly didn't expect the animation industry not only be extremely competitive but in a way unsustainable. I have a classmate who earned an internship at one of the most well known studios for tv animation and got to work in character design on an animated series after graduation but had to work as a waitress the entire year without any industry work last year. That pretty much shocked me because my classmate got to live the dream job I wanted but it only lasted several months after graduation.

&amp;nbsp;


Like I said, I specialize in 2D animation and character design but there hasn't been many job openings (especially full time) as of lately. I do notice there has been more job openings for 3D animators. I did dabble in 3D animation during university but I would have to learn how to effectively animate well in 3D (i've worked with 2D rigged animation, not sure how much of that will be helpful towards transitioning over 3D). Either way, I don't know if 3D animators are more profitable than 2D animators. I have a classmate who has worked at a studio as a 3D animator for over a year now while another classmate has worked for several months for a different studio but hasn't landed another gig as far as i know of. 

&amp;nbsp;


Right now I'm stuck because I need a stable well paying job but I don't know what else I'm good at or interested in. 

&amp;nbsp;


Medicine doesn't interest me but my friend (whose parents are both nurses) has told me nurses are in demand and it seems less study-intensive than doctors? I have to pick up dog poop and trash as a small side hustle so i don't know if that will prepare me for whatever nurses have to deal with. 

&amp;nbsp;


Engineering would be a dream (especially since their jobs are well paid and stable and I wouldn't mind the loneliness) but I'm terrible at math (physics and calculus class in high school were some of my first classes that i really struggled with). 

&amp;nbsp;


Computer science also sounds cool (i could probably use it to my advantage to know how to make my own games and what not in my free time) but I heard it's just as math intensive (if not more than) as engineering. 

&amp;nbsp;


Those are some careers that probably peaked my interest on paper but i honestly don't know if i will regret changing careers to something i will have a frustrating time. My parents are getting old and I want to help support them so that they wouldn't have to work anymore. Any advice, ideas, suggestions, or guidance is much appreciated.

&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR Mid-20s animation major considering switching careers. Maybe nursing, engineering or computer science? but the last 2 are probably pipe dreams considering that math isn't my strong suit. Either way I don't know what else I'm good at or interested in besides art/animation.**"

I will be entering university this year, assuming my health condition permits.

I never knew who my mother was, as she left after I was born. Dad's overseas for almost all the time. The last I saw him in-person was before COVID. I live with grandpa but he has dementia and is spending his final months in a hospice. Currently, I work part-time hourly, since I have some time before school starts. I am unable to do a full-time role as I need the flexibility for my clinic/hospital appointments. Also I get unwell even on working days so I sometimes have to leave earlier/rest.

The bulk of my salary is used on medical expenses, with the rest going to groceries for cooking, electric/gas bills and transport. I occasionally try to buy herbal soup for grandpa. Sometimes I may need additional treatment/medicines, so I might spend more than expected.

Recently, there were some payment issues regarding my grandpa's hospice. Dad has an account set up for that, but in any case I was notified when I visited, and I paid the rest. I didn't tell Dad about it.

He found out somehow, and he called me. He framed it as a casual chat, asking what I was up to. I told him the above. He then mentioned about expenses for college such as clothes + school fees, and I told him I didn't want his money.

We had an argument about it, and he brought up the hospice thing. I screamed at him saying that he was uncontactable. I then refused his money because:

1. I don't think I should be taking his money as we never had a relationship.
2. He keeps talking about coming back for a visit but never lives up to it. In fairness, COVID may have affected his plans. I was disappointed with his recent failed promise to visit last year.
3. I live in the house he owns. Grandpa used to live here too. I know that the house would fetch a good price on sale or rent, and I'm not paying any rent, just the electric/gas bills.

In any case, I gave in and accepted payment for the hospice fees, and taxi/Grab fares for my next medical appointment, I drew the line on other expenses like my medical fees.

Dad also mentioned getting clothes for uni. I'll admit that it never occurred to me to buy new clothes. Perhaps that I never really had an experience shopping for clothes with friends, because I was unwell for most of the time. Another reason was that I have a few school-based shirts, and my school blouse and skirt are in good condition, because I hardly attended a full-day of class due to my health issues. Given that I spent quite a bit of money already on school clothes, I was hoping to keep using them until I saved enough money to buy more durable clothes for working, if I could get an internship in year 2 or year 3. But there is a chance my health could worsen too, so it is also a maybe.

However, Dad seemed to think that wearing my JC shirts/skirts to uni was a stupid idea. My friend agreed too. She offered to give me some of her clothes, but I rejected it. I asked others for their on wearing my JC clothes/school skirt to uni, and while there were no rules against it, people seemed to think I would be judged, although some said it was OK.

I'm just wondering if it was ok to do so in uni? Alternatively, would it be okay to wear them, perhaps when I'm going for my hospital appointments/grandpa/grocery runs? Would people judge me? I'm sorry if I come across as being naïve, but treatments/appointments leave me quite drained and unwell, so I have never really thought about getting new clothes or thinking what is appropriate. For me, if it is in good condition, its fine. Also reluctant to spend money on durable clothes since my JC clothes are fine.

Also, was I bad to reject his money?"

I'm a senior software dev sa startup company and sakin na-assign yung mga HS interns, may work immersion sila na subject ata. Total of 2 weeks daw. Gusto ko sana maging fun and memorable sa mga kids.   


I just need some advices or recommendations na pwede kong ipagawa sa mga kids. Nauubusan na kasi ako hehe. 

Eto na yung mga pinagawa ko sakanila. 

1. Create individual resume para ma-assess namin kung ano na ba yung alam nila and ano pa ba yung kulang.
2. Conduct ng research and gather ng insights sa mga related product/service namin. Then gawan ng report and presentation. 
3. Write expectations sa company and sa internship/immersion
4. Tinuruan ko sila ng overview sa scrum, waterfall, agile, best practices, etc. How to start a sprint, anything na high level about sa scrum. Nag create din ako ng kanban board for the HS interns para ma-track namin lahat ng tickets/activities na ginawa namin and makita nila yung flow.
5. Sinama ko sila sa sprint planning namin, daily stand up meeting, retrospective, etc.
6. Discuss about hackathon, purpose, etc. Then nag conduct din ako ng mini hackathon. No coding since wala pa silang alam, more on idea lang, purpose, problems, objectives, etc.
7. Nagpa-games/activities din para magka bonding, masaya naman kami and okay din sila kasama, masaya ka-bonding. Magkaka-vibes lang kami kahit na may onting age gap hehe.
8. Overview ng mga IT job roles like Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps, etc. And pinakita yung roadmaps, overview lang. Baka ma-overwhelm sila haha. 
9. Nag share ng ideas kung pano ako naging software engineer and paano ako natutunan yung mga tech skills ko. What are my recommendations, and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So far ayan pa lang ang napagawa ko during 6 days nila. May 4 days pa sila. So kahit light lang siguro, baka lang may ma-suggest kayo guys :)  


Eto isa kong option like mag turo ako about cloud computing, overview lang and ano ba yung mga ginagamit namin.

Based kasi sa mga expectations nila tingin ko nagawa ko naman, yung isa lang yung hindi like turuan daw sila sa programming skills, pero na-discuss ko naman sakanila na hindi ko yun gagawin kasi it takes time lalo na para i-digest nila yun haha. Na-discuss ko rin na hindi ko sila minamaliit pero it takes time kasi para ma-gets at digest nila yun. May mga prerequisites kasi bago nila matutunan. I assess din kasi if ano ba alam nila sa programming, sobrang onti lang kasi even functions di pa nila alam daw. So mahirap yun if turuan ko sila ng OOP. So nagbigay lang ako ng tips kung paano nila matutunan yun and kung ano lang yung ituturo ng schools. Nasabi ko na super basic lang and natutunan ko sa labas yung mga yun, like umattend ako ng seminars, bootcamp, youtube, udemy, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, guys! I'm actually new sa role ko as a senior software dev, actually goods naman ako sa technical skills but sa soft skills I think new and not enough pa kaya hinahasa ko pa hehe. Hindi lang interns yung natuto and natuwa rin ako kasi ang dami ko rin natutunan sakanila."

One of my prereq for capstone is to do an internship this summer, but 300+ apps later and I still haven't landed anything. Not getting an internship means my capstone will be delayed by a year.

I don't have many courses left so spreading the courses across that extra year isn't possible. What would you do during that extra year to make yourself more employable upon graduation?

Thanks in advance!"

Now I am searching for jobs in the tech line, but I have no experience so irrespective of sending out resumes to almost 200+ companies till now, getting no response, also I am not sure how to go forward with this,

I only know Python language as a whole and made some minor projects that I stored in a GitHub repository and added to my resume,

I also learn a bit of Data Analysis and Django to have some chance getting placed, but very slim, along with some SQL, but most experience I have is with MS Excel

My friend stated that I need industry exposure and for that I have to start doing even unpaid internships,

Can anyone suggest me how to gain experience or get a job, even low paying, especially in Data Analytics, as that is the only part where I see myself being somewhat capable."

I’m a senior based in Asia and I plan to take my masters degree in the US preferably within the next 2-3 years. I’m kind of anxious bcus idk if I’ll be good enough to get accepted or land any scholarships. I am currently considering an IT for business course or something related to that. 

Here are my qualifications
1. Probably what i’m most anxious about - I’m a social sciences major but I have a minor in information systems for business. I started becoming interested in tech after my quantitative research class. My GPA is on the 3.1 to 3.3 scale but I come from a prestigious university in my country
2. I have 4 internships, 3 of which are analytics/programming-related. 2 are in multi-national companies (top 20 in the fortune 500 list as far as I can remember) and I aim to get absorbed in my current internship
3. I’ve had leadership positions since my first year of college inside and outside university (got an award for it too), varsity for most of college, etc.
4. I’d say I’m a proficient writer and speaker. 

Please be brutally honest with me so I can plan accordingly :) would appreciate any tips or insights"

In my first semester in poly, it was pretty fked for me since I found out that my ex cheated on me with my best friend and It really affected me + I wasn’t a hardworking person if can I would rather just sleep everyday and just do nothing. I originally tho I could get a 3.0 which I assume is an average gpa for everyone but I gotten back a 2.1 :(

I'm in a IT course and I wish to study computer science in the future hence I decided to work hard and It paid off. I got my year 2 semester 2 results a while back and achieved a cumulative gpa of 3.45. From a 2.1, I was pretty proud of myself.

But… the stupid minimum gpa to enter computer science is so fking high and I found out that If I get 4.0 for my internship and last semester I would only achieve a final gpa of 3.6333. Looking at the IGP of NUS,NTU,SMU I doubt I can get into any + I doubt I can get a 4.0 cause honestly I'm getting pretty burned out

For reference:
NTU 10th percentile: 3.70
NUS 10th percentile: 3.84
SMU 10th percentile: 3.80

Should I just give up and apply for SIT computer science instead"

I cannot focus good and I’m a bad procrastinator. I need something to follow
-&gt; also how can I know what exact position to go into? I was thinking SE but I’m afraid I can’t do that plus I know there’s positions like designing websites etc… but I feel like I should aim higher. 

Tips on studying, how to stop procrastinating, how to figure out what I want to get into, how to stop relying on chatgpt (because yes, I literally rely on it so much to get me through assignments sadly).

Tips on how to find experiences.

Been in a situation where I've had to move for grad school multiple times in the last 6 years, with a move scheduled this fall for postdoc and then I'm going to have to figure out my first licensed position. I've had really poor experiences through grad school, with the state I moved to, program and people, and missing home. Moved again for internship and the workplace has treated me amazing but I can't stop the itch of having no roots (I make friends, but they have roots and lives here so don't make time outside of work) and knowing whatever roots I form here I'll leave behind when I move again in the fall. I've felt perpetually separated by loved ones and now that I finally have a date scheduled to return to the place I consider home, I'm kind of numb to it.

Generally I've been using the last few years to really focus on work and haven't been able to feel purpose with much I invest in outside of work. I just get in a very existential ""what's the point?"" place where any escapism seems more tempting than investing in than anything real, especially when everything feels temporary. Usually it makes me look forward to talking to clients so my life has at least some purpose, but I'm hitting a wall again where I don't feel a point to working nor to existing between shifts. Took a day off without much direction to recover, and idk how to get myself out of the funk at least enough to get the drive to work again.

Anyone been in a similar situation? Anyone figured out a way to feel a reason to care or try when they feel systematically detached from the things they care about? Or found ways to mentally recover and find the will to show up for busy work days when they're in a real (existential) funk?"

As was packed. I could tie this in to how this motivated to study medicine and so that I may go back and help me people"

By graduation, I had done internships writing android, iOS applications as well as some light backend work. I’ve been at a company as a developer for the last 3 years but I’ve somehow lost my self confidence and it keeps getting worse. I am overwhelmed by the vast number of topics that I could learn as a developer, from language and framework proficiency to databases, cloud concepts, containerization, networking, software design and architecture, security, algorithms/leetcode to frontend/web technologies and don’t even get me started on ML and AI. And there’s of course all the devops ci/cd deployment and maintanance stuff that I don’t know anything about. There’s just SO much to learn. I’d be surprised if other jobs require this much breadth and depth. It’s taking a massive mental health toll on me as I always feel like a fraud and don’t know how people learn.

My question to you is: where do you learn what you need to be able to do your job? Do you use books, online courses, YouTube videos? And how do I retain more information as I tend to quickly forget what I studied. I take notes but I end up pretty much copying articles and tutorials and documentation into my notebook and it’s inefficient. H"
124yrm7,11,2023-03-28,My fear of dealing with shit is destroying me,sad-cloudz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/124yrm7/my_fear_of_dealing_with_shit_is_destroying_me/,"Whether it be good or bad. I feel like I’ve just become more and more irresponsible since being in school. The longer I go with self accountability, the worse it gets. 

I had accepted an internship offer with a large aerospace company. I failed the drug test due to prescription medication and put off dealing with clarifying it for a month and missed the deadline. 

I got an internship offer at one of my dream materials companies and was too busy stressing about questions I wanted to ask &amp; feeling pressured to practice negotiation which made me put it off more before I responded with an acceptance letter. I was supposed to respond within 4 days but failed to acknowledge that and responded on the 5th day. They gave the offer to someone else. 

I still haven’t quit my research position on campus despite not putting in hours for a whole school year because I’m scared about disappointing my professor. I’ve pretty much already quit in his eyes, so why can’t I bite the bullet and do it? I also put off quitting my previous internship and informing them I’ve accepted another offer. I finally did it last week and it felt like the biggest weight lifted off my chest. I was employed at 3 places at one time because I’m so scared to quit and say goodbye to these opportunities. 

I owe over $100 for not returning a library book and I’m sure the charge will go away once I return it since they’ll know I’m not stealing it. Still haven’t returned it. 

I’ve done so poorly in classes because I put off asking for help. I always think I can help myself and it always goes south. I still refuse to ask for help. It’s gotten better as I’ve had professors who give a shit and reach out first, but I wish I could do more for myself. 

Plus a bunch of random little shit that I put off dealing with in my personal life and club work. 

Is anyone else stuck in this perpetual cycle of refusing to deal with responsibilities? For context, I went my first 3 years with undiagnosed and untreated adhd and the following 2 years diagnosed and medicated. It’s gotten a lot better since then but obviously drugs don’t cure adhd. I don’t feel like these actions stem from laziness, it more so feels like anxiety. Which is so fucked up because my worries would be lifted if I would just deal with shit. I have a year left and I think I’m going to make it but I don’t want to enter the workforce like this. 

Have any of you had to overcome this? How tf did we come so far in Engineering with such awful habits of avoidance? Dealing with things up until the last moment was my specialty, but it has finally caught up to me and now I’m missing opportunities all together. I can’t keep resenting myself over shit like this. 

And if you haven’t dealt with this but might have an idea of what I might need to improve this behavior, please chime in as well. I’m sure a lot of it comes from how you were raised but all I can do now is acknowledge that as a reason, but still do the adult thing and overcome it. That doesn’t mean it’s easy though, I now know the “privilege” really just means that you just so happened to get lucky to have been raised with a certain trait that benefits you without you having to put much thought into it. I’m privileged in many areas but definitely not this one. But I’ve been privileged enough to recognize that it’s something I can fix so I want to work towards fixing it. Any and all advice would be appreciated!"
124zb8p,3,2023-03-28,Reality of moving from web applications to video games?,at_ligma,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/124zb8p/reality_of_moving_from_web_applications_to_video/,"I have been working primarily as a front end engineer for the past 5 years. I started with building static websites for a small, local marketing agency and then became a full-stack engineer at an IoT consultancy and now work as a front-end engineer at a FAANG company.  I've become very comfortable working with different kinds of systems/infrastructure, learning new designs/languages, and collaborating with all kinds of stakeholders. I love what I do but I'm worried about getting burnt out with the particular work I'm doing. I've been building pretty generic SAAS applications throughout my career that are mostly based on forms that handle basic data. A lot of this has been handling user information (names, emails, URLs, auth tokens, etc) and any related infrastructure tools. I'm not saying this work is trivial, but it just doesn't get me excited or motivated.  I'm not sure I'll have the drive to move from my L4 position to L5, L6, etc.  


Recently, I built &amp; deployed a calculator app for a video game I love using some public data from the developers. Some friends of mine used it and collaborated on the project and it was the most fun I've had coding since I first learned HTML/CSS. I realized that I was having way more fun working with data that I was passionate about. Now I'm wondering if I should start seriously considering trying to get my foot in the door of the video game industry. I've been looking into some titles at gaming companies such as ""Front End Engineer"" (for their web applications) or ""UI Engineer"" (for the actual game clients). It looks like a lot of the technical requirements overlap with the work I've done throughout my career. I would definitely have to put some time into getting familiar with game engines, though.   


The requirements of having experience in the gaming industry looks like the biggest hurdle, though. I'm not sure where to even start. These usually are in the form of:  
""*proven success as a senior software engineer in a national/global gaming company* ""  
or  
""*3+ years professional experience in software development with multiple shipped titles / projects.  Video or casino gaming experience is highly desired.""*  


Would love to hear any advice or experiences that you may have related to this kind of career switch. Just trying to get a general idea of what the road could look like ahead. Do you just bite the bullet and start building your own games from scratch? Do you try to join and contribute to open source projects? Do you pursue an internship?"

I pretty much got rejected from the majority of my other schools aside from one of my top choices for NYC, which was Fordham Uni! Ivy day is a few days away, but I don’t really have high expectations for it LMAO

But, I wanted to just say that it was really cool getting to see ya’ll and be around ya fellas! Seeing a lot of people be competitive and work hard for their dreams is incredible, and I’m honestly super impressed with how everyone here has been able to accomplish so much cool stuff! You guys are genuinely talented! 

I really think that regardless of where you end up, either you’ll have the perfect opportunity to get another chance for admissions, like grad school or med/law school, or you’ll be able to do great things at your uni! My counselor always said that you’re land a spot at the place that you’re meant to be in, so no matter what happens, it’ll always work out, even if it feels like it doesn’t. So please keep your head up high, and focus on the future: you’re going to go to COLLEGE! And you’ll get to meet and make a lot of friends! You’ll try out all the nice and bad cafeteria foods, hang out at libraries with study groups, do interesting internships, and so much more! You may or may not like your options, but down the road, you’ll thank yourself and be happy that you did the best you could, and still ended up somewhere nice!

As for me, I honestly surpassed my expectations. I went from a small time underfunded NYC high school, and ended up at a pretty decent university. It may not be the best, but it’s T100, costs about $1500 per year, and is in Manhattan! I did the best that I could, and I was able to get what I wanted in the end. I think that it’s going to be okay, and I’m only motivated to work even harder once I end up at Uni for law school!

That being said, this is probably the last time I’m going to be posting or commenting here. I’m glad that admissions is (mostly) over. I’m gonna go ahead and chill out during the summer and try out a bunch of bakeries!

Congrats fellas! Great job for doing your best! Continue to work hard and pursue your dreams, and always stay hopeful!

I'm majoring in CS with a focus in Cybersecurity and Software Development. My GPA is 3.5 and I have 2 years of SWE experience from my internship. My internship doesn't have any entry level SWE positions available other wise they said they'd hire me on.

I understand it's only the end of March and I have ~1 more months before I graduate then 6 months after that before I need to start repaying loans, but I really just want to be hearing back from more places then just 1. Plus, I only got the interview I had because my friend referred me. However since my friend graduated a year before me, his company got bought by another bigger company and whole he still gets ti work fully remote I'd have to move 6 hours away to a state I'd rather not live . Plus, they're thinking I'd be better for their QA role (no technical interviews happened BTW) and my dad says if I want a Development role QA isn't the way to go as I'd be stuck in QA. 

I've gotten emails saying my resume has been moved along and I'll hear back soon, but that was a month+ ago!

I'm starting to lose faith in me being able to find a job."

1252y0x,1,2023-03-28,Think I may be in the wrong industry since I easily get sensory overload,WhaliusMaximus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1252y0x/think_i_may_be_in_the_wrong_industry_since_i/,"**TLDR:** *I get overloaded easily every day by having to use lots of different software programs / tools for ad-hoc tasks, am currently a web dev atm, and want to blow my brains out. It seriously affects my work performance on a daily basis. Are there positions within the industry better suited for me?*

I got my degree last year and have some peace knowing I didn't major in CS just b/c it's relatively lucrative, but b/c it genuinely interests me (not trying to sound ""holier than thou"", just noting that I'd personally be miserable if I'd only gone into something for money).

Building a simple personal website for myself some years prior was what got me interested in software development and wanting to learn more foundational topics, which led me to going to school for CS.

However, since my final year in school, I've done an internship and been in a developer role for almost a year, and I fucking hate life almost every second I'm ""on the clock"". I've gone **almost** borderline suicidal a couple times. And no, I'm not exaggerating. I was a non-traditional CS student, so in my late 20's with some life experience and don't say it flippantly.

One of the biggest issues I have is the ""sensory"" overload I experience everyday when using the tools to complete what, in the end, are fairly simple tasks:

Getting messages and shared files in MS Teams at random times, having meetings scheduled in Teams and then getting the notification in Outlook, getting email with attached files in Outlook that could have been sent easily via Teams, working through different VDI's for security reasons, using multiple IDE's b/c of how horribly some apps were initially built, which results in being tied to random propriety offerings etc. etc.

And then there's all the fucking technical acronyms that get thrown around non-stop during every damn meeting by people who don't use them appropriately nor in the correct context 50% of the time. As someone who takes things very literally / at face value (a therapist suspected I may be on the ""light"" end of the ""spectrum"" which could be true) this fucking grinds my gears so hard I want to combust and yell ""FUCK YOU"" at everyone. I'm often trying to figure out what they mean only to later realize they're dumbasses who don't give a shit what spills out of their mouths as long as they *sound/appear* competent and intelligent.

All this stuff eats away at me every work day, gets my body temperature up, and makes me want slowly close my laptop and through it in a wood chipper.

I've been looking into getting into embedded systems / lower level things b/c it's more interesting to me but also in hopes of escaping a good amount of the tool overload in web development. Things may not be very different in the end unfortunately.

I'm aware most jobs today involve use of different tools, just want something less hectic and more ""stable"" I guess if that's the right word, but that still allows me to be creative (solutioning etc.).

**Are there any fields within the industry that I may be better suited for?** Data science?"

I did not arrange my internship yet for my next uni semester which is in two weeks, and I have several other deadlines next week. I'm finishing up my portfolio so I can apply for internships tomorrow (I already wrote E-mail drafts and made my CV) I'm not looking forward to looking silly for applying so late, and I know that on top of that, I will miss at least one project deadline next week.

-

I'm bummed out, this is really my own fault because I got sick and then my sleep schedule got reversed to nocturnal mode, and I didnt't do anything for two and a half weeks. I was also very ashamed so I didn't really contact my teachers about it aside from letting them know I was sick.

-

So yeah, I'm trying not to beat myself up about it, but it's kind of hard to give myself some slack.

-

I think there's a possibility where I can figure this out if I go for the redo's, but for one of the projects I have to present my idea to teachers and a stakeholder, and I already know I am going to get scolded for my behaviour/work by the teachers at the end. 

-

TLDR: I fucked up with deadlines again lol



Anyway, I'm kind of tired of embarrassing myself like this, maybe one day I will learn :') If you can relate, feel free to let me know so I don't feel so alone lol...."

Ever since i moved away from home to attend college i've been overwhelmed by all the changes in my life which accompanied the move. On one hand i made quite a bit of friends here which has overall been a net positive, but at the same time i'm taking some pretty hard courses this semester. On the other hand my family's urging me to start pushing out my resume to companies for an internship this summer. Then there's my desire to explore programming and learn a specific skill by myself so I can improve my future career opportunities. I also want to start hitting the gym consistently and learn more about building a physique so I can improve my appearance physically. However, i'm struggling to find balance in all these aspects in my life and i just feel hopelessly overwhelmed and lost as i wasn't facing this sort of pressure in high school and now theres like 10 different things hitting me at once and I dont know what to focus on. Due to this hopelessness and general lack of direction i distract myself with social media to escape my responsibilities and the feeling of not having my goals and priorities in order, which is pretty frustrating, as i'm not doing all that well academically or mentally atm. I'm very hopeful about my future, but I'm also pretty fearful about wasting away this crucial period in my life and ending up with dead end opportunities and becoming a disappointment to myself and my family. Any suggestions on how do i move on from this?"
1254580,3,2023-03-28,Advice/next steps for getting more research exp/next steps for BA Psyc wanting to pursue PhD clin psyc (Canada),hjk830,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1254580/advicenext_steps_for_getting_more_research/,"Hi! I have a BA in psychology (graduated 2 years ago) from UBC. For the 2023 intake, I applied to clinical psychology graduate programs at 7 universities + a government scholarship. I have yet to hear from one school, but so far, I've been rejected by 6 of them (and I nominated 3 out of the 6 for the scholarship, so likely the scholarship is out as well, and plus, interviews have gone out already and I've heard nothing back, so I imagine the last one's a rejection also). Despite knowing how horrifyingly competitive graduate clinical psyc programs are in Canada, I thought I did a relatively good job at preparing for it throughout my degree, so it is a huge bummer. I wanted to get any insight/advice into what to do next/what would be the best way forward to build more research exp and strengthen my application. More context below. Writing this got a little lengthy, so I apologize in advance for it being long to read!

To provide context for where I'm at, I have a competitive GPA (3.95/4.33 or 3.9/4.0 both cumulative and last 2 years). I have multiple years of RA experience in clin psyc labs, with a paid internships in a clin psyc lab and at a hospital in medical psychology, and I was a lab coordinator in one of the above clin psyc labs for about 6 months. I don't have an honours (took a while to decide what I wanted to do, missed the timing) but did an independent research study under a faculty member, presented a poster at an undergrad conference, wrote a manuscript for it, and both of them received awards from the university's psyc department. I'm currently still a part of one of the above labs, and the work here might culminate in a publication co-authorship (unsure as of yet though, and might take 1+ year, so maybe not as relevant). I have some other academic volunteer exp and non-related work exp (had to work multiple jobs throughout). I've been a freelance academic english editor for MDPI for the last year or so, which gives me some insight into the publication process. I don't have much counselling-related exp, but I've heard it's not as important for clin psyc apps.

Just hoping to get some advice as to what I should do next. I can't afford any international or private institutions and I'm not in a position to relocate to the US, Canada offers no terminal clin psyc master's that I know of (and those that exist I imagine would be just as competitive, when I can't get in in the first place). There aren't many (if any??) post-bacc clin psyc diplomas/programs that would give me research exp with good potential for research output that are in Canada and affordable.

The only things I can think of right now to strengthen my application more are to (1) email the admissions committees to see if they would give me any feedback about my applications, (2) email professors in advance, and (3) take the GRE. I don't know if that would strengthen my application enough though. While I don't want to delay my apps too much since that's another year gone, I have thought about also (1) trying to find a research assistant/coordinator position for a year, (2) emailing PIs to ask if I can volunteer as an RA, or (3) finding a community position, like a behaviour interventionist position, for a year before applying for 2025 intake. The thing I'm concerned about is whether a new RA position would lead to any tangible outputs that would make that gap year worth taking. I find that for undergrads without connections, it is very difficult for any of that work to culminate in a product of some kind, especially a publication, unless it's through a course (like the honours program or independent study course). I'm finding it harder to find research opps as well now that I've graduated and no longer have the connection to university resources.

I'm aware there are other paths of BSW--&gt;MSW, counselling psych, and PsyD, but my main interest is in research, and I currently lack the community exp to apply to either BSW/MSW or counselling psyc. Plus, I can't afford a PsyD, and especially in Canada, I feel like it's not regarded as highly if I want to go into academia eventually.

Any recommendations/advice about how to get more research exp or what would be the best next steps from here on out would be greatly appreciated... Are there any post-bacc clin psyc/psyc programs in Canada that are relatively affordable and will give me research experience and potential for research output? Or are there any other post-bacc diplomas that will give me an additional edge? Should I prioritize getting more research exp (any research exp) over getting at least some community volunteer experience like a crisis line? How should I handle feeling like I'm bugging referees so much for asking them to do so much work, esp with multiple years of application? Feeling quite stuck and lost rn. Thank you!"

&amp;#x200B;

**General Info**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian
* Residence: Asia (though I am a US citizen by birth so I think that would make me a domestic applicant? idk)
* Income Bracket: $100k/$200k+
* Type of School: private + competitive (one of the best in the city where I live) It only offers the British high school curriculum (Cambridge O and A levels).
* Intended major: Biology/Biological sciences (I plan to stay on the pre-medicine track)
* Note: I did apply to some combined BS/MDs (combined bachelors and med school programs) which guarantees you a spot in medical school unless you maintain your GPA and other stuff in undergrad. I'm not sure if I was even eligible to be considered in it because only one of the programs mentioned about details for selection criteria of oversea US applicants while the others weren't specific about this. (Only US citizens can apply to these type of programs)
* GPA:  N/A (my school doesn't do GPAs, but I was able to calculate it on my own and came out at around 3.7-3.8 though I'm not entirely sure if it this accurate. In general, I did have straight A results for the past three years after a rocky start at high school.)
* Academic honors: distinction in my Biology O level examinations (top in the country) and first position in my school's Biology A level first year examinations (mocks + midterms exams)
* Standardized testing scores (SAT): 1450 (790 M, 660 RW)

**Activities/Extracurriculars:**

* Took part in multiple MUNs (did get some small personal awards and was the marketing director for my school's MUN event once)
* participated in my school's community service society. (We would invite children from a nearby underprivileged community and do many activities with them)
* took part in a special internship and observer ship program at one of the best medical schools in my city (I collaborated with the medical school's community medicine society and was able to learn &amp; discuss about various topics, attended lectures and was able to get a glimpse of medical school life. This lasted a few weeks and was really fun :))
* took part in a community outreach program at the same medical school (coincidentally it happened during my internship and observer ship. It was more of a community service activity)
* was part of my school's science society and our team once won runner up position at a local Olympiad (didn't get to participate too much in it though)

**Letters of Recommendations:**

* Chemistry teacher: 9/10, he is honestly my favorite teacher. Since the start of my A-Levels he really motivated me a lot to do my best and I was able to strive in Chemistry under him (even though he spoke more in the local language here which I don't really understand very well). I was also among his personal favorite students in class and while I did not get to see what he wrote, I bet it was great. I still of course have to work hard for my A-Level CAIEs now and maintain my consistency in the subject.
* Biology Teacher: 7/10, he did not really know how to write it, so I sort of had to give him a rough draft but at the same time I was busy with my assessments and other things that I feel that I could've given him a better draft lol.
* Internship/Observer ship supervisor: 9/10, I had a good relationship with him and was able to work on so many things with him and his department. I am really glad he took out the time to write it out as he was really busy at the time :)

**Essays**

* 8/10: I wrote about my motivation of doing medicine which came through by seeing the poverty and poor healthcare infrastructure in the country where I'm residing in. My parents and counsellors liked it, but I think it was a bit too general....
* 7/10: I had A LOT of supplements to prepare, especially for the BS/MD programs. They were not too bad but not too good either as most of them were aimed at my extracurriculars which was honestly one of my weaknesses in my application....

**Interviews**

With the one and only WashU and I took my chance. I would give it a 7/10 as I feel like I could've asked more questions as my interviewer led the conversation more than I did.

**Decisions (RD/EA/ED/Rolling)**

* University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou): Rolling - accepted and awarded with $22.5k scholarship.
* University of Missouri-Kansas City (umkc): RD - rejected by BS/MD program but accepted to regular undergrad.
* Maryville University of St. Louis - Rolling: accepted and awarded with 14k scholarship.
* Siena College: RD - rejected by BS/MD program but accepted to regular undergrad.
* University of Iowa: EA - accepted (scholarship yet to be specified)
* University of Pittsburgh: Rolling - waitlisted
* WashU St. Louis: RD - Rejected (this hurt me the most as my dad did his post graduate fellowship from here)
* John Hopkins: ED - Rejected (Didn't expect to get in anyways lmao)
* Case Western University: EA - deferred and then waitlisted after going into RD.
* NYU NYC (main campus): RD - Rejected literally just one hour ago lol while I'm writing this post (depressed though)
* IUPUI (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis): rolling - accepted.
* Stony Brook University: RD - Accepted (might have a scholarship didn't check yet)
* University of Connecticut: RD - Rejected by BS/MD but was surprisingly accepted to undergrad with 19k scholarship. (Though it's still really expensive)
* St. Bonaventure University: RD - Rejected by the BS/MD program.

**Waiting on: Duke, Yale (no hopes for these two in a realistic sense) and Saint Louis University (maybe might have a chance on this one)**

**Personal things to add:**

So, I am from the United States but had to move to Asia a couple of years ago due to personal family circumstances. But the thing is that I've never felt adapted to the new environment and people here. It was and is honestly tough to make friends and develop connections here as I'm not too fluent in the local language either. This is the main reason that I feel like made my high school journey was quite turbulent. During my first two years I was a below average student in terms of grades (with a lot Bs and Cs) and found it hard to motivate myself to do more in extracurriculars. While the pandemic helped me change my academic strategies and perform much better in the remaining three years of high school, I just didn't put in the effort in my extracurriculars (which was due to the different environment and type of people here and the fear of not being to balance it out with my academics as I did not want to take any chances if my grades fell again).

You may also be wondering why I applied to some of the T25/T50 colleges too. Well, honestly, I only wanted to apply to Yale and Johns Hopkins (based on my personal interest even though I never stood a chance) but my parents kind of pushed me to apply to other top colleges too (as they thought I would have a good shot since I come from a pretty complicated Asian background and other stuff) But even despite that I feel like I should've gone test optional for these top colleges as the medians were clearly higher than 1450. However, my counsellor continued to persuade me to send them to these top colleges as it would make me a better applicant than those who did not submit (idk if that's true lol). I should've known better tbh as I was pretty clueless about this. But my extracurriculars were pretty weak too.

I plan to do medicine and now that I have some acceptances at some middle tier to average schools, I'll have to decide soon. I also have the option of doing medicine from the Asian country where I'm currently residing in (which unlike the US does not require any undergrad prior to med school and you can directly matriculate after completing high school). It also takes 5 years (vs 8 years in the USA) and is much cheaper too. But because of my experiences here in middle school and high school outside the classroom and realms of academics and with the lack of connections and issues I've faced, I'm kind of unsure if I want to even consider it here as med school life is really challenging.

Anyways, I've just always wanted to go back to the United States to not only do medicine but also to bring a change in myself both personally and for my family after living here in Asia and now I have the chance to do so (even though it might be a bit more expensive). I feel like I had the potential to do so much better, but I feel my personal circumstances really brought me down. I apologize if this all felt too personal and came across as being cringey and ungrateful. It's just that this has all been over my head for the past few months and did not have anyone other than my parents to discuss this with as I don't really have any close friends here and I thought this would be a great opportunity to share this with you all on this subreddit page which is mostly full of people with 1500+ SAT scores, perfect GPAs and stellar ECs (no hate to them though, they are honestly pretty motivating to me Haha).

I would appreciate any feedback from y'all!

Thank you and good luck with your applications everyone :))

1257woh,5,2023-03-28,"Earned the Entry Level CompTIA Certifications (A+, Network+, Security+), Now What",[deleted],CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1257woh/earned_the_entry_level_comptia_certifications_a/,"Good evening fellow Redditors,

IT student here, with a focus of cybersecurity and networking. I wanted to inquire about your feedback on the matter of the position I find myself in. Having earned the core CompTIA certifications and being a junior student, what possible paths would you recommend?

For context, my sights are set on cybersecurity and networking: network security. I had a realistic roadmap for what certifications would follow suit for this year: Cisco Certified Network Administrator (CCNA) and Cybersecurity Analyst+ (CompTIA CySa+). Are there any other certs you would recommend or suggest for someone with the foundational CompTIA certs that would be realistic?

Unfortunately, I have little to no technical experience (aside from performance based labs and applied scenarios) which don't bode well for the IT industry; I'm currently looking to fix this hinderance through internships.

I also wanted to inquire about potential future certifications that have a focus on network security. I already have knowledge of Cisco's roadmap of certifications and wanted to ask about any vendor neutral certifications that go a step further than the traditional CompTIA certs.

For those who have found themselves in a similar situation, what are you stories and recommendations for someone looking to take the next step and how to get there. Any feedback would be appreciated and best of luck in your studies/endeavors."
1257ypr,0,2023-03-28,Does one year of inconsistent employment look bad?,Majestic_Amoeba9990,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1257ypr/does_one_year_of_inconsistent_employment_look_bad/,"My employment history will be the following whenever I seek out a new job (probably in a year or longer)

University: August 2018-May 2023

Job 1: August 2018- July 2019

Job 2: August 2019-March 2022

Gap for mental health/school focus: April/May 2022

Study abroad: June 2022

Mental health/seeking employment: July 2022
(Basically April-July is an employment gap) 

Job 3: August 2022- October/November (technically the last week of October, so idk if I should round up or not, but I have a gap at the end of the year)

Internship: September 2022-December

Job 4: internship hired me in January 2023-current 

As you can see, up until 2022 I was consistent and had no real gap in employment. 2022 was just a rough year for me, and one could also argue that I spent most of my time unemployed time productively (focused on school, grad apps, internship, and a abroad experience). Will this impact my future employment? I also have non-employment “work” experiences as a research assistant and teaching assistant that I have been doing for over a year now"

**Thoughts**

* Honestly want to get this shit over with. I don’t really know what to expect for Ivy day, considering Test Optional (hoping Cornell pulls through with the Test Blind). Although I got accepted to UCLA, I’d much rather stay on the east coast and not have to worry about OOS tuition for UC’s. Worse case scenario I get rejected everywhere else, sure I’ll feel defeated, but honestly besides academics everything I did EC wise was because I genuinely wanted to do it (not because of college app- maybe except STEM club). I never really thought about applying to T20’s until halfway through my junior year when I saw some of my friends get into good schools and thought I had somewhat of a chance. So nonetheless I still feel somewhat content.

I had been meaning to apply for internships this summer, so when my accounting professor sent out an email that a local tax firm was looking for interns I applied. The interview was easy, they just asked about what hours I was available. They were not requiring any prior experience, but said that 50% of people don’t make it through the first few weeks.

The actual work was mostly entering data into excel, and then applying formulas to the data. It was overall not too complicated, but there were still some things I made mistakes on, and the one thing that was kind of embarrassing is that I’m not very good on computers and they had to explain things like how to save my work/ how to upload files and some other things that I think they were expecting me to already know. By the end of the week though I felt like I had improved a lot and had a solid understanding of everything I needed to know for my job.

On Friday they told me that they were firing me because they felt I wasn’t familiar enough with computers, and they had reviewed my work and found mistakes. I was aware of and understood my mistakes and I had fixed them though.

This whole experience has been pretty discouraging, but I’m just going to try to use it as a learning experience. I was so relieved when I got the job because I wasn’t looking forward to searching for an internship, and now I’m back on square one. If anyone has advice for what I should do/what to take away from this/ how to find useful work experience this summer please let me know."

Don't know how to choose, especially given the rise of AI and mass layoffs.

**Background**: I am a double major in CS and Game Dev, but I was doubting if I should keep making games - so my applications are mostly on the CS side. I am better at the applications side of CS, instead of the theoretical. I am not too good with math or logic, so computer graphics would be hard-ish for me, despite being admitted to the UPenn MS in computer graphics and game tech program - but I do wish to make AI tools for game development.

I have had 4 smaller research experiences, 3 smaller internships abroad, 1 better internship in the US. Whether that will help me land a job or PhD idk.

**PhD**: I'd like to consider doing PhD, but also have no decision on that - I don't know if I'd be good at that or if my backgrounds support it (I have big quantities but low-quality research without papers)

**UCB Con**: As an international student seeking for internships in the US, major downside of Berkeley MEng is the 1-year duration - no summer internship means less chance to land a job at time of graduation. They used to offer extension to 1.5-year and international students can use that summer in between for internships.

Sorry for sounding so negative, I just see no way out from this AI craziness, especially that I can't do AI... (see ChatGPT interpreter if you don't understand why I have this attitude)

I interned at Google in winter 2022. My reviews were excellent and my recruiter said that they were positive that I would get a return offer. First, they said I would get news by the end of summer, then by the ""end of November"", then they said January, and finally March. Few days ago, I got a call from my recruiter saying that all intern conversions are cancelled.

I interned at Amazon in summer 2022. A few weeks after the internship, I got a full time offer. I had negotiated to be fully remote and I accepted the offer. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and Amazon announces the new return to office policy. As I could not move to the city where my office was, I asked for an exception, or to be relocated to the office in the city I currently live in. Both were denied.

Now I have to chose between relocating to the city where the Amazon office is, or find a new job.

I feel really lucky to have had these experiences and I don't blame my recruiters or my ex-managers, but the timing does suck. I guess the lesson is that you should always have a plan C

Did anyone experience something similar?"

1) what’s the differences between the opportunities provided by each school (internships and networking etc)

2) is NUS more competitive than NTU, is it harder to score better in NUS compared to NTU

3) Does EE in NTU have software mods like in NUS

4) is there a difference in job and masters in overseas Uni opportunities for both schools

5) What’s the difference in culture of both schools

125c6gq,104,2023-03-28,Internship Tips,Gullible-Conflict-46,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/125c6gq/internship_tips/,"Good morning to all, I’m a Y2 Business student (have had about 5-6 different internship experiences) and I’ve had friends recently who asked me for tips on applying to internships. Truth be told, the period now is a little late to apply for summer, but you may still try. Do take note to apply at least 4 months in advance in future. For finance students, your cycles might open even one year prior especially for Investment Bankings. 

Without further ado, here’s some tips I can share with all of you (I had quite a few offers for summer): 

Resume stage: 
1. Keep an excel sheet and list down companies in 3 different categories. Easy, intermediate, hard. You increase your chances of a company getting back to you  if you do it this way instead of applying to all the competitive companies (especially of you have 0/minimal experiences). This can range from applying to startups to MNCs. 

2. Put in all your relevant experiences. If you find that your resume is empty, PLEASE do not increase your line spacing, its obvious when you’re trying to do that to compensate and to just “fill in the gap”. Instead, you may list down your involvements in school i.e. projects, competitions. Many of my friends did not include in competitions they did not win in, but I recommend to still put it in if you have space. That way, employers know you at least try to participate. If you don’t include, they don’t know you so they’ll assume you never take part in such things. 

3. Keep your resume to a one pager. Most HR won’t even glance through / beyond 1 page. Highlight your key achievements. Anything 5 years and older you may remove :) 

4. Connect connect connect. LinkedIn is one of the best ways to leverage on getting to know a company culture / speak to the direct managers in the teams you’re keen to work with. Make use of that if you can. Ask questions.

5. Consider projects, competitions and CCAs. If you have zero job experience, being a member of a relevant CCA is better than having nothing on your resume. If you’re keen to enter the finance industry, maybe taking part in competitions and being in NUS Investment Club helps. 

6. Do NOT use Canva for resumes. Most companies especially large MNCs use ATS systems. If your resume is fanciful, the system cannot detect your resume and you’ll be out right away. 

7. Use multiple platforms. Don’t just stick to TalentConnect and LinkedIn. Exhaust all career sites. Some companies only have listings on their own career portals. Look into those. 

8. Be realistic. Some sectors right now might not be doing extremely well i.e. tech. Apply to the industries you believe are / may not be as affected - FMCG is one of them. However, the barrier to enter FMCG is also a bit harder if you have no experiences. Different industries look at different amount of experiences. 

9. Cold emailing. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn’t. Especially for smaller companies, this would work way better compared to an MNC. If you’re keen to join a company, try dropping them an email and find the email on the company site. 

10. Research. Even if you’re desperate, make sure to research properly on the different roles / companies before you apply. Its better to be safe than sorry as many MLM companies are targeting students nowadays. 

11. Speak to seniors. They would know best how to enter specific fields / industries. Get their advice, the do’s and don’ts. 

—————————————————-

Interview stage: 
If you’ve gotten to this stage, congrats! Now all you have to do is practice. 

1. If you haven’t done so already: RESEARCH. Know the company inside out so that you can tweak whatever you want to say to show you are a good fit in the company. 

2. Prepare questions. Do not LEAVE an interview without asking questions. It shows that you have interest in the company enough to ask. Some examples: i.e. Tell me about the day to day of someone in [X role] in this company. OR How will you measure the success of the person in this position etc. 

3. Practice. Instead of memorising an actual script, have a few key points in your mind and pretend that you’re having an actual conversation with your friends about something you really care about. If you care about marketing, talk about how you first dived into that industry. Stand out from people. 

*note: for finance students, please take note that financial advisory roles are NOT relevant to actual finance. Banks also take in Penultimate students all the time, so if you are in Y1-Y2, it might be a bit harder to enter banks, especially IB. 

*note: different companies have different stages. Some companies have tests, some companies have gamified stages, virtual interviews, but this thread is more meant for general internship advice. 

For those who have other tips, feel free to share in this thread :)

125e5kw,1,2023-03-29,Advice on working with my dad,According-Leave-6761,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/125e5kw/advice_on_working_with_my_dad/,"This is going to be a long post and a bit of an emotional mess, but a mess purely because of obligations and helplessness (at least to me). 

I graduated from my master's degree last year and came back home after being away for almost a year (the program was two years long, but the first year was conducted mostly online). After being away for so long I had somehow forgotten what home was like, and how bad it was. 

I don't have a good relationship with my father. I was living in a bubble and assumed that if we pretended to be happy in front of others, we could eventually resolved all our issues and actually be a happy family. But the bubble burst, and I realised that I couldn't be subjected to his behaviour towards me and my mother. I confronted him about his behaviour last year thinking we could talk it out and try to work on fixing our relationship (clearly that didn't happen), and ever since I dread the weekends because he decides each week that is isn't happy with me and what I'm doing. This is relevant because now I have to work with him. He and his partners (3 in total, including my father) started their business 20-something years ago and groomed their kids to eventually take over. I was, for a lack of a better term to describe it, gaslit into studying the subjects I did. I realised that I hate what I studied and only enjoyed being a student upon coming home, and thus realised I'm going to be miserable working at this company. 

I'm also my father's only child, so irrespective of what I do, I'm eventually going to inherit his share of the buisness, which is not the case for his partners' as they have two kids each, and they've already decided who will and won't be joining the business. 

I tried last year to ask my father to let me work elsewhere, as it is in essence a family business, but that caused more drama and me being sent to an internship that is specifically catered to the company. Everyone in my family told me it would build my resume, but they didn't know that there's no actual certification and there's no actual benefit from the learnings unless I join the business. The internship ended in January, and being at home, I've been in an extremely fragile state of mind. 

I couldn't bring myself to even have a conversation with my father as it would either end in what felt like a depressive slump, severe tears, or a shouting match. I eventually told him I'm leaving next year to pursue my PhD, which I want to pursue because I realised I enjoyed teaching, research and in-depth studies of particular subjects and topics, but also because I'd be equipped for an alternative career outside of my father and his company. 

I could just ignore him and leave the house and get a job, save money, and eventually leave everything behind and pursue the PhD, but I cannot leave my mother behind and let her bear the brunt of me finally cutting my father out of my life. Also, his partners are like father's to me, and when they talk about me they look so happy and proud, and have implied that I would have the lead the company in the future, including their kids. 

I dread having to have a conversation with my father, and if I start working at his company, I will have to report to him everyday. The only way I can pursue my dreams once I start work is getting married to my boyfriend, who also wants to take the same educational route, and is actually the one who inspired me to study further. I say that because then my father cannot hold documents he made me sign when I was 18 over my head and say you can't leave. He wants me to get married more than he wants me to work. 

I know I'm in desperate need of therapy, but I haven't found anyone that I'm comfortable unloading my baggade on to. But until I am able to find someone to help me fix my mental health, I need advice on how to proceed. How do I separate my feelings from my job, and keep my father at a distance for my own emotional safety? We don't really talk to each other at home, but when he reprimands me, even when it is justified, all the painful memories from my past bubble up and I become the same little girl asking God to change my dad and some other things that I won't include here as it could be triggering. 

I wouldn't mind working in the company if it weren't for my father as there are aspects that interest me and i feel like I would be able to do a good job, but at the same time, I would be stuck with the man who is the cause of most of my issues. I don't want to burden anyone, nor do I want to disappoint anyone, but I feel so lost and broken, and desperately need guidance from someone who doesn't know my father, as he is considered a decent man by people who don't know how he treats me and my mom, or his behaviour is justified because of the type of society we're from. 

If this post comes accross as entitled or ignorant, I'm really sorry. I just want advice on how to proceed with working, all things considered."

Audio engineers are just theater nerds poaching the title

Biomedical engineers should have just been MEs or they’re buying into the pyramid scheme of academia

Industrial Engineers are just business students who could handle physics 1 but then the word “electric field” got thrown around and they were out

I need to optimise the moment of asking for a job. If its too early I might not have done some good work. So I might get rejected. I will have to drag myself to finish the thesis at a company that rejected me. If its too late, then I will have to live with burden of not having a security of a job.

For context, I was a reasonably competitive student at a massive and very highly competitive public school. I had a very good weighted GPA (took 14 APs) and a decent but not outstanding unweighted GPA. I had perfect test scores and on the activities side I would say I was again decent but nothing outstanding (Varsity sport, minor leadership in a few clubs, some volunteer work and a high school job). My rec letters were probably good but nothing outstanding, and my supplementals were pretty good but my common app essay was mid at best. To put it bluntly, I was a good but unremarkable student in a sea of very competitive students. Most of you here seem to be strong students, and maybe some relate to me in terms of their application.

I applied as a business/econ/polisci major (depending on the school) to 22 schools including 4 Ivies. I believe all except my 1 safety school were T30 give or take. I pretty much just sold my soul from October to January shotgunning these schools. In the end, I wound up with 13 waitlists (none of which I got off of) and 8 rejections from the 21 top schools I applied to. I guess it makes sense, after all I was a student who could hold my own at a top school but I didn't stand out against a lineup of talented students with strong applications. By the time I got to Ivy Day, I was honestly so hopeless and numb that even if I had gotten into one I probably wouldn't have even reacted. My senior year was easily the most miserable year of my life, after all I had worked hard and had placed a lot of pride into where I was going to go to college.

It has now been almost a full year of school at my ""safety"", Indiana University, and I can genuinely say that this could not have worked out any better. First of all, I was offered a substantial amount in scholarships and had a ton of AP credit that allowed me to get out of most of my GenEds because IU is a state school. I have been able to experience the excitement of Big 10 sports and the social life of a large school. I am excelling in my classes and joined a business fraternity where I have met some of the most talented yet chill and personable people in my life. All of them are definitely capable of attending an Ivy and most of them have internships or job offers (mostly in business) that many Ivy league students would still struggle to get. Through my business frat alone, I was able to get an offer for an extremely competitive finance internship as a freshman. On top of that there is no toxic, competitive culture in my circle, everyone genuinely supports each other and wants to have a good time. I really cannot put into words how amazing this year has been for me, but you guys will have to trust me on that. I could go into wayyyyy more detail, but this post is already long enough.

The moral of the story is that while going to an Ivy or another big-name college is amazing (and I really wish y'all the best of luck), it is nowhere near the end of the world if you end up at your safety. It is entirely up to you as to what your college experience is, and honestly being a stronger student at a state school has been perhaps more beneficial to me than being an average student at a T20. I encourage you all to find a school that will make you happy, not one that you only want to attend for the name. Plus like after getting your first job after undergrad, what school you went to doesn't matter a whole ton. My mental health is the best it has ever been, and I know for a fact that if I went to another competitive school that I would be bogged down with stress and other things that would push me to my limit. I know I'm rambling at this point but genuinely I cannot express enough how thankful I am for IU and how thankful I am that the 21 colleges that rejected me led me to the place where I am and the person I am today.

I am not here to be an upvote whore but please upvote this if this helped you so others can see, Ivy Day and college decision season can be very stressful, and I hope that I can help as many people as possible with that. You will end up in the place you are meant to be, everything will work itself out &lt;3

Also feel free to ask any questions, and if you are going into business, IU is an amazing option

TLDR: I got rejected from 21 T30 schools. Attending my safety is the best thing that ever happened to me for a million reasons. Good luck w Ivy Day but I promise it isn't the end of the world by any means"

&amp;#x200B;

context: 21M asian american male, computer science major, 3.87 GPA, 4 internships (1 IT, 1 SWE at big bank, 2 SWE FAANG), good relationships with past managers and was hoping to milk rec letters, officer of competitive programming org at school, brazilian jiu-jitsu enthusiast. will be going back as SWE to one of the mentioned companies this august.

&amp;#x200B;

have not taken GRE but if i become perfect cell within the next two weeks i think i should be able to get 330+

&amp;#x200B;

big question: is the deferred applicant pool generally more competitive than applying during a normal cycle? my thought process is that if i apply with 2-3 YOE, i will not be competitive with other applicants who may have way more YOE under their belt. with a deferred program, i'd ideally have time to work and promo for a few years and gain technical expertise before pivoting. additionally, i would not need to worry about going sicko mode at work and would have peace of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

reasons for pursuing MBA/plans afterward: definitely want to do something entrepreneurial or something more human oriented/less technical down the line. having more decision making power in a managerial role and in regards to whatever i might be working on will allow me to make greater and more fulfilling impact

Now I want to help her fulfill her dream of coming back to the SWE industry.,Shooter913,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/125i5is/my_mom_gave_up_her_career_for_my_brother_and_me/,"I'm not a frequent poster on Reddit, but this is very important to me. My mom is one of the smartest people I know. Before I talk about her, I'll share a bit about myself. I was born in India but grew up in the United States. I've always loved computers, and hence computer science, thanks to my mom. I'm finishing my MS in CS and will be joining a FAANG+ company this summer. My brother was also born in India and raised in the US; he's a talented 10th grader with many more achievements than I had at that age. My brother and I owe a lot of our success to our mom. She sacrificed her career to become a full-time stay-at-home mom and always put our education first. She instilled in us a love for learning and computer science, which has led to our academic and professional achievements. Without her guidance and support, we wouldn't be where we are today. I want to help my mom achieve her dream of working in the computer science industry. 

Mom was born and raised in India. For education, she earned a bachelor's degree in Physics (1987), a master's degree in Computer Science (1990), and worked on her Ph.D. in compiler design (1999). She was also a lecturer at a university in India. When she was trying to have kids, there were a lot of complications, and she had to move a lot for medical reasons to have me. By the time she had me, she had already lost so much that she was determined to always be there for me. So she quit her job and became a full-time stay-at-home mom. She had planned on going back to the industry, as she had a job lined up at IBM before having me, but circumstances kept changing, and it kept getting delayed. We moved to the US in 2010 through my dad's work (also a software engineer), and due to H4 limitations, she couldn't really work. So she spent her time taking care of the house, praying, and learning whatever she could in CS. This overflow of energy is how, when I was in 4th grade, she randomly taught me fundamentals in C, jumpstarting my own love for CS. Now fast forward to my sophomore year in college, I'm grinding LeetCode for interviews, and she sees me and asks me what I'm doing. After my explanation, she asks if she could try, so I gave her the link. Recently, when I went back, I learned that she's been grinding LeetCode so hard, doing four problems a day because she has nothing better to do. She has also done random training courses and internships here and there but nothing substantial. 

Now she has a green card EAD but still doesn't know how to get into the industry. She keeps talking about it and wondering what she could do in the industry. Most entry-level jobs require a ""Class of 2023 Graduate"" or something similar. She's one of the most hardworking, passionate, and smart people I know, and I'm confident she'd ace any interviews thrown her way. I really want to help her. She's nearing 50, and I'm just not sure what to do. She has been there for the ups and downs of our family and always stood by us helping us in whatever way she can. If anyone has similar experiences or any suggestions, I'm all ears! Pay isn't really an issue, she just wants to work and solve problems. 

TLDR - My mom gave up her career and passions for my brother and my success and I want to help her fulfill her dream: get back into the industry as a software engineer.

2) is NUS more competitive than NTU, is it harder to score better in NUS compared to NTU

3) Does EE in NTU have software mods like in NUS

4) is there a difference in job and masters in overseas Uni opportunities for both schools

5) What’s the difference in culture of both schools

I have had one software engineering internship at a well-known microchip company. I transferred a few years ago and changed majors to Data Science.

I was originally gunning for the CS major early on but got burnt out and just wanted to graduate already because I’ve been here for awhile now and feeling burnt out.

I’m super close to graduating (December 2023) with a DS degree but recently, I’ve been feeling like I’m missing out on learning more about computer science, for example operating systems. Also, getting a CS degree from the University would be kinda cool too.

Idk exactly what I want to be doing in the future as a career and I don’t mind being a web app developer. 

I got a B+ in 61A, an A in 61B. I still need a B- in cs70 to declare. I was thinking of taking cs70 this summer and trying to declare but I’m super rusty on math. 

If I were to try to double major in CS, I would probably need another year to finish the upper divs (so probably grad in December 2024). 

I’m taking CS186 right now and would need to retake 61c because I NP’ed it thinking I wouldn’t need the class anymore. School is stressful too though, especially if I needed to take 3 upper div techs for the next 3 semesters. But I feel like this wouldn’t be the worse idea given that the job market is pretty bad right now (I don’t even have an internship lined up for this summer). 

I’m not set in stone on doing this but was curious what you guys suggest I do?"

Problema este ca nu stiu ce sa invat si pe ce sa ma axez, fiecare companie punand intrebari diferite si avand tech stack-uri diferite. Astazi am avut un interviu pentru o pozitie de internship in care am ""grilled"" cu foarte multe intrebari despre multi-threading, securizare (nu, nu e CrowdStrike sau BitDefender, nici macar nu face securitate compania asta) (eg. Ce sunt PIN-urile in Spring Boot?) si design patterns. (Interpreter &amp; Composite). Alte firme au ce au cu tehnologiile lor, nu conteaza ca n-ai folosit X limbaj de programare in viata ta, o sa te intrebe din el.

Mi se pare ca cel putin, in ultimele cateva luni, dificultatea interviurilor de juniori a crescut drastic, sa fie asta din cauza faptului ca a picat piata si acum se cauta doar top 1%?

* Framework-ul de frontend/backend
* SQL/NoSQL DBs
* DS&amp;A
* Design Patterns
* System Design
* Multithreading &amp; Concurrency
* Cloud providers
* Software testing

I wanted to share how I spent my Year 1 summer with the NUS Enterprise Summer Program. I felt that it was well spent and served as a good break from school while also allowing me to learn about something new (and get 4MCs).

So I’ll be sharing my experience at the NUS Enterprise Summer Program in Entrepreneurship in 2022.

A little more about myself: I am currently a second-year computer science student from Residential College 4.

I participated in the NUSSP 2022 program last year and would like to share my experience as a participant. Like many first-year students, I didn't do an internship during the summer and instead focused on experiences that would build my portfolio, meet new people, and be fun. So for my first-year summer, I did Orbital and took part in this summer program. Our batch was pretty lucky as it was the first time since COVID that it was held in person. I recall that the two batches before me were held virtually, which I presume wouldn't have been as fun as being back to physical.

More about what we did during the 12-day program.

Firstly, we stayed at either Cinnamon or Tembusu college within UTown for the duration of the program, and there was catered breakfast and lunch every day. The food was good, and most importantly was not RC/Hall food. It was also a great experience for those who hadn't had the opportunity to stay on campus before and experience student life in the hall, like late-night sports and going to supper stretch.

Secondly, onto the program itself. For every day of the program, there was a set schedule that usually started from 8 am to 5 pm, which included entrepreneurship classes, listening to panel discussions with founders and VCs and workshops. We also visited a bunch of companies/startups such as Shopback, Grab, Prudential, Alibaba, and even Social Enterprises. We also had a dragon boat activity on a Saturday morning, and the rest of the weekend was free time.

The first few days of the program also emphasized and had a lot of bonding activities. For our batch, we were grouped into clans of 10 people (5 local students and 5 ASEAN students) so that we could get to know each other better. Activities like ice-breaking games in orientation camps and activities like amazing races going around Singapore and seeing landmarks and attractions allowed us to show our ASEAN friends Singapore and try out local stuff. 

There were also some cool cultural exchange activities to learn more about the different ASEAN countries, such as simple language sharing, and country and culture sharing, and even our friends from Thailand led a Thai cultural dancing workshop teaching how to wear their traditional clothes and cultural dances.

In the last week of the program, you'll be preparing for the pitching part where you will be forming groups with the entire cohort to come up with a business idea or join someone else's business idea and pitch it at the finale. At the same time, there were some pitching workshops and business idea generation workshops. We also had a practice pitching session in front of industry leaders that gave us feedback on our pitches to get ready for the final one. The proper final pitch was at the end in front of founders and venture capital judges. Though I would say that you don't need to have a solid business idea before joining the program as the point of the program is to mix with other people and come up with one.

So now you're asking, what happens after 5 pm? Actually, it's up to you since after 5 pm is all free time for you and the ASEAN participants. This was the part that most of us remembered as we usually bring out our ASEAN friends to local attractions, bring them to eat local food at hawkers and chill together. I remembered that a few of our clans got together and went to Sentosa for a beach day and also had a picnic at Marina Barrage. These were the parts that I remember the most as it was pretty cool to get the time to know one another better.

Although, I must say that doing this for almost 2 weeks straight was pretty tiring as every day we had to wake up and get ready by 8 am and go through the scheduled program each day. There were also some COVID complications as a small handful of participants had to be quarantined halfway through the course. But I believe that problem will not be an issue anymore, and I think the program this year will truly be back to how it normally was run many years ago. Back on the topic of commitment levels, if you are planning to do an internship at the same time, or have other commitments like other orientation planning for your halls/RC/faculty, it would only make the program more tiring for you, but then again, I do know friends that did that and still enjoyed the program.

The benefits of the program: it was fully covered by the Temasek Foundation scholarship that is offered to Singaporeans/PR through the same interview for NUSSP. It was also 4MCs pass/fail and combined with Orbital, I was able to clock 8 MCs worth of electives over the summer while not being as stressed as taking a summer school computing module.

With that, I recommend all my friends who are available during the period to join the program. It's a great opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship if you were just a bit curious about it and make friends with our ASEAN neighbours. It was cool making friends with people from Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, and Japan (apologies if I missed a country).

I also had a lot of questions from my juniors about the application and interview process. The application process seems daunting, but I would advise keeping it very simple. I recommend sticking to a simple 1-page proposal like this ([https://www.growthink.com/one-page-business-plan-template](https://www.growthink.com/one-page-business-plan-template)) and a 3-minute video. I think in the interviews, they were just looking for individuals that show some entrepreneurial traits and would be a good ambassador to Singapore and NUS.

Also, the program is open to all NUS Undergraduate students and any faculty. 

To note, I was in Year 1 and was doing Orbital Artemis at the same time, so if you have questions about Orbital, you can message me. Though I would recommend accounting for the 2 weeks that you will not be coding as much and including that in your software development plan to account for, especially if you want to build something substantial or keep up the Artemis status.

I'm sharing my experience because the application for the summer program is closing on 31st March, and I recommend everyone to give it a shot. It won't be something that you regret.

Let me know if you have any other questions about it and hopefully I can answer them or maybe previous alumni can answer too.

I got a IT help desk job when I was a freshman (upgrade from working in Walmart, lol) and worked my way up to sys admin, all while in school for computer science.

Now I’m about to graduate and I feel stuck in IT. I make 75k and I repeatedly get emails for jobs that pay 90k. Add in my CS degree and experience I can get a high end IT job relatively easily. 

But, I’m screwed regarding becoming a software engineer/developer. I don’t have any experience except school coding wise (except for writing scripts). And I feel like if I were to become a super junior software engineer I’m restarting my career, definitely won’t get a job making 90k (especially in my MCOL state and the current job market for devs) 

I also am realizing that IT jobs seem more secure then software engineering ones (from what I’ve seen). I live in a state with a LOT of startups and so many of them are having a shit ton of layoffs. 

I tried getting a software engineering internship but I kept bombing the coding interviews. 

I feel like I’m just way better at IT stuff. 

What should I do?"

Respins de HR pentru ca ma considera ""supracalificat""",Sickvicious,programare,https://www.reddit.com/r/programare/comments/125rqu1/help_respins_de_hr_pentru_ca_ma_considera/,"Long story short: Trecut de 30 de ani, fara facultate in domeniu, cu o conditie medicala dubioasa care imi afecteaza abilitatea de ma deplasa dar nu imi afecteaza cu nimic abilitatea de a lucra remotely. 

Nu sunt total paralel cu IT-ul, am lucrat in cateva agentii pe partea de web design/web development. De 4 ani traiesc din freelancing, insa problema e ca am lucrat doar pe chestii destul de basic(html, css, javascript, wordpress, mult bug fixing, maintenanta site-uri vechi, interfete UI pentru produse IT etc). Din motivele economice actuale evidente, m-am decis sa imi caut un job normal, stabil la o firma. Tot citind pe aici mi-am dat seama ca poate programarea chiar nu e pentru toata lumea si uitandu-ma putin pe leetcode mi-am dat seama ca probabil nu as trece de un interviu tehnic mai riguros fara sa am acces la google. 

Am decis sa ma reorientez spre un post de QA/Support: am invatat, facut cv m-am pregatit si am aplicat in 6 locuri, la firme cat de cat mari unde am gasit review-uri bune (2 internship, 4 entry level/junior - pentru ca nu am experienta hands on cu aceste roluri) in ultima luna si am fost mirat ca, chiar am primit raspuns de la toate 6 (4 pe mail si 2 telefoane). Primul raspuns a fost ca din pacate prefera doar studenti, lucru totally understandable, celelalte 3 mail-uri erau ceva in genu: ""suntem impresionati de background-ul si experienta ta insa acesta este un post entry level si nu credem ca e potrivit cuiva cu experienta ta"". 

La cele 2 telefoane primite, am incercat sa le explic situatia si sa cer detalii dar mi-au spus ca posturile entry level sunt de obicei pentru oameni tineri la inceput de drum sau pentru cei mai in varsta care fac reconversie profesionala spre IT si nu pentru oameni cu experienta in domeniu. Nu am mintit cu nimic in cv, trebuia?

Mentionez faptul ca nu am pretentii financiare deloc, sunt dispus sa particip la un internship neplatit sau sa lucrez pe minim pe economie pe un post de junior atata timp cat am o renegociere la 6-12 luni in cazul in care firma e multumita de munca prestata de mine. Deci nu pe considerente ca as fi cerut prea mult am fost respins.

Ce ar trebui sa fac? Sa mint in cv ca am lucrat la Kaufland si ca nu stiu ce e un API? ca fiu eligibil pentru un post entry level.

Apreciez orice sfat fie in comentarii sau in dm. As aprecia si sfaturi despre ce ar trebui sa imi pun in cv ca sa imi creasca sansele sa ajung macar la un interviu. Multumesc!

TL:DR: Batran si vai mortii mei, nu ma cheama nimeni la interviu ca au impresia ca sunt prea calificat pentru rol."

I'm about to graduate highschool in January and I'm just kind of lost as far as what exactly I should do to set myself up for success.

Right now I'm studying for the CompTIA ITF+ and A+ (I used my college acceptance info and got the 50% off)
Working a paid internship for my local bank under the head of cybersecurity; I head the tech support (only a team of 2 lol) at my local library. 
My girlfriends mother is higher up at a company that makes some computer components like motherboards and such, and is helping me get a part time job for the summer.
I'm accepted to my local community college for networking and cybersecurity. 

My conundrum is that some people think I'm going to fast, some people tell me I should be doing way more and my family has no clue since the most educated profession before me was working in a glass factory. I'm sure that my passion is hardware and networking and working on computer parts rather than coding or anything like that, and I seem to really enjoy what my supervisor does which he says is a combination of systems admin and IT support services. So I'm coming to a place with people that have been through all this looking for advice, thank you for anything! 
Also I'm aware I won't start off making 100k, I'll be lucky for half of that where I live in the US, but I'm exited to learn and I'm fine with the fact that I'll be working my way up over time. I just want to set myself up so that my peak isn't level 2 helpdesk, I want to get all the way to Sr Systems admin or something like that, not totally sure yet but I feel I have a bit to figure out my goals.

I graduated high school in 2020 with 3.64 GPA. I didn't get into any colleges except for a few but I couldn't afford to go ( applied to US during Covid-19). Tried again. Some luck. Got a few good acceptances with some merit scholarships but still wasn't enough for full 4 years. Tried again for a 3rd time. No luck. Put a lot of money (my high-school asks for a very hefty fee which is high key illegal everytime you want your transcripts to be officially sent to universities) and work into my applications but still no luck. I can't do computers science in my home country since you need to have a math in a levels plus other entry exams for which I was too burned out to do and my country's education system is...lacking to say the least.

Reluctantly decided to do an online degree at University of London (Coursera). Just got done with first semester and got a first (which is like A and above in UK). I applied to internships (didn't get in to many of them and still waiting on the last remaining one). I also applied to University of Florida online and just heard back today after obsessively checking my portal every day. REJECTED.

I have to now pay the fee for the second semester which is starting in April if I want to continue with my education at University of London. I really don't care for it tbh. I find no joy in doing my courses online and the love I had for computer science is mostly gone because of all of this. 

I am told by my family to stick it out and maybe apply for a summer abroad at UCL or any other university (all out of pocket). Or I could visit my sibling in the US this Summer. Or I can change my major....I always wanted to combine humanities like eng literature, fashion, arts and other stem subject with comp science. Kind of like what brown university's curriculum is.

Feeling stuck and lost in life. Any passion or interest i had in CS has gone. I am now wondering if CS or University is for me. I don't know what should I do now. Reapply again for bachelor's? Transfer? But I think most good universities don't accept credits online universities even if it is recognized and accredited institution. 

I had a lot of dreams and ambitions and life goals mapped out since I was like 13 and they have all gone poof. Every morsel of hope has been squeezed out of my body. I am depressed and I sleep in a lot. My potential is wasted. I so wanted to be independent and free and on my feet but I rarely ever leave the four walls of my bedroom at my parents house.. I highly feel like i failed my parents and teachers and feel like a joke in my sad pitiful situation. I am so not looking forward to the next semester of school or this year in fact. I just want the earth to swallow me."

I have a lot of regrets coming out of this application cycle, as I feel that I wasn't able to bring out my application's potential due to the lack of cohesive storytelling, and extreme procrastination (Both problems I brought upon myself).

I still want to try and give transfer admissions a shot next year if possible. I have skimmed through the subreddit, and I find that good essays and a captivating story go a long way in the process, and that maintaining college GPA is essential. I will be involving myself with more ec's in college that hopefully help me build a better story, but what else can I do to prepare my application? I will be mentioning some basic stuff about my application below.

**Demographics:** Indian International Male

**EFC**: somewhere around 40-45k

**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1540 (780 rw, 760 math)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** School does not rank

**Coursework:** CBSE curriculum. 9th - 94%, 10th - 93%, 11th - 97.8%, 12th - somewhere around 94. Self studied and took 3 AP's.

**Awards:**

1. Won National Environment based comp (2000+ participants)
2. 1st place at state level stem competition
3. School excellence award for consistent performance
4. AP scholar
5. Trinity Grade 1 guitar with distinction

**Extracurriculars:**

1. U-18 team state cycling captain, represented state at nationals.
2. Self conducted research in the domains of environment and machine learning, published in peer-reviewed journal. Will be presenting findings to professors this summer.
3. Research Assistant at a conservation non-profit, once again related to environment and AI (training models on collected data).
4. Self-programming, been coding all 4 years of hs.
5. ML intern at a software firm.
6. Founder of local chess camp, ran all 4 years of hs in summer break.
7. Team leader on plastic management awareness/cleaning campaign in a Himalayan hill station.
8. Lead guitarist in school choir, part of small band and performed at local venues.
9. Speaker/Debater at school, won some best debater awards (only school level)
10. School Basketball Team Captain, lead team to interzonal semis.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Essays were probably my weakest point in this application cycle, and the thing that I'll work the most on for transfer admissions. My school was not very supportive and I had to write my LOR's myself and get them signed. Hopefully I can find university professors who will provide good recommendations.

Please offer advice on how I can best tackle transfer admissions. Is it even worth trying with my demographics, since I've seen that transfer rates are even lower than freshman rates at many top schools. I'd mostly aim for the best schools (Gtech, ivies, other T20's)."

I recently got accepted into Berkeley MEng in EECS data science &amp; systems and UofT ECE MASc and am having a hard time choosing between the two.

I want to pursue a R&amp;D career in the tech industry, but I currently don't have the commitment to do a PhD, so I chose to apply to masters programs to have the option to work or pursue PhD in the future. These two programs are very different, with MEng being completely industry oriented and MASc being almost completely research oriented. I would really appreciate any advices on choosing between the two.

**Berkeley MEng**

Pros: 

1. Well known school and department
2. In the bay area -&gt; more opportunities in tech jobs
3. Potential for working with Berkeley faculty on a capstone project (maybe I can leverage this to get a RA and apply for PhD later?)

Cons:

1. Expensive
2. Not research focused, does not prepare well for future PhD or research-based career (but might be able to get some research opportunities like mentioned above?)
3. Heard MEng doesn't carry as much weight as MS even in industry? (can someone confirm/deny this?)
4. Short 9-month program paired with bad economic timing means no internship and find a job can be challenging?

&amp;#x200B;

**UofT MASc**

Pros:

1. Fully funded plus modest stipend
2. Get to do research so might be easier to pursue PhD in the future
3. Close to friends and family

Cons:

1. Not as prestigious
2. 24-month program -&gt; PI hesitant on allowing internships unless in top companies
3. Focus on computer systems research (not very familiar since all my past research experiences were in AI/ML)
4. If I end up not liking systems research, 2 years is a lot to find that out

is it worth it to delay everything so much to take this co op? my summer internship said i could continue with them part time in the fall, which would give me more internship experience without having to delay graduation. however i’m not particularly interested in manufacturing or working at that company after graduation i was just really desperate for this summer lol. 

in my mind, having experience with a bigger company would be beneficial when job searching. also, i don’t think i want to do manufacturing after i graduate either. on the other hand it’s such a long time to delay graduation and i want to get out asap.

my parents think it would be stupid to take it and should just focus on my degree. my friends are split. i’m itching to take it so bad, not insignificantly because of the money, but idk if i’ll regret it. imagining my bank account after those few months is so mouthwatering. the work itself also seems cool too lol.

I'm a burnt out sysadmin dying to make a career change.  I want it like oxygen.  The problem is I live in an area that has literally 0 SWE jobs or internships, so that makes it very difficult.  There has been an uptick in entry level IT roles however, but right now I have all my eggs in one basket.  If I get laid off during the (potential but maybe certain) recession, I feel that I would never be able to achieve what I make now (approx 55k) in my area.

I'm literally trying to land a SWE position.  My resume is heavy with IT support, but I've listed and discussed some of my college projects on it in Java/Python.  I am not trying to ask repetitive questions here, so I'll take a more unique approach - for those who have had issues landing a CS related job lately, what did you do?  

My issue is the area I am in, I am in deep.  I have a house and I am working on it, as well as working full time.  I've been told, if I move, I would be moving alone (without my family) which is, to say the least, disheartening but I get it.  In the grand scheme of things, what is $10,000 more when you have to maintain two mortgages and live separately from my family would basically destroy me emotionally.

So, I'm really looking for something remote but something like 90% or more remote jobs require significant experience, and out of 400 applicants, I don't stand a chance.

Any advice, tips, or even criticism is accepted.  I have researched this ""problem"" a lot and some advice was to essentially create a project.  I've also heard that personal SWE projects are typically ignored.  Basically, I feel like I'm spiraling out of control seeking out jobs and getting a touch of impostor syndrome, wondering if I made a mistake, etc.

The other thing I am itching to do is look at bootcamps, or similar ""pay us a percentage of your income for 2 years if and only if we help you land a SWE job"" type of companies, but I've been told to avoid those, and I'm not crazy about giving up like $10k for something like this, I'd rather be an underpaid entry level SWE.

Thanks!"

We started dating in high school. 

Our relationship was as good as they came. Better than most of our peers at the time . We communicated well, never fought and argued rarely, we supported and uplifted each other in everything we did, we had fun, we enjoyed each other’s company, we were really close friends before we started dating. Etc. Everything felt right. 

Then, college came into the picture. We both applied to the same university that’s 9 hours away from our home town. It has great programs for both of our career prospects, not just because we wanted to go to the same university together (Although that was a bonus). I got accepted, he didn’t. We decided to give long distance a try, under the agreement that he’ll try to transfer next year and hopefully get in. 

Well, fast forward to almost a year later. Our relationship has been through it. I left feeling pretty secure and stable in the relationship, thinking we could do it. But, he wasn’t ready. LDR kinda brought out the worst of ourselves. First semester was awful. We fought every week, and it felt like we were hitting a brick wall every single time. Arguments that used to be solvable through conversations and communication in the past, were now just us going in circles. We couldn’t see each other much either. Overall it just sucked. This semester we’re doing better and in therapy. Except, now we’ve become incredibly busy. We try to make time for “movie nights” on FaceTime one night every weekend, since frequent calls and texts aren’t always guaranteed with our busy schedules and time zone differences. 

But, I realized… it still isn’t enough. My mental health was declining. I cried so much for him one month, it was almost kinda concerning. I like to think we’re pretty independent and individualistic from each other. We have our own hobbies, clubs, academic goals, social life, etc. I like to think that’s healthy right? At least we’re not codependent to each other. Except, after spending a pretty lonely Valentine’s Day, I realized holy shit, this is really depressing for me. I’m not sure I can do this anymore.

We had our anniversary weekend last week, and I had felt so disconnected from him from the lack of physical intimacy in general. Not sex, exactly, but just the lack of his presence. It felt as though for the past few months I didn’t really have a boyfriend. I dont blame him, but the fault lies in our situation I guess. It just felt like I didnt really know him anymore, and that we had grown apart or became pretty different as people. Being away from home (my home life was toxic) has definitely made me grow into a different person for sure. I’m not the same person I was in august. And I’m not sure if that accounts to why I dont feel like I click with him anymore. 

We will only get busier. And I’m not sure I can guarantee time for him. I’m not sure he can either. I have an internship this summer in a different city, so more time away still. He applied to some other schools besides my university, and got accepted to one 3 hours away from my university town. It’s a great school for his career prospects. And it looks like he may go there. 

I’ve talked about it to some extent with him, but it seems like he thinks our situation is not great, but doable. That he has faith in our relationship. He thinks we can persevere it. He thinks 3 hours away compared to the 9 hour difference is better. That we’d see each other every weekend etc. Except, I dont. I dont have faith anymore, just doubts. I dont think I can do LDR no matter how far away we are from each other. I’ve grown unhappy with our situation. And thinking about doing this for more years possibly makes me even more sad. But I love him, I want him in my life. He’s my best friend. He’s a great guy. The thought of losing him scares me. 

I know these feelings aren’t fair for him or myself. I plan to have an open honest conversation about it with him in person. But idk… should that conversation lead to the possibility that we should break up? Or should I give it a chance still? I fluctuate between these two things often, but I feel like the doubts are winning over. Or maybe they’re genuine grounds on breaking up. Idk anymore. 

TLDR; Currently doing LDR with my (f19) bf (m19) of 3 years. We started dating in high school. I dont think I can do LDR anymore but I dont want to lose him."

original post, march 29th:

i have no idea what happened. i think my essays honestly, to a person who isn't my dad or me, wouldn't have come across as that bad. but maybe it was. i also don't think my recommenders gave me horrible recs or anything, i don't think they would do that and my history wouldn't even give anything bad for them to write about.

yes, i am disappointed. i'm still hanging on to hope that i'll get into one of my reaches but honestly, after getting rejected so much from schools with higher accept rates, i don't know if i should even hope. i might also need to take a gap year to work and get some money, so i have no idea what to future holds for me. maybe community college and transfer? who knows. but i'm not going to let this get the best of me, the only way to not let this get to me is to keep trying and working hard. so that's what i plan on doing regardless.

I just started a computer science masters program but I'm having second thoughts since I love statistics and urban environments. I really like the idea of working with spatial data, in a data analyst or scientist role. Plus I did undergrad in computer science + statistics and have done an internship in analytics as well as software development, I feel well equipped on the statistics/programming side.

I pretty much have two options to switch my program: data science or urban informatics.

The data science program would essentially be machine learning + 2 spatial analysis classes, where the urban informatics would be 3 spatial analysis classes, a bit of visualization, some stats, a bit of policy(but no machine learning).

I feel like machine learning is really important but I did cover it in undergrad.

Which would you choose?(also, if this question would be better answered in a different sub, let me know.)

Surprisingly, I’m not actively suicidal, but I see everything going on, and I can’t stop it.  I’m only one person and it makes me powerless.  I thought maybe if I wrote it in my manuscript in an allegorized way, I’d be dealing with it better, but I don’t even have the energy to write anymore.  For reference, I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety since middle school, had my ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) confirmed in my junior year high school (though my parents helped me get the right therapy much earlier on in my life), and I started suffering from depression when COVID hit (my freshman year of college), and it’s just been downhill since, it feels like.

Sure, I have good-ish days, and a decent support group (parents, sisters, best friend, and boyfriend), but today I felt it be not too good.  Woke up in physical pain, heard more about Nashville which reminds me why I could never have kids and why I dropped my Education major, got lectured by my Book Club team (I’m president, which was FORCED onto me because the other girl left) because I haven’t been more productive (when I’ve been so burnt out on my other things to prep for graduating college).  Oh, and don’t get me started on my bodily autonomy becoming a thing of the past in certain states (why I’m probably too nervous to have sex properly, even though I  live in the Northeast for home and college).

I wonder if I’m even good enough anymore.  How can I be a productive member of society if I can’t even do the ONE thing I was brought on Earth to do, which is to write? Because writing was my life and I still want it to be (and hell, I still want to publish my work), but now it drains so much out of me when I do it outside of classes or internships.  And hell, I can’t even please my partner right (he’s super understanding about it and knows I’m a naturally anxious person and knows we’re gonna figure it out together so I can be comfortable, too).

I do see a therapist on campus once every two weeks and she knows I’ve been dealing with anxiety, but this is a newer low for me, but not unheard of in my family (though they did bounce back eventually).  But can I bounce back?  I’ve been resilient for so long (almost died at birth, bullied to hell and back up until college, survived a pandemic, faced betrayal from people I genuinely thought were my friends, etc), but for how much longer can I keep my resilience? 

Any support or life advice would be greatly appreciated."

It’s also really hard for me to find jobs that I think I might like because you can’t search for “Computer Engineering” as the job title and you can’t search by degree required. Also some job postings have really vague job duties which makes it hard to tell if I’m interested in the work. To give more background, I’ve done some testing/software sort of work in the automotive industry for one summer (mostly intern bitch work) and I’m currently at an internship doing embedded software engineering for a medical device company. I really like the company I’m with now but I hated my company last summer. I’ve never really liked software all that much, I don’t mind doing coding but I don’t like object oriented coding at all. I also will be working as a test intern this summer and I’m hoping I like that more but I don’t feel like I’m finding anything I’m interested in or am good at. I really liked my digital logic class and computer organization class but struggled doing a lot of the math for some of my circuits classes. I’ve got the basics but I was by no means exceptional. Am I doomed if I don’t want to do object oriented programming but don’t want to do circuit design either? I also don’t want to specialize in something super niche because life happens and I’d like my skills to be transferable between companies. Anybody else have a similar experience or want to share how they found a job doing something they enjoyed despite not having experience in it? Even just sharing your job title with a bit of information about the day to day might help."

**Letters of Recommendation**

I read both of my teacher recommendations. Honestly, these were amazing and I couldn’t be more grateful. In length, they were nothing crazy (600 - 700), but in terms of content, they were completely personalized. Other than the advice that y’all have probably seen everywhere about teachers including unique anecdotes and tying these back into how your character traits will benefit the school in question, I was lucky enough to have my teachers do something especially special for me. It is not very often that you notice teachers including comparisons in their letters of recommendation. Phrases like, “the best in my class,” “the top student,” “one of my favorites,” “most enjoyable to write for,” and “will be one of the few that go on to the big stage” are phrases that exemplify how strongly a teacher advocates for you. These phrases can be deal-breakers, as the letter of recommendation is the only component that allows for someone other than you to speak on your behalf. Regarding my counselor recommendation, unfortunately, I do not have access to it, but I am probably one of the closest students to him in my class. He also happens to be the IB Coordinator and the Quiz Bowl Sponsor.

**Interviews**

This was super enjoyable and probably my favorite part of the entire process. Although Penn claims that this interview is more-so for you to ask questions and to get to know the school, my interviewer practically guaranteed that she would write a stellar report. Out of the 90 minutes that we spoke for, only 30 were actually devoted to her asking me questions. The remaining 60 minutes were just us talking about… Life? It got to the point where she taught me how to make croque monsieur (it’s basically a French grilled cheese). I actually lost my note sheet, as my interview was back in November, but if I remember correctly, the following were the questions (the part that y’all readers probably care about) asked: “Introduce yourself by telling me three things about yourself,” “Tell me about your favorite extracurricular activity and its impact on your life,” “Tell me about what inspired you to want to study business at Penn, and specifically at Wharton,” and “Tell me about why you want to be a part of the Huntsman Program and why you chose the target language that you chose.” It’s important to note that while these do appear to only be 4 questions, the interview is supposed to be conversational, so many follow-up questions were asked in between.

**Essays**

Especially for someone of my demographic, I haven’t experienced many of the shared struggles or common experiences that most speak of in their essays. With that being said, I believe that I have also experienced many things that others of my background have not, so that probably made my essays a bit more unique. Without revealing too much, my personal statement was about how I combined my own struggles and attachment to the community to engage in three unorthodox activities. My supplements went into depth regarding these three activities. I’d say that this was a very risky strategy, considering that if one of the essays didn’t really hit home with the readers, the rest would also fall flat. Luckily, this was successful. One thing that I would definitely suggest to applicants in general, especially for Penn, is to look at a school’s mission statement and “values” (just Google \*school name\* “values”) and ensure that all of your essays showcase at least three of those values and make it a prominent theme throughout them. Additionally, take advantage of the UStrive Platform. Trust me, I haven’t been paid to advertise or anything like that, but it was a life-saver. College consultants can charge thousands of dollars, but with UStrive, if you choose the right mentor, you can get an even better experience completely free of charge.

I plan on getting an entry level IT position out of college but I’m trying to look towards the future. I really love web development and have been learning that in my free time. With all that being said if I wanna make a career in development should I go back and try and get a masters or a second bachelors in CS? I know of programs like OSU’s post-bacc and WGU’s accelerated CS bachelors are popular options. If all I want to do is full stack web development should I just save the money from a degree? I think enrolling in some type of CS program even if it’s a masters would be beneficial for internship eligibility. I'm just wondering if I could benefit from a structured CS program and have that boost my resume when trying to break into the industry. What do you all think?"

Today, a sophomore was really sad about their first-try SAT score-- a 1390. In 8th grade, my friends constantly talked about getting college counselors and preparing for the SAT. The other day, a freshman said ""MIT and Stanford are my reach schools,"" while another chimed in with the ""Carnegie-Mellon is my dream school, but my chance for that flew out the window long ago."" Even as a freshman, people around me are constantly talking about their new internships (obtained through daddy's connections of course) or the new SAT prep book they found. Talking about grades is all anyone is interested in, and I thought I was alone and a failure for not having a 4.0. But turns out, there are other people; silenced out of fear of judgement. 

I'm so done being surrounded by all these people who I can never be better than. It's the type of environment where I don't even feel special for taking Pre-Calc or Honors Chem, and instead become disappointed I couldn't have skipped *two* math courses over the summer or beaten the system to somehow take an AP when I couldn't"

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: Black/hispanic
* Residence: LI, NY 
* Income Bracket: Low Income
* Type of School: Large Public School
* Hooks: URM, ROTC

**Intended Major(s)**: Medical Anthropology/Cultural Anthropology/Anthropology 

**Academics**
* GPA: 100.07 (W), UW Unknown
* Rank: N/A
* Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc: 8 APS, rest even mix of honors and regular classes. School bans APs for freshman, 3 per year (sophomore year it’s impossible to take more than 2 because of prerequisites). 
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Lit, AP Calc BC, AP Bio, Gov, Health, JROTC

**Standardized Testing**
* **SAT I:** 1430 (680RW, 750M). Did not report this to Northwestern and Duke, submitted everywhere else. 
* **AP/IB:** Research (5), USH, Psych (4), World, Seminar (3). I forgot to submit this to my EA and ED schools. I reported all my scores everywhere else.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**
1. Section Leader at local churches choir. Accompanied by high involvement in church activities.
2. JROTC High leadership position. High involvement. 
3.  JROTC Drill Team Member. High involvement.
4. Tutor, Tutoring club. Medium involvement, I only did this my junior year. I explained in my additional info section that the organization halted tutoring. 
5. Yearbook head of journalism. Medium involvement.
6. Member of large activism/community service organization. Medium involvement but high impact. 
7. Summer Internship on healthcare (projects, presentations, classes on all sectors of healthcare). High involvement but only 6 weeks.

**Awards/Honors**
1. ROTC Scholarship
2. Girls state! 
3. AP Scholar w/ Distinction
4. National Hispanic &amp; African-American Recognition Programs
5. National Honor Society (??) 

**Letters of Recommendation**
* **Guidance Counselor (10/10):** He let me read it and also made it really personal. I think his letter resembled my character really well. 

* **Gov Teacher (9/10):** I didn’t get to read this rec but he is known for writing good (and slightly embellished) letter of recs. 

* **Crim Justice Teacher (6/10):** He let me read it and I felt like the essay is generic. It doesn’t add anything to my application but it definitely doesn’t paint me in a negative light either. 

**Interviews**

* **Barnard:** Interviewed for CSTEP. I would say the interview was an 8/10; I easily connected with my interviewer but there were some questions I could’ve answered better. 

* **University of Rochester:** Alumni Interview; super great! Loved my interviewer a ton :)

**Essays**
*Common App*
I started brainstorming my essay March of my junior year (perfect time to start them, IMO). Finalized my essay for ED1; after my rejection, I edited the essay (not heavily) and I think it improved the quality so much. 

My essay was about my curly hair and my journey of its self acceptance. Throughout the essay, I continuously referenced barbie dolls and the way society compared me to one. I continued this idea throughout the entire essay and I think it worked really well. Everyone thinks I’m a good writer so I had a lot of fun writing this essay! 

*Supplementals* 
For all of my Why Us essays, I discussed my passion for medicine, how my chosen major addresses this, and why the school was a good fit for my physician career. I had barely any medicine  ECs so I felt it was extremely important to express why I want to pursue medicine. 

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*
* Barnard College (Committed!) 
* Northwestern University (still shocked) 
* University of Southern California (insane)
* University of Rochester
* Villanova University
* Case Western Reserve University 
* Fordham University (EA)
* Lehigh University 
* SUNY Binghamton University 
* SUNY Stony Brook (EA)
* SUNY University at Buffalo (EA)

*Waitlists:*
* Boston College 
* Boston University  
* Northeastern University (EA deferred)
* UNC Chapel Hill

*Rejections:*
* NYU (ED1)
* Duke

**Additional Information:**

In my additional info, I thoroughly clarified my home life. As a primary caretaker for my siblings, I couldn’t partake in as many ECs as I would’ve liked. Please make sure you’re specific here! This was roughly 1/3 of my additional information section. 

I also talked about my extremely long commute to school and how this hinders my EC involvement.

The last of additional information was targeted towards explaining my ECs. For me, it’s really quality over quantity and I wanted to make sure the AOs knew this. 

**Advice** 
1. ED rejection is NOT everything. My NYU rejection absolutely crushed me but I’ve found my new dream school (Barnard!) 

2. Do not ED if you think you have potential to improve. My ED application lacked a major award (ROTC Scholarship), and I had a few mistakes in my EC section and essay. I would say my strongest application was my Barnard one and it’s the one that got me the farthest. 

3. Don’t feel discouraged if you lack “stellar” ecs. Clearly, my ECs weren’t all that nor were they plentiful. However, in my common app, I worded these ECs extremely well and I made sure to elaborate on major projects I was working on in my Additional Information section. Also, don’t compare yourself with applications you see on youtube, tiktok, r/ApplyingToCollege, or even this sub. I can’t tell you how agonized I was thinking I would never get into one of my top choices, yet I got into multiple reputable institutions.

126f9tq,1,2023-03-30,"In the long run, what would benefit me most this Summer: an undergraduate research opportunity at an Ivy-League equivalent, or a possible summer internship?",Little_Pass2548,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/126f9tq/in_the_long_run_what_would_benefit_me_most_this/,"   I recently got a referral from a professor for undergraduate research program from a professor I had last semester who was a notoriously harsh grader, but I was able to get an A in his class. The program claims to be a ""Research Experience for Undergraduates"" and is a joint project between my university and an Ivy-League equivalent school in the same city. It is meant to be sort of a mentorship program with the goal of you publishing a research paper at the end of the summer. Its focus is on operating systems, computer architecture, and big data.

   As a junior in computer engineering, would this help my career prospects more than an internship at a company. For context, I haven't received any internship offers yet, and the ones that I do receive will most likely be from smaller local companies. I also have little interest in pursuing a graduate degree, and even less interest in a career in academia. This research opportunity also pays $6000 over the Summer.

   In summary, would this research opportunity be something that would benefit my resume more than some SWE or embedded systems internship at a small local company. Thanks for any insight that can be provided!"

I live a pretty privileged life. I come from an upper middle class immigrant family, live in a nice area, and have a decent family life. The biggest issues in my life are my ADHD and depression (although I have not been diagnosed with depression). I have been on and off ADHD medication since high school. Of course there are small issues in my life, but overall, I don’t have much to complain about. Which makes the fact that I am so bad at life entirely my fault. 

All through my life, I have never been good at school. It’s not like I wasn’t smart, but I just never tried. My family puts education first and my parents would do anything for me to do well in school (help me w/ my homework or send me to tutoring). Since middle school, I have been barely passing most of my classes. I graduated high school with a 2.8 GPA, went to a junior college for two years (actually did pretty okay and got a 3.6 GPA there) and transferred to a top 25 school for my major. What’s crazy is all my friends are so smart. They go to amazing schools, all graduated with a 4.0+ GPA in high school, and I am the odd one out. Since I have been at university, I have not been doing well at all. I have been on academic probation, have gotten off academic probation, and am probably going to be back on it after this terrible quarter. My GPA since I have transferred is a 2.2.

My issue is that I have never once been proud of myself in life. I am overweight, I have friends but not that many, and I barely put effort into any aspect of my life. This includes school, working out, keeping up with friendships, etc. If it was acceptable to rot in bed I totally would. Even if it isn’t, I would rot in bed if I knew that no one else would know. While I did well in community college (which is so surprising bc I was also working during that time), once I transferred to my university, I had gone into a depression where I barely left my room, didn’t make many friends, started smoking a lot , and failed a couple of classes. By some stroke of luck, I landed a good internship during the summer after my junior year of college. I had such an amazing time and actually did well at this internship. Unfortunately, the economy wasn’t doing to well and I wasn’t able to get a return offer, but my manager expressed that if she had the option, she would hire me. I am happy about that, but I didn’t do much work that summer so I felt undeserving and not like I made myself proud. Last quarter I earned an A, A-, and a D+ in my classes. Even then, those were all because I *barely* made it there. Throughout junior college, I felt like I barely made it. Although I did okay, I think my GPA can partially be attributed to the pandemic and classes moving online. Anyways, I don’t think I have ever been proud of myself in my life. After this quarter, which is the worst of my entire life, I’m probably going to fail 2 of the 4 classes that I have taken. And I’m worried because after one more quarter, I am supposed to graduate. 

It’s not like I don’t want to be smart and do well, I literally just don’t have be physical capability to and can’t. I know if I sat myself down and actually learned, I could probably do something amazing with my life, but I don’t know how to get to the point of actually starting something. I also just feel terrible because I live such an amazing life and have zero excuse to be such a failure like I am. Especially because I have parents that care so much about education and would do or pay anything (even if they can’t afford it) for me to be smart and successful. 

Anyways, I guess I’m just writing this to see if there’s anything worth saving even. I just saw two of my final grades for this quarter and they are a D+ and F. In the class I got a D+ in, I actually got a B on my final paper,, it’s just my homework assignments from the beginning of the quarter that I didn’t do bc I was off my ADHD medication due to the nationwide shortage. I just threw up because of how much I hate myself for getting to this point and how my life’s circumstances are amazing and would not lead me in this direction of it wasn’t my fault. Overall, I feel like I’ve just barely gotten myself through life, I’m not proud of myself, and I don’t know how to deal with it. 

I guess I just want to hear other peoples opinions on my situation to see if y’all see it the same way I do. I also have a problem of not trusting my perception of anything (idk why I think I just don’t believe  that I can  tell myself the truth ) so I just want to see if I am missing something or if there’s another person that relates to me."

So my question is, how would you make the most of the internship?

So far I've:

\- decided to build a mini-project with the same tech stack as their product to get familiar with the tech

\- been attending as many meetings as possible to get up to speed with their processes

\- asked to get involved in the user research side of things (which is currently non-existent but they're onboarding someone for that)"

=====================================================================

\+ **Central Command Director**: John Johnson XVII

\+ **Date:** 05/30/2203 – 17:15 AWST.

08/06/3103 – 19:15 GCST.

\+ **Location:** Central Command Conference Hall

=====================================================================

As per usual I was the first to arrive at Central Command’s Conference Hall. All while Sally decided to needlessly narrate my actions through my personal comms earpiece. Her crackling voice taking on a dramatic tone as I make my way to the Director’s chair, &lt;//And so, our great and brave overseer courageously strode in to take his spot in the big kids chair.//&gt;

The conference hall was modeled after an assembly hall that the countries of the old-world would gather in to discuss and make major decisions. Those countries were no more. However, in their place were now the Departments being ran by their respective heads. The states, provinces, and prefectures that once made up those countries were now the sectors. Times had changed, but some things stayed the same. Such is life; such is nature. Such is how humans and the major governing bodies worked.

The conference hall was more or less the same as it’s old-world counterpart, there were a few modifications in the design; modifications here and there namely the inclusion of the Overseer’s podium and the supporting Director’s chair right underneath it and the major display screen that allowed for off-world representatives to make an appearance. Meetings here were of the same vein; department heads would gather here to give their reports on any major or minor breakthroughs they had made and to discuss any major decisions regarding their respective departments. Things ran smoother than the old-world, but the bickering and needless uncooperative stubbornness born from ancient grudges or beliefs of the respective heads still permeated many of their decisions and thought processes.

I took my seat and as soon as I did so, the hiss of door signaled the arrival of the first head. The head of Department 3 (The United Kingdom): Winston Marshals their appointed “Prime Minister”. “Lord Director,” he says with a bow before taking his seat. Despite his aged and gentleman appearance, he was prone to getting riled up by a certain “*yank*” as he would put it and was a heavy drinker.

Oh, speak of the devil if it isn’t the yank himself, the head of Department 2 (The United States): Aubrey Adams the “President”. A mischievous grin accentuates the wrinkles of her face as the woman with greying blond hair playfully elbows her fellow department head as she takes her seat. “Howdy, howdy Winston! Still being an old stick in the mud,” it sounded innocent enough, if it weren’t for the fact that I was aware of their decade old spat.

“Ms. Adams,” he curtly says before focusing on nothing at all. Whatever Ms. Adams wanted out of that interaction, she got it as she was simply chuckling to herself and giving me a side-eye as if she thought I got it. I nodded along and awaited for the others to arrive. Usually after Ms. Adams was-

Before I can finish that thought I am interrupted by an energetic and booming voice, “AHOY THAR YE LANDLUBBERS!”

Ah yes there he is now, the other department head that also managed to ruffle the few remaining hairs of Mr. Marshals. The head of Department 3B (The Principality of Sealand): L’tow Mish-vensai, or “*Captain Kidd*” as he likes to be called now; the “King of Sealand”. He is an Asobi, an aquatic race of merfolk hailing from the planet of Solban. Out of all the Asobi that attached themselves to human media, he was by far the most eccentric.

For starters he wore a navy officers cap with a crown impaled through it (the crown belonged to the former king of Sealand), his badge of office was a human trident (vastly different than the leviathan harpoons his people used throughout their history), an eyepatch (he doesn’t need it, but insists), and to complete the look a curly fake beard (the Asobi lack facial hair, but instead some have fins or tendrils that can be considered their hair).

L’tow tipped his crown to each and every one of us as performed his greeting. “Arr, good tidings to ye Lady Adam’s, Lord Marshal, and Admiral Johnson,” the pirate impression grated with the Asobi’s naturally smooth and deep voice, but he still committed to it anyway. While Sally and Adams enjoyed every bit of this, Marshal’s dreaded every bit of it mainly due to the fact that he refuses to acknowledge Department 3B as it’s own department. The 3B was meant to placate him, but it still frustrated him that we addressed it as its own independent Department.

Marshal worked his jaw before saying, “Sir L’tow.”

“Oy! My good Lord, please, please. L’tow is a name that I do not go by any longer,” he took a dramatic bow. While rising and stamping the end of his trident on the ground he proudly announced, “Please, address me by my true identity: CAPTAIN KIDD!”

Adams stomped a boot on her shared desk and pointed fingers guns at L’tow. “That’s right Winston! Please address our dear Captain by his true name, Captain Kidd!”

L’tow gave her a sharp toothed grin and responded in kind, making audible “pew” “pew’s” as he did so. Much to Winston’s dismay.

Clearing his throat Marshal asked the question that always seemed to grate in his throat, “\*Ahem\*, why is the chief of sector-“

I cut him off, “You mean the head of department 3B.”

“But sir!”

Shaking my head at this, I decided to remind him once again. “Department 3B despite being within your territory was un-claimed by your department for the longest time and with recent advances with them expanding and building underwater facilities they can no longer be considered a sector. L’tow’s predecessor, King John Ivars made many sacrifices and committed his all in the creation of Atlantis Station. It is only to appease you that Department 3B is called 3B and is not assigned a true designation.”

Winston made no further attempts to argue. Nor would I let him. While I was not Director back then for the creation of Atlantis station and the formation of Department 3B, I read the reports. During the beginning days of Earth’s conversion to a containment facility Department 3’s Navy could not handle some of the Anomalies that were dumped in their waters. However, through sheer will power and many sacrifices of John Ivars and Department 3B they were able to suppress the anomalies and tame the seas. Department 3 was humiliated and demanded that 3B turn themselves in to absorbed into their department. King Ivars and the rest of the staff under his command refused and a Department war that lasted for a day broke out. Thankfully the Director at the time put a stop to it and Department 3B was born.

The reason for Department 3B’s success was thanks to many Asobi corporations sponsoring and lending aid to them as at the time they had thought that 3B was their own department at the time. Over half of Department 3B’s staff and faculty are Asobi and they are proud to be considered fellow “*seamen*” by the human staff of 3B.

The development of L’tow becoming the new head of Department 3B was during my time as an intern under the previous Director. I had witnessed the duel myself. John Ivars body was starting to fail at the time, neither rejuvenation nor cloning that we had back then could bring him back to his prime and so he asked for staff and faculty to duel him for his position. L’tow was the first to step up and honored him, becoming the new head of Deparment 3B and becoming Captain Kidd.

I wanted to nip this problem in the bud once and for all. Glaring at Marshal, I asked. “While you and your predecessors may disapprove of Department 3B being their own independent department, how come you do not show the same feelings for Departments 7 (Ukraine) and 8 (Taiwan)?”

Marshal looked taken aback, “T-that’s because for the longest time in history, Sealand was nothing more than a-a seafort!” he stuttered. “In fact, calling it a seafort back then is too generous! It was just a platform of junk and scrap and-“

“Entitled and dated beliefs that hold no weight or bearing on the here and now” I stated.

“But sir! Winston pleaded. “This is history! We cannot simply-“

“Yes Winston, it is history. And we should learn from history. Russia which is now Department 7 failed in all of their attempts to invade and conquer Ukraine which is now Department 10. Just like how China which is now Department 12 failed in all of their attempts to invade and take over Taiwan which is now Department 16,” I lean forward and stare into his eyes. “Why is it that you take great offence to Department 3B existing, yet also are disgusted by the acts of Department 7 and Department 12 and their attempts at disregarding Department 10 and 16’s independence,” I ask.

“W-well I. You-you see Lord Director!”

“As I’ve said before many times. Just Director, Marshal,” I state.

...

...

Sally breaks the tense silence, &lt;//Oh, would you look at that! The other departments are here!//&gt;

Great. Time for others to start using ancient history as a way to make future decisions. Great in theory, but horrible in practice somehow.

\+ **Date:** 08/06/3103 – 18:50 GCST.

05/30/2203 – 16:50 AWST.

\+ **Location:** Central Command Security Office

=====================================================================

A Risa Valen sits in the command chair of Central Command’s Security Office. Varia “Storm Vermin” Kelf, Central Command’s Security Chief. Her eyes scan the monitor of her computer as she reads various reports and reviews facility discrepancies that have been marked as a priority. A rising gauge on one of the discrepancies catches attention and she snaps to it, quickly opening the report as well as the possible threat that is rising.

“I see. I see,” she mutters to herself. “This is a problem.”

She shakes her head at the current dilemma that she’s in. “Those fools made the executive order of putting all hands-on deck and moved all their local security teams to areas of least resistance, and now we have a barely addressed discrepancy over in Department 36B Sector 1.” She lets out a scoff before continuing, “\*Tsk\*, inefficient as per usual. However, a remedy for this problem.”

Very quickly she brings up a roster of Central Command Crewmembers currently looking for work. Only three end up piquing her interest.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Available Staff and Crew:**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Carmine Vespasiano (Crewmember - Security Officer in Training)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Devin Nguyen (Crewmember - Hospitallers Legion Internship)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Victor Smith (Crewmember – Motorcade Mechanic)

&amp;#x200B;

“Promising. Promising,” she affirms to herself. She sends the trio a ping and their assignment and searches for any Central security teams she could prepare in case the group’s scouting mission of Department 36B’s maintenance tunnels go wrong.

**Species Dossier:**

Key:

**(DW)** = Deathworld Species

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Asobi (DW):** An aquatic species resembling merfolk. They have residual tails that can assist with swimming alongside webbed feet and hands and their facial features lack a nose, but they do have holes where a nose should be alongside gills on the side of the neck that you’d expect from merfolk. Fins, ridges, and tendrils adorn their heads and bodies akin to the hair of human or the fur of the other species within the Galactic Commons. Their homeworld Solban is mostly covered in water with islands that dot the planet. The culture of the Asobi for the longest time was comparable to that of 19th human gentry and the style of their clothing matched that as it was reminiscent to that of Victorian fashion. However, in recent times there has been a surge of “*pirate*”, “*navy*”, and “*islander*” fashion as the Asobi have become exposed to human media and their portrayals of “seafaring” cultures.

* The Asobi have an unhealthy fascination when it comes to Human media. Often times you’ll see one sporting tattoo’s, shark iconography, piercings, and even cutlasses; much to the light-hearted chagrin of humans and the dismay of the older generation of Asobi.
* An Asobi is currently the head of Department 3B (Sealand). He goes by the Moniker of Captain Kidd (His actual name is L’tow Mish-vensai) and can be seen sporting a navy officers cap with a crown impaled through it (it belonged to the former king of Sealand), an eyepatch (he doesn’t need it, but insists), a trident, and to top it off a curly fake beard.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Risa Valen (DW):** The Risa Valen are a rodent-like species with digitigrade legs. They are one of the tallest deathworld species in the Galactic Commons second to that of the Vacaian. They have prehensile tails that they can use to pick-up and use objects with ease and have been known to use their tails to wield an additional weapon or tool. Just like the Vacaian they sport digitigrade legs and can transition to quadrupedal locomotion. The homeplanet of the Risa Valen is simply called “*Tel*” meaning one in their language and it’s geography is similar to that of Earth except for the fact that mega-flora and fauna seem to be common. In addition, storms and violent weather also seem to be common, leading them to either live in the hollows of the various mega-trees, the roots of said trees, in cities built into mountains and cliffs, or in the underground.

* The Risa Valen prefer function over form, causing their culture and outlook on life to be very utilitarian. What is strict and military for some of the species within the Galactic Commons is commonplace and civilian to the Risa Valen.
* The Risa Valen due to favoring function and form are the top producers of survival gear and tools. From multi-tools, workshop equipment, or simple survival you can trust anything made by the Risa Valen.

A little backstory—I joined the army 3 years ago to get away from a toxic and broken family when I was 18. I was addicted to drugs and my life was falling apart at the seams. 

I've done a lot in these past 3 years. I've saved some money. I've traveled the world. I managed to land a corporate internship in New York state providing housing after my service obligation and that's what I'm currently doing. 

That ends in June, and after that I have a big decision to make. I originally said that I was gonna go home once this ends to go to college, but now I'm getting cold feet. Although I have some family that are good people and have done well for themselves, my intermediate family(mother and her soon to be ex husband) is very toxic and draining. 

One of my closest friends from the army is going to college in Denver and he invited me to come with him and his brother. I thought about it, applying to jobs on indeed and was offered a fundraiser position with a non-profit. It's a pretty shit job with a high turnover rate, but pay is 25 dollars an hour so it's a way to get my foot in the door and make a living wage. 

On the flipside of that coin, I do miss my family. I know they miss me too, but they're proud of me. Prouder than they would have been if I had stayed in small town Mississippi. I have a hard time explaining my reasons for not wanting to come home, considering home was a very different experience for my sheltered cousins than it was for me. I know they're not getting any younger. I know my grandfather isn't getting any younger, and I don't want to be filled with regret if the unthinkable happens. But I know he's proud of me, and I want to keep it that way.

Moving to Denver is a big risk, but I also feel like going home is a big risk. All my life, i couldnt wait to leave. I have enough money saved up for travel, and to survive for a couple months. I feel like this is now or never. I may never get this chance again

I need some advice, cause life is hard for a 21 year old just trying to make the right call"

I have no real internships under my belt, but whenever I try and apply to some, I get super discouraged because when I read all the requirements/qualifications there's always one or a few that I just don't meet. In turn, I don't apply. It might be years of experience, some skill they desire, or other knowledge I just don't have.

 For reference, I'm a math PhD that doesn't have real world experience with any stem related jobs and I'd just want something meaningful during the summers that looks good on a resume. However, most positions usually have a coding requirement, which I have bare bones python in the back of my head somewhere if that, or some other software or skill I just don't have. It's usually computer related. 

I wonder if I should apply anyway to certain positions, even if I don't have the coding skills? I'm not even clear on what kind of internship I'd want, I think something in research but I honestly don't know what to do.

That being said my GPA is still trash overall and I want to get to grad school. So eventually, I gotta get to the point where I can consistently get more As than Bs to truly get my GPA to at least a 3.0, and this upcoming term I want a 4.0, and don't think its a super unrealistic goal given my grades to my standards have been good recently.

Top students, how do you overcome waves or little to zero motivation, or the waves of imposter syndrome? While I'm doing a lot better than past performances, I still have to work on my self esteem (see post history) During break I'm trying to do things that make me feel better about myself, running everyday, applying to jobs + internships, cook for myself more. (Of course resting as well since this is a break) But I'm worried how to balance this with 16 units next year as a STEM major, and whether should I only be focusing on school if I want to have a 4.0 GPA."

So, I am not going to apply full time job until 2024. I am going to apply internship for 2024 summer starting from July 2023.

So, to see current job market conditions, I looked up job postings in google jobs and ziprecruiters.

When I see the job posting, it is mostly for senior level software engineer and very little openings for new grad/junior level.

Also, it shows salary very low. It shows like 70~100k for senior level software engineer and 45~67k for junior level. Most job opening for junior/new grad level requires at least 6 month experience on job, plenty of languages and frameworks and the salary is mostly around 50k which is much lower than median salary for entry level.

My searched location is DFW and Austin in texas.

Is there reason why there are so few opening for software engineer and salaries are very low now?

Is it because, now is March? Is March one of worst time for job openings? When is the hiring season for junior/new grad software engineer? (I've heard it will starting July)."

Got hired on full time at month 4, bumped to 50k.

Fast forward to month 6, a round of layoffs hit and one of them was my Supervisor. Got spooked, so I started looking around and found a contract position for $27/hr, but then ended up accepting a counter offer at my company.

I am a french Web Developer that graduated in 2016 from some CS Engineering school, and here's what I did after that:

\- 1.5 years as an embedded dev

\- 1 year as a fullstack dev

\- 1 year as a freelance fullstack dev with side projects

\- 2 other years in a company as a fullstack dev again

\- And now: freelance fullstack dev again, but with a really low workload

Throughout all my experiences:

\- I didn't have a lot of mentorship (if at all: even at my first job, I was an intern, yet literally the more knowledgeable about C code at the company) 

\- I was always in small companies: which I like, to be honest. I was in a 80+ people company once, I left after 1 month despite them being happy with me

\- I really enjoyed trying new technos, languages, fields, as side projects or in the companies

Web development is boring to me (but it's easy and pays well). Even though I've never been part of a big team with exciting tasks. I don't even know if I would ever have fun with this field: doing APIs, handling loads, responsive website, responsive app etc. etc. it really feels the same over and over. Other than this, a big chunk of the projects I see are in my eyes useless to the world

Am I missing some skills, or seniority that prevent me from climbing up to a different position where it would actually feel more fulfilling and fun ?

So, I'm leaning towards changing the field where I am in. I would like to get back to less bullshit, and more concrete engineering: mostly, lower level things (but NOT embedded programming). This is where I need to get ideas on how to shift careers, and mostly, what are the possibilities. I am really curious about graphics computing, as it seems to be a nice mixture of math, coding, art, problem solving, hardware... Other fields like simulation, HPC, HFT etc. all seem really cool, challenging and stimulating, but it's hard to get an idea on how to get into such fields when you've only had 1.5 years in C, 6 years ago.

Which also leads me to my next question: how do you handle shifting from one field to another ? How do you justify going back to (almost) square one to an employer ? Is this a red flag for them ? Someone too unstable and unsure ? Does it mean I'll get back to a junior pay ? (I hope not, to me lots of coding skills are transferable).

I know my most is quite evasive and personal, but I have been trying to write it twice and since my ideas on what I want is not really clear, but I hope I can reach people who relate and had a similar experience

Thanks"

126ro5d,1,2023-03-30,18 credit hours…?,astro-cowboy,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/126ro5d/18_credit_hours/,"Hey all,
I am going into my senior year as a transfer student next fall. Unfortunately I still need 4 random classes as gen eds at my university. I have 12 credits next semester as hardcore engineering courses. Of those 4 classes, one is a lab, one is a CAD based class, the other is heat transfer, and one is Vibrations. I would say these are some very hard classes. 

I am planning on having 2 random 100-level gen eds to fulfill 2 of my needed gen ed credits. These classes are anthropology 100-something and art appreciation. They are also online and asynchronous. So they should be very easy if there’s no rigid meeting times, in person exams, or what have you. 

If it becomes overwhelming, I can always drop the classes. However, knowing my current ME professors, they should be very accommodating. 

I do not want to have to take yet another semester because my internship is waiting for me to graduate next May. Especially if these classes are art, humanities, diversity classes. That would be a kick in the face to me who has worked so hard in intense Mechanical Engineering courses. I am already 2 years behind in school. I would like to be done. It is just 15 weeks of hell and it’s over. 

What is everyone’s opinion?

EDIT, I could take one over this summer but I am already enrolled in Calc 3… I know I am behind on math but my original major required only up to pre calculus so I have taken calc 1, 2, and 4 but still need calc 3. calc 4 was a pre req for this semester and calc 3 is a pre req for next semester."

I recently searched for a summer tech internship and found it challenging to navigate through job postings. Specifically, it was difficult to find internships with upcoming deadlines and opportunities for visa sponsorship.

To simplify the process, I came up with an idea to create a website that makes finding and filtering summer internships easier. I'm curious if others have had similar difficulties finding relevant internships and what features they wish existed to make the search easier.

Would you be interested in in a job platform specifically for summer tech jobs? How do you do it currently?"

My current circumstance put simply:

I am attending community college in order to get my G.E.‘s to transfer back to Cal Poly Pomona where I left on probation a few years ago. I reapplied and thought I’d be accepted considering I’ve really changed as I have a 3.9 GPA at the time of submitting my application however I was rejected. I’m currently seeing if this can be challenged but the more I’m weighing my options the better WGU is sounding.

I’m currently interning at my community college and a few part time support positions are opening. I was suggested by my coordinator and colleagues to apply. On top of all my classes, I am studying for my Network+ certification (currently have my A+). 

With my free time I work on projects and some projects have already been seen as successfully useful in the work environment.  

They are in the process of converting a part of their infrastructure to the cloud and my end goal is to have a job role within the cloud. 

My girlfriend is graduating and has a few options for employment but nevertheless, both her and I will be moving out for the first time soon. 

My idea is to attend WGU to have time to work at my community college, focus on projects, learn as much as I can with our schools migration to the cloud, make my own schedule so I can enjoy time with my girlfriend, and of course finish faster to possibly to get a full time position at the school or move into a cloud position somewhere else. 

This seems much more easier to accomplish if I go to WGU instead of my CSU. My CC’s website mentions WGU as being apart of some credit transfer program they have with them.

Though it is the most easiest and seemingly convenient move, I am not sure if it is the smartest. I would miss out on other potential opportunities with networking or finding possible better internships. I don’t want this decision to hurt me in the long term. So I’m here from more experienced people what are your takes / helpful comments. 

Any advice would be great."

However, I am making next to nothing working here and there have been so many times they have shown me they don’t value this position (never responding to messages and saying “I forgot about you”🥺 - with that exact emoji, and not disclosing certain info and responding “it really only benefits us to do this”).

My job application process is generally:

* Looking for and bookmarking midwest/remote jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed
* Adding recruiters on LinkedIn and sending them a message
* Customizing the base of my cover letter to the company I am applying (ie. referencing their values or a favorable personal experience with them)
* Attending events organized by my alma mater or companies
* Having my resume reviewed by my former school and alum in the industry. I seem to get good feedback on my resume but that might be comparatively since they see a bunch of undergraduate resumes (I've already graduated)

Notes:

* I am a US Citizen
* I have no experience, unfortunately, internships or otherwise. Besides projects, my experience at a learning center mentoring young coders is the closest thing I have to anything technology related
* GPA is barely a 3.0 with a lot of ""Pass"" grades my final/pandemic semester not counting toward my GPA calculation

I am currently working on projects to add to my resume and keep my skills sharp. In particular, I am going through the CS50 AI coursework and expanding some existing projects as well. I also plan to start looking at working on open-source projects per the advice of someone I met at a career fair.

Any advice is appreciated. Just looking to finally break into a technology related role no matter what it is. I like coding."

I got accepted into Rutgers New Brunswick MS Statistics - Data Science program recently. MS Statistics - Data Science is different from MS Statistics that is offered by the same department. However, I have already finalised UChicago MSc Analytics program and paid the $1500 non-refundable deposit. Rutgers is offering Day 1 CPT that would let me intern with any company from first term itself which have me wondering if I should still go ahead with UChicago or choose Rutgers because the CPT would help lower the cost of MS. 

Why I wanna go to UChicago?
1. Brand name and reputation
2. Great curriculum
3. Professors hold professional position in industry and thus it gets easier to get internships and full-time jobs
4. Good placements 

Negative points about UChicago MScA program:
1. Expensive (60K tuition and fees + 24K annual living expense)
2. On-campus jobs are competitive to get
3. Classes in Downtown campus (not necessarily a negative point as Hyde Park isn’t far but I personally wanted to study in the main campus)

Why am I considering Rutgers?
1. Day 1 CPT
2. Cheaper than UChicago (50K tuition and fees; not sure about living expense)
3. Department of Stats professors look intelligent af 

Negatives about Rutgers as per my opinion:
1. Curriculum is stat focused; doesn’t look up to date
2. Lower brand value with respect to UChicago

Please vote and comment your opinion. Thanks!!

126wgmv,2,2023-03-30,Choosing major?,absolute_fudge,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/126wgmv/choosing_major/,"Hey, so I’m having trouble deciding if I should continue pursuing a CS major or go for Cog Sci w CS focus (I want to double major btw, not sure in what yet but likely something culture/language-related). I’m a freshman and I’ve taken CS61A and CS61B, but I don’t think I’ll be able to make the 3.3 GPA cutoff for declaration, especially since math is my weakest subject (probably not gonna do well in CS70, and based on my grades for the other two prereqs, I would need an A).

Ultimately I am not sure what I want to do/what I’m interested in. I don’t particularly like nor dislike CS in general, just thought it was a good option while I figure out what I like. If I can’t figure it out then at least I’ll have a technical degree. My family is also pushing for me to do CS (which I’m fine w for now since idk what I want), but none of them have any experience in the field so I don’t have anyone I can ask for advice.

I consider myself a humanities person since that’s what all my high school extracurriculars and hobbies were geared towards, and I didn’t even think about doing CS until a week into first semester, so I just feel like I’m very behind. Cog Sci seems like a good blend of humanities and STEM so it actually interests me a lot, but I also want to maximize my chances of getting a SWE job if that is what I want to do later on (I don’t know what I want right now so mostly just wanna keep my options open).

Would it be a good idea for me to go for Cog Sci instead of CS if I might apply for SWE jobs in the future? I have a FAANG internship lined up this summer so would having that experience on my resume make up for the lack of a CS degree?"

I started learning programming two years ago in my sophomore year with CS1, but I started to get bored with Java in my junior year APCSA. My teacher allowed me to break off in APCSP (senior year/this year) and start learning about hardware on my own. I started building small Arduino projects and even made an HID keyboard by hacking the chip, I built a computer station and just now started working with rPi which funny enough I am struggling to load an OS because I didn't have a micro SD card adaptor, I also set up Linux on her old computers for the next people to learn.

However, I am worried that I haven't created anything that can run on anything except some Arduino code (meaning I haven't made any computer or phone apps). My fear is that when I get to college, everyone else will have made cool stuff, while I will have no real skill to speak of except maybe being able to fix superficial level issues with electronics, if you need more info to be able to ""diagnose"" my issue feel free.  


  
but again the main question is: will college make me into a programmer as long as I have the will?"

For those who get into Cal, I would like to congratulate you all on you all and looking forward to welcoming you at Cal Day on 22nd April Saturday. 

It's the best public school in the world with top major programs in each department. You can take part in social clubs based on your ethnicity and hobby. You can take part in competition teams of engineering clubs and represent Cal at the national level. You can find research opportunities from most experienced faculty at Cal. Finally, we are close to all tech industry and San Francisco Bay Area, so finding an internship is much more convenient.

However, I feel sorry for you if you couldn't make it. Even my sister got rejected and I am low-key happy for her due to following reasons. First of all, the campus is not much safe, and occasionally, you get a warning for stealing and stabbing. There are some homeless people who harass international students. There's no In N Out Costco Walmart around campus thanks to the monopoly of small business owners. The worst part is the most expensive housing where you can't even find a single under $1500. University Administration is now building more on campus housing buy still landloard at off campus can ripe you off.

I would still say it is worth it dealing with all these issues for 4 years of college, the education you are getting, the exposure of the industry you are getting. Especially if you can make $200k out of college. I have been living in Berkeley for a couple of years, and I never faced these issues directly. I can help you find loopholes on how to tackle these issues. If you are an admitted student, you can learn more about campus life at r/berkeley, so better join the sub.

That's all from me. Welcome to adulthood. I know you all will do great no matter what college you are attending. Having consciousness of attending university at teenage is an achievement at itself."

2) Maths for machine learning by imperial college london

I would also like to take a data analytics course but I’m not sure which one would be worthwhile. I read about the one offered by google but many reviews say that the capstone is too advanced for what was taught in the courses before. 

How do you advice I start learning data science ? 

Also, what do you advice me to do to start getting internships as soon as possible? 

Im thinking of doing competitive programming + personal projects over the summer as well. Which competitive programming website should i start on ?"

Teacher #1: known since freshman year, very good relationship as she taught two of my classes

Other: Another teacher since freshman year, very strong relationship and again very strong letter 

**Interviews**

Only did one interview, with WashU. I think it went well, or really it didn’t go bad. I was definitely awkward but it was with a current student so we hit it off a lot better than i think we would have if it was with, say an alumni. 

**Essays**

My personal statement was a bit,, cliche i think. I talked about overcoming shyness and building confidence after attending a summer program , and how a quote on a sticker on my teacher’s mug inspired me to stand up for what i believe in. My supplements were a bit cliche as well; nine times out of ten i wrote about my background as the daughter of immigrants which is probably really overdone but i guess i pulled it off!

If anything i think that attending an uncompetitive high school really helped me stand out. I don’t think i would’ve gotten the same results if i went to another larger school with more resources/clubs/classes available. ALSO, despite being accepted by multiple of my dream schools, i’m headed to my state school this fall! They offered me the best scholarship money, compared to the others that asked for over 45k a year, and i just can’t justify that lol."

**Letters of Recommendation**

**We aren't allowed to see them so I can't say for certain**

AP Lang Teacher: know her super well. great writer. we still talk all the time: probably a really good one

Biology Teacher: also know her super well through class + clubs, we still talk a lot. Also probably a really good one

Counselor: No idea. She likes me a lot but she switched out with my old counselor junior year so we barely got time to know each other and didn't start talking a lot until this year.

**Interviews**

Harvard: 8.5/10 In-person - it was my first interview so I was really nervous but we connected bc she majored in french. mainly talked about cooking and she only asked like 2 pre-made questions

Tufts: 8/10 Virtual - We connected because she used to go to my highschool and she was in the badminton club before it became a sport so we talked about that a lot (she had the same coach as I do). She was a little stiff in conversation though so I felt awkward at times but great overall

Northwestern: 10/10 Virtual - Interviewer was amazing and we bonded over our love of food + cooking. She was Filipino so we just talked about that a bunch. Just amazing overall. I don't think she really asked any pre-made questions

Yale: 100/10 In-Person - This was one of the greatest experiences of my life, genuinely. The interviewer lived in my city and we met up at a famous local coffee shop. We talked about the unfair political life on campuses nowaday (the divides) and how poorly it affects students' ability to grow critical thinking. We talked about more things having to do with political climate around the world and it was an amazingly mature conversation I wish I could repeat again. He made a note at the end saying I was the best interview he's had this year, but this got my expectations too high smh.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: 10/10 It's extremely personal so I won't delve too much into it, but it was about my very tough upbringing and my struggles in school/at home and how applying myself to studies/hobbies made me completely change and grow

Supplements: eh. I'll be real. Some of them are REALLY good while others were probably good but not my best. I kinda procrastinated a lot of them and focused most of my attention on schools I actually cared about

Really really liked my Havard/Yale Supplements

For those who get into Cal, I would like to congratulate you all on you all and looking forward to welcoming you at Cal Day on 22nd April Saturday. 

It's the best public school in the world with top major programs in each department. You can take part in social clubs based on your ethnicity and hobby. You can take part in competition teams of engineering clubs and represent Cal at the national level. You can find research opportunities from the most experienced faculty at Cal. Finally, we are close to all tech industry and San Francisco Bay Area, so finding an internship is much more convenient.

However, I feel sorry for you if you couldn't make it. Even my sister got rejected and I am low-key happy for her due to following reasons. First of all, the campus is not much safe, and occasionally, you get a warning for stealing and stabbing. There are some homeless people who harass international students. There's no In N Out Costco Walmart around campus thanks to the monopoly of small business owners. The worst part is the most expensive housing where you can't even find a single under $1500. University Administration is now building more on campus housing buy still landloard at off campus can ripe you off.

I would still say it is worth it dealing with all these issues for 4 years of college, the education you are getting, the exposure of the industry you are getting. Especially if you can make $200k out of college. I have been living in Berkeley for a couple of years, and I never faced these issues directly. I can help you find loopholes on how to tackle these issues. If you are an admitted student, you can learn more about campus life at r/berkeley, so better join the sub.

That's all from me. Welcome to adulthood. I know you all will do great no matter what college you are attending. Having consciousness of attending university at teenage is an achievement at itself."

**Additional Information:**

To be honest, I was completely apathetic to my decision because I had entered this process without expectations. I have done all my EC's with passion and genuine interest, and had never considered even considered doing EC's that look good for the sake of colleges. I thought that would be enough, but it seems that I haven't put in enough work.

What truly sucks about this process is that I have been living in the US since I was born, but because of an archaic immigration system, am considered an international. As I continue to view the acceptances of my peers with worse rank/EC's into those same schools, it makes me wonder what could have been. At the same time, I question whether I even deserve an acceptance.

I have come to terms with my situation, and now am spreading my horizons abroad. I feel American, but I am not accepted by the only country I can truly call my own. I plan to move out of the US in the near future to a country that would be more accepting.

I have accepted my terms, but am terrified of the uncertain future where I have to leave the US in seek of an uncertain country.

Enough of the rant, but here are my decision, and I hope this doesn't discourage other internationals from applying to schools in the US.

Note: Some of the information was altered and redacted to protect my identity, but the essence of my application remains the same.

Note 2: Sorry for the terrible writing/grammar, I can't think straight rn"

CAD Teacher: Only one I can rate surely, was almost def a 10/10. We're super close and he always has said great things about me

Physics Teacher: Probably was pretty good. We're close and I did extremely well in his class.

English Teacher: I was least close with my English teacher so this was one was pretty mid if I had to guess

**Interviews**

Harvard: 10/10. Went the full length (got cut off by her having another interview right after but would've gone longer) and we got along really well. Was really nice in the follow up email

UPenn: 8/10 Very standard interview

Princeton: 7/10. Was weirdly short and the interview was over FaceTime but we got along well since we were both from New York. Overall it was a kind of strange interview so I'm not sure what to make of it but I think it went well

MIT: 1/10, I was late and the interviewer just stared at me for most of the interview instead of saying anything

**Essays**

Personal statement was kinda mid but my supplements were great

**Demographic:** Asian Female from Pakistan, family income &lt;$20,000

**Intended Major**: Nuclear engineering/ electrical engineering

**SAT:** 1560

**Grades:** We don't have GPAs at my school, but I have A\*s in all my subjects. School rank in O levels was #1 and in Alevels is in the top 5.

**Coursework:** Five A levels (Chemistry, Math, Physics, Biology and English Literature) + Linear algebra, Cal3 and a Modern Physics course from a university (received college credits for all three).

**Awards:** \&gt;10 medals in WSC for many years (Served as a judge this year due to experience)

\-Qualified in the top 50 to represent my country for the IMO.

\-Won a silver medal in a south-east Asian math olympiad.

\-Finalist in an IAEA competition and got invited to present my work at a conference aimed toward professionals in my intended major. It was also fully funded. Only undergrads were supposed to submit papers but I was an exception and was part of a youth panel.

\-Runner up in a competition that got me a scholarship into an Oxford Cambridge Summer school.

\-Won a few law moots on a national level.

\-Was accepted into a program that provides students in my country with scholarships for studying abroad (they take 50-60 kids a year).

\- Won a national-level research competition for high schoolers.

**Extracurriculars:**

1. Conducted research on the unfolding of polyhedra (mathematics) under the mentorship of faculty from the University of Waterloo (6 months).
2. Conducted research with a faculty member from Cambridge ( it was initially paid but since I couldn't afford it, the professor had the fee waived since he thought I had potential).
3. Wrote a research paper that proposes a solution for a specific problem in reactors under the mentorship of a T50 professor ( 1 year). The paper is in the process of being published.
4. Have been working at a lab (at the top university in my country) for 1.5 years, where I have been part of a project that designs nanoparticles for cancer treatment, water pollution and drug delivery.
5. Published a paper on Nigerian literature and one on the Handmaid's tale (My teacher thought they were well written and sent them to a journal).
6. Editor and the person who started my school's first publication which has a readership from all over the city (&gt;2000 readers).
7. Got into PROMYS and received the Mehta Fellowship.
8. Got into a prestigious T5 summer program (not mentioning it because afraid of being recognised) on a 100% scholarship.
9. For all of high school, I have been tutoring kids for free (because we belong to a persecuted minority, so it was due to a sense of duty to my community; at least a 1hour commitment every day). 
10. Wrote a few mathematical, political and Law related articles for a university publication and my local newspaper.
11. I make digital art and designs for small businesses for free unless they want to pay me.

**LORs**

1. **Literature Teacher:** (10/10) She told me that out of the 200 essays she graded mine was the best so hopefully, that's a safe bet.
2. **Math Teacher:** Wrote all my recommendations for prestigious programs that I got into so 10/10.
3. **T50 Professor:** Told me I was amongst the strongest students he had mentored so hopefully at the very least a 7/10.
4. **The professor that supervises the nanoparticle project:** 8/10, let me intern in the lab even though high school students aren't allowed because he was impressed by my CV.            

**Essays**

It was about how unconventional art inspires me to invent unconventional machines and technology. It also included my struggle as a female in STEM in a third-world country and how I had to work twice as hard for opportunities; I wrote about this subtly since I did not want to come off as whiny.                                                                                                                              
  
 **Interview:** I only got one from Dartmouth. Thought it went great........apparently the feeling was not mutual.                                                                                                                                                                                    
  
  
  **Results:** Harvard (rejected), Yale (rejected), Princeton (rejected), Cornell (rejected), Dartmouth (rejected),  UChicago ( waitlisted), Amherst (rejected), Colby (waitlisted), Williams (waitlisted), Caltech (rejected), Richmond (rejected),  Depaul (rejected), Lehigh ( rejected), CWRU ( rejected), University of Rochester (rejected), Mount Holyoke (rejected)                                                                                                                                           
  
  
  
 I know my list is rather unbalanced, but that's due to my parents only agreeing to send me abroad if I got in somewhere big (prestigious lol) . They were quite unsupportive about applying abroad ( well judging by the past 4 years and considering their attempts to get me to quit extracurriculars). Anyways, I think I must have insulted the AO in secret code language or really screwed up somehow to get such a horrific result.  Oh well, here's a temporary goodbye to my wildest intellectual dreams. May your moratorium be one day lifted."
1275c55,0,2023-03-30,For the lives which do not work out,Embarrassed_Bee2967,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1275c55/for_the_lives_which_do_not_work_out/,"I was a high school senior last year like all of you and I know how bittersweet a day like can be. I was myself rejected from all of my RDs and I now go to a college at which I'm doing fine at academically. However, college can be a life-changing experience if you make the most of it. I want to provide a couple words to the lives which did not work out today.

As a high schooler, I always thought life rewarded the tenacious. Put in the effort and things will work out for the people that deserve it. I think college apps are pivotal for many because it shows that life is never a meritocracy. There are people who are destined to be winners and others who are meant to be losers. This college apps process just one step in that journey towards determining who will be on top.

However, there is a skill that all individuals can learn to be better and be on the top. After all, how can you lead a happy life when you are consistently at the bottom? How does it feel when your friends are the ones at the top and you can't have what they have? I can tell you some tips for the future.

That skill is to be more ruthless. Today's world is based off of results. Why work towards something if there's no reward? If you want to live a better life, you need to lie, cheat and steal to live a better life. Backstab others when you can and make sure that you can come out on top in the end. 

I've tried to implement this strategy now at college and I've gained research positions, a TA position, and a job all by taking down other people to further my own goals. You learn that there is a rumor that someone else is drunk? Spread that rumor. You see that someone's stuff is lying around? Take it for yourself. Why work to help others when you can't even help yourself in the process?

I never had any of these current opportunities in high school; I blindly stayed in my own lane while the more fortunate individuals found internships through their connections and money. I've learned that people like myself can perform grave sins when they are confronted with amenities they can never attain. And yet, I am happier that way because I've built myself an existence out of anonymity.

Many of you must learn to be ruthless to others, because you cannot treat others as equals in a society which is inherently unequal. For me, college apps was a turning point because honest work can turn obsolete when met with the dishonesty of the rest of the world. Be corrupt and be a cheater, as long as it benefits yourself. The only person that matters is you. Make sure that you stay faithful to yourself."

I’ve recently landed a computer science internship as well. I’m fully aware about how important these internships are and ‘passion’ projects. Julie Kim apparently has a better email template for reaching out for internships, but really how useful is it? I’ve seen tons of videos about creating passion projects, but I still have a lot of uncertainty. I’m filled with anxiety, since going to these bigger Universities often times provide better aid packages. Do you think her program is worth it?"

I love what I'm doing, I love my mentor, and I can't say I dislike any of these kids. I enjoy them all, even when they misbehave so bad they give me a panic attack.

Anyways

These two girls were talking about the boyfriend they have and other likely inappropriate things. They were sitting very close to me on the floor in co, so they know I can hear them. One of them looks over at me and tells me she has a boyfriend.
I said, ""oh, who is he""
""He goes to another school""
""Cool, what's his name?""
Silence from her.
""Is the boyfriend in the room with us?"" I asked. 

A girl at a nearby table laughed  at least lmao. The one i was questioning didn't get it."
1276oij,1,2023-03-30,"nervous OH real analysis trans girl w/ good stats, mid ECs",terminallyonlineee,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/1276oij/nervous_oh_real_analysis_trans_girl_w_good_stats/,"watching the bloodbath unfold this year and last has scared me sm omg  


**Demographics:**

Gender: female (trans)  
Race/ethnicity: white  
State: ohio  
Income: $60-80k  
Type of School: title 1 public  
Hooks (URM, first generation, legacy, athlete, etc.): trans?

**Intended Major(s):** philosophy + math

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1550 SAT but retaking bc i choked math so bad idk how but i'll get 800 or 790 next time (780V, 770M); 5s on all APs so far

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.98UW (B in middle school)/4.83W; rank 1/\~375

**Coursework:**   
middle school- alg 1, geo, alg 2, chinese 1  
9th- french 1, orchestra, H ela 1, H world history, H bio, H precalc, APCSP, DE health  
10th- H french 2, H chem, H ela 2, AP calc AB, AP stats, AP psych, APUSH, DE college comp, DE discrete math  
11th- H french 3, AP lang, AP gov, AP micro, AP macro, AP physics C: mech, DE american studies, DE neuroscience, DE calc 2, DE multivariable calc, DE linear algebra, DE intro to phil  
12th- DE real analysis, DE abstract alg, DE number theory, DE symbolic logic, DE ancient phil, DE eastern phil, DE modern phil, DE political phil, DE african history, DE european art history

hoping coursework saves me lol. for reference highest math at my school is AP calc AB and AP stats, so i self-studied BC last year (but forgot to sign up for the test fml) and have self-studied ahead a bit this year so that i could practice proofs (and am also currently learning ODEs) to be ready for math next year. abt half of the phil classes are 300 and 400 level as well. history and art history are 200 level

for APs this year i'm def predicting 5s on all, but could maybe see a 4 on phys c or gov if i don't review enough   


**Extracurriculars:** 

kinda mid but i did things i genuinely cared abt so maybe it'll be enough? also pls don't dox me  
1. gsa president (10th-12th)- have helped organize trips, fundraising, etc. help raise awareness abt lgbtq+ stuff around my school and have worked to improve some policies relating to trans students  
2. paid research internship summer program at local college (11th)- learned and researched abt the humanities and stuff, somewhat selective  
3. sports (9th-12th)- currently play varsity girls soccer, where i'm one of 6 trans athletes in ohio (all sports); used to do JV boys XC and varsity boys track but quit after freshman year lol. helped raise $15k at a fundraiser tho  
4. academic challenge (9th-12th)- ""varsity"" player (lmao) our team has won local tournaments (where i've also gotten t10 individually), qualified for nats, and also some stuff on tv which i technically can't say bc it hasn't aired yet lmfao   
5. community orchard founder (9th-12th): helped found a community orchard with a group of other community members where i volunteer and teach kids abt gardening in the summer  
6. political discussion group (10th-12th)- my friends and i have a group where we read and discuss theory and sometimes go to protests, idk more a personal interest of mine but hoping to tie it into a bit of an activist type theme  
7. student help committee (11th-12th)- my friend basically started a club where we help kids who are struggling with their grades and we basically teach them study skills, as well as making sure their homelife, mental health, etc. is ok. we essentially just try to get them to realize their potential and get more motivated to succeed at school  
8. viola (9th-11th)- take private lessons and stuff; used to do orchestra in 9th where i was section leader but then quit lmfao. idk if i'll keep playing next year either tbh but maybeee  
9. nhs (11th-12th)- bruh moment of the century  
10. baking (9th-12th)- don't roast me for this one but i just really like baking and started making stuff for friends and family during lockdown and have devoted way too much time since

so some things that could boost my app are that i applied to a bunch of summer programs (TASS, WTP, MITES), so if i get into one of those (will update in a few weeks) that would be a huge boost. if not, i'll just get a normal job this summer. the other thing is that i'm probably gonna start a tutoring business geared towards low-income kids at my school sometime soon. also i have a podcast with my friends but it's lowkey reallllly bad so idk if i'd put it

  
**Awards:**   
if the last section was bad idek abt this one  
1. academic challenge stuff  
2. all-league in soccer (somehow even tho i suck lmfao)  
3. AP schol w/ distinction (was the 1st person in my district to ever get it as an underclassmen so maybe that's something?)  
4. national merit semifinalist (don't know for sure but got 1500/1520, so it's safe to assume i think)  
5. like straight-As award or something, i really don't have anything for this spot so far ngl  


if you guys have advice for farming easy awards or essay contests or something please dm me, i really need help lmao

**Essays/LORs/Other:**   
ok so i'm probably gonna make my essays super quirky which could either work really well or get me rejected everywhere. i'm gonna use summer programs and fly-ins as a test and see what happens. am also definitely gonna utilize my identity as trans and stuff to hopefully play to my advantage, altho it's not gonna be like the main themes of my essays necessarily, so like i wont make it my personality or anything

\-first LOR is from my history teacher in 9th and 11th. he's seen me transition, overcome a fuck ton of mental problems, grow as a student, and basically go from the quietest kid in the class to one of the most outspoken. we have a pretty personal relationship and often talk abt music, book recs, philosophy, and politics. he's a really good writer and has also been a prof at kenyon for both history and phil, so this one is def a 10/10  
\-next LOR is probably either gonna be from my phys or neuro teachers. i kinda know them both and they def like me, but idk how good they are as writers or how much they know me apart from my academics, ECs, and a couple more personal things i've talked to them abt. i'd give it like a 7 or 8/10  
\-counselor rec: um well she knows who i am, which is better than most can say but she'll probably just say i'm smart and a nice kid and stuff idk probably like a 5/10  


**Additional Info:**  
i'm immunocompromised, and so that on top of an eating disorder, depression, anxiety, undiagnosed ADHD, and beginning a transition kinda stopped me from doing a ton as an underclassmen, and then this year one of my parents got cancer sooo yeah. idrk how much to explain to AOs, esp with the mental stuff, but at schools that don't require a STEM rec i was thinking abt getting a rec from either my apush or ap lang teacher bc they also know abt my personal life and growth, just not as much as my history teacher from 9th and 11th. i was just worried abt that tho since i want to go into math, but it's not like i want to get a math teacher rec anyway ( i don't really know my profs this year and wasn't overly close with my teachers last year) so idk if it even matters fr, esp bc i'll be applying everywhere as philosophy. i could also even maybe get a therapist rec but that lowkey sounds kinda like a horrible idea idk  


**Schools:**   
gonna shotgun reaches and full rides, any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated!!

I can adapt to any time-zone and I have some beginner skills in Node JS, Express, Python, Data Analysis, Docker, Kubernetes, and React.

The problem I'm facing in my country is that we have a very tough economic situation that we're going through, so Junior Devs are expected to have 2-3 years of experience and they throw insane expectations at us. Most of the entry-level jobs here literally require tons of experience and to have worked with production code before. Even the internships I had are not enough, and I'm kinda in a sticky situation as I wanna start earning more money for myself (Im currently working as a barista) and get actual work experience as a Software Engineer. It's a field that I'm really passionate about!

I feel really lost and demotivated right now. and I'm willing to work for as low as **1000$/month**. This would actually provide a great living standard for where I'm from. So I'd be very thankful if you know any company that's willing to hire a contractor based in another country with my level of experience, or if the company you're currently at is offering such an opportunity.

Thank you so much for reading this far!

PS: I'm legally allowed to work in my country."

So I’m a 16 year old engineering intern. For the past 3 days, its just been me in the engineering department because one guy died, one quit, and one was on a work trip. This entire time, they’ve been wanting me to get this one job done and at one point, they told me to give it to the president to check. I did that, but it’s clear he just wrote his signatures and didn’t look. Today I asked about a paper for the engineers and sales guy to check, and he said it would be fine to just until tomorrow and have them check the stuff. This is good because it’s an actual check of stuff and I’m a bit anxious that I got everything right. So I get everything ready to be checked, and some fucking reason I think, “Ok so if she’s gonna check this, his signatures might not matter” and I make the DUMBEST thing every and white out some of them. At the time, this seemed like the smart thing to do but looking back, Im such a fucking idiot. I’m panicking and thinking I may get into trouble for this. I’m an idiot. Im so stupid. The people there are nice but I know this would be a really really stupid mistake to make."

So basically fast forwarding to  march, my girlfriend wanted to attend this concert with her friends and asked me to come along, i told her I will because I felt like going, it was her dream concert. 
Okay so adding some context, I have anxiety and social anxiety issues that I face due to my law school, internships, future(in my final year) and I have an important internship starting from 3rd and other things which are lined up and I’ve just finished an internship last month and been writing papers and competing in competitions which peaked my anxiety.
Around 10 days ago she asked me again and We had a conversation and she told me that it would be fine if I don’t come.

She asked me again 2 days ago and I told her I won’t be able to come, to this she got insanely upset, she told me that she wouldn’t expect anything from me, stopped talking to me and hid her from her Instagram stories and even called the relationship one sided and told me she’d never ask me again. I told her about the anxiety issues I’ve been facing lately and she told me that I always have anxiety and she would go with friends only from now on. 

I referred to the conversation we had a few days ago and she told me she was just checking if I really wanted to come.


I reconsidered everything yesterday and planned to go (not because of the drama but I really felt like going because I feel confident and wish to socialise) and she told me that there’s no need to come and she’s a bad girlfriend who had to do a drama for a concert. 

She’s been very upset regarding this whole thing and I don’t know what to do anymore, she has even hid me from her stories too which hurts. 


Please advice, Thankyou."

I was recently accepted into the UIUC CS + Linguistics program as a transfer student. I'm currently a Computer Science student at SJSU and would still need two years to graduate if I stay at SJSU and 2.5 if I transfer to UIUC. I've received a scholarship to cover my expenses, so money isn't a major concern. However, I still believe UIUC will be ~40k while I'm paying 25k at SJSU. Initially, I was excited about the opportunity to attend UIUC because of the research and weather, but I'm now feeling lost because I started an internship at Tesla from January to August. If I stay at SJSU, I might be able to continue working there part-time next year, but if I transfer to UIUC, I'll lose that opportunity. On the other hand, attending UIUC would allow me to experience a new climate and potentially provide more opportunities to interview with NYC fintech firms. I would appreciate any advice on what I should do. I've talked to former teachers, professors, and family friends in the industry and they're all lost on what to do right now! Socially leaving SJSU would be hard since I have a large, dedicated friend group and have lived in the area for almost my entire life. But I'm extremely lost right now.

127a07o,2,2023-03-31,TLDR; is it too late to go from SWE recruitment to PM recruitment for the full time cycle as a rising senior in CS?,ProtectionDifficult,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/127a07o/tldr_is_it_too_late_to_go_from_swe_recruitment_to/,"I’m almost at the end of my junior year as a CS major but have gradually realized through recruitment and a previous SWE internship that I don’t enjoy coding. I’m struggling to make a decision to completely jump roles as a rising senior who will need to recruit for full time soon.

I’m looking to change careers and have a few worries that it’s too late and that I should just stay in SWE for at least my first year out of college but am wondering if anyone has any recs? I’m interested in working with people in terms of leadership, delegation, and ideation, and anything along those lines.

I was thinking PM because of previous club experiences where I’ve been involved in start up incubators and event planning? Can I switch to PM cycle/are my chances good? Is it a good idea to go PM at all?"

I tried to open my decision twice this evening, but both times I just had a mental breakdown at my computer out of fear of what will happen and cried for several hours. Istg my blood pressure skyrocketed when I got the email that decisions were going to be released like 90 minutes before they actually were. It’s so incredibly stupid, especially when I’ve already been accepted to two amazing schools, Emory &amp; BU, but I don’t know how to gain the strength to open my decision without like inducing psychosis. I applied for International Affairs so being in DC would truly mean the absolute world to me for internships and connections. I’m trying to reason with myself that there’s always grad school, but I still feel pretty terrified. I’m so grateful for my other two schools and I know I’ll be super stoked to attend either one, but yk that dream school decisions always hit differently. How can I better cope in my situation?"

Domain: Ml initially, Ds and Ai after I learn Ml.",[deleted],developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/127aahy/help_needed_domain_ml_initially_ds_and_ai_after_i/,"I am a CSE student in my 4th sem. Comparing to other students of my batch, i know almost nothing. I don’t want to get into web and app development, not at this stage, may try it out later. 

Ai&amp;Ml seems a bit interesting to me. So i started with the world famous Ml specialization 3 course series by Andrew Ng on coursera. Currently stuck on course no.2. Ngl course 1 felt like a waste of time as the course took 1 month just to teach linear and logistic regression, which from yt I could learn in 2-3 hours. The course 2 so far seems good cause choosing the parameters and model is necessary in building a model. 

Now the help i need is what should i do next or simultaneously. Ik the answer will be projects, but WHAT PROJECTS? WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS? WHERE DO I GET THE IDEA OF IT FROM, KEEP THE ORIGINALITY INTACT? WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS WILL HELP ME IN GETTING INTERNSHIPS? Yes internships, cause we need to do 2 months of internships starting from june, and all i have is cv as my powercard as my cgpa so far is fucked. 8,8 and 6.7 in sem3 cause of a surgery. 

I did a project on housing price prediction on the blr price dataset (I assume everyone knows this basic shit project). This project was entirely of ds, in which i learned data handling and cleaning, but the ml part was of just 2 cells of notebook. In any basic ml project all the work is done by tensorflow in just 10 lines of code, so is there something else that i can try or learn. Ik what computations tf does behind those lines of code, thanks to Andrew, but it’s all theoretical, meaning I haven’t solved it myself. So help now, in any and everyway possible. 

Also which companies/startups to apply for ml or ds or python developer role in mumbai? Cause most of the roles i see on Internshala are of web/app/frontend/backend or java/cpp. Python wale kya kare- maar jai? 

Also ranted this omw to college in mumbai local. Thanks for the read."

I was recently accepted into the UIUC CS + Linguistics program as a transfer student. I'm currently a Computer Science student at SJSU and would still need two years to graduate if I stay at SJSU and 2.5 if I transfer to UIUC. I've received a scholarship to cover my expenses, so money isn't a major concern. However, I still believe UIUC will be \~40k while I'm paying 25k at SJSU. Initially, I was excited about the opportunity to attend UIUC because of the research and weather, but I'm now feeling lost because I started an internship at Tesla from January to August. If I stay at SJSU, I might be able to continue working there part-time next year, but if I transfer to UIUC, I'll lose that opportunity. On the other hand, attending UIUC would allow me to experience a new climate and potentially provide more opportunities to interview with NYC fintech firms. I would appreciate any advice on what I should do. I've talked to former teachers, professors, and family friends in the industry and they're all lost on what to do right now! Socially leaving SJSU would be hard since I have a large, dedicated friend group and have lived in the area for almost my entire life. But I'm extremely lost right now.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I read all my LORs and I gotta say they def carried my application

1. AP World/AP Human Teacher: 10/10 - Known him since my freshman year, had him as a teacher for 9th/10th. He's like my adoptive grandpa and he knows a lot about my extracurriculars and my future aspirations. Mentioned how I was one of a kind and he hoped the letter could do me justice, he's the best.

2. AP Gov/Macro Teacher: 9/10 - Known her since my freshman year (she's the Mock Trial coach) and had her as a teacher senior year. Really cool lady; she used to be in politics so she's very supportive of my political aspirations. She likes me a lot and mentioned my maturity and responsibility a lot in my letter.

3. State Representative: 7/10 - Not as personal as the other ones since he doesn't know me as well, but still nice. He mentioned some of my more career-oriented aspects and he knows me fairly well; definitely more than the average state rep knows their constituent.

4. County Commissioner: 10/10 - Got to know her really well during the two years I did Activity #1 plus I helped her write the letter. This one especially touched a lot on the specific community work I did and my passion for helping my community. Out of all my letters, I think this one was the most important.

**Interviews**

1. Yale: 6/10 - I got my likely letter phone call an hour before the interview so I wasn't sure what to expect. Went in and did my best but I feel like I wasn't as charismatic as I usually was. My interviewer also just didn't seem to react positively to anything I said so that was a bit of a bummer.

2. Harvard: 10/10 - I feel like this interview carried my Harvard app. The interviewer was a really nice guy, funny and honest about his time there. He showed real genuine interest in me and my background, I ended up talking to him a lot about my less common ethnic background (Chinese and Moroccan) and I feel like I was able to articulate really well how my upbringing and perspective have been shaped by my background.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: 8/10 - I tried to take a unique approach and talk about a lot of topics relating to who I am as a person. I used this overarching theme of my love for browsing Wikipedia and connected the things I learned on there to learning about aspects of myself. Completely overhauled the last paragraph in the last few days (but not before I submitted the old one to Georgetown and Harvard :,) haha)

Harvard Supplemental: 7/10 - I was on a time crunch to write this one since I was going out of the country. It's mostly a Frankenstein essay made up of bits and pieces of other essays I had written over the course of a year for college and scholarship-related things. More focus on my identity and how its shaped me.

Yale Supplemental: 9/10 - I felt like I did pretty good on these. I took a few days to write them all, the short response ones were especially good. I tried to be witty here and there and I think it worked.

Georgetown Essays: 8/10 - I gave myself plenty of time to write these and honestly thought they were pretty good. I would say these are the best bunch and they really let me showcase my passion and aspirations. 

All other essays: 6/10 - They're all a blur at this point. Not the worst but definitely room for improvement since I kind of powered through them. Didn't get any outside feedback on any of my essays so I went in raw lol.

All in all a crazy year for me. I still can't believe it sometimes but I'm glad it's all over!

I graduated 11 months ago with a BS in IT. I did have a desktop support sort of internship at a small firm where my biggest project was running around installing Windows Admin Center on the endpoints there to collect CPU/RAM statistics (was even a little bit tricky, had to do a powershell command on some systems that didn't want to play nice with it). Other then that I basically replaced keyboards, dealt with end users, changes ink cartridges, and did some phone VOIP zoom provisioning. I tried to learn proper scripting/coding at this time but I think it being an internship sort of depressed me.

My first gig out of college was a Data Center Technician gig at a start up cloud services provider. I ended up carrying literal tool bags and well - was lifting systems more than a third of my weight racking and stacking and building DCs endlessly. I did learn a lot about the network topography there (spine/leaf config for switches, what an EDGE network was, diff types of cabling like MTP, how OOB worked, ) and learned some basic troubleshooting (pinging, traceroute, etc) and did some some bash scripting even and built myself some tools for easy SSH access to grab stuff like MAC address info, automating pinging from IPs listed in a file, checking how many GPUs were still working, etc. I also did the patch panel manual work, running cables both ethernet and fiber, etc. This job didn't last because It was sort of physically killing me - lol.

My second gig was in mainframes/enterprise servers doing HP NonStop/Tandem. A whole bunch of FTP and command line interface stuff was being done in this role, and that linux/bash background I had actually helped a bit. Problem with this job was that it was quite literally a dead end job. I got really frustrated with finding normal IT work and kept getting harrassed by recruiters coming to me with posting demanding 25 years experience (despite me being 25 years old... lmao). I basically ran command line jobs and did tedious tasks in this role. During this time I get my Certified in Cybersecurity certification from ISC2. I also started my CCNA studies but ended up stopping because I had a lot of interviews and it made it really difficult to focus. I will be returning to this soon

I am now on my third gig. Junior Network/System Admin - and I start monday. I have been doing the Windows Server Admin 2019 course on udemy and I plan on finishing it this week. I then plan on doing a Udemy course on specifically AD, finishing up my CCNA,  then DNS, and then DHCP to really get a solid foundation on that stuff.  Hopefully I can bang out AWS Cloud Practicioner and Azure Fundamentals.

Do you guys have any advice regarding studying or career stuff?  I have been checking out the wiki and spending time here and I am starting to at least understand \*some\* of the questions asked here (a lot seem to be a bit over my head). The office I am going to be supporting is about 80 users and 100+  endpoints. I would be ofc under a normal/non junior sys admin. There is formal training but I am really trying to not just rely on that and really push myself.

The job entails AD/Hyper-V/DHCP/DNS duties as well as end user stuff."

0.5 years work-ex as software dev + a year's worth of internships.

Also got rejected by ASU MCS. I'm going with CMU MS ECE so these rejects are the least of my bothers (also have other better CS admits), but I'm still curious.

I have seen several similar rejections across these universities and UMass and NYU. Last year, someone got into UPenn MCIT and got rejected by NEU CS Align. Wonder what the reasons behind the discrepancies in these schools are.

The 'fit' argument does not make sense for masters in universities of such rankings, it will only hold logically for the top 10 or 15.

I don't understand the yield rate argument either, why would a university just reject someone when the chances of the person joining are non-zero? There is still a probability that such students with great credentials might join their batch and benefit the university, compared to having a slightly better yield rate, for what? I know people who would have very much gone with the offers from such universities had they not rejected them because they had 'too good of a profile'."

1. **Founder &amp; Content Creator** **for my startup revolving around ed-tech (Post HS graduation - present, 15hrs/week):** *Lead a team of 28 (15 while applying) from 6 countries. Post educational, scientific videos regularly. Developed a motion-sensing gaming controller using Arduino and Nintendo Wii to be paired with educational video games. Long term aim is to* ***revolutionize learning for students suffering from ADHD using technologies like motion-sensing and Mixed Reality****. Since then, we've built 3 prototypes for our products and tested them at elementary schools in my city.* 
2. **Web Dev Intern at a Data Analytics Company in India (remote) (Post HS graduation - 20hrs/week, 8weeks/yr):** *Redesigned a significant portion of the company's website; employed SEO techniques to raise activity by 11% (yeah, doesn't seem like that large of a no.); explored the role of ML and Statistical Algorithms in Big Data Analysis; shadowed a few devs to gain back-end development experience.*
3. **Research Intern at a Top 3 Eng. institute in India (12th - 40hrs/week, 9weeks/yr):** *Assisted a Mech Eng. prof conducting research on Computational Fluid Dynamics, specifically related to motorsports (keeping the topic vague on purpose). Gained valuable experience in C++ coding and SimScale operation. Attended thought-provoking seminars. The internship was supposed to last for 3 months but it was cut short due to the Delta COVID wave iirc (explained this in additional info.) Only* ***4 students were selected out of \~1200*** *for this opportunity.*
4. **Founder &amp; CEO at my startup revolving around Formula 1 (11th - present, 14hrs/week, 40weeks/yr):** *Lead a team of 12 F1 enthusiasts. Collect race data from AWS, convert it into CSVs, analyze the data using Matplotlib, and post the analytics for each race. I write weekly blogs (generally 2-3 per race weekend), hold sim-racing open lobbies on the F1 video game, and organize forum discussions. While applying, we were receiving* ***around 500-600 unique website viewers per month, and viewers were from 40+ countries!***
5. **Lead guitar player for my band in India (9th - 12th, 4hrs/week 45weeks/yr):** *Playing the guitar* ***since 2016.*** *Passed* ***Grade 6 in Trinity College, London Guitar exam with merit****. We organized bi-monthly concerts at old-age homes and community lawns. I also aided many newcomers in perfecting their technique (the band was basically started at the music academy where I learned to play). Even though I left the band when we moved to the US, I've continued playing the guitar and I mentioned this in additional info.*
6. **Vice Head Boy of the Student Council at my School (12th - 5hrs/week, 30weeks/yr):**  *Presided over weekly council meetings, spearheaded mental health awareness and road-safety campaigns; played a critical role in organizing special assemblies, inter-house sports competitions, and award ceremonies. At my school, you can only be a part of the student council in Grades 10 and 12, and I mentioned this in additional info. In 10th, I was a House Captain and I elaborated on this in additional info (although, I didn't do much as a House Captain).*
7. **Independent Volunteer and Tutor in my hometown (Summers of 10th and 11th - 30hrs/week, 10weeks/yr):** *I* ***tutored and mentored 80+ underprivileged students over 2 years*** *in Math, CS, English, Physics, and Chemistry.

I* ***collaborated with the Indian National Congress and raised roughly $4,000 to buy Lenovo tablets for the students to aid online learning*** *(this was during Covid when many weren't able to attend online classes due to a lack of electronic devices). Received an award from Congress for this.*
8. **President of the Science &amp; Innovation Club at my school (11th &amp; 12th - 4hrs/week, 20weeks/yr):** *We debated the latest developments and innovations in the scientific community. I hosted weekly coding/hacking competitions for the club (mainly Leetcode or sometimes CSS comps as well). I helped* ***grow the number of members by 150%****!! I did this mainly through attractive posters and numerous open-house sessions. By the end of Grade 12, this was the* ***3rd most popular club*** *after Chess and Arts clubs. In my additional info section, I mentioned how my school had a weird rule regarding if a student was part of the student council, they couldn't hold leadership positions in a club but the club co-ordinator saw extreme potential and enthusiasm in me and actually wrote multiple emails to the Principal requesting an exception. She finally gave in somewhere around the middle of 11th grade (hence the 20weeks/year due to an average of 11th and 12th). I did ask the club-coordinator, who was also my Physics teacher, to write me a LOR. He did, but I didn't end up submitting it as most of the schools I applied to only accepted 1 Teacher's LOR + Counselor's LOR.*
9. **Chess player and teacher (9th to 12th - 3.5hrs/week, 30weeks/yr):** ***Elo rating*** *while applying was* ***&gt;1950****. Won* ***4 golds and 3 silvers in random, but fairly big, chess tournaments*** *(most of them were district or state level). Weird that I mentioned it here, but while applying, my friend and I were* ***developing a rudimentary Chess engine*** *(it was a success!!). I held summer camps each year to mentor society kids* ***(earned around $450 over the 4 years)*** *and also was a* ***registered tutor*** *at a fairly well-known chess-tutoring-for-kids website.*
10. **MUNs (9th to 11th - 25hrs/week, 6weeks/yr):** *General MUN stuff. I was a committee member at one of my school's MUNs and I also served as Chair/Vice Chair/Rappo 4 times. I also helped students hone their public speaking skills in MUN workshops.* ***Of the 16 MUNs I participated in, I received awards in all (3 Best Dels).***

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. **Certificate of High Distinction and Lapel Pin from the Royal Australian Chemical Institute (International, 10th):** *Received this for getting a perfect score, and thus being in the top 1%, on the Australian National Chemistry Quiz. I mentioned how I achieved this score as a 10th grader while most of the exam-takers were upperclassmen.*
2. **Certificate for Clearing the Pre-Regional and Regional Indian Math Olympiad Qualifiers (National, 11th grade):** *I extrapolated on my efforts and criteria for clearing the stages in the Additional Info section.*
3. **Certificate of Merit for scoring a top rank in a rather competitive Talent Exam (National, 9th &amp; 10th grade):** *Got All India Rank (AIR) 224 (out of \~20,000) in Round 1 and AIR 18 in Round 2 (out of \~600)!! I also got selected for a training camp at a Top-5 engineering institute in India.*
4. **CBSE Merit List in 10th, Science stream school topper in 12th (National, School - 10th &amp; 12th grade)**
5. Welp that's it (I genuinely thought that we could only enter Academic Awards here, so I ended up leaving this slot empty as I had no other significant academic award XD)

**Letters of Recommendation**

**Math Teacher (Taught in Grades 9,10, and 11): solid 9.5/10;** She knows me since Primary school and has always been impressed with me. I actually saw the LOR she wrote and ong it was amazing!! She was going to retire from teaching, and no one had ever asked her for a LOR so she poured her heart out in writing one for me :D She spoke about my academic achievements (specifically awards #2 and #3) and about my overall interest in Science! The LOR was 2 whole pages!!!!

**Counselor (Principal): 8.5/10;** Again, she knows me since Primary School and we've had quite a healthy relationship throughout my schooling journey. She elaborated on my ECs and spoke a lot about my road safety and mental health initiatives! Her LOR wasn't as great as the one written by my Math teacher but it was quite good.

*Notice how I didn't have any LORs from teachers who only taught me in 11th and 12th. This was because my 11th and 12th grades were spent in online classes and I strongly feel that online classes didn't help me convey my values and passion in the same way as in-person classes!*

*I had 2 more LORs, one from my Physics teacher (also club coordinator) and Chemistry teacher. Both were quite good (&gt;8/10 for sure), but I did not submit them as none of the schools I applied to required more than 1 teacher LOR. Looking back, I should've definitely submitted at least one of them.* 

**Interviews**

Didn't have any interviews :')

**Essays**

**Common App essay: a very solid 9/10:** Wrote about my love for Formula 1 (watching since 2010) and sim-racing. I explained how many of my values are actually intertwined with F1's values (adaptability, collaboration, valuing things, etc.) using anecdotes for each value. I had it reviewed multiple times and the reviews were quite positive. But again, I liked it A LOT because I felt it painted a complete picture of me as an individual, and that's what matters at the end of the day :D 

**Supplemental Essays:** My 'Why CS @ Georgia Tech' essay was the BEST supplemental essay. 10/10. Others were quite good too. I spent a lot of time (&gt;10hrs easily per essay, a lot of time as I didn't have school lol) writing each supplemental essay, but I did get lazy and reused them for 2 UC PIQs and NYU's Identity essay :P 

***Tip: Never go for the strategy of perfect CA essay but mid supplemental essays.*** *As admissions get tougher and tougher, supplemental essays are going to be key in the admission process (especially due to yield protection and shit). Utilize them efficiently!!!! I genuinely believe that my s****upplemental essays were the key factor behind most of my acceptances!!!***

Now for the fun part :P

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* &gt;!Purdue CS (EA)  (yessir!) !&lt;
* &gt;!UIUC CS+Economics (EA)  (WOHOOOO!!!) (Dream college!!)!&lt;
* &gt;!Penn State Main (Campus) CS (EA)!&lt;
* &gt;!Northeastern CS+Business (EA) (Global Scholars lmfao) (applied cuz they didn't need any essays lol) !&lt;~~(Dream college)~~
* &gt;!UMD (not direct to CS) (EA)!&lt;
* &gt;!UMich Flint and Dearborn with Blue Scholarship CS (RD) (lmao I accidentally clicked 'Other Campuses on my UMich Ann Arbor application)!&lt;
* &gt;!UCSD CS (RD)   (OMG OMG!!)!&lt;
* &gt;!University of Washington Paul Allen School (CS) (RD) (LET'S FUCKING GO! Go Huskies!! Ily Udub :D) (Dream college!!) Committed to UW yesterday :DD!!!!&lt;

*Waitlists:*

* &gt;!UCLA CS (RD) (issok, was never gonna attend over UW anyways)!&lt;

*Rejections:*

* &gt;!NYU Stern BTE (RD)  (Dream college :(  ): Welp, its 50 spots lmfao, but I really liked the program. Rejection stings :')!&lt;
* &gt;!Berkeley EECS (RD): Nice! Ending decisions with a sweet reject :D!&lt;

**Final Thoughts:**

* *I didn't apply to any private colleges (except NYU and NEU for the memes lol): Why? Simply because I did not feel that it was worth paying 35k extra for private colleges when public colleges are simply better for CS. Considering my family's financials, I did not expect to receive any aid, and my parents and I came to a mutual decision that public colleges were the way to go!*
* *HOW IN HELL DID I BAG SO MANY DECISIONS WHEN MY ECs WEREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD COMPARED TO OTHERS?? My hot take: Because the A/Os could see that I wasn't doing my ECs for the sake of college admissions. Up until Nov 2021 (after 12th grade midterms), I wasn't even planning to pursue undergrad in the US. I was prepping for JEE, which is a really tough entrance exam here in India (hence not many ECs in 11th and 12th). I explained all this in my Addntl Info section. Moving to the US was a too-good-to-miss opportunity for my family as in the back of our minds, we knew that the US was much better to pursue an undergrad than India, and since we were coming on a Visa category which basically guarantees a Green Card in under 2 years, we decided to jump on the opportunity :D! It was always my dream to study in the US, but I was planning for a Masters rather than a Bachelors. The fact that I pursued so many ECs simply because I loved them was the BIGGEST factor behind my acceptances, as far as I believe. Also, the fact that I had a fruitful gap year (an internship plus two startups) was a really positive sign too.* 
* *As an International, I am SUPER SUPER SUPER thankful to my parents and College Essay Guy for supporting me throughout this process. Admissions are super tough for us internationals and we should be extremely proud of ourselves for getting into a good US university (and by good, I don't mean T20s, anything T100 is very very VERY good).*"

I would like to hear your thoughts on how to go about choosing between these schools. I will be graduating from my BS in 2023 and will be joining for the Fall 2023 cycle.  
Down the line, I would like to work in architect, rtl design or verification roles. Research is not a priority and the first priority is to get a job after graduating (international student).   
From what I believe:  
1. Coursework - UMich &gt; CMU &gt; UCSD  
2. Location - UCSD &gt; UMich = CMU - I am not sure if this will play a major role provided that hiring mostly happens online now and most hirers do come to UMich and CMU.  
3. Affordability - UCSD &gt; UMich = CMU  
4. TA/RA Opportunities - UCSD &gt; CMU &gt; UMich  
5. Co-Op Interns - UCSD(gives credits too) &gt; UMich=CMU(can do, but no credits given)  
6. Career fairs - I believe all of them are equal in this aspect.

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I ended my bachellor in Videogame Development at 25, ended uni with the feeling  that I didn't like it too much as a professional path to pursue.

**I just have 6 months of working experience** I acquired in a place I worked for an internship, where I did some free work for a subject in my grade and later hired me for said 6 months.

Now I find myself aged **26 to 27** later this year and I'm starting to get offers from technological consulting companies, I just have AWS Practitioner and an english C2 certification, which I think, at the end are just about 10% of what I could have by now **should I had done things correctly.**

Now I dread when thinking that when I'm 30 if everything goes smoothly, which never does, I'll just have 3 years of experience and *Junior* standing in a company. And I've met several teachers that by 30-ish they already were *Senior.*

I hope this isn't understood as a rant or a camouflaged flex, which it absolutely isn't. I'm not one to flex about anything, if anything, to only see the negative parts of what I have achieved.

My situation: I am a junior and I have applied for 500-600 jobs this 2022-2023 school year. I was lucky enough to get interviews with a few companies like Qualtrics, Whatnot, Square, Microsoft, Sigma Computing, etc. For the last season, if my resume got through the initial screen and the OA, the chances that I got to the final is 90%. However, the problem is I always fail at the last round or the second to last round.

I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong at that step. I don't know what companies are looking for at the final round/ second to final round. I understand that for the first round, resume is the key. For second coding round and behavioral, it is leetcode and communication. However, companies tend to have multiple coding rounds and I often failed at the very last round although 80% of the time I did a pretty good job. 

Does anyone have any insights on this? What should I do? I was thinking that it is because of my resume. My resume is enough to pass the initial screen but when it got to the hiring committee, it is not strong enough. It's just my guess because I don't know how recruiting works internally. If you have some insights, please let me know! I would love to know what you think!

About my resume: Have 2 internships before, mostly in frontend. Little exposure to  backend."

HI everyone,
lam a student currently looking to pursue my undergraduate studies in computer science.
Unfortunately, my grades are not strong enough to secure admission into top-tier public universities in the EU. As a result, I am considering private universities.
I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or advice regarding private universities in the EU that offer excellent computer science programs. I am particularly interested in universities that have a strong reputation and provide ample opportunities for internships and industry connections.
To clarify, I am excluding France and Germany as potential destinations for my studies. I am open to considering any other country within the EU.

Sunt putin in impas si nu stiu ce decizie sa iau, la firma curenta am prins un proiect foarte naspa, folosind ceva framework intern, de luni bune fac doar debugging, n-am implementat niciun buton sau endpoint pana acum. Sunt si proiecte interesante, insa manager-ul meu nu doreste sa ma schimbe, dupa ce am avut 2 discutii pe tema asta.

UiPath, fiind firma cu produs propriu, cred ca sunt mai ok, presupun ca asta inseamna si ca posibilitatea de invatare va fi mai buna. Pe LinkedIn vad ca multa lume se bate pe pozitiile lor. Insa am auzit si zvonuri cum ca ar lua multi interni si ar pastra mai apoi sub 50%.

Ce ati face in locul meu, sa renunt la job-ul curent pentru UiPath sau sa continui la firma curenta?"

They have an amazing program for my major (literally the top school) but I’ve heard many not so great things about the school. 

Is it really true that they are so competitive  that I wouldn’t be able to get into clubs, get LOR from professors, get access to internships, etc? I do work hard and my personality is the type that strives in a competitive environment but I fear that it may be better off to go to another state school or even an out of state safety where I would thrive from being a “top student”. Does anyone have any input? 

I would like to just say that I am so grateful to have been accepted and this is in no way a complaint about my decisions :)"

Currently making 70K and I’ve been in the IT field for 9 years now, and at this current job for almost 3 years. My pay is consistent within my small departments, but that doesn’t say much as I think the whole department is underpaid. For reference, I know that our entry level software engineers/late stage interns make 100K+ on the low end. Same goes for our project managers and customer success mangers. I appreciate some feedback from you all on what my worth is, as I’m still young and figuring things out. 

The description of what I do at work is ever growing and I’ll probably forget some things, but this is at least most of what I do on a weekly basis. 

My job mainly focuses on implementing and onboarding our clients on the technical side, as well as dealing with the highest level support/helpdesk tickets that come into our queue. I work with IT counterparts (DBAs, CIOs, CTOs, and various other stake holders on the project) on the customer end to integrate their various IT systems into our platform, whether that be databases, firewalls, and other client devices on the network. I’m also a SME when it comes to our own technology and how it works to integrate with various counterpart softwares. I work with our own project management team to set client expectations and come up with solutions for integrating, as each client’s implementation is unique. 

I also work with our sales and training team to support them with higher leave technical questions from customers and prospective customers.  

I also manage the networks at our offices, and am sort of a catch-all for anything regarding technical problems that happen under our roofs.  
I’m on an on-call rotation for escalations from our support desk that is 1 week on 1 week off, but when shit hits the fan, regardless if I’m on call or not, I get the calls from our C-suite to help resolve the issues. 

The job also involves some travel to higher profile clients during times of emergency. It isn’t all that often, but when something comes up that needs immediate on site support for something high-level and important, its me getting on a plane to go fix the problem. 


I’ve got experience in and am considered one of the experts at my place of work in the following:
Windows
Mac OS
Debian based OSs 
Routing/switching 
Firewalls
Databases
IP Video 

I also have experience, but not what I would call an expert in project management (Google PM courses), Python (self taught), and the AWS Cloud (Cloud practitioner level, working on architect.) 

Hours are typically 8-6, but as things go in the support department, there’s always more work to be done. Often having to work late and some weekends to even attempt to keep up with the workload. 


Again, I’m probably leaving some stuff out, I’ll add anything else I can think of in the comments, but please feel free to ask more detail if needed. Any feedback from the group on what this job should be worth would be much appreciated. 

Thanks,"

I'll be graduating with my Bachelors in May and have yet to land a job. I've been applying pretty consistently for the last 2 months and here and there before that. I've only had a few interviews, and with it getting closer to the summer I'm getting a little worried I won't land anything. For context I don't have any internships, but I do have an officer position in an interesting club, a number of projects that I helped lead, three years at my schools IT department, and a 3.75 GPA.

I'm on the second round of the Dev 10 interviews, it seems like a nice enough program, the pay is kinda low and not knowing where I'll end up sucks, but at least I would have a job. My other option is to not do Dev 10 and to continue working at my current job this summer while I apply. 

I guess my questions are: 

To those who have experience with Dev 10, is it a waste of time for a CS grad? Are there a lot of CS people in the program? It seems they have a data science track and a software development track, I'm leaning towards data science since I think I'd learn more there. 

To everyone else, do companies even hire junior devs during the summer? Or are they all hiring for start dates in January and June? If I decided against Dev 10 how likely would it be for me to get a job before next year?

(I have had offers from Tesla, SpaceX, Apple, Microsoft, and more)",EngineerinStudent,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/127qzmi/guide_for_how_to_get_an_internship_how_to_be_a/,"TLDR, your resume is THE most important thing. Do something cool then make sure you portray it and yourself in a way that makes an employer want to hire you. 


Odds are, your resume needs fixing. If you’ve applied to hundreds of openings and still don’t have an internship or job - I hope this guide can help you. 

Using websites and tools I’ve linked below will get you very far with tailoring your resume to play the game of job applications. Most resumes aren't read by a real person until they pass through the automated systems. In addition, often the first person to see your resume may be non-technical so be sure to make things easy to understand. Don't go too in-depth. Having lots of numbers/figures will catch anyone's attention because everyone can understand these metrics. (Improved efficiency by 80%, cut costs by X%, saved the company $$$, etc, etc)


The best thing you can do to get started is read the wiki on r/engineeringresumes, then read many top posts on there, then post an anonymized copy of your own resume. You need to get some brutal and constructive criticism on your resume first.


Here are references and tools I use:

https://www.jobalytics.co/

https://resumeworded.com/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Engineeringresumes


For refining the keywords on my resume, jobalytics is probably my favorite.


Download the chrome extension, then make a word doc, or somewhere else you can start storing notes.


Upload your resume to the chrome extension, then go to LinkedIn and start searching for jobs you are interested in. Click on a listing, then use the chrome extension and have it tell you ""Words you are missing in your resume” copy and paste this list of ~10-15 words the word doc. Repeat this for ~10 job listings or so - continue to paste the missing words into a word doc.


After you have all of these words that you are missing, start looking for common trends in the words, or think about what words you can work on implementing into your resume.
Try to implement as many words as possible into your resume. 


After you are done, reupload your resume to the Chrome extension, and start looking at ~5-10 job postings again for keywords you are missing.


Repeat this until you are not missing many words. A good resume with metrics and meeting the keyword requirements is probably the most important thing to getting an interview. Getting past the automated screening is difficult with how many job applicants there are.


Once you have an interview: prep for it by going over all of the common questions that a company may ask: https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/index.html


On my resume, employers are always interested to hear about my 3D printing business / webtool I developed that has thousands of users. Being able to take an idea to production says a lot about a person. In addition, my internship and other work experience has allowed me to gain a lot of practical engineering knowledge outside of the classroom. They also loved seeing that I was active in an engineering club in my first semester of college. 


Companies are also always excited to see FSAE experience, solar car experience, rocket club experience, etc. Many students graduate with no experience, so the people working in these engineering clubs are at a major advantage as they’ve been doing actual engineering since their first semester of university. If your university has an engineering club that actually builds something, hardware or software, - join it asap and commit to working as many hours with it if you can. Your career prospects will thank you. 


After you get to the interview, someone thinks that you are qualified enough to have the position so they're going to primarily be seeing how you are at communicating, how you would react to problematic scenarios, how you would approach a problem, etc. Your resume, projects, etc will show that you have the technical knowledge and can apply it, but a business and internship need you to work on a team so they are testing you as a person.


I got my sophomore year internship at Tesla from an employee referral (another intern). Someone I had worked with in a project class during my first year of university. Knowing people and reaching out to alumni from your university at companies will get you very far. I know that there are more qualified people than me out there, but I may have never applied to this position if I hadn’t been referred. Networking is important.


After your resume is good, the rest is a numbers game. Depending on the economy, your previous experiences, etc, you may need to apply for 400+ internships. This is a numbers game - spend several hours per day applying to a wide variety of companies (especially if this is your first internship or job) 


Bonus tip: I’ve found that co-ops (6+ month internships) are easier to get as there are fewer students applying for them. Apply to them as a moonshot - if you get the offer, figure out what taking a semester off will do to your graduation schedule. Remember you can always take college courses online from many different universities during the school year, or over the summer. UND, ASU, UW Madison, etc, all offer lots of online engineering courses over the summer/some during the year.

That’s all. Let me know if you have any questions."

127sj2j,4,2023-03-31,"[CO, US] Coworker has been berating and denigrating me for months. Small company, no HR department.",Pink_Graptopetalum,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/127sj2j/co_us_coworker_has_been_berating_and_denigrating/,"Hello, I hope this is the right place for this post.

Some background:

I work for a small company (1 owner, 3 employees) with no HR department. We WFH and are paid a salary (not hourly). This is a small field with limited and highly competitive job prospects. I'm not sure if any of the following is relevant: When I was 30, I quit my comfy job as a project manager to switch careers. I went back to school, got a STEM degree, and now I'm doing work I truly love.

At work, our client base has been growing over the last year and we're slammed with work. We just hired a part time summer intern and may offer him a full-time position in the fall. Next month, we are launching a new product that will bring on even more clients! It's very exciting, and we are VERY busy.

The owner is in his mid-60s and has been dropping hints about retiring in the next 5-ish years. I am interested in a partnership, and possibly buying the company. I love the work I do, and I feel like I'm in a good life position to take over. I plan to discuss a partnership with the owner in the coming weeks. 

The problem:

A coworker (let's call him Sam) has been demeaning and berating me with augmentative and inflammatory language since October 2022. **When I brought this issue to the owner (let’s call him Ted) in December, he said he would talk to Sam and tell him to stop. I asked Ted if I did anything to provoke Sam, or if anything I’ve said or done was upsetting in any way. Ted assured me I did not instigate this situation.** I believe Ted spoke with Sam about this shortly thereafter. Sam seemed to back off for a few weeks, but his attitude towards me quickly deteriorated again by the end of January. This subreddit sidebar says to be specific, so I will provide two examples:

* Example 1: I have been automating tedious, time consuming, error-prone tasks such as entering hundreds of data points into spreadsheets every week. This task requires 3-9 hours per week when done manually. The new process is simple, quick, and eliminates data entry errors: click the red button in excel, and the data populates in seconds. I showed Ted and my other coworker. They were both receptive and appreciated the time this will save us, especially since our workload is growing rapidly. Ted then asked me to call Sam and demonstrate the process change to him. **I had been on the call with Sam for less than two minutes when he interrupted my demo to chew me out. He said I was terrible at this job, and that this spreadsheet shows I am ""untrained"", and that I am ""ripping up everything"" and ""tearing apart"" his work.** I listened to Sam and then tried to address his concerns, but he wouldn’t let me say more than a few words before continuing to shout. After 30 minutes, I interrupted his ranting with ""I need to walk the dog, he's crying to go out"" and ended the call. My husband (also works from home) happened to be nearby and could hear Sam yelling at me through my headset.

* Example 2: We have variable schedules and rotate between early morning and afternoon shifts with occasional late-night operations and monitoring. This is typically a one-person shift. When I work the afternoon/evening shift, Sam is always around. About a month ago, I was on an evening shift where conditions were quiet. Around 9pm, Sam pinged the MS Teams group chat, asking if I was monitoring, and what I thought might happen over the next hour or two. I replied with my analysis of current and future conditions. He then started blowing up the chat, quizzing me on technical details and advanced theories. I could tell he was aggravated with me by his rapid-fire chat behavior. I tried to diffuse this barrage of Teams messages (20-30 consecutive, short messages, some in all caps, ending with ?!!?!?!!) by replying with something like ""It's kind of late for a pop quiz, don't you think? lol"". This did not work. **He continued spamming messages into the group chat, saying he was ""baby sitting"" me, and I need to answer his questions because I ""still need to prove"" myself to him, and that I have ""not earned [his] trust"".** I spoke with Ted about this the next day. Ted was not only offended on my behalf, he was angry Sam worked late when only one person was needed.

I've been working for this company for three years. Ted and my other coworker have given me nothing but positive feedback. My former professors invite me to give lectures on campus a few times a year, I mentor undergrad seniors, I'm active in the local community for this field of work, and I try to stay up to date with the latest research. 

I do not understand why Sam gives me so much pushback and grief. I can't necessarily claim this is harassment because Sam has not directly mentioned anything about my gender. I've spoken to some friends (peers, other women in STEM fields) and they suspect there might be some gender discrimination at play. At the very least, I believe Sam has created an uncomfortable, unproductive, and toxic working environment for myself, my other coworker, Ted, and any future employees.

**As I mentioned above, I plan on discussing a partnership with Ted in the coming weeks. I'm trying to butter him up. I do not want to make waves or burden him with more Sam drama.**

My questions:

* Can I do anything to diffuse future outbursts and disrespectful language/behavior? 
* My husband (who has heard Sam yell at me several times) believes Sam is verbally assaulting me and thinks I should leave the call or close Teams without warning next time. Should I abruptly leave calls and/or close Teams? 
* Should I confront Sam? 
* Is this something that can/should simply be ignored? 
* Should I seek advice from a different subreddit? (if so, where?)

TL;DR: I am looking for advice regarding an aggressive coworker who has been berating and denigrating me at work for months. Small company, no HR. The owner has spoken with my coworker about his behavior, but my coworker’s toxic treatment toward me continues."

I have fortunately received admits from Purdue and Columbia university for MS CS programs and I am confused between the two. I am still waiting for UCSD, UCLA and Gatech but I don't have much hopes left.

First off, I wish to do a job (either as an SDE or as an MLE) after my graduation. I don't plan to pursue a PhD. My research interests during undergrad have been in the ML side however I am open to doing systems coursework as well during my postgrad (since my major during UG was electrical engineering).

So far, based on the discussions I have had with seniors and professors, I have been able to deduce the following:

Pros for Purdue:

1. Very good systems coursework and research.
2. Full tuition fee waivers if I get a TA/RAship. (apparently this is not very hard since Purdue has a lot of UG students and they need TAs). They also offer a stipend on top of this.
3. Accommodation is way cheaper.

Cons for Purdue:

1. It's in the middle of nowhere.
2. ML research as well as good courses in this domain is seriously lacking at Purdue.
3. Weather is very cold.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros for Columbia:

1. Good courses and Good profs in both ML as well as Systems side.
2. New York, hence networking opportunities is great. People say that this is a big plus for getting internships and jobs however I also received opinions that it doesn't matter since everything is being done virtually these days.
3. Better brand value (again not sure how important this is if I am comparing with Purdue).

Cons for Columbia:

1. Huge cost difference. The tuition fee is way too high plus they don't offer any waivers on becoming a TA/RA. Only stipend is given which barely covers living expense.
2. New York, hence rent is very high and finding an accommodation would be a task.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if there is something that I am missing in the above discussion. Moreover, I am looking forward to hearing what others would have done in my position (via poll and if possible reasoning in comments). I think this discussion can be extended to anyone who is confused between going for a cheaper (and lower ranked in some metrics) university vs a more expensive Ivy.

I've been following the community for a bit now, and was hoping for a bit of career advice for anyone so-inclined to help.

I graduated from college May of 2022 with a degree in Emerging Media and a minor in Computer Science. That being said, I took many more CS related courses than was required for the completion of the minor. My goal is to end up as a Software Engineer, preferably somewhere in the realm of Backend Web Development.

I took the job hunt pretty seriously out of school, however due to my parents health I had to take a break and focus on them and my part-time job. A year later, I'm finally able to start putting sincere time and effort back into applications and personal projects. However, I'm concerned as I made the mistake of not getting any internships in college as I was very focused on extra-curriculars - none of which were CS related. When I was still actively applying, I crunched out about 200 applications only to hear back from a handful of companies, and received two interviews. I've read through many of the similar posts here, and seen many people receive great advice.

I've tried to follow the resume-guidelines suggested in the FAQ, modified to take up a bit more space and give hiring managers a bit better of an idea at the skill set I've accumulated thus far without over-burdening the page. If you'd be so kind, the questions I have are:

* What edits, if any, could I make to my resume to better grab the attention of hiring managers? I've tried to keep it concise with what I've learned/accomplished from my projects and courses.
* Are my projects at a scale of knowledge that would show I'm able to participate in a junior role?
* Would it be worth my time to consider alternate roles, such as IT desk support or software consulting? I say this with potential hopes of breaking into a development role further down the road.

Thank you very much in advance for any/all advice you all could offer me. As everyone else is, the massive layoffs have me worried that I'm now competing with an even greater number of people, most of which have more industry experience than I do. Looking forward to hearing back from you all!

Hello! I was recently accepted into four bioinformatics Master’s programs:

Carnegie Mellon University’s Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics program

Johns Hopkins University’s Bioinformatics program

Now, I am trying to decide where to go. My formal background, including my BS, is almost entirely in biology, but I do have some programming experience from self study/online courses and an internship (I did take one college level computer science class, though). 

After graduating, I think I’m more inclined to work in industry. As of right now I’m not sure enough to go for a PHD, but that might change, so I want to keep my options open. 

I know that the Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics program is new, but it seems to share a lot with CMU’s Computational Biology program, so I’m hopeful. The other programs seem to be older, but I’m still having trouble finding reliable rankings. 

Any thoughts on where I should go? Any alumni of these programs want to share their experiences?

My school's program is a combination of computer science, mathematics, IT, and mathematics. I have taken many electives as part of the general education requirements, including many business classes, but not enough of anything for a minor in business or other topic.

In the US, this would be no problem. There are many programs here that I meet the requirements for. A year ago, before I met my girlfriend, Germany wouldn't have been an option, but now I am kicking myself for not majoring in Computer Science. 

I am interested in an IT or information systems programs in Germany in English. I have been viewing these from the DAAD international program website, and I'm starting to feel very discouraged, as I don't think the breadth of my degree allows me to meet the qualifications. The IT programs require an electrical engineering background and the Information Systems programs require a computer science degree with a business minor or vice versa. Many programs have their requirements and an ambiguous ""or related degree"" exception.

For Example, from a program website: 

## Entry requirements

1.  Fachhochschulreife/Allgemeine Hochschulreife \[i.e. an entrance qualification for studies at universities of applied sciences or at universities\] or an equivalent qualification.
2. Bachelor's degree or equivalent in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology, Computer Science, Mechatronics or **another closely related field of study.**

I'm planning on applying to a handful of programs. I'm worried that my ""closely related field of study"" is not enough to meet these requirements fulfilled by a pure IT or CS degree. 

As a student, I will be graduating with a 3.8 overall GPA on the American 4.0 scale. I also have a solid resume with multiple internships in the field. My goal is to become a cybersecurity leader and an info systems management degree would be a perfect fit. 

Does anyone have experience getting into a program that requires a computer science degree (or related) and fell into the related category? How lenient have you found admissions staff to be when evaluating applications? Will my application be generally removed by a computer system before people can read a motivation letter?"

I have 4 years of IT experience, and 2 years of being a sys admin.

I got a IT help desk job when I was a freshman (upgrade from working in Walmart, lol) and worked my way up to sys admin, all while in school for computer science.

Now I’m about to graduate and I feel stuck in IT. I make 75k and I repeatedly get emails for jobs that pay 90k. Add in my CS degree and experience I can get a high end IT job relatively easily. 

But, I’m screwed regarding becoming a software engineer/developer. I don’t have any experience except school coding wise (except for writing scripts). And I feel like if I were to become a super junior software engineer I’m restarting my career, definitely won’t get a job making 90k (especially in my MCOL state and the current job market for devs) 

I also am realizing that IT jobs seem more secure then software engineering ones (from what I’ve seen). I live in a state with a LOT of startups and so many of them are having a shit ton of layoffs. 

I tried getting a software engineering internship but I kept bombing the coding interviews. 

I feel like I’m just way better at IT stuff. 

What should I do?"

So, here is my situation:

I am an international student in the US, currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science. I am in a VERY BAD university (not going to mention the name here). It is bad in every aspect. Academically, my master's level courses are easier than my high school classes (and I am not exaggerating). Moreover, there are numerous regulations, and generally, the school is run by some mafia (ok, here I am exaggerating a bit).

Just to let you understand how bad it is: I am a grad student, and I am not allowed to live off-campus. Previously, the rule was that if you move off-campus, you lose your work-study, then some of your scholarship and the work-study. Now, they have just prohibited moving off-campus and raised costs (literally will expel and cancel SEVIS if you try).

They hire people with no background, skills, or experience, and I bet even with no appropriate authorization (just because the school is mostly run by immigrants, DISCLAIMER: I am completely fine with immigrants, because I am one of them, but not when they threaten international students - kids by canceling their SEVIS).

I am not going to explain how I ended up here. Let's just say I was scammed at a very inappropriate moment in my life. I couldn't know that before I came, and most likely couldn't avoid that.

I did not come to the US to get any degree and just find a job. I came to get a GOOD degree and then find a job. And here is why it is important to understand: for this summer, I was able to secure an internship, even though it cost me a mental breakdown, mainly thanks to my previous education and experience. This position is in a good company; you most likely know the name. They are ready to work with me after summer, and they are ready to do the OPT and so on (by the way, I have one year left to study, and I am the first international student in this ""amazing"" place to secure an internship).

But I have an unfulfilled dream of high-level education. I am really looking for a challenge that could make me feel worthy, that I would enjoy dealing with, backed by the solid faculty, and at least some kind of brand name in the educational world. If my goal were solely immigration purposes, I would already be satisfied with my life, yet I am not. I don't like what I am doing. I am wasting so much time with no use, with people who are not motivated to learn, who are not passionate about what they are doing and the subject, who are just fine with the quality of education here, which is below any existing standards.

My ambitions are way higher than what I am receiving, and that is sooooo depressing. When you know how much more you can do, yet you just don't get a chance to do that.

I could learn a lot by myself, and I did. I have a pretty solid background in my field. But there is something you can never achieve without some sort of guidance, and that is what I am looking for.

***End of the backstory***

I have decided to reapply and start my Master's from scratch in Fall 2023.

I have a somewhat decent profile, well, it is not super exceptional, but anyway:

* GPA: 4.0 from the 2nd ranked university in my country.
* 1 international research paper (AI/ML) (co-author).
* 1 research paper in progress (AI/ML).
* 9 months undergrad TA experience,
* 2.5 years of professional experience (SWE)
* around 5 personal projects (in AI/ML)
* finalist in a couple of international startup contests
* winner in a couple of local hackathons
* recipient of a couple of national recognitions, scholarships, and awards
* 2 strong LoRs, 1 average LoR, somewhat good SoP and PS

My major concern is finances. Due to the international situation, I am not ready to take risks with loans (most likely, due to my nationality, nobody will give me one). So, I applied to around 15 universities. Some are obviously very ambitious, like Cornell, but to get some funding, you have to be ambitious, aren't you?...

Anyway, I received 4 admits and 1 rejection so far (from Cornell, which was my top choice. I am still depressed about it). 10 more results are still pending, but those are either rejections, or even if they are admits, the financial aid would not meet my needs.

So, what I have got is:

* George Washington University MS CS: 75% scholarship
* Syracuse University MS CS: 40% scholarship
* Vanderbilt University MS DS: no aid
* Fordham University MS CS: pretty much all the tuition is covered

The bad news is that I barely have enough money to cover my living expenses, so my only option is Fordham. But, from what I have read, its CS department is not very strong. Generally speaking, it is a pretty mediocre major. A pretty reasonable statement would be that it is by far better than what I have now. However, based on my research, it seems like their program is a bit shallow and does not really build a strong professional since they are a more Liberal Arts-oriented school.

And I don't want to sound arrogant, but unfortunately, I am right now the best among the worst. What I would prefer is to be the worst among the best. Just changing one place, which is bad, for another place, which is better, and indeed different but not to the extent I need it. Besides, transferring would also mean losing the job opportunity I already have because it is tied to the location.

I am really lost. When Cornell rejected me, my last glimpse of hope for the life I could live has gone. I understand that it seems like I will never be able to fulfill my dream of getting the highest quality education, and that really makes me sad. I don't want to postpone my education to my late 20s. I really want to pursue it now, but unfortunately, I don't have such a chance, and this will probably be my most unfulfilled dream.

FINALLY, here is the question: What should I do?

I am just seeking advice on how to be excused from a course requirement. I am a double stem major at a really prestigious school. I have done 6. years in a 5 year program and I am expected to graduate on May 25. I am trying to figure out a way to plead my case to be excused from calculus. I have failed the class 3 times and I am on pace to fall the course substitution. I didn’t take a lot of maths in highschool and during Covid math was given a pass/fail grade with an extreme curve due to the pandemic. I have had two internships, one of them being at the university and the other with the state. I have completed the other courses needed, I had a recommendation letter (for my resume) from one of the professors, I have the needed credits. I just need help trying to plead my case. I have jobs lined up post graduation, and don’t want calculus being the only reason I continue to stay in school."

I got a IT help desk job when I was a freshman (upgrade from working in Walmart, lol) and worked my way up to sys admin, all while in school for computer science.

Now I’m about to graduate and I feel stuck in IT. I make 75k and I repeatedly get emails for jobs that pay 90k. Add in my CS degree and experience I can get a high end IT job relatively easily. 

But, I’m screwed regarding becoming a software engineer/developer. I don’t have any experience except school coding wise (except for writing scripts). And I feel like if I were to become a super junior software engineer I’m restarting my career, definitely won’t get a job making 90k (especially in my MCOL state and the current job market for devs) 

I also am realizing that IT jobs seem more secure then software engineering ones (from what I’ve seen). I live in a state with a LOT of startups and so many of them are having a shit ton of layoffs. 

I tried getting a software engineering internship but I kept bombing the coding interviews. 

I feel like I’m just way better at IT stuff. 

What should I do?"

2. **ap seminar teacher (656743/10)-** ABSOLUTE STAR 🤩🤩 MS\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* I LOVE YOU &lt;3 She encouraged me to push through w my adhd diagnosis and stood up for me with my parents and guidance. Constantly asked me what I wanted on my rec. letter and read over my personal statement. Never let me forget how bright my future is, despite struggling a lot with academics 🥺. Gonna go out this weekend and buy her a gift.
3. **guidance counselor/budget therapist (10/10)-** Really helped me navigate my constant stream of late assignments and procrastination habits. Encouraged me to seek diagnosis and helped me be the best me I can be &lt;3

**Interviews**

LMAO NONE. . . probably for the better 😶

**Essays**

1. **Personal Statement: (11:27/12:00)** Started off with vivid imagery of getting beat up in a karate match because no matter how good your technique is, bad timing=you miss=you die. Transition to piano, guitar, playing in a band and how I always rushed my pieces. Transition to chem research, living alone, and realizing the time I hoped to spend being a slay studious stem girl was more-so dealing with rats in my apartment and handing raw chicken. Overarching message of ""omg my sense of time was shit but now is no longer shit"". 
2. **Supplements: (idk)** some good, some not so good. Most of them were very sarcastic, jokey, and cringey asf. In schools with multiple supplements, I had at least one essay with a more serious tone to show I can actually not be dumb as bricks. If anyone's curious about specific ones let me know. 

**ADDITIONAL INFO**

Got diagnosed ADHD June of grade 11 on my own 'cause ""mommy and daddy say no"" even though ""teachers say yes since grade 7"". Was generally struggling with deadlines and stuff throughout school but having the expectations of former gifted kid pulled me through. Despite having obvious concentration difficulties I couldn't get accommodations for how I stared at a ceiling during 80% of the time in a test. I wasn't allowed into AP Calc and AP Chem because of lower grades- But hey! Just happy I'm now a druggie (legal adderal ofc.)😤 and am doing a lot better in grade 12 (with grades reflective of that).

English Teacher:

She also pretty close to me and help me get the summer job at Starbucks since I got really into coffee/latte art in junior year. Given my relationship with her maybe a 8-9/10

Math Teacher/NHS advisor:

I talk to her occasionally but not often since she's always busy doing stuff for the school. Really chill and was so glad I asked her to write my rec letter. Also prob 8-9/10

I honestly don't know how to rank these

**Interviews**

MIT (10/10) Bro we just clicked. He loved the stories I told him about cyber and some of the projects I working on. Legit said like that's type of stuff an MIT student would do. Also talked about sports, and family things. Went for like an hour

Princeton (8/10) She basically asked like who I was, some hobbies I had, and that was it. Then, she turned it on me to ask some questions. I had some prepared but at some point, it felt like I was interviewing her now. I asked way more questions than she did to me. Still went really well. Tried tie in facts about myself in my questions to her to make it seem like I was a good fit for Princeton. She told me that she really hopes I get in and to contact her if I have any more questions. Went for like 40 mins.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

*I have never experienced more pain in my life than the week of writing essays, but I think the majority of my essays were really good. Not going to talk to much about them since a lot of them are personal but I'd give them a 8/10. MIT, however, sucked balls. It was my last application and I was so burned out and I don't even think I would like MIT. I wrote my MIT supp in like 2 hours, let my dad check it, and submitted. MIT is like 5/10.*

All of my essays were done either the day of or like a week before.

I stuck with the same topic for my Common App for RD schools but rewrote it a lot to. After getting rejected from Stanford, I found some major flaws that I needed to fix.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *EA: Maryland (College Park Scholars with Business, Society, and Economy program)*
* *EA: Georgia Tech*
* RD: Notre Dame (Likely Letter w/ Merit Scholarship Semifinalist status)
* RD: Rice University
* Rolling: UCF (Full Ride + Honors College)

Reflection:

It will be a tough decision between Notre Dame, Rice, and GT. I so so so thankful to have those options and for everyone I had in my life that helped me get here. Even though I never fulfilled my childhood dream of getting into Stanford or an Ivy, I believe going through these rejections have nurtured some mental fortitude in me. All of these outcomes are what fate had in store for me, so I am going to make the best out of it, wherever I might go. I cannot believe this journey is finally over but I am thankful it is. Good luck to all the juniors next year. Remember to believe in yourself and to orient your goals to something that is in your control. Peace out r/collegeresults r/ApplyingToCollege"

* Princeton (8.5/10) the interview was really late and I had also just come back from a competition, we connected well and exchanged contact info.

**Final Thoughts**

* This process has been a rollercoaster, but I couldn't be more grateful for how it has ended. After my deferral from UPenn, I didn't think I'd have any chance of getting into my top schools, but here I am. As much as I've hated this process, at the same time, I've loved it, and I have grown immensely because of it. For everyone out there embarking on your college application journey, please continue to stay disciplined (start studying for the SAT and working on supps now), relax (you don't need to be college focused 24/7, trust me, GO AND HAVE FUN), and most importantly BELIEVE IN YOURSELF and take pride in all of your achievements no matter how big or small (this can make or break your app trust me).
* Deferral does not mean rejection, WRITE THOSE LOCIs!!!
* You may be wondering where I'll be attending and tbh the choice is difficult. As of right now its between Penn and Princeton and when my Fin-Aid letters arrive I'll make the final decision. 
* PLZ PM ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!"

***Letters of Recommendation***

LOR 1 - AP Chem teacher - loved him, I hope he loved me, I used him for my isef project and alot of other stuff, and he seemed very interested, he’s known to write good rec’s so id say 8/10 being conservative

LOR 2 - US History Teacher - only non ap history i took but he was genuinely so amazing of a teacher, he liked me, i read his rec since he let me, it was pretty good 6/10

LOR 3 - EC#1 research mentor - old guy who really liked me and said he specifically tailored my rec for MIT and Caltech whatever that means \[he sent 4 people to mit over the past 4 years so ig he knows\], love him sm and he said he spent a really long time on it so hopefully 9/10.

LOR 4 - counselor - I talk to my counselor alot and I think she likes me alot, and she’s super super nice so I’m just going to say 7/10.

​

***Interviews***

MIT - spent 3.5 hours, my mom lowk got annoyed, but it was amazing he told me about a new way to think about space time, MIT experience, hacking and everything, met him later at admit day for our region and he said he really enjoyed the interview and expected me to get in. 9/10.

Harvard - he said i would “fit the modern school” interview went for 45 minutes, got him to talk about some illegal stuff he did @ harvard but he cut it off when zoom ran out so not sure how good, felt like i vibed. 6/10.

Stanford - went really well, the AO note later said she described me as a genius apparently so that’s cool, we talked alot and she had done isef i think in the past and we talked about our memories alot and in general it was fun. 9/10.

Duke - pretty mid tbh it was fun and nice but i had no answer for why duke 5/10

UC Berkeley MET - Disaster, this is not a one on one, but you record yourself answering questions, I REALLY didn’t care since I came back later had 1 day to do this and was tired, just chatgpt’d some random stuff about the school and said it reading straight from a script, super uninspiring answers read in an uninspiring way (tbf I wasn’t interested in MET since it meant my parents might force me to go there over stanford) 1/10

​

***Essays***

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

I nearly failed APEL and I’m not known to be a great writer, so ​I dropped all my ec’s senior year to focus on essays, after being warned by a guy @ davidsons that essays mattered way more than I thought they did. Watched every video from admitium tiktok to cc posts and hundreds of reddit threads to get ideas and help. I got help from my friends and also a really cool family friend @ harvard who got praised for writing alot. My essays were very nontraditional and very very casual and i talked about lots of mitish stuff (dream school), which also happened to fit for caltech. Everyone who read my CA said they liked it, and my Harvard friend who got in purely for essays (his note said) rated them really highly said he liked my essays, but I don’t think they were the main driving factor for my acceptances so I’ll rate them 7/10 (like everyone else on this forum). 

Since I didn’t have to tell the colleges how much i loved researching or science bc my awards and ec’s displayed that already, i spent most of my essays talking about fun stuff i liked doing, and nonacademic stuff, trying to talk about myself as a person and not as a college applicant/sweaty high schooler.

I didn’t try on my Duke or Columbia or NU essays AT ALL, i templated my why essays really hard and just swapped in names, but I did copy paste my MIT essays into duke which i spent almost 100 hours on. I tryharded my MIT Stanford Caltech and Harvard essays, and I’d rate them 8/10, while my other schools (including UC’s) were much much worse probably 3/10 or 4/10.

Additional Information:

In general, I don’t think this collegeresults posts helps anyone except maybe like 20 people be more confident in their profiles, but I wanted to say either way GOOD. ESSAYS. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. MATTER. I know alot of people with similar ec’s as me and while they lit up the T5’s as well, there is always people that don’t, if you have these sorts of awards&amp;ec’s you need to be showing off your personality, don’t just sit there with your isef medal and watch the world go by and chatgpt essays and expect to sweep T5’s (or t3’s since Yale and Princeton are irrelevant smh) 

UC’s are so random—I live in CA and I hate UC’s for being so RNG, almost NO one is getting in, and it’s just so random no matter which ones. I have no clue what is going on but test op hit these schools like a truck. Until the test is reinstated in \~2025 UC will probably be stupid and random like it is right now for Co22/23/24. College Board backlash was unjustified. 

Also try on everything!! I got my MET interview, and then absolutely bombed it by just reading straight from a script and obviously rushing to get it done, and I might have had some random stanford stuff in the background too LOL so that was not the best look and probably why I got straight rejected (read: coping)

Similarly, not trying at all on Duke/NU/Columbia is why I got rejected by those, like seriously those were 2/10 essays, you can’t just get by without good essays, I did this almost as a test, if I could have awful essays and clearly a good enough app for more selective schools, and yeah it DOESN’T WORK. TRY ON YOUR ESSAYS!!

Okay actually not columbia, funny story, they didn’t get my SCOIR rec for whatever reason, and sent me 3 emails asking me to submit it (want me fr) but I didn’t respond on time so yeah. (sorry I kept forgetting and the deadline hit)

At the same time, Columbia is the worst school in the world (read rejected my best friend ed) so i dnc.

In general, I wasn’t \*that\* surprised by any acceptance after stanford, but mit still had my heart destroying itself. 

Should you do the no targets/no safeties strat? Yeah go for it j take 20 gap years like that one usc (or was it nyu i can never tell) post.

**Essays**

I took a risk with my Common App, but basically I love One Piece. So I essentially framed my life around it. I would metaphorically go from island to island, learn things about myself and improve myself and the world around me. It ends with me finding the One Piece in which I talked about the universe, and how it was all connected in One Piece, and how I wanted to solve each part One Piece at a time.
