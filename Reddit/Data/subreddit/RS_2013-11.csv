1ppxlr,1,2013-11-01,I'm in love with my best friend. Help.,throwaway284123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ppxlr/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend_help/,"I'm using a throwaway account on this. It's a long read, too. So bare with me on this. 

When I was in 16, this girl from my high school and I started dating. At first it was the typical high school relationship, but after about a year we started to fall in love with each other. Then, like typical high school relationship stuff, it fell apart. 

My senior year of high school is when we broke off and I started dating another girl right before I graduated. Looking back on it, that really was a rebound so I wouldn't really feel anything after the previous relationship ended. While I was dating this new girl, my now-ex and I didn't talk for awhile and didn't start talking again the summer going into my sophomore year in college. 

In the fall of that year, the relationship I was in ended. Being the emotional wuss of a man I am, I took that one hard too. But I also had recently got back in touch with my ex from high school, who was at a college two hours from the one I go to. We worked back to making a friendship, and it eventually has grown to where it is now - as best friends. 

During the time from us breaking up until the last month of my junior year, she was dating another guy. Wasn't very fond of him because I knew he was cheating on him, though I don't have much ground to stand on, which I'll explain in a little bit. When she and I got back in touch, she was still with this guy. Our spring breaks are at different times, and during mine my sophomore year in college, she and the guy she was dating were going through a rough strip. She asked if I would pick her up at her college and drive her back to our hometown since I was leaving for there. I did. It was the first time really since HS that I was around her for a long period of time. 

On the drive, we decided we would hang out that night at my dad's house since he wouldn't be home. So we did, we watched movies, raided the liquor cabinet and just had a fun time being around each other again before falling asleep in the same bed together. There wasn't anything physical - promise, I wouldn't lie to you guys about that. 

Fast forward to the following fall. She was up at my college visiting friends she has here. But for a reason I don't remember, the friend she was staying with couldn't house her the last night and needed somewhere to stay. She asked if she could stay at my apartment. I let her, only this time we ended up making out. Which I felt bad, confused, and on a high at the same time because I had developed feelings for her again but she was in a relationship. 

We stayed close after that happened, and even when she and her boyfriend at the time we're on the rocks, we discussed the possibility of getting back together. But we always got cold feet. 

Right as my fourth year at college started, I got into a relationship with another girl. I knew I had to put away any feelings for my best friend if I was going to be in a relationship. Which I was able to do. But that relationship didn't even make it to the New Year. So pretty quickly I was back to thinking about her.

Fast forward to this summer, I ended up getting an internship in a town about five hours from our hometown. But, her mother's side of the family lives in this same town and it's where she has spent her summers ever since I've known her. So basically her and I were in the same town for 10 weeks. I couldn't describe how excited I was. We saw each other nearly everyday after we got off work. And our friendship is weird that we can spend the night with each other and nothing happens now. 

Until about 3 weeks into us being out there, we stayed the night with each other and somehow a mood was created and we ended up making out in only our underwear. The next night, we did everything but have sex. That happened another time before we both knew we needed to talk about what was happening. She told me flat out she didn't want to have emotions involved if we were going to be physical. I was heartbroken. I had thought maybe this was us working toward a relationship again. 

We cut off being physical because I just couldn't keep doing it and not have emotions involved. I was in love with her and didn't want us to be fooling around if it wasn't meaning anything. 

Now since we're back at both our schools, she's recently started talking to another guy. When she told me about the guy, I think I took it worse than any of my breakups. I realized then I'm still in love with her even though we broke up years ago. I realize that having been physical with each other probably wasn't the best thing for my feelings. 

I don't know how to just stop being in love with her because I shouldn't be if she's with other guys. Nor can I just remove her from my life because she's a best friend. But she isn't interested in being in a relationship again. 

I know I threw a lot, but if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this. It'd be much appreciated. "
1ppwg1,32,2013-11-01,TIFU by taking photos of a Turkish police station,TGDE,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1ppwg1/tifu_by_taking_photos_of_a_turkish_police_station/,"So in the Turkish republic foreigners residing in the country for an extended period of time are required to get a residence permit.  Today was my appointment.  This occurs at the Fatih police station.

A lot of people have trouble finding finding the location within the complex where you turn in your papers.  In light of this, after I turn mine in I thought to myself, ""Wouldn't it be useful to create a guide so other people could use it.""  Why this guide should include some photos! 

So stupid me decides to act on this, at the time, brilliant idea and on my way out Im merrily taking photos of landmarks to use.  Since my appointment is late, (9PM) there is nobody around and I can take these photos unabated.  All is well until I get to the front and I take a photo of the building.  I get accosted by what I assume to be a non uniformed police officer and I tell him in Turkish that I don't speak enough to understand him.  He takes me to a uniformed officer sporting an MP5 submachine gun and tells him the situation in Turkish.  By now I realized I've made a mistake but I have no choice but to ride this rollercoaster until the end.

So since I realize my mistake and I already know what's coming next I hand the officer my device with the photos pulled up and I delete one making sure to show him the process.  He takes it and repeats the process for every photo while asking questions like, 

Where are you from?
Why are you taking photos?
Why are you in Turkey?
Where do you Study?
What do you study?

By this point I'm attracting a lot of attention from the other officers posted in front because there is literally nothing else happening other than cars driving by, it's really late like 9:45PM local time.  So every time another officer joins our new circle of friends I have to repeat my story.  By the end I'm encircled by 6 police officers armed with an assortment of automatic weapons including MP5 and M4 looking weapons that may have been HKs since they already had MP5s.  

The last officer that joined our circle of friendship came up on my left and cut me off mid sentence and yelled,""DONT PANIC, DONT PANIC MY FRIEND.""  Now, I dont feel like I was panicking, I could feel some adrenaline sure but even if I was panicking I feel like I was perfectly within my right to panic because I was encircled by police in a foreign country sporting automatic weapons after doing something very stupid.  

Right before this the original english speaking officer asked if I took videos, I hadnt but he had to check anyway.  He watches a few of them, and scrolls through some like he had before with the pictures, at some point he was just admiring my collection, anyway he selects one more to play and this one happened to be me shooting a handgun at an indoor firing range.  So that didn't look good.

Anyway, since the new guy joined I had to go through the gauntlet of questions again and this time at the end, kind of out of the blue, he asks if I know of [Kevin Mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick).  Now, I did two internships at a defense contractor during high school after I performed well in a cyber security competition and at a time I trained to be a penetration tester.  So yeah, I know who Kevin Mitnick is we hit it off from there.  I had the fortune to take a cybersecurity centric tour of the Pentagon before and I happen to have a CIO.gov folder from that day that I used to carry all my residence permit shit.  It has a presidential seal on it and binary 1s and 0s aesthetically faded on the interior, they ooo'ed and aaahh'ed at it for a few moments and made polite conversation about hacking and firearms.  When I'm about to leave he says something about a photo and Facebook, I didn't ask to clarify because I really wanted to get out of that situation since my fight or flight response was still active.  We exchange goodbyes in Turkish after a few steps I say turn and say the equivalent of ""bye-bye"" in Turkish and wave.  They respond the same as a group with a smile and I ran to cross the street.

It's weird to think had we been born in the same city we may have been best friends.  "
1pputz,2,2013-11-01,Graduate ECE or CS Programs with ECE Background?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1pputz/graduate_ece_or_cs_programs_with_ece_background/,"Hello all,

I'm applying to programs now and realizing I'm not sure whether I should pursue the Masters/PhD in ECE or in CS. My interests could most generally be described as autonomous systems. I love the algorithmic development aspects, but I also have a great time designing overall systems, i.e. embedded hardware/software, interfacing sensors, developing control and estimation theory for the application. The way I see it is I straddle the line of CS and ECE. The machine learning aspects fit well under CS and the control systems aspects fit well under ECE. I'd like to retain involvement in both in my future. However, I would like to strengthen my CS skills more in the future - hopefully taking more CS theory classes and fewer ECE.

I'm looking to apply to top 10 programs with particularly strong robotics or automation labs. I have of course done a ton of research on the schools and particular labs, but I am wondering what the overall best decision will be for me when applying. Will my background look more appealing to an ECE program and less appealing to a CS program? I know there is likely more sophisticated competition for the CS graduate programs simply because its more trendy and has broader involvement. This brings me to the question of whether to apply to MS programs or PhDs. I am totally content with sticking it out all the way to my PhD but I would really like to upgrade my general school ranking and network as optimally as possible in the jump to grad school. I assume MS programs will be easier to be accepted into - so naturally this would be the appeal.

To give you an idea of the stats I am working with:
&gt;Two Simultaneous Bachelors: 
* Electrical Engineering
* Computer Engineering
* Minors in: Mathematics, Digital Arts
* From a respectable top 20 public research university
* GPA: 3.8/4.0
* GRE: 164v 164q 5w
* Research Experience in two labs for all 4 years, couple poster presentations. Research is robotics related.
* No publications, but working towards 2 currently.
* 3 Industry Internships during summer at a prominent company
* 3 Strong LoR all from professors that know me well
* US Citizen/domestic student

My current thoughts are to apply to Master programs in CS, but possibly PhD in ECE in others depending on the program focuses. What would be your plan of attack if you were in my shoes and these were the priorities:
* 1.) School Ranking
* 2.) CS PhD over ECE PhD if Possible
* 3.) Retain work in autonomous systems area - hands on robotics

Looking forward to opinions and any advice really. Also, let me know if you think I'm wasting my time applying top top 10 programs with my stats. I would hope I'm not though... =]

1prnpr,11,2013-11-02,How do I tell someone I don't want their advice?,FreakishCurly,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1prnpr/how_do_i_tell_someone_i_dont_want_their_advice/,"Some background: I (21m) have moved off-campus for my senior year. Had some problems in my past, nothing major, pretty average life and an easy going dude. My sister, who is almost 15 years older than me ALWAYS has a crisis going on in her life. While she has some legitimate problems that need addressing, she also tends to blow everything out of proportion. It is just something she has always done. This might be a bit long.Fast forward to now: in the past year her dad died from cancer, our mom was diagnosed with lung cancer (she is fine now), she has been working as a social worker in a federal prison and is finding herself unhappy in her long term relationship, both her job and relationship are ending or already done at this point. Like I said about me, I just do my own thing. Nothing too drastic going on. My sister and I have been relatively close, about as much as one could be when most of their lives have been spent apart due to school. Out of all my siblings her and I have the closest opinions on things.So at the start of this year, as I said, I moved off-campus. I had a nice paying part time personal training job over the summer that I was carrying into the school year. I also have pretty cheap rent and figured I could make it work with x amount of clients each month. No big deal. Well school started, a second internship started, and clients became scarce and I was struggling to make rent. I had some old baseballs back at home that had some cool signatures that I could get some money from. They were sitting in a room that my dad used before moving out, now it is a junk room, aka I really had no interest in the balls anyways (not oblivious to their significance or appreciating value). My sister happened to be visiting my mom the same weekend that I went to get the balls and told me all these anecdotes of people selling their things for rent or drugs blah blah and is trying to convince me to take out a loan for the year. I made it this far without loans I really didn't want to resort to that. She ended up breaking down and crying during the conversation, because everything is a crisis. She called me multiple times a week to press upon me to take my loan. Eventually I did and she stopped bugging me.Now about a month ago I had a pretty bad weekend. I got ticketed for my inspection being one month overdue. Brought it into the shop and found 3,000 worth of repairs. Well..that's more than the car is worth so no more car. No big deal, I have rent money and campus is a ten minute walk. A few days after that my roommate and I were walking home from a party and we see some guy get jumped, we run in to help him out and end up getting pretty beat up. We wake up the next day, wtf did that really happen last night, assess our bruises and go about our day. My sister happened to be in town looking for jobs, she wanted to come watch us play quidditch..yeah no big deal, captain of the team over here. I decided to sit out the practice, figuring I was probably a little concussed and really wasn't feeling up to it. She saw me  and begged me to go to the ER with her. Granted my ear was extensively bruised and worrisome, I figured ice, ice and more ice. The doctors checked on me, told me I was concussed, no broken bones or fractures, and gave me some pain killers and a referral to an ENT doctor. So the next few days I stayed at my brother's house. Him and my sister took very good care of me. When I said I was ready to go back to my apartment my sister told me I should talk to someone about what happened. I said I have no interest in that because if the same thing happened next week I would do it again. I assured her I was fine, and she assured me that I won't be, that I'm minimizing the situation and I need to take it more seriously. I personally don't allow things to get to me. If bad things happen then they happen. Fix it and move on, why dwell and be upset when that helps nothing and makes you miserable? She brought me home and ended up going home herself, about 4 hours away. Since then I've gotten about three phone calls a week all asking me how my head is, how is my ear, send me pics. I appreciate her concern, but how many times do I have to tell you I'm fine before you stop asking?Lastly, I was just offered a part time job at the strength and conditioning clinic I interned at over the summer. Its not a lot of money but it's a great opportunity to get some experience under my belt before graduate school. Unfortunately, no car and no money for a car. I texted my family about getting a job offer because I was excited and that opened the door for my sister to try and help me out with the car situation. She keeps calling me at incredibly random times giving me the same advice about taking out a loan, keeps texting me asking what my progress is...it's getting to the point that when I see her calling I consider not picking up, which I've never done to anyone in my life. Now it may seem that she's just being a caring sister who is trying to help, and that's what she is, but I'm starting to become annoyed with her. She has called me more times in the past three months than in my entire life. I appreciate her help, but I simply feel awkward with how much she's trying to give. I also don't want to be insensitive to her because she has her own problems in her life. What can I do? Simply tell her I appreciate your help but I don't want it? I believe if I tell her that she will have no reason to contact me other than to catch up, which we never have really done unless we are face to face during the holidays.Tl;Dr: My sister insists on helping me through my problems all of the sudden and insatiously calls/texts. She has problems going on in her life and I don't want to be insensitive to her and ignore her, but I also am tired of her help."

[What are giraffes like in the presence of humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|Giraffes are incredibly stupid. That said, you can't outsmart them.
[Can you simply approach them and pet them, or would they kick a person (or run away scared\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|They evolved as prey animals so they are always alert. Any new changes to the yard or their daily routine and they won't cooperate. We put new fencing up in the yard and they didn't approach it for 3 days.
[How intelligent are giraffes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|When we bring visitors down to the barn all the giraffe turn and stare, and you have to move slowly so you don't scare them.
[Do they communicate with each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|What's interesting about giraffes is that they communicate with very little or no noise. I do recall reading in one of the care books that they can use infrasound.
[Can they be taught tricks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|They're not called tricks anymore, instead they're called behaviors. For giraffe you can teach them various things, but we never had time to. I've seen some pretty cool things other zoos have done with their giraffes.
[Can they recognize individual humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd55apg?context=5)|As for recognizing people. I think they can because after a week of working in the barn they knew I wasn't going to harm them. They also recognize our voices when we call them on the deck.
[*That said, you can't outsmart them.*  \[Yes, never try to outsmart a giraffe\] (Link to i.imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd58w8r?context=5)|[More like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaksVOgC-Ag)
[If they're very skiddish and timid, how does the San Diego Zoo have the ""Feed the Giraffes"" attraction?

Love of food, especially food they don't get very often, overrides all fear. We give them rye crackers as their special treat and they eat it like candy.

Do they play games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd54n2f?context=5)|Just in general they are pretty [adorable](http://i.imgur.com/iOCHFW6.jpg). They're very curious about whatever you happen to be [holding](http://i.imgur.com/dtOEUDe.jpg).
 |As for playing, they don't really. They like to run when the weather is cool and sunny. Some of them liked to mess with the [Crowned cranes](http://i.imgur.com/fkY6Vn6.jpg) we had in the yard, those poor birds.
[How woulda giraffe mess with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd56j2y?context=5)|They'd chase them around or just stand too close and the cranes would get all upset and start leaping at the giraffes.

[How does one get into the zoo world? Are zookeepers veterinarians who focus on specific animals? How many different zookeepers are staffed on a zoo (one zookeeper/species\)?

I volunteered for a wild animal refuge and they only had 4 people taking care of all the animals (probably ~200). At Cincinnati the average for keepers per department was probably 5.  Once again it depends on the zoo. I've seen some real shitty zoos, not just the ones in china and third world countries. Our animals at Pittsburgh and Cincinnati were very well cared for. We give them plenty of food and toys to play with, as well as other enrichment items. We also do training which can be mentally stimulating for the animals.
[Sorry that these are pretty random and varied - just some initial thoughts I had about zoos.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pr4xt/iama_zookeeper_with_an_hour_probably_to_kill/cd54yij?context=5)|We are not vets.

1pqk1a,12,2013-11-02,Breadth first or depth first when looking for a job?,cscqu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pqk1a/breadth_first_or_depth_first_when_looking_for_a/,"

I'm recently on the job market after going through [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io). I'm doing my thinking about what kind of job I want to take next, and I'm thinking I want to start out with an internship to get a feel for the field. I'm in the San Francisco area. I recently talked with an engineer who suggested that I look for a job by figuring out exactly what I want and matching a company to those interests versus doing a ""spray and pray"" approach to finding a job. What is your opinion on this?

I also don't feel like the final project that I made at the end of App Academy shows off my abilities very well. I spent most of my time figuring out everything necessary for what I thought a back-end should be instead of focusing on my front end, and combined with the fact that I don't know design and that I finished with a partially made project, it really shows. Do you have any advice as to what kinds of projects tend to show off a candidate well?

I am also 19 and haven't yet attended college. Can employers look past that and not judge me on this? Do you think I should take whatever job I can to pay back App Academy and go to college? I also remember seeing posts about how not many people seem to use the skills they actually learned in college in their careers, and learned more after the fact. Is this true? 

In case you're wondering, I honestly didn't feel prepared for going to college, due to a barrage of medical issues. Because I happened to live near San Francisco, I thought App Academy might be something where I could learn something cool that I've been interested in for a while and get a job after for a year and see where I feel about college. But maybe I'm mistaken and should go to college sooner.

My background is that I've fiddled with small applications (in *gasp* vb.net, then C#) but haven't written any CRUD applications with a database in the backend until App Academy. To be honest, I mostly fiddled with GDI+ and making the form background draw cool shapes. You can see some of the examples on my github, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to share because it would reveal my identity. Most recently, I'm learning android using the little bit of java I learned in APCS at my high school.

I'm thinking that for my first job, almost ever, I should start off with an internship. This would be a short duration job, with a definite ending that I could do. I'm also thinking a medium-sized company (around 100 people or more) in San Francisco because they won't be frantically trying to run a start-up and will have some extra time to train a more junior developer. Do you perhaps know of any jobs or know of anybody who might know of jobs? Do you perhaps know if this place would even exist in San Francisco?

I should mention that this was written close to my bed time, so I might fall asleep soon. I promise to answer your questions and respond to your comments tomorrow if you don't reply before I fall asleep."

1ptkmp,0,2013-11-03,Has anyone gotten an associates degree and is working towards their bachelors? A couple questions...,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ptkmp/has_anyone_gotten_an_associates_degree_and_is/,"So currently I am in my first year at a community college. I am doing a 2 year (will likely be a little more, but what it's called) + 2 year program which involves two years of community college, transferring into two years at a university. The program I am in is for electrical engineering and I am very interested in the work I am doing. Also it's ABET accredited. So, a few questions

I am very curious on job aspects upon achieving my associates degree. How difficult is it to get a job after getting my associates? I would love to be able to get experience and a stable job that will pay for my bachelors right after graduating from CC. Is this a good idea? Or is taking out the loans to achieve my bachelors worth it?

In my head I'm thinking that by getting a job before and while getting my bachelors, I'll be able to finish my degree while being able to pay most of it off as I go along with a ton of valuable experience. I know it would take longer to achieve a bachelors while working full time, but once I complete my bachelors won't I be much more valuable then a fresh graduate? I've seen/heard of a lot of engineers getting internships while in college, but I've also seen/heard a lot about how if you are at a community college it will be a bit more difficult to get them...

Anyone who has had experience doing a CC to university program, I would greatly appreciate your input or suggestions. Thank you for your time."
1pstv2,3,2013-11-03,I'm going to kill myself.,sadcat64,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1pstv2/im_going_to_kill_myself/,"Before I do, I will tell you all a short story about myself ; also, why I am going to kill myself. 

The last Time I was ever happy was 2011. when my dad was on dialysis, and I was still working in college. My dad always push me to be the best and tried to tell me it's on motivation for happiness or despair. I was always the time to fuck up by some silly message, but quickly recover. I did that a lot in college ; I just pushed myself harder to counter my mistakes. I was in a good relationship too with a girl I plan to stay in a long relationship. Every thing was fine ; until crunch time of me entering into my main courses of engineering. I had little time for the long distant compassion that I put earlier for my relationship . Eventually, she would berade or skull at me at nights for not putting enough effort into our relationship. Despite some verbal hostility, I continue to make it work and do a engineering / physic double major.  Short story, it didn't pan out so well. I ended up cheating, she attempted suicide then dated my best friend. within that whole scenario, I lost a slew of friends too. I was feeling down, but not out. I still tried chugging with school, I felt a bit empty through after the relationship. I think my more bigger concern was my lack of stamina to keep up with my courses. I always talk to my dad every night for support. Even when I was down, I had that hope from his wisdom. I wasn't a big christian or very dedicated, but I prayed each night to god to give my dad a kidney ( or to at least give me an internship or cop op to pay for his medical bills ). The time was Christmas eve when my dad past away. I felt even more empty. I transfered to a college closer to work, and forgot about the physic double with engineering major. I just did EE, and then struggled to keep a 3.0. Currently, I am finishing as a super senior in engineering. At this new university, I meet a new girl. Let's call her Gen. I told her my problems as well. (Forgot to mention I was looking my home to wells fargo and my mom was in debt after retirement ). I guess I mader her out to be that lil bright side in my life as we grown to like each other. We only dated for a month and a half, but  she tried to help. She try finding a new place for me to stay, and then showing me how to love again ; though, she instantly broke up with me, because of my situation and  some other sexual preference. Long story short, I burn a bridge, and then she saw m as a Toxic individual.  Now m days I just work, and one in a blue moon guzzle down a few shots of 151 or everclear to swallow my saddness on sa saturday. No degree.. No money not even a way to regain my home... Even worse I'm completely alone with no close friends or relative that are concern enough for me or my moms well fare.  So, I just work and try to forget about everything. I just delve in my studies or  open a new bottly of bacardi. The worst thing is when I am stuck ; I have no one to go too. I care for my mom and sent her my money, but we hardly communicate on a level that is emotional or any understanding. She is the high temper and angry lady you see. 

I think the final note on why I'm going to kill myself after this post. 
Every day felt like the same emptiness. IT was just me alone working; not evening a good group of friends to connect with. I see couples and friends around me happy.; in my mind, I ask myself why can't I be happy? I do hang in a new group of people I found, but I felt so distant and it too artificial. The only reason they talk to me, because I just roam in the club every week. 

honestly, I just want this empty feeling to end. not with booze or pain. I just want to die now"

Need to get some stuff off my chest",blehh91,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pwuaa/22f_unemployed_avoidant_dependant_on_other_people/,"Feel free to not read this because this might get pretty lengthy. My friends and family know I'm shy but they don't know how internally terrified I am of just... everything. So I wanted to get some things off my chest and share my story with people who can relate.


I don't remember when it started. When I was 5 I had a stutter and went through speech therapy. I was told it was due to my mom being a heavy drug addict and neglecting me. I'm not sure if this has to do with anything, just a thought.


When I was a kid I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderal. I think this caused me to be overly-aware. I was only 9-10 and thinking about heavy thoughts about life, death, existentialism, etc. I guess somewhere down the line I started thinking more about people and what they thought of me. I had my first anxiety attack when I was 11, reading in front of class.
When I was 12-13 I started skipping school and sleeping all day. I was diagnosed with major depression. I stopped speaking at all very much unless I had to. Then I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety. I stopped being a human pretty much and there was nothing my mom or grandma could do so I was sent to an outpatient highschool with about 20-30 kids who had various behavior problems or substance abuse.


Sorry to include all this it's just I always think about where things turned in my life, where it went wrong and how I developed this.

I've been lucky enough to not have to search for a job. My grandma is a self employed attorney. I worked for her for years because it was way too perfect. I was like a personal assistant except I didn't have to take care of phone calls. Her paralegal took care of that. I greeted her clients every now and then but for the most part it was just me quietly filing, organizing and running errands. My mom lost custody of my 3 younger sisters (1-5 yrs). My grandma got temporary custody of them and she paid me to take care of them. During that time I was going to school for phlebotomy which was the worst idea ever. School scares the shit out of me and I often dropped out of my classes. Phlebotomy was different. I have a fascination with blood. Not in a creepy way I just think the way it works is very cool and I like the way it looks. During group presentations I often traded my way out of speaking. I'd offer to do the person's portion of the work if they read my portion of the presentation. It worked out very well and this is usually how I avoid things. I'd rather do more work than speak. I'd rather do anything than speak. Anyways so I floated by with the prereqs for the actual class. When it came to actually drawing blood, my hands shook. I pushed through thinking the shaking would go away after I got some practice. It never did. I made it to an internship and the shaking never went away. It was miserable. I'd actually forced myself to talk to the patients more, to distract them from noticing that my hands were shaking. Sometimes it worked but sometimes they would point out I was shaking and it would make me nervous which made them nervous and it was this vicious cycle of fear. I had never hurt anyone and I usually got the vein on the first try, though, so I guess that's something. During this time I picked up quite the alcoholism. I'd drink til 2am to skip the process of laying in bed, thinking about the mistakes I had made that day only to wake up 3 hours later. Anyways, I basically forced my way through a $500+ certification for nothing. I didn't feel accomplished after. I felt more hopeless. To know that for the first time in years I had worked toward something I could see myself making a career in something I enjoy and failing at that too because of my constant anxiety. No one knows this issue but my classmates and teachers. My friends and family are wondering why I haven't tried to volunteer or get a job.


A few months ago, as soon as my mom got custody of the siblings, she moved into my gma's house and I decided to move in with my boyfriend. My gma agreed to continue paying me until I found a job.
Shortly after boyfriend, friend, and I found a new place, I further avoided getting a job because my boyfriend's company got shut down and was offered to relocate 8 hours away. I decided to go with him under the agreement that I hurry and find a job and that I don't drink hard liquor. Now we found a place and it's time to find a job and I'M TERRIFIED. I swear I'm not just lazy. I don't think I'm afraid of working, I'm afraid of the process. Like going in and applying to places then doing interviews were you just sit there and be judged for 30+ minutes. Everyday I wake up early and prepare to leave the house and go job searching but I panic and somehow find something to else to do to put it off. I'm so scared and I really need to start working. I hate that my gma is still paying me. She's too helpful to everyone and I feel so terrible that I'm still mooching off her. That my mom is too. My boyfriend keeps getting pissy with me, and rightfully so, he keeps asking me everyday how the job hunt is going and I can sense his annoyance with me for staying home all day and not working or helping out with bills. I was delusional. I somehow thought that moving 8 hours away from all my friends and family could change me. I thought I could become this fearless, changed person. Everything I do is the same, everything I work towards I fail at. The only reason why I haven't killed myself is because it's selfish and I know that people love and care for me and stuff. But the way I'm living is also selfish.

I'm totally aware of how shitty I am but can't seem to change. I make excuses for all my own failures. I flake out on people often.  Exposure doesn't even seem to help, it just makes me feel worse. I think need professional help but I don't even know how to go about it. I don't have insurance and I don't have a car. And before a year ago I felt my SA was manageable by simply pretending it wasn't a problem. Now it is a problem and I have no idea what to do? I'm coming to the realization that my life-long depression is all caused by SA. I'd be happy if I weren't so afraid

TLDR; I'm suddenly realizing how much I've fucked up and am freaking out. Any advice or words of encouragement would help."

I think everyone is still proud of her, I know I am. But what else can I do or say to cheer her up?

-----

**Extended version:**

So my girlfriend of a few years has a long history of depression, sometime bi-polar issues, has contemplated suicide, has been on anti-depressants and has been to therapists. I've helped pull her up and she's been in a much better place since she and I met. She's told me that I am what keeps her going, and I love her very much and would do anything for her. But now... she's spiraling downward, and I don't know where to turn. So I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

**The setup:**

About a year ago, she took a year-long internship at her ""dream job"" on the other side of the country. After several months of doing long distance, I packed up and decided to relocate and join her. She and I both left our jobs back home, along with our family and friends, to try something new and exciting. And while the first few months were hard on both of us while we settled in, I found a great new job while she loved interning with her ""dream"" company.

**The problem:**

As the internship came to a close, she interviewed for a full-time position. There were quite a few other interns applying for the same position, and she felt like she ""bombed"" the interview (which for her, is surprising because she's so good with people). She just found out that she wasn't offered the position, and has hit a depression I've never seen her in.

The first reaction was crying. She bawled into my arms, and still does when she thinks about it. There are times when she just lays there, in silence, staring at nothing. Then there are times where she will get extremely angry, yelling at me for even trying to give her words of advice. She then goes back to crying, or laying in bed in the dark for hours, it seems.

**A little more info:**

Her whole reason to move here was to work for this company. This company specializes in a very particular market, one which doesn't have many competitors (or at least, doesn't have many competitors that do as 'good' of a job as this company). She misses her family and friends back home constantly, and she hears about all their good news all the time (""Soandso got a new job!"" or ""Soandso got engaged!""). Even I recently got a great new job at a company I really admire.

She feels like moving here was a mistake. She feels like she's let everyone down (including me), by having us move here and leave everything and everyone behind. She feels incredibly alone, even when I go to console her. And I feel terrible because I simply don't know what to say.

**What I need from you, Reddit:**

I need to know what to say or do in this situation. Regardless if moving here for her ""dream job"" was a good or bad decision, I need to know what to tell her. What should I do? How can I lift her spirits and give her confidence? I want her to feel like there's always another way to reach her dreams, even if it isn't with this company. *(Note: I did just find that there are some part-time jobs her ""dream"" company offers, so I could pitch that idea to her. But they pay significantly less and don't have much in the way of benefits.)*

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Im a dutch student and currently working in Ireland as an intern for a small\medium sized supportcenter for schools and other companies.
i mainly work as repair\engineer but that we got something that blew my mind.

on a lovely moring a desktop came in ( HP Z220 Desktop, lovely I5 and decent specs all around). this machine is located a factory nearby and came in as ""not booting""

so me with my 21 year old brain open up the machine a to my suprise i see a circulur sawblade stuck in the motherboard. at this point im look at my co-worker and start laughing.

i proceeded to ring the client and he told me he was trying to replace the prossocor chip and could not get the heatsink of the motherboard.

* in the end we replaced his desktop with a new one, but with a i7 
** his harddrive was hit by the blade but, i manged to get all the files off to my suprise."

1pux6e,2,2013-11-04,Limited CS courses- how much does it matter when applying for internships?,pr0cedural,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pux6e/limited_cs_courses_how_much_does_it_matter_when/,"Pardon my long-windedness, and direct your eyes to the bolded text for a tl;dr.

I'm a freshman at a well-regarded liberal arts college on the East Coast intending on majoring in computer science. I'm originally from Seattle, which, as you very probably know, has a wealth of software development going on, and I'm looking into interning out there this coming summer. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected surge in interest in computer science at my school, I was unable to take a computer science course this semester (sophomores took precedence). I could have gotten into the Intro to Programming course that is offered, but it doesn't count towards the major, and my level of experience in programming exceeds what is taught in the course. 

As a result, between both semesters, I'll have one calculus course, one computer science course, and one other math course (either Linear Algebra or Vectors and Matrices, depending on how gutsy I feel at time of class selection) to my name for CS-pertinent courses. I figure this places me behind a lot of the probable CS majors at larger and more CS-oriented universities.

What I've come here to ask of you is this: what should I do to overcome this deficiency in my resumé, and how much work will it entail? I'm guessing it would be a good idea to take some online courses on Udacity and whatnot, maybe posting my completed projects on GitHub, and coming up with/developing some projects of my own, also open sourced. How does that sound? Anything else you can think of, and any advice for things that would particularly stand out? And, lastly, about how much work should I be expecting to put in? A quantified estimation would help, but I will gladly accept any abstracted answer, too.

FWIW, I took AP Computer Science back in high school and, in the summer going into my senior year of HS, I did an unpaid internship within the department of computer science and engineering at a flagship state school very highly regarded for CS.

**tl;dr** Freshman in college looking to intern in Seattle this summer, need advice as to what to do to compensate for my lack of CS courses, and wondering how big of a disadvantage said lack places me at."

[What did Kim Jong-un's hands feel like? Rough? Soft? The world needs to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f53n?context=5)|Soft and supple. Don't think he's doing a lot of heavy lifting. 
[I'm interested to hear a bit about your path to this job? How did you get into VICE or did VICE find you? did you always want to be some sort of reporter or was it more like 'I want to experience some crazy shit and need to find a way to afford it""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f756?context=5)|I had an advisor at college who suggested I intern somewhere. I said if I was going to work for free, it would only be at my favorite magazine, VICE. That was in 2002/2003. I've been here ever since. Lots has changed for VICE over that decade, but the constant has been that I get to work with my best friends to make awesome shit we believe in. 
[Do you believe that you'll eventually die doing something for VICE, or any other journalistic activity? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f843?context=5)|I'd never really thought about it, but now I have. Thanks! 
[Hi Ryan, huge fan of the show. I'm a reporter as well (in a much more boring capacity, unfortunately\) and I'm quite jealous of what you guys get to do.  Is there anything *too* extreme in terms of coverage? In your editorial meetings, have you had to turn down something that's *too* intense? Cheers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f6ky?context=5)|We don't pass on stories because they're too intense; but we do if that's the only reason to go. Shock value is fleeting; real stories that are underreported are what get us excited. 
[When watching the North Korea episode, a strange thing that stood out to me was how absolutely calm, cool and collected the Harlem Globetrotters seemed the entire time.  Were they seriously that laid back or did they just play it off well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fbjz?context=5)|Some of the coolest, most relaxed guys I've ever met; captains of Team Good Vibes. 
[What really happened in the post-game after party? Did any N Korean officials say anything other than their talking points of Dear Leader/Marshall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f7e0?context=5)|Sounds like a cop out, but I really can't even explain how bizarre it was. Massive banquet hall, KJU at center table with myself and the players, all-white-clad violin-playing all-girl band...It was hard to hear what anyone was saying because the ""holyshitholyshitholyshit"" loop playing in my head was too loud. 
[Have you been detained or debriefed or contacted by the NSA, FBI, CIA or any one, since you had dinner with an enemy of the state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7kayc?context=5)|Oddly enough, no. We fully expected to be questioned as soon as we landed at JFK, but I've never been contacted in any capacity, nor has anyone in the crew. 
[Hey Ryan, Love Vice. What was the worst place you have been to? Do you also have to get different shot/vaccines before going to these countries ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f06a?context=5)|North Korea, hands down. There are places I've been with more clear &amp; present danger, but I'll take a gang of dudes with guns over the feeling I'm being watched 24 hours a day. 
[How scared were you of sergei? and what were those plants he was spanking you with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fkrw?context=5)|A teddy bear of a guy; it's tough to be scared when you're both half nude in a 120 degree sauna at 4am. I'd love to go back. 
[You have a great haircut. What do you use to describe it when you go to get it cut?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fhik?context=5)|Give me the Macklemore, but less weird. 
[Were the Yakuza guys really seedy scary criminals or were they totally gentlemen and fun to be around?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7faye?context=5)|Little bit of both. They're obviously a tough crew, but in the brief time we spent with them, they were also courteous and great hosts. And I've got that tattoo on my leg to remember them by. 
[I really enjoyed the japan sex story, was there any other places that you went to that didn't make the cut? one more question, where does vice go from here? can we expect more long form documentaries over time? i hope you all keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f809?context=5)|We went to a slew of the host/hostess bars, but only showed a few. You can also buy a date by the hour, which I did with a girl dressed up in an anime costume for a stroll around the mall.
 |Expect a TON more long form documentaries on VICE.com as well as our YouTube channel, the launch of our brand new News channel, and S2 of the HBO show...to start. 
[Best experience you've ever had? Seems like a lot of negative things you've seen but what about something positive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fjvs?context=5)|Covering Arab Spring in Cairo is something I'll never forget. To be a part of something that is changing the shape of world history, harnessing new technology / youthful energy into a movement to better lives...it was inspiring to say the least. 
[Your Portrait of a Russian Oligarch may have been one of my favorite stories, but it was so fucking short! What else did you guys do? What was the dynamic like between him and his wife Sofya? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fta2?context=5)|We actually spent time with a number of oligarchs while we were in Moscow; Sergei just turned out to be the most compelling once we get into the edit.
 |Russia has changed so much in the last few decades; the opulence that characterized the first wave of Oligarchs is by and large a thing of the past as the move to more ""legit"" business and less decadence continues, but Sergei and a few others didn't get the memo. 
[Was the ear cleaning worth the Yen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f7m0?context=5)|It was long overdue. That poor girl. 
[What was it like visiting the ghost cities in China?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fpca?context=5)|Surreal. Massive, sprawling towns with the population of a small apartment complex here in NYC. And the weirdest part is no one is willing/able to admit the problem; construction continues on new cities as the existing ones sit empty. 
[Hey dude. What's your favorite vice story? Not just one you covered. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f3fp?context=5)|I've got a ton - most are not mine - but Mexican Mormon Wars always sticks out. A crazy combination of domestic politics, cartel wars, and great characters. Check it out: [Link to www.vice.com](http://www.vice.com/vice-news/the-mexican-mormon-war-full-length)
[To me, VICE feels like one of the last bastions of *real* investigative journalism. When I watch the videos or read the articles, they are presented in a way a young person *may actually perceive and experience* the topic at hand.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fu47?context=5)|There are a lot of reasons to get negative - turn on your TV this evening and take your pick - but yes, I'm wildly optimistic. There's a misperceptions that young people don't ""care"" about the news; that's wrong. There's just no one delivering it to them in a voice they can relate to.
[Ryan, how do *you* feel about the current state of journalism? What can/should other organizations do? Are you optimistic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fu47?context=5)|I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by people at VICE who understand this, and are working to change it every day. 
[What is the most *boring* topic you have ever reported on? Like, you got the assignment and rolled your eyes and just tried to get it over with as soon as possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7ez4l?context=5)|I don't want this to sound like a bullshit answer, because I mean it sincerely, but I've never been completely bored by a shoot. Are there moments when you're on your 8th hour of a long, cramped van ride, or killing time while waiting for an interview, etc? Sure. But at the end of the day, I get to meet folks all over the world and tell some pretty interesting stories. Coming from a guy whose previous work experience was scooping ice cream, waiting tables, and coaching basketball camps, you're not getting any complaints outta me. 
[How did Thomas Morton actually win that Senegalese wrestling match?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fznr?context=5)|Low center of gravity. Never underestimate Baby Balls. 
[What is Kim Jong Un like in person? I saw the documentary and you had the opportunity to meet him. I feel like he's really awkward. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f8i0?context=5)|Young. More so than anything else, he seems really, really young. Reports peg him anywhere from 29-31, but I was more struck by how he carried himself; people deferred to him, of course, but he didn't have the air of authority you attribute to most world leaders. 
[Where did you get shot? And how did it feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fd0u?context=5)|Right in my gut - about in inch below the rib cage so as to not snap a bone. Felt like a very hard punch from a very small fist. 
[How uncomfortable were you during the cuddle cafe/BDSM segments?  What has been the coolest thing you've been able to do, whether associated with Vice, or not?  Did you attend college? Where and what for?  What would you change about your life?  What is the scariest topic you've filmed for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f81w?context=5)|Lots of questions in one; I'll pick the most salient. What I'd change: I'd really, really, really like to be able to dunk a basketball. 
[Hi Ryan, I'm a huge fan of your work on Vice, I'm a videographer and it's actually a dream of mine to someday work for Vice doing something behind the camera.  My question is this: How did you get started at Vice? Were you a correspondent right off the bat or did you have to start doing other things like writing articles? How did you get to where you are at Vice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f9s4?context=5)|I started at VICE as an intern while I was still in college back in 2003. I basically kept showing up until they took pity on me and gave me a paycheck - that was 10 years ago and I've held on tight ever since. 
[Have you ever wanted to intervene and try to help out the people you meet in your stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7flp4?context=5)|It's a natural human desire for sure. And in certain cases - like with the band featured in Heavy Metal in Baghdad - we have been able to stay in touch after the shoot and play a larger role in their lives. 
[What advice would you give to an aspiring political journalist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f4up?context=5)|Reporting is the easy part. Get really good at listening. 
[What is the most intense experience you have ever had while working with Vice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f4it?context=5)|I've been detained a few times, but the worst was getting arrested in Egypt. I'd just had some rather questionable food, and my stomach was getting a little squirrely while we were interrogated. They finally let me out to use the bathroom, which was a pitch black room with water up to my shins and a small hole in the ground. It didn't go well.  
[Hey Ryan, huge fan!  I'm always shocked by the places that you guys manage to bring a camera. How do you a\) get in contact with some of these people (im thinking specifically about some of the people associated with criminal activity\) and b\) convince them to talk to you on camera? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f8ps?context=5)|Most folks - especially those who feel that they are misunderstood - jump at the chance to be able to tell their side of the story. The camera is a remarkably compelling tool. 
[What was it like meeting Kim Jong-un?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7f32u?context=5)|We honestly didn't know until we turned a corner in this banquet hall that he'd be there; there was no time to prep, or plan a question, or even consider the gravity. We walked into a dining hall and he was standing there with his hand extended. 
[Ryan, seen all your segments. great, great work. i'm always left wondering... where do you find the cojones to enter these difficult and challenging situations? i.e. sitting down with yakuza and not blinking an eye...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fyg6?context=5)|Half pure, unadulterated stupidity, and half complete and total faith in my crew. 
[What's the greatest act of humanity you've seen thus far? Also, what's the weirdest thing you've eaten while abroad.  I'm a huge fan, thanks for all you do! Your shows make me feel like I traveled with you to the destination. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7geu9?context=5)|I raced reindeer in Norway, which is a really heart-warming, family friendly activity until the end, when they kill and cook the last-place deer and serve him to all the racers. Very gamey. 
[Hey, been reading vice for at least a decade now.  keep on keepin on.  What is the scariest, or freakiest thing you've seen while doing your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7fp1u?context=5)|A cab driver named Martin making sweet, tender love to a small, undsupecting donkey.

[Is HBO's 'The Newsroom' anything like the real thing in a actual newsroom? Like the intensity when a breaking news comes to surface?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7anlp?context=5)|There are a lot of things that Sorkin actually gets right. How the reports are put together and the pressure of getting sources to commit and all that is correct.
 |The main thing I see is that we don't talk as much as they do. haha! When you're covering breaking news, you assign people to do certain things (like making calls, etc) and then you all disperse to do your tasks while the anchor is on the air frantically reading AP reports and looking for new information. We don't have the time to chat like they do. We generally have one news meeting a day and it's focused on just assigning stories and getting on with it.
[As someone who grew up in the middle of the country, can you tell me more about Middle Ground? What inspired you, how long you've wanted to do it, what kind of feedback you've gotten, etc.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7bbn7?context=5)|I'm so glad you asked about Middle Ground. Here's a link to the Kickstarter:  [Link to www.kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/542039841/middle-ground-0)  I've wanted to do this for years. I started in radio at KNAU in Arizona and then spent more than a decade in Detroit and I found that national reporting on the middle of the country is really, really bad. Instead of using the reporters who live there and are invested in the community, networks will fly in reporters for 24 hours. That's not how you get great coverage.  I think part of the reason we're so politically polarized is that Americans neither know nor understand one another, and it's very easy to hate ""the other"". It's really easy to see ""the other"" is not human. So the more we know about each other, the more empathy we'll have, the closer we can come as a country.  On the feedback part - we've gotten an amazing response. We've heard from lost of stations in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Colorado...
[How are stories fact checked before they go on air? Is everything run by a lawyer to make sure there is nothing potentially slanderous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7aqgy?context=5)|Not in public radio - we can't afford that many lawyers.
 |But every story is fact checked by the editor, the senior editor and the host. So there are multiple pairs of eyes looking for errors. Stuff still gets through, though.
 |I know NPR peeps are really, really careful about anything that could be inflammatory. The editors are always reining me in.  
[Are you still not allowed to call waterboarding and stress positions ""torture""? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7gi3c?context=5)|I haven't run into this, or been told not to call it torture. If there is an official NPR policy on this, I'm unaware of it.
[There was in 2009; I don't know about now. Here's the background to my question: Link to www.onthemedia.org.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7oegd?context=5)|That's a great interview from Bob Garfield. And it's a tough issue, I think. Partly because there's this myth out there that NPR is a government-funded organization when in truth it only gets 2% of its funding directly from the govt: [Link to www.businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/npr-schiller-government-funding-2011-3)
 |So any time we anger a political party, it becomes an excuse to call for an end to funding for public broadcasting. While that wouldn't hurt NPR all that much, it would be disastrous for local stations, especially in rural areas and for local PBS stations and all the other small local groups that rely on grants from the CPB to survive.
 |I don't think that ever affects story choices or deters us from covering newsmakers, but it does mean the organization is very careful to follow the law. We try to be sure that our editorial choices are legal and defensible. Since ""torture"" is a legal term, I imagine it was tough to decide whether to use it or not. 
[What makes all people on NPR sound like they're heavily medicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7brsl?context=5)|You're the second person to mention that. It's definitely NOT a style guideline. On the other hand, I've had exec. producers tell me to keep my vocal range confined to the middle of my voice. They tell me that I sound screechy when I go high, and people complain all the time about women using vocal fry in the low range. I think NPR has tried to sound serious and calm and credible and this is the sound that matches that best for them?
[Is it a style guideline or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7brsl?context=5)|I try very hard to be natural and respond like a human being, even if I sound silly. But to be natural, you have to give up a little bit of control and let yourself react. That can be scary and dangerous. You open yourself up to make mistakes. I don't mind because I don't think anyone thinks I'm perfect. But others aren't quite so comfortable with that.
[Also, any favorite microphones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7brsl?context=5)|I love the RE20, but I need two windscreens on it, stacked on top of each other, because I pop my p's so much.
[Is Carl Kassel as sexy in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b4aq?context=5)|Ha! Carl Kassell is as charming as he ever was and just one of the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. I wouldn't go so far as sexy, but he's quite a bit older than I am.

Government people are usually nervous and have to check with higher-ups before saying anything.
[Is it easier to investigate a government scandal or a financial one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7b4aq?context=5)|On the other hand, it's easier to investigate government sources because someone, somewhere will tell you something as an ""anonymous source"". It's REALLY hard to get people at banks or hedge funds to tell you anything.

This is a tough one and I have to be honest and say that I have to be very careful in how I answer this.  This issue is still sensitive for us.
 |I will say this: NPR's relationship had been rocky for a while and the comments on Fox were not the only thing that prompted his departure. On the other hand, I think NPR handled it badly.
 |I think NPR doesn't defend itself aggressively enough, actually. I think we get defensive too quickly and sometimes bend too much.

Some of the best examples of this are stories where you have the source but can't convince them to go on the record. For obvious reasons, I can't give precise details about this.
 |However! I had one auto worker that almost went on record talking about the way the management in his plant (foreign-owned) coerced and wheedled the employees into opposing union membership. Also, I had a member of one of the two parties claiming some really incredible workplace violations (racist, mostly).

 |The best opportunities in my life have come about because someone asked me to do something and instead of saying, ""I don't know how to do that,"" I just thought, ""OK, I'll try it.""
 |That's how I got into radio. I just figured, if I sucked at it, I would do something else. But people are pretty forgiving of mistakes when you admit you need help and they'll train you for FREE!
 |So, don't define what your identity is. Don't say, ""I'm a creative person and I need a job in the tech industry that allows me autonomy."" Just take all the opportunities that come your way and you might be surprised to find that you're not the person you thought you were.

 |I am a member of AGMA and a working musician. I empathize with all my brothers and sisters out there trying to make a living from music.

The facts sound right because it aligns with what they believe to be true. That's too bad, but not much I can do about it. I generally send people to listen to the On the Media examination of this topic, which I thought was great: [Link to www.onthemedia.org](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/235601-does-npr-have-a-liberal-bias) But I doubt they listen.   My biggest achievement so far is my son. He's 15, still alive, very bright, very funny and very compassionate. I'm excited to see what kind of man he becomes. Honestly, I've had a pretty tough life.

Huge fan of all things public radio.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7f7z4?context=5)|The most difficult interviews are often the emotional ones in which you're afraid someone is going to cry. And I've had many interviews in which I personally disagreed with the person I was talking to. Usually, it doesn't matter. I'm still interested in their point of view.
[What is the most difficult interview you've ever done? I'm really interested to hear about any experience you've had where you completely disagreed with someone you may have been interviewing, but had to hold back your own opinions to ask the important questions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7f7z4?context=5)|The ones I hate are with pundits who distort facts and say things that simply aren't true. It's hard to refute everything without sounding argumentative and you end up not getting any useful information. I think those kind of interviews are stupid and I wish I never had to do them.
[It is common knowledge that all media organizations are owned and regulated by a very select few (5 in total\) corporations. Clearly this creates a conflict of interest and boas, How does this make you feel as a professional in the industry? Is it safe to say we no longer have free press? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7k0at?context=5)|I agree. I think the quality of our news coverage started going down as soon as it became a commodity that needed to produce a profit. Why else does cable news think that Miley Cyrus and Rihanna are legitimate headlines? Give me a break.
 |On the other hand, most of the journalists I know are very smart, dedicated people who think they're contributing to the public good. I can only say that I'm glad I work for public radio.

By total number of major laws passed? Yes. By number of campaign promises kept? He's below 50%: [Link to www.politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter) but he's also pretty successful compared to other politicians.
 |It's too early to know who the front runners will be. I'm not even totally convinced that Hilary will run. But I do think there's a chance that the Republican party will split. The Tea Party might make a break for it because how does someone like Colin Powell stay in the same party with Ted Cruz? Also a lot of people on the left are unhappy with Obama because he's a centrist. (To be fair, he ran as a centrist and that's how he's running the country) So we could see a sort of Wikileaks party sprout up as well.

[Can you appreciate that many conservatives see NPR as a propaganda vehicle for the democrat party? The economics of radio nowadays is that you have to have public funding to keep an information based radio station on the air. And the democrats control the funding.

I have to assume that you don't listen to a lot of public radio. I know many people assume it's left-leaning, but it's just not true. We work really, really hard to include voices from all over the political spectrum and to fact check our reporting.

[As we become more technically adept and closely connected through the internet it seems that ""real"" journalism is a dying art that is becoming rapidly replaced by 'bloggers' who feel that a sensationalist headline is the only thing that matters. There is no need to fact check when it is simpler to just pass your opinion off as the truth. If their opinion is too far from the truth then a straw man argument is the most efficient way to manipulate the situation into something they can continue to talk about. They believe that as long as they are getting website hits then their version of the ""news"" is successful. This type of reporting feels to be toxic in the fact that once a few people see how popular one can become by spouting bile they want to imitate the behavior in an attempt to try and achieve the same level of 'success' which results in questionable, opinionated, one-sided news that, at the very best, distorts fact. Now keeping all this in mind my question to you is: What type of vacuum cleaner usually gets used on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pycuu/iama_celeste_headlee_reporter_and_host_for_npr/cd7j1zh?context=5)|I couldn't agree with you more, and you said that all beautifully.

That second one is a big question. I think the answer is that it was the commercialization of news that caused the problem in the first place. As soon as news became a commodity that had to turn a profit, news management started choosing reporters and stories that would generate more ad dollars. If we want better news coverage as a society, then we have to make it a public service again. That's one of the reasons I wanted to use Kickstarter to launch my new show. I really believe that the public should directly fund public radio.

1pyusa,8,2013-11-05,Struggling to choose between two offers. Hoping to get some fresh insight.,Poggus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pyusa/struggling_to_choose_between_two_offers_hoping_to/,"I'll try and keep this as short as possible, but it may be difficult.  I graduate in December and have narrowed my offers down to two.  I'm just hoping a fresh set of eyes and some real world experience might help me out.  My background is I'm in my late 20s, did military service before going to college.  All my courses were in Java, I have some experience with Android programming and did an internship dealing with .NET web applications.

So, I have two offers with the same salary.  Benefits vary slightly, but I feel they even out.  (One has an extra week vacation, the other has no monthly deduction for health care.)  They're both in the same area, but the job descriptions are very different. 

**Company A:**

I would be a junior C# developer working on enterprise HR style software.  The company is a medium sized software company.  They have some big name clients and great numbers.  Very strong stock and are rated very highly in employee satisfaction.

**Company B:**

I would be a junior iOS developer working on many different products.  The company is a smaller software company that only develops mobile apps.  It's a younger company only a few years old that recently went public but has a much weaker stock.  Still has a startupy feel to it.


I honestly feel like I would fit in well with the dev teams of both companies.  Both companies offer good training programs to get me acclimated immediately. 

My dream job would be to work for a company like ThoughtWorks which has opportunities abroad, or a company like Automattic which has a great culture and promotes remote work.  I've lived a good portion of my life overseas and would like to return one day.  I'm looking for a job that can build a resume so I can eventually enter a position like this.

I feel like the enterprise software experience at Company A could open doors to all sorts of different opportunities in a few years.  I also feel like iOS development is a hot commodity that could be great for a resume.  I don't want to get pigeon-holed, though.  I'm a little apprehensive about that position  since I have never touched iOS or Objective C.  I didn't enjoy my course in C, but the company seemed to think I'd pick everything up quickly in their training program.

So there's my not so short story.  Hoping to maybe hear from some people that went one way or the other or just some general advice.  Thanks for reading.

**Mandatory TL;DR:** Enterprise software developer or mobile developer"
1pyuce,1,2013-11-05,Older student losing motivation.... problem?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pyuce/older_student_losing_motivation_problem/,"Hey guys... like the title says.... I'm an 'older' student about a year away from completing a CSE degree. When I say 'older'...I mean I'm closer to 30 while the majority of my classmates are closer to 21. Up until this past year I've gotten pretty good grades (IMO) with a core GPA of ~ 3.5 while also completing a degree in Mandarin Chinese while taking all my engineering/CS classes. I've also been working on campus as a Python/Django developer for the past 3 years, so I've got alot of real world experience and a decent-size portfolio. It should also be mentioned that I have ALOT of other interests other than school/CS.... one of which is running a small non-CS related business with a friend... so I'd describe myself as a well-rounded individual.

This current semester I went a career fair on campus and was quite discouraged from all the recruiters I talked to. No one seemed to care that I had tons of experience working as a dev or had outside interests other than CS. The only thing these people cared about was my GPA. I even had one recruiter ask what my non-core GPA (3.09) and was told that she thought that was too low to even consider for an internship. I even referred many of them to take a look at my github and bitbucket accounts, but nobody seemed interested. As a result from this experience, I kinda quit caring this semester. Alot of it has to do with the classes I'm in.... I really don't care about Geology or Multi-variable calculus (pre-reqs that I never got out of the way). But I love all my CS classes.... however there just aren't enough hours of the day to get 'A's on all my assignments/exams when I need to work, as well as maintain outside relationships and keep myself sane. 

I read on this subreddit all the time that GPA doesn't really matter after your first job.... but I'm starting to feel like I'll have to still go through yet another lower-paying entry level position after graduation. This is kinda irksome since I can definitely code and solve complex problems while being enthusiastic and personable, unlike alot of my classmates with 4.0s. Do employers/recruiters notice extra-curricular activities and or well-rounded individuals who hate school? Or do they only want asperger-type golden children with perfect grades?

**TLDR:** Older student with alot of experience told his GPA isn't up to par.... should he keep trying to improve the GPA or just finish school and prove himself in interviews?

I don't see any way to fix it. I just want out.
There's no one to talk to cause everyone has this image that I'm doing fine, even great. I should be working right now, but I can't even focus on that. I dont wnat to deal with this anymore, I don't know what to do.

Edit: I guess specifics would help understanding the situation. I'm working part time, interning in my field, and taking three grad classes. I'm also in the closet, but have a beautiful gf. I'm pretty sure my mom knows, but she won't say anything. I live at home, cause my job doesn't pay much. In return I do a lot of the cooking and cleaning and errands.
I just feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew this semester, and it's come back to bite me. Up to now, I've been taking two classes a semester. The program directors really want us to finish in two years, so my advisor got me to take three classes. I'm failing one of them. Its reading and writing intensive, and I just can't focus like that, for that amount of time, and time is one thing I'm realllly short on this semester. Of the five required assignments for the first half of the year, I got two in, a week late. The midterm was due two weeks ago. I still don't have more than a page written. The class is tonight. I skipped my internship to work on it more, but I'm freaking out so much, just thinking about how much it doesn't even matter at this point cause she's not gonna accept it. I'm ruining my life, slowly but surely, just like I'm ruining my gf by continuing to keep her a secret. I dont want anyone to know how much I've fucked up. I just wish i could pickup and just leave. Go somewhere else, leave all this shit behind.
Everytime I drive, i think about how easy it would be to just veer off the road. Easily explainable, the road was wet, I was going too fast, or I thought I saw a deer. I see a knife, I think about how nice it would be to just end it all nicely. Cut my wrists, it's what? five, seven minutes tops? But I'm kind of practical. If I die, I leave my load of debt from school and my car on my parents and my gf is already bipolar. I don't think she could deal with this short term. It would have been better if she had never met me. I've been avoiding her calls partially because i've been so busy, I havent' gotten more than four hours of sleep a night and partially because i keep thinking that maybe if i just fade from her life, she'll get used to not having me around and won't be as impacted if something happens.
I'm a piece of shit, i know. Don't worry, I'm angry at myself too."
1pxz7i,1,2013-11-05,How does one transfer from to an US university from a third world country's institution without a ton of money?,aguyfromthirdworld,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pxz7i/how_does_one_transfer_from_to_an_us_university/,"Firstly, excuse my English, it is not my first language.

Hi folks. I've been reading the best of the /r/bestof and got a hope that reddit's hive mind can help me.

My story: I am 18 years old and I am a second year student of one of the best technical universities in my country. I know a thing or two about programming which helped me get an internship in a major IT company, let's call it A. For three months I was living in California working a job of my dreams. I really felt like a time traveller who jumped 30 years forward. A few weeks ago I have returned home.

Living in the US and talking to my new friends opened my eyes on a lot of issues. Teaching process in my university is horrendously inefficient: you don't get to choose courses you attend, most of them are utterly useless, most of the professors either don't know the course they are teaching or don't care about their job at all, literally all methods of control are not working, there is a vast portion of my fellow students who just don't study during the semester and cheat their way through exams. Buildings are literally falling apart. All this is surrounded with talk about innovations and modernization. Most of my knowledge comes from books, MOOCs and doing my own projects. Several days ago A's direct competitor, local company B contacted me and offered the same kind of job I was doing at A, but with 11 times smaller salary and no perks. BTW, my parents, one of whom is a brilliant practicing surgeon, together make about $27k per year.

I live in my university's dormitory, and I left all my belongings in my room when I left for the internship because I signed a contract with the head of the dormitory that next year I will live in the same room. When I returned I found out that all my stuff was simply thrown out and I was moved to another room.

And it is simply not comfortable living in my own country. For some reason I was not seeing the kafkaesque around me.

I like to reckon myself an intelligent person and I have a ton of motivation, so I'd like to apply to an US university like MIT or Caltech. But I hear that education in US is ridiculously expensive and I have no idea how I should apply.

Some advice or may be a first-hand success story would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you."
1pxp0s,17,2013-11-05,Got interviewed and offered my first internship today. I accepted... but I'm a bit apprehensive. Did I make a mistake? Details inside.,MyCScareerThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pxp0s/got_interviewed_and_offered_my_first_internship/,"Okay, I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, but with relevant details to give some perspective.

I'm in my early thirties and had a successful career as a salesman in the custom home market in my mid to late twenties.  When the recession happened, it hit me especially hard... and I hit rock bottom both financially and emotionally.  I was kind of messed up for a while and felt like a complete and utter failure.  I pretty much gave up on life and crawled inside the bottle to hide from my problems.   Finally I sobered up (I go to meetings) and got a little bit of self esteem back... I cleaned up my act and enrolled in a community college to get a 2 year degree in programming (I already have a Bachelor's from when I was 22 years old, but it's unrelated to CS).  I figured I would start from scratch, clean slate, that sort of thing.

So here I am, one semester away from wrapping up my 2 year degree.  I am a straight A student and I'm consistently 2-3 weeks ahead in all my classes. More than one person has used the expression ""on the ball"" to describe me.

Part of my degree requirement is that I find an internship.  I met with the internship coordinator (guidance councilor) at my school, and she said that my internship had to be completed locally (i.e, I could not move to another city for an internship).  The city I live in has roughly a million people in it... maybe a little less.  There are not as many options as one would find in a larger city, like Chicago, Boston, Dallas, etc.

After extensive searching, I could only find a dozen or fewer internships/co-ops for the spring semester in my area.  I applied to all of them 2 weeks go.

Only one responded.

It is a small company of about 15 people who work with IBM products and mainframes.  They want to pay me 10 bucks an hour to learn an old, somewhat obsolete language (RPG4) and code for them.  I have experience with Java, C++, Visual Basic and SQL.  I told them in my interview I had never heard of RPG4 and they said they were not surprised, and admitted it's not really common anymore.

So... here in lies my problem.

I feel like this is an ""any port in the storm"" kind of situation for me.  An internship is better than no internship, but am I painting myself into a corner by taking this job?  One one hand, I will get real world experience actually coding, and I would like to go on to a successful career after working there for 6 months or so.  But at the same time, I'm apprehensive.  I don't want to waste a lot of time becoming good at a dead programming language that hardly anyone uses.  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  My gut feeling is that they can't find anyone to program in RPG4, so they're taking advantage of an intern that will do it for next to nothing.

Also, if it matters, I'm taking advanced Java and C++ in my final semester at community college... will that help me ""break out"" from this other job once I graduate?

Sorry if these are dumb questions, but I really just have no real world experience yet, and I don't want to go down the wrong path.

Edit:  11/12/13 - Thanks for the awesome advice everyone!  I really appreciate it!

1pxk8n,3,2013-11-05,Internship - what skills should I have?,pavle3k,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1pxk8n/internship_what_skills_should_i_have/,"Hey guys, I'm currently a junior undergrad bioinformatics major. As my college career begins to wind down, it is time to look for an internship for the summer. However, due to scheduling problems, and the fact that I did not choose BI until my sophomore year, I am a bit behind in terms of curriculum and relevant knowledge. More succinctly, I have not taken any bioinformatics courses (though I plan to in the spring, so that should give me preparation for a summer internship), or even genetics for that matter (I know). I have basic programming skills, and knowledge of Data Structures, having taken the class. I am familiar with Java, C, and Python.

So my question to you is, what should I spend my winter learning so that I could come into an interview with enough knowledge to have a chance of landing an internship? I plan on learning Genetics and Molecular Genetics through and through, as well as doing as many problems on Rosalind as possible. Also, I have heard that Perl and Ruby are commonly used languages, so I will spend time learning those. Anything else, or would I be better advised to just wait and spend my time doing research this summer?"

She's only here, on average, 2 to 4 days a month, so naturally other employees will squat there for meetings or what have you. She was also too important to put in tickets herself, it was always someones assistant/secretary. 

One afternoon coming back from lunch, we receive a ticket from the CEO's assistant. Subject along the lines of ""FW: My Desk top won't respond."" I specifically remember the inability to properly spell desktop. The Chief in question emailed the CEO's assistant asking her (the assistant) to cut a ticket. Not only did the Chief refuse to cut her own ticket, but emailed another the assistant her exact issue, so the assistant just forward the email into our queue. Why the Chief couldn't just change the email address to our ticket system, boggles my mind.

The ticket only says that the computer won't respond to any form of input. The only button that responded was the CD drive open/close button.

I go up to her office, only to find the keyboard and mouse unplugged and hanging there in plain sight. Clear as day that was the issue, plug them in, computer responds. This is where it gets funny: 

PFP: The keyboard and mouse were unplugged. You're all set.

She must of thought I was blaming her for unplugging the cables.

Chief: What?! I never unplugged them. I specifically remember leaving my office last month with everything working. How could this happen?
 
I should have played dumb, but I didn't know any better.

PFP: I'm guessing another employee was having a meeting in here and accidentally did this. I see people on conference calls in here all the time. 

Chief: NO! That is unacceptable, this is MY office and mine alone. How dare anyone use my stuff, don't they know who I am?!

Before I was back at my desk, she had sent out a company wide email about how her office is her's alone, no one is allowed to use it. Using other people's things is a fireable offense. It was great. I will never forget the look on her face when I just plugged two cables in and told her people use her office. 

From this ticket we created a new status code for issues. The ""HoF"" status, or Hall of Fame. I will dig up some more HoF tickets for everyone's enjoyment."

I've been working full time the entire time I've been in school and also made it through a deployment when I was 22. Needless to say I've always been a non-traditional student.

I posted on r/AskComputerScience yesterday about my current situation (I'm a math undergrad with 3 semesters left thinking about going to either grad school or the job market but in a mostly CS field). At this point I'm happy with my choice of doing an undergrad in math (and some of the nice folks over at AskCS confirmed that it was a good idea) but I feel like I need to work on a portfolio on my own. Internships are extremely competitive at my school (only a few a years offered to the handful of top students) so I don't really count on those to get some experience.

My main problem is that the areas I'm interested in have pretty high entry levels. I was wondering if, from the list, you guys could recommend a few things worth looking into. My goal is to basically add some activity on my github account so I have something to show when time comes.

I have been programming in C for the past 7 or 8 years, mostly to code small gadgets including a brainfuck interpreter, a tiny webserver, a markdown to html translator and so on. My interests are mostly in compiler design, embedded systems, how OS actually 'work' at the lower level, security. Basically I'm trying to stay away from Mobile and Web as much as possible (although I did play around with NodeJS recently and it's not too bad)

So my question is mostly to people who have experience or knowledge in what employers are looking for. I'll be arriving on the job market with very little ""real world"" experience and a math degree so I need something to show that I'll be able to do the job.

Any kind of information is appreciated. Thanks and have a good day!"

[CS Major graduating in May],curiousGambler,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q0g98/where_and_how_to_look_for_jobs_cs_major/,"Hey everyone. Thanks in advance for any advice you have for me, hopefully this question will be helpful to many.

**My Question:**

I'm graduating with a degree in CS this May and don't know how to find a job. My school's career center has been moderately helpful, but CS is definitely not their strong point, and I really don't know where to look, so I figured I'd ask you guys.

Specifically, I want to go into security, preferably working with or writing crypto. See below for my background. My intent is to work for a few years before going back to school and hopefully get into research. I'm just not sure where or how to find a relevant job in the meantime.

Any advice guys?


**Background:**

I'm a CS major, math minor set to graduate with my BS from a pretty good school. I'm a confident programmer with good math skills in addition to a well-rounded liberal arts education. I have experience in C++, Python and Java, but pure C is my favorite. 

I've written an RSA crypto library (for fun, don't roll your own crypto, I know, I know) and am in the design phase of my next project, a multi-threaded HTTP server. I have my work on Github and have been looking to work on open source projects as well. My coursework includes all the usual data structures, algorithms and theory of computation as well as software development and systems programming. I'm very excited about the computer security course I'm taking next semester.

Job and internship experience is probably one of my weaker aspects. I spent a summer as a network engineering intern with my school's IT department. I did some programming but it was mostly a sysadmin role. It did teach me how to really use my computer as a tool however, which has been valuable. I'm also a CS lab consultant in the evenings, which has improved my ability to explain code and concepts.

*Thanks again for your help!*"
1q05xc,4,2013-11-05,Building a resume as someone going back to school for CS,technicallyrice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q05xc/building_a_resume_as_someone_going_back_to_school/,"Hello all,

I'm enrolled to begin the Post-Baccalaureate online CS degree (two year track) at Oregon State University. I have to say, I'm really excited about it.

I'd like to get a resume ready so I can start applying for internships when I begin, but I'm not quite sure how to go about this. I already hold a bachelor degree in Japanese, with a business minor. After I graduated in 2010, I worked for 2 years as a sales person for a Japanese data center/telecom company in New York, and then for almost a year now as a computer technician. Clearly, while related to technology, neither job really represents what I would like to do by obtaining this degree and land a job programming. 

So, what should I do? Should I hold off on the resume for now and do some personal projects and/or maybe try to take part in some open source? I've really only been fiddling with the fundamentals and different languages to get a feel for them. I started playing with a few different frameworks from a few different languages, but nothing really solid as of yet.

Any advise is welcome. Thanks all."

I had to drop some classes due to struggling in them the past year and it really put me off track to graduating on time, unless I take a lot of classes each semester. However, I have a decent number of big CS and CS project classes left, so I'm not sure if I'd be able to handle it. So, I might need an extra semester to graduate. 

So, will it look bad to companies I'm applying for when they realize I'll need an extra semester to graduate? Also, what should I do for my ""senior"" year? Should I apply for full-time positions and tell the companies that I wouldn't be able to start until the spring of next year? Or should I just go for another internship?"

So ever since my laptop suddenly shut down one day- which I am led to believe is due to the fact that it was getting too hot, I've been monitoring my processor and GPU temperatures for every game. I've been playing Batman Arkham City and it is among the games that reach the highest temperatures (along with No More Room in Hell for some odd reason). 

When playing this game at all high settings (and while streaming at 720p), my GPU temperature can reach 93 celcius. Is this normal/safe? 93 seems pretty hot when you convert it to featherweight, haha. If not, what could be the reason and how do I solve it?

(I did post this in /r/Dentistry and /r/Dentists  but nobody commented so i thought i would ask here.) 

I have been to over 10 different intern locations, general, pediatric, surgery, orthodontics and other specialties.

My class has 24 students also interning but the majority of them have already gotten job offers. I feel I am the only one who has not had one while others have had 3 or 4 offered to them.

I understand my skills are not up to par yet.
While interning I am professional and friendly towards the patients and staff.

I am a diligent note taker looking to learn as much as possible. I ask questions after the patient has left unless the doctor allows questions during the treatment but I never question the doctor on why he is doing this or that.

Whenever the staff or doctor try to correct me on a skill or something I do not take it personally, I thank them for their advice and try to refine my technique.

In one of the places that I interned at I was told that interns are not allowed to take x-rays, call the pt back, or assist on a child if the parent was in the treatment room, a classmate went to the same place and she was asked to take x-rays, call the pt back and assist. That office never gave me a chance to show my skills. Why would one office tell me I can’t but allow another intern to do it?

I hope the next office I intern at will give me a chance because I know I can be a great asset to their practice. I am such a hard worker (I have had a job for over 6 years, I have won awards for my hard work and dedication, I have had letters written to my boss about my helpfulness, I never call out, etc. but I cant mention “non-dental” things in the dental office, especially as an intern.) I feel the dr and staff cant see that because I am learning a whole new skill (assisting) and my passing isn’t the best yet. Every office I go to has “their way” of doing things and I don’t know how to read the Dr’s mind yet to know which instrument he wants next.

It’s hard for the dr. to get to know me because so far my experience has been at every office, the dr locking himself in his office after each pt. The staff doesn't want to help me learn (they think I should just ""know"" it.)

A couple of the places have told me they were not hiring at the moment and then a couple of weeks later a classmate of mine has been offered a job as an assistant at their practice.

What tips do you have to help me improve my skills and land a job offer before my semester ends?"

When I first started college I had a hell of a time being focused and passing classes. I spent nearly all of my tkme drinking and partying, and eventually dropped out of school.

After spending a year or two doing minimum wage jobs and being a typical college drop out, I ended up landing an awesome internship that turned into a full time job as a sysadmin. I just recently started taking courses at the local community college again with the intention of switching to uni in a semester or two once I've finished my AS.

Im nervous now because I don't have the time to dedicate to school that most students do, and my current GPA is an abysmal 2.0, and I feel like I pretty well screwed myself for the future.

I guess two questions: is it worth it to go for the BS in comoiter science? And does the math ever stop? I still have to take calc and from what I understand computer science degrees end up with math all the way through... not fun. 

Thanks in advance, and sorry for any formatting/spelling errors, I'm on my phone right before heading to class."

* A: silicon valley startup

* B: large, established, tech company

* C: healthcare software company

* D: small company that writes educational software

I love company A, I visited them and the culture fit was incredible. I would have been heartbroken if I hadn't received an offer, so luckily I did.

Now the problem is withdrawing from/declining the other companies' offers, and I feel so guilty about it.  With company B, I had an onsite scheduled for next week, and when I told them I accepted another offer, they encouraged me to retract it and continue the interview process with them. This suggestion seemed odd to me, so I sent a firm but polite email defending my decision.  Then they asked who I accepted the offer from. Is that a standard question? I'm not sure if this is a normal question and I should answer without pause, or if this is them continuing to be extremely pushy.

My other concern is company C. I really liked them, I went to an onsite last week and was awaiting a decision. I would definitely consider working for them next year, full time, if I don't get asked back to company A. I don't know how to get across that I was very excited about them, and would possibly want to be considered again in the future.

Now, company D...
They're based in Boston, paying less than half the salary of the others, don't help interns find housing (all the other companies provide housing), and when the manager called to give me my offer, he asked who I was still interviewing with and I told him (maybe I shouldn't have?). From there, he told me that those companies were too big, wouldn't treat me right, and if he was getting this offer, he'd probably accept almost immediately.  To this, I told him that I wanted to complete my interviews with the other companies so that I could make an informed decision, and he gave me that time, very reluctantly (and I understand how generous he was to give me that time). However, I'm scared to make the phone call declining their offer, because he's been quite pushy in the past. I'm afraid of saying something I'll regret, in order to appease him.

I want to withdraw from consideration gracefully from companies C and D, and know whether to tell B the name of the company I accepted an offer from.  This is my first interview season, and I'm so overwhelmed. Any tips?"

I have the amazing opportunity to be interviewed next week for a Software Development internship at Facebook for the summer!

However, as it is my first technical interview ever, I am a bit scared of failing by starting with such a big company.

I know that I should know my data structures, algorithms, complexity by heart, but there is something that I have no idea of which is scalability.
My actual work as a student iOS Developer (part-time job while in my first year of master) and my past internship never touched on this question of scalability, and I would like it if somebody could point me in the right direction for this!

Apart from that, has anyone had a specific experience with Facebook that he could share with me? It's mainly to drop the pressure a bit as I feel like this is an amazing opportunity but due to my lack of previous interviews I am afraid of it.

If you have anything that could help me for this, please feel free to share! I'm so excited though, this is gonna be an awesome experience anyway, but if I could manage to land it, I'd be even happier ;)

P.S: There is something that I am wondering about the hints given by the engineers, are they really common? How bad does it look if you need hints to complete your code?

Thanks!"

I believe it went well because they are going to fly me to headquarters to interview with the big bosses. I have a little less then a year of IT experience (a couple internships.)

I've seen the question on here a bunch of times about the advantages of certs, and most answers seem to be right on the money where you get past the HR screen, and get an interview. The hiring manager who interviewed me flat out said that my certs earned me an interview.

Its at that point where its up to you, your soft skills, and your actual knowledge to get the position.



*UPDATE: Had a second local interview, and this one was to test my skills, it was all networking, asking about How switches and routers move traffic, MTU sizes, difference between UDP/TCP, I also talked a little bit about WAN's and BGP.

One thing that really impressed him was when he asked if i had any questions, I asked him: ""If i was hired, and we sat down 30-90 days from now for a review, what will i have done to impress you, and what are you looking for in a successful employee in this position?""

It started out with my best friend and I, then my friend Susan. Susan leaves a few months later because she can't stand the messiness of the house (she didn't clean jack shit). So, we asked my friend Alec to move in, and he brought his friend Tyler. They never discussed Tyler living there, but that's okay with me, I like Tyler, he cleans and eats his own food and pays all of his bills on time. 
 
However, Tyler, Alec and Zeke my best friend, are all giant fucking slobs. Which, I am kind of a slob too but I have a much lower breaking point than they do, as they allow dishes to pile up. I have been doing sink fulls of dishes every two days. I also cannot use the washer and dryer, and a slew of other annoying roommate issues I was prepared to handle.
 
Now, the straw that breaks the camels back is that Alec, who shares a room with Tyler, has not paid a dime in rent, and the only bill he managed to pay was half of what he owed me for the internet. I have $20 to last me the next two weeks. On top of it all, I am now down to only a few boxes of Mac 'n cheese and half a gallon of milk because Alec keeps eating my food. And I swear it's to spite me. He and Tyler are supposed to share rent, and neither of them have made a single payment and they're two months behind. The Landlord is awesome and wants them to pay their rent, and isn't expecting Zeke or I to pay any portion of it. 
 
Yesterday, I came home for lunch after classes and saw that Alec had left a pan half full of MY mashed potatoes, along with plates and other messes around the sink. It was so bad I couldn't even move the faucet. I looked in the dishwasher, and surely enough it was empty, with the exception of the dishes that I had placed there.
 
Now, Alec has spent all his money and he complains that I am not doing enough around the house, and that he should be exempt from certain household chores because he ""works more"" (which is bullshit I work two part time jobs and go to school and have an internship, he just works a full time job). I asked him to clean up after himself and he told me that I should be the one to clean up the kitchen. 
 
So, I placed the dishes under his pillow. This sinister plan was something Alec implemented when he first moved in. I never got a taste of it, but Zeke would find his dirty pans and plates under his pillows almost every night for two weeks straight. Alec then threw the dishes and got pissed and told me I had to clean them up.
 
We got into a screaming match and had I not walked away I would have hit him in his face. 
 
Among other things, he also borrows money and doesn't pay it back, goes into my room to take my things such as clothes, or my phone charger, etc. AND he likes to invite ugly fucking girls over and then be a giant dick to me in front of them because thus far I have tried to be a good host and not start a scene. 
 
It's only been two months, I'm about ready to kick his ass, and I feel that my only options at this point are to kick him out, or leave myself. To be honest, I think I would prefer to just move out, but my lease won't be up until July. What should I do?"

I'm also in a lower math (Calc II) than many and still taking chemistry (everyone else took AP). Does this put me far behind? Like unappealing to recruiters?

I was also recommended by a TA for my intro to engineering section for a possible internship for freshman for Qualcomm because I always got my work done on time, asked questions, and paid attention. There were less than 20 people recommended for the possible one or two positions, but I don't know how I stack up. I imagine many are smarter and further in their coursework than me. 

When talking to the recruiter, I talked about a current project (android app) and my involvement in extracurriculars as well as my enthusiasm for CS. I also talked about how I've done a lot of little projects with python in the past and took the initiative in high school to work with my counselor and teacher to do an independent study in x86 assembly language (very limited choice of courses, it was that or javascript which I was not interested in whatsoever). If I get an interview, I know there won't be many technical questions, but what would be some ways I could still set myself apart from the crowd and give myself a better chance? How are my chances if other people have taken higher up classes than me?

I appreciate any advice I could get! I know it's not always easy to get an internship as a freshman, but it would love it if I did."

Premiums, co-pays, and deductibles cost way more than what most people would consider to be a ""fair"" price.

Plus, a few years ago, she had ovarian cancer. She got lucky; it was a stage 0 diagnosis. But after she went in for the surgery to get the ovaries out, it got harder for her to afford the insurance. The co-pays and out-of-pockets put her in the red about $16k. Her premiums got near $1k/month. She couldn't afford that, the other monthly payments for living, and putting me through college, so she had to drop the insurance. And when she reapplied to Anthem for a lower rate, she was denied because even though the cancer was long gone, it still counted as a pre-existing condition.

If anything, the Affordable Care Act should prevent some of these things.   No denial over pre-existing conditions, no unfair raises in rates, a ceiling on out-of-pocket costs, and a state marketplace (CT) to shop in for coverage. We should be happy, right? Well, we aren't, because she still can't afford it. Despite the fact that she has been making less money each year, she still makes more than 400% of the poverty line, so no subsidies. That means that the monthly co-pay is north of $500, with the maximum possible deductibles we can be legally charged under the law.

But I can't say that I oppose the ACA. I have two reasons behind this: the first is that I believe in the good intentions of the law, and even though she may still not get coverage, other people may be able to. The second is that I would be siding with the conservatives. And between the two options, I'd rather be shot in my sleep.

They've been getting real cocky lately. The ACA exchanges are taking forever to get setup. Only a few people so far are enrolled. This therefore means that the program has officially failed, despite the fact that much of the legislation hasn't even been in place for two months yet. This legislation was passed in *2010*. We've been waiting so long for this to get enacted.

And it doesn't even have teeth. The original plan was to introduce the public option. All the other first-world industrial countries have it, and they're having very few problems with it. Private health insurance still exists in these countries, too. When Obama first came out with the ideas, he wanted a public option and for all people to have insurance. So what gives?

Enter the conservative, who cried and screamed with the insurance companies over how it was socialism and was going to destroy every business in America in the history of ever. Never mind that Romney implemented a version of the ACA. Never mind that the Heritage Foundation supported a public option before they opposed it. So Obama tried compromising with them, and the public option got scrapped entirely. Insurance did not want to see the competition, so they lobbied their way out of it. The compulsory mandate to buy insurance, however, they were fine with. No problems with that at all.

Ask a conservative what he thinks about the ACA, and he'll go on to tell you about how the liberal socialist Marxist Kenyan is going to give *their* ""hard-earned"" tax dollars to illegal immigrants and crackheads in the projects. They hate the notion of ""giving handouts"" to the poor. Again, never mind that Jesus (who I'm sure many of them believe in) believed in giving to the less fortunate (period, no exceptions), and said ""give to Caesar what you owe to Caesar and to God what you owe to God."" The death panels with their government hands are coming to pry Grandma's Medicare and Social Security from her sick hands. (Take a moment to read over that sentence for the irony.)

The conservatives got more out of the deal than the ""lieberals"" they think got. But apparently, their version of compromise is ""give us all of what we want or we'll shut down the government."" And they literally did this last month. They kept making a stink, even though it was voted as law, and many people support it, and the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor, with the tie-breaker being a conservative judge. They tried to vote to abolish it *40 fucking times*, when there were other issues to worry about. It was their top priority in office: undo any and all progress made by this piece of legislation. And their reasons were, and still are, stupid. We shouldn't have these things because lazy people. We shouldn't have these things because illegal immigrants. We shouldn't have these things because Democrats.

We don't live in the welfare state that Reagan tried to convince us we were. We're CUTTING aid for people who need it, FFS. Food stamps just took a cut by $30 a month. Half of the nation isn't on the health care exchanges because they won't sign up, despite the fact that the money is free the first few years and 10% of what the state took in the following years. The benefit limits are so constricted, that you could work 60 hours a week on minimum wage, have no home, no car, no children, and no other expenses, and you'd *STILL* be ineligible for government aid. How the fuck is this a welfare state? The people who are poor carry a large social stigma for being poor and we're making it worse.

And you'd think that the insurance companies would be done by now. Hell no. They don't want their clients getting any ideas. The dust the conservatives are kicking up are doing well for them. They just hope that people will be too stupid to know the difference. Take, for example, the recent debacle about some people losing their coverage over the new regulations of the ACA. Do you honestly think that the insurance companies have no power? Do you really think that they can't adjust the plans to include the contraceptives, even if it only added a grand total of $20 to your monthly premium? Do you truly believe that the government is the above-all force of evil on this planet, and that these poor wittle multi-billion-dollar insurance companies are the victims? Because if you are, please tell me how you manage to feed yourself and put on your own clothes, because you have to have to be at THAT level of stupidity to believe that kind of pure horse shit.

The insurance companies don't want you to think that you'll have something to gain out of this, so when the insurance exchanges opened up, they did the one last thing they could do: lie. A company's HR isn't going to have the time or patience to shop around, so let's lie about not being able to extend coverage to generate misconceptions about and hatred towards the legislation. When the legislation was enacted last month, there were comments in the related articles posted on reddit by company HR employees responsible for managing their health care. The insurance companies they work with came and said that their costs were going to go up and their coverage reduced due to the legislation. So what did the employees do? They said something along the lines of ""well, we can't afford that coverage, so I guess we'll have to go shop around on the exchanges for something cheaper. You'll get your last payment at the start of the new year."" And boy, did the insurances companies' tone change. Those companies wound up getting either the same or *more* coverage, and for less money. Now tell me that those insurance companies weren't lying. Go on and try now that I've told you this.

Finally, among the other anecdotes out there on the Interwebs, I'll give you my own. I managed to get lucky when I graduated high school because my old insurance plan expired at that point. The DSS offered Medicaid part D, now called HUSKY D, for college students, who would be accepted regardless of their parents' income. (The specific program is no longer offered, BTW. Also, new applicants must consider their parents' income as their own when applying.) While I have full coverage, I have a very low income limit, and it just got lower. Last year, I could make $10k/yr before taxes before my benefits could be revoked. Now, my limit is at $517/mo before taxes, which is down to around $6.5k a year. As a computer science and computer engineering major, I need to get an internship to graduate. The internships being offered by companies lately are paid, and the rate is usually $20-30/hr. This means that when I get an internship, which will be part-time in order to get the hours required for graduation, I'll have to give up the insurance. If I get coverage with my mother, our combined incomes will be below the lithium for subsidies, so premiums will cover half. A silver plan can go for around $340/mo, which is the cheapest option on the marketplace. Even this, given the other bills we have, will be expensive, and we will probably have to make more cuts in our budget in order to afford it. All because some conservative with a shitty attitude didn't want a tax raise that he probably wasn't even going to get get hit with.

If there are any wannabe politicians out there, give me a public option, with basic coverage at the least, and I will give you my vote. Please. America is over due for it.

TL;DR - Just go back and read the whole damn thing.

Quick background, i'm just about to start final year of my Mechanical Engineering Degree (in Australia, with a dual in economics, if anyone cares), and my university requires a capstone project, either in the form of a year long thesis or a semester long design project. From talking to people and according to the head of the school, roughly 90% go with a thesis. It's strange, most other faculties in the school are the other way around, but thar you go.

Anyways.

So I decided to check tonight and it seems Thesis topics have been posted (Topics are provided by various lecturers/researchers etc who are the supervisors, relating to their field of work etc).... aannndddd none of them really interest me at all.

It seems like probably ~75% of the topics revolve around CFD (which I haven't done a course in, so it would be very time consuming/difficult to learn, and I really didn't enjoy fluid mechanics, so I can't seem myself liking it), or materials analysis (things like analysis of some particular composite under some particular loading scenario etc, which I really don't think i'll enjoy either since I didn't enjoy doing materials/chemistry etc). It's probably due to the fact that the school is at the bleeding edge in hypersonics etc, so most of the researchers (aka lecturers) are focused around that. 

There are maybe 2 or 3 projects that would be ok, but other than that there really isn't anything interesting. It's unfortunate because previous years topics were more interesting (my particular interest is in mining equipment, since i've doing 4 summer internships for a big mining company, and cars/engines etc).

It is possible to do our own thesis topic, but the process to do it is pretty time consuming (ie you have to write a thesis proposal, find a supervisor who will take it, get it approved by them, get it approved by the school, and then the supervisor will probably not be very helpful since it isn't their own thing).... but there isn't anything that i'm that passionate about that I want to spend a year of my life on my own doing.

So having said all of that (and thanks for making it this far into my late night ramblings!), does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what to do? Do I just cop out and chose the easiest thing that sounds the most interesting? 

Thoughts? Suggestions? Slaps back to reality?

Thanks all :)"

Basically my current plan is to build up my web development knowledge while going to school so I can land an internship or part-time job, since I need some kind of income.

I DO have some experience with HTML5, CSS, and a good amount of experience with coding languages such as C(first language learned and strong foundation), C++, and Java.

I think questions like this are pretty typical so I will try to ask some (hopefully) good questions.

1. For someone in my current position, with no experience in Front-End(e.g, Javascript) or Back-End(e.g, PHP) web development, what should I prioritize or attempt to learn first(for the sake of a job)? Which languages are better off learned more than others?

2.  How do I find a challenging project for these languages(PHP, Ruby, Javascript, etc.) that will help me learn about the language as much as possible, as efficiently as possible? For example, I felt like I learned a lot about C when working with pointers, freeing memory leaks, and using function pointers. When I look through the very basic examples(e.g, creating an array) of languages like PHP or Javascript at W3Schools, they seem really redundant to me.

I apologize in advance, I know these questions are very general and I may need to be more specific, but any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

1q5xw0,0,2013-11-08,Pharmacy Education Assistance Program Question (MN/ND),msb4464,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1q5xw0/pharmacy_education_assistance_program_question/,"During pharmacy school (in ND) I worked for a major chain retail store (in MN) as a pharmacy intern. During that time I was offered their ""pharmacy education assistance program"" which is basically a scholarship for employment contract. They gave me some money and I agreed to work for them after graduation.

The problem was, they didn't hire ANY new grads the year I graduated (2012). I applied, and was not offered a job. A year later I applied again, and went for months without hearing anything. Now it's been 1.5 years since I graduated and they have decided they want their money back.

I was told by my district manager at the time of this non-hiring year that because the chain hadn't held up their end in good faith I wouldn't have to pay back the money ($6,000). Unfortunately, I was naive and believed him, and didn't ask for anything in writing.

I feel I did all in my power to attempt to hold up my end of the contract, but when they weren't hiring there wasn't much I could do. Below is the wording of the contract. I'm wondering if there is anything I can other than pay it back, I never terminated or rejected an offer - an offer was never extended.

1. Upon approval, educational assistance awards shall be provided for a one, two, three or four year period of
time, during which time the recipient must remain a student (with a ""C "" average or better) in a pharmacy
program approved by ****. Additionally, the student must be legally authorized to work in the United
States throughout the duration of this Agreement.
2. Recipient shall apply the entire amount of each award to recipient's education in the approved pharmacy
program.
3. To avoid any repayment obligation, recipient must graduate from the approved pharmacy school, accept
employment in the location designated by ****, and remain continuously employed as a full-time fully
licensed pharmacist for a cumulative period of time equal to the sum of the number of years recipient
participated in the Program (this period of time is referred to below as the ""Required Employment Period"").
However, for participants in three-year pharmacy schools, the Required Employment Period shall equal one
year for participation during the first school year, plus 18 months for participation in each of the second and
third school years. Periods of non-active employment (approved leaves of absences) do not count toward
satisfying the Required Employment Period.
4. The total Required Employment Period for the recipient shall include the Required Employment Period
described in 3 above, plus the Required Employment Period(s) for the recipient's participation in one or more
of the other educational assistance programs offered by **** to pharmacy students, if applicable. (For
example, if a student receives the Pre-Pharmacy award, Progressive Program awards (under a four-year
program) for two years and Location Based Program awards for two years, he/she would be required to work
for **** as a full-time registered pharmacist for six years, two of which are in the geographic area
specified in the ****. Pharmacy Student Location Based Educational Assistance Program Application).
5. **** will consider recipient geographic location preferences, but nationwide employment availability and
business needs also are important factors in **** employment determinations. For this reason,
**** reserves the right to employ recipient in any geographic location and shall be under no obligation to
place recipient in accordance with recipient's geographical location preference.
6. If recipient does not graduate from an approved pharmacy program or fails to pass the state board examination for a pharmacy license after three consecutive attempts, then recipient promises to pay to
**** the sum of the annual awards received under the Program, which sum shall become immediately
due and payable upon demand from ****. The amount to be repaid with respect to each annual award
shall be increased by a penalty of 8% per year from the date the award was made.
7. If recipient does not complete the Required Employment Period, then recipient promises to pay to ****
the total sum of the awards received under the Program, upon demand from ****. If not paid within 30
days of demand for payment, the amount due shall be increased by a penalty of 8% per year from the date
recipient terminates employment or rejects a designated employment location. Recipient's completion of a
portion of the Required Employment Period shall not reduce the amount owed. Further, failure to complete the
Required Employment Period, either directly or indirectly due to the recipient's failure or inability to maintain
valid work authorization throughout the duration of this Agreement, shall not release the recipient from the
repayment obligations described herein.
8. **** reserves the right to satisfy this repayment obligation with any amounts owed by **** to the
recipient at the relevant time, including but not limited to any final wages or vacation. In the event the
recipient fails to fully satisfy any portion of this repayment obligation, **** may refer collection to a
collection agency, and the recipient shall then be responsible for all fees incurred by **** in connection
with such collection, including any attorneys' fees and court costs.
9. The terms of this award shall not be considered a contract or guarantee of employment for a definite period.
Either the recipient or **** may terminate the relationship for any reason at any time with or without
notice.
10. It is the recipient's responsibility to keep **** informed of any changes in his or her student status and
any changes in his or her address.
11. If any of the foregoing provisions is held unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall be enforceable.
12. No delay on the part of **** in exercising its rights shall operate as a waiver by **** or operate as
a release of recipient's obligations.

1q9b0p,0,2013-11-09,[Need Advice] Will Studying Abroad to Become Fluent in a Language or Staying with Current Internship in Awesome Company Help More,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1q9b0p/need_advice_will_studying_abroad_to_become_fluent/,"I'm in a bit of a pickle (a good one, but it's still a weird situation.) 


I've had 3 internships at very prestigious places (2 semester-long part-time, 1 summer full-time, 2 paid) and 2 part-time jobs in related fields (each lasting a year) over the course of my undergraduate career and as I finish the first semester of my junior year I'm starting to panic about jobs.  My major is pretty much useless on its own (political science with a focus on international relations), and after a year and a half of academic research with a prof at my school I know that I don't want to do academia, and after a semester at a think tank I also know that it's not for me.  I like research, just not think tanks or academia.  I've been doing a lot more business and PR related things in my most-recent internships, and started looking at doing PR or consulting.  I landed a paid internship at an incredible company (think among the top 5 firms) that has PR and consulting divisions.  I'm at least finishing up my fall semester with them.  


My dilemma is that I know that this company has connections that I can use to extend my time here in the spring semester (still paid) and even the summer (also still paid), but I also really wanted to do a language immersion program in the spring of my junior year (this spring).  This is my last shot to study abroad before senior year, and the language I'm taking is sufficiently exotic/in-demand enough that it's been a HUGE factor in getting my foot in the door for most of these places.  However, by staying with this company I can have paid internships for the rest of my time in college, and will very likely be offered a job when I graduate next spring.  


Options:  

*I stick with my current internship and essentially guarantee myself a spring internship in a field that I like with the option to stay in that field or transition to another equally-interesting field for the summer and all next year, becoming employed full-time next spring

*I opt to go abroad and still try to leverage the position so I can intern with them in the summer and all next year


I'm just terrified that if I bring the second option up to my supervisor they'll reject it because I'll be gone for a semester and people will be dying to fill that position.  They really are happy with my work and have said nothing but positive things, but I need to have this conversation with them soon before it's too late.  I feel like I'm being asked to predict how much fluency in this language will help me in the future vs. how much this company will help me, and I am totally lost.


TL;DR: I have a ton of great internships, found the best one so far at a company I really like with crazy growth potential, but am trying to see if I should ask to leave for a semester to become fluent in a critical-need language and try to come back, or stay where I am and guarantee myself paid/prestigious internships from now until graduation.

First, how essential is research experience for being accepted? I expect to graduate with about a 3.4 gpa, so it's not bad but not anything spectacular. Since I am undecided about grad school and work part time for the company I mentioned earlier, pursuing research would require me to give up my job. I am learning so much with this company and making good money, so I really want to know, how badly would it hurt me if I decided to apply to graduate school with no research experience? 

Second of all, how difficult would it be for me to decide to apply to a grad school after a couple years in the industry, if I decided I wanted more education? This question is more about being accepted, I am not too concerned about making the transition back into being a student.

1qbmu5,8,2013-11-10,Jr. Sysadmin here with a few questions,XGXA,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1qbmu5/jr_sysadmin_here_with_a_few_questions/,"Hello everyone,

I am an 18 year old Jr. sysadmin, I currently work as the IT Admin for a small SMT machining company that is beginning to expand. This past month I have completely redesigned the companies network. Before they worked off of a workgroup with a 2003 small business server, this got them by but they were lacking many things. The old IT admin had no idea what he was doing, I asked him if he ever had plans to implement Active Directory and I just got a ""What is Active Directory"". Anyways I was hoping that I could explain what I have done so far and see if this meets /r/sysadmin's requirements.

Questions are at the bottom!

The first thing I had done was purchased a R720 with dual E5-2620's, 96GB of RAM, RAID Controller, 8 1TB Drives, and Dual Power supplies. As the company plans to expand to another country I wanted to make sure that I met any future needs. I built 7 of the HDDS into a RAID 5 array for VM's to sit on and the other drive to no RAID for the Datacenter Version of Windows Server 2012 for running the Hyper-V Server. After doing a lot of research the likely hood of the one drive failing was very minimal and with good backups it wasn't worth wasting more space in the array. 

Then I purchased a range of Cisco SPA502G, SPA504G, and SPA525G2 Phones as replacements for the 10 year old NEC phone system that still ran on a hardware PBX.

After this I needed a switch, firewall, and router to handle the network side of things. I ended up choosing a Cisco SG300-28P (which was a mistake now but I will explain later) and a Sophos firewall/router combo that will run on a R320. I set up the network with 8 VLANS: 

10 - Computer 
20 - Internal WiFi 
30 -  Employee WiFi 
40 - Device WiFi (For tablets that need access to internal services but not the the internet) 
50 - Machine (For the SMT machines) 
200 - Server 
220 - Phones 
230 - Guest WiFi 

I have the Sophos trunked into the switch and all the ports set to Access VLAN 10, if a phone is connected Smartport takes over and selects 220 for the phone and 10 for the PC port. The R720 connects over a trunked port to the switch and the VM’s are connected via access 200 which is determined by the Hyper-V Network.

We have a Meraki AP that handles the different WLANS but I am hoping to get some Ubiquity AP’s in the building to help with the network load but after spending a lot on server, switches, and phones I am thinking I might wait a little bit. 

For the server side of things I have completed my basic setup of Active Directory and built quite a few GPO’s for each OU. The users were given full admin access before so they are a little confused why they can no longer install applications but so far they like having the folder redirection, mapped drives, and printers. They can hop onto a company laptop and walk around without having to email themselves all the stuff they need. I have a bunch of software restrictions in place and locked down users from accessing things like Control Panel. I also have prepared for Crypto Locker by preventing applications from running out of the temp directory pre a post here. 

I have also setup SCCM and have been working closely with a guy that I intern with at my school district, I am hoping to be able to push out all of the software that the computers need. I hope to be able to fully manage all computer and Windows 8 Embedded thin clients in the future using SCCM.

Over this last weekend I began and finished the install of Lync 2013 and push the clients to all users on the network using a MSI GPO, it was slow but now the office has ICM, I had to run a bunch of PowerShell scripts to scrub AD for the users that I wanted seeing as you cannot add groups to Lync. 

If anyone has some good install documentation for Dynamics 2013 I would really appreciate it, we are moving away from the terrible world of BusinessWorks and into the amazing world of Dynamics! 

The file server hosts all of the shared resources and home folders from folder redirection, I allocated the VM 1.5 TB’s of space but I am thinking that I might expand that to 2 TB as every employee will be receiving a thin client at their station and I don’t want the users to fill up local storage on the Terminal Server. 

I finished the setup and deployment of our 3CX phone server; this one was a really big pain. I highly recommend using 3CX for its manageability and integration with Exchange but there are small details that you have to pay attention to.

DHCP relaying is handled by Sophos, it was much easier than using CLI with a Cisco Switch. I am CCNA certified but who has the time to write all of that?

RRAS and DA were setup easily using windows new remote access tool, I just need to figure out how authentication with NPS works, I used RRAS with 2008R2 and knew how to do it that way. I am sure it is very similar but I haven’t have the time to dedicate looking into it. 

Terminal services with RDS have been setup, I have remote app working I have also prepped to have RD Gateway handle the RDP as an extra step of authentication. I plan on allowing some type of VDI in the future but I think I may need another hardware sever to handle that. 

The Terminal Servers are meant for implementation of thin clients at each employee station to follow circuit boards as they are in their current stage, so employees will be able to scan the bar codes at each station and so that they are being soldered, test, shipped, etc. We are trying to move into a better tracking system, but there is a need for much more hardware then we currently have access to and dealing with the company president of purchasing new hardware is a very difficult topic. This is also why I regret the purchase of the SG300-28P, if we add HP’s PoE Thin Clients to the mix then I will have to configure another switch to handle the traffic when I could have used a SG500- 28p and stacked the new switch when we were ready to implement. I wasn’t told about the employee stations until after I have made all of the purchases, of course now I will have to reconfigure two switches. 

As of right now I am waiting for Comcast, we have just signed a contract with them for 100/20 but we should expect to see double those number for the location that we are at. (I highly doubt it but that's that the Comcast rep told me). We have purchased 5 static IP's with that so that I can separate the IP/Application like RRAS and RDS. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this :)


Questions I have:
1.) Is the network I have setup to complicated? If so, what should I do to simplify it?
2.) Does the main sever have to much stress on it? The CPU usage is only about 2% right now and running at about 40% or RAM Capacity?
3.) Have I take on to much for myself? I know I can handle it but I just don't want this to be a 24/7 Job.
4.) Does anyone have installation documentation for Dynamics 2013? I haven't been able to find any yet.
5.) What kind of thin clients do you recommend? Can I support USB attached devices over a terminal server? or would I need a VM per thin client?

1qadxg,1,2013-11-09,"Employers of Reddit, How Should I Handle my Drug Charge in an Interview?",Throwaway2112313,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qadxg/employers_of_reddit_how_should_i_handle_my_drug/,"I am a senior in college graduating this December with a major in Computer Science. I am an excellent student with good grades, done research, internships, one of which was at a software firm in the city I'm looking for employment in.

Earlier this semester, I was arrested for a small amount of marijuana and a small amount of Adderall, for which I had no prescription. Although I had used it in the past as a study aid, I stopped using it for that the previous year. However, I began to suspect that I had ADHD and purchased the Adderall I was caught with to see if it helped.

Possession of Adderall is a felony. However, my lawyer was able to negotiate a 152.18 deal, where I was found guilty, but *not* convicted. This means that in an interview if asked if I have ever been convicted of a felony, I can say no. The marijuana and paraphernalia charges were dropped.

I want to know how to approach this in an interview. If asked if I was ever convicted of a felony should I just say no, or tell them about the charge? Should I mention the small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia charges as well, even though they were dropped? Any other suggestions you can give about how to handle talking about the entire situation as well would be appreciated.

Bonus Question: How likely is this to show up on a background check at all given the fact I was never convicted of anything?

Thank you for your time."
1qaboq,9,2013-11-09,Interview with Cisco a dissapointment,BobHogan,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1qaboq/interview_with_cisco_a_dissapointment/,"At my university's career fair I spent a lot of time talking with the Cisco representatives because I have a fair amount of networking experience for a freshman. They ended up offering me an interview, and eventually a second interview. 1 day before the second interview I get a phone call from Cisco saying that they were never considering me for the job because I was a freshman. He then continued to say that the interviewer had absolutely no negative comments about me, only praise, and that he would have loved to offer me a job.

I don't know whether I should feel offended or not. They did speak highly of me, but they also told me on the phone call that going into the first interview they knew beforehand, without telling me, that there was no way I was going to get the internship. I feel like they just wasted my time. Whats even more annoying is that I know they have offered internships to HS students in the past, bc my best friend had one last year. 

I'm really ticked because they just wasted my time. I was banking everything on landing this internship this summer (my fault I know) because at the career fair they had all but said that I had the internship due to my experience in networking already. By the time they will even consider me for the internship (I was told they don't accept anyone who is not within 6 months of graduating college, again I know this isn't true bc my friend had an internship in HS) they won't even remember me. 

Should I try to get an internship or co-op with Cisco in the future, or stick with companies that might not waste my time like this?

Edit - I should add that I did go through the Cisco academy course as well as my friend who had the HS internship. And I am, or I guess was, one of the top HS kids in the country in networking and computer repair competitions. And also if it sounds like I am holding a grudge with Cisco, I am sorry for that mis-communication, I do not hold a grudge with Cisco, just merely upset that they let on to hiring me with no intention of doing so."
1qa0ip,11,2013-11-09,Not sure if this is the field for me?,anonoymouspellcheck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qa0ip/not_sure_if_this_is_the_field_for_me/,"I'm a 2nd year working towards my bachelor's in CS (in the US), and, to my horror, I am starting to have second doubts. It's not that I don't like the classes-I do-it's just that I'm afraid I won't like the actual work I'd be doing if I got a job. I enjoy the theoretical stuff-the proofs, the math, the designing graphics or AI algorithms or whatever, the tough programming challenges that really make you think. It's even better if they're open-ended, where your task is to come up with the best solution to a certain problem, given a number of restrictions. 

But I've done some CS projects outside of class, and to be honest, they bore me. I had an internship that was essentially handling a database with a lot of SQL and simple scripting, and it was almost unbearable. I've done some basic web development for a couple of groups on campus, worked on another project that involved lots of debugging and very dry programming, and I have to say I can't see myself doing this stuff as a career. I just realized this might come across as arrogant - I'm not saying this stuff was easy, because it wasn't and there were times I wanted to tear my hair out, just that it doesn't really excite me the way programming usually does.

The issue is, I've never considered the possibility of not liking CS, since it was what I've wanted to study as far back as I can remember. And at this point I've kind of backed myself into the corner of it being a bit too late to switch majors, except maybe to math or electrical engineering. And like I said I really do like most of my CS classes, it's just that I try to picture what I could be doing with my CS skills after graduation that wouldn't make me miserable and I come up blank. (I've considered grad school/going for a PhD, but I'm not a genius and that just seems a bit far-fetched). 

So what should I do? Should I just stick with the CS and be grateful that it will likely get me a steady, decent-paying job? Should I try to switch to something else I may not even like better? Are there more exciting jobs I can possibly get with a CS degree, that will make me feel like I'm working on something meaningful? I'm just confused right now and not quite sure how to proceed.

I used a throwaway account because my parents are helping to pay for my college, and afaik they don't use reddit, but if they found out I was having second thoughts about my major they would not be too happy."

May I ask you guys/gals to look over my CV? Whats your impression about me? Would you call me in for an interview? If not, why?

*At the moment, I sent out around 10 of them, and registered for a big job application website. Had 2 calls for personal interviews. One was a company with a terrible internet resume, the other, I could not attend because I was working. (they promised a recall for thursday, now its sunday and no incoming calls from them...meh)*"

[To Chris: Did you have creative leeway with your character on Everybody Loves Raymond? And who were some of the better people to interact with off of the camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwtdh?context=5)|Hi. They gave me some leeway with the character. Phil Rosenthal was a fan and had my voice down and pretty much knew what I was going to do with the character. We went back and forth on what kind of wig to wear but we were on the same page as far as the character. I loved interacting with Fred Willard and Brad Garrett. The whole cast was great. One of the best times I ever had was going to New Orleans with my family and hanging with Fred and Phil, and Ray and their wives.   - CE.
[Also this is worth a shot but I'm a sophomore at USC and I was wondering if I could get an internship on something you're doing this summer (trying to make my mom proud\). i'll get you coffee and snacks.  Ok bye.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxne7?context=5)|Sure! I guess tweet/DM me with you email? No idea what I'm doing this summer. - JW.
[Hey guys, you're the best.  Any chance of one final Best Show appearance?  I can't wait for PARADISE RISING ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwrhe?context=5)|Thanks!! I was probably going to call in one last time. We're out in LA so I don't think I'll be able to sit in at the studio again. The few times I've gotten to do have been pretty awe-inspiring. Especially listening to The H-Man conquer the first time he was on. - JW.
[Chris, I saw you on Letterman the other night and you killed it as usual. Eagleheart is awesome, and I was wondering if you guys know if this is going to be the final season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxufi?context=5)|Well, we're 44 minutes into this AMA and we have 68 comments, including our own. So yeah, this will probably be the final season. Thanks for watching! -AW.
 |Thanks for saying that about killing on Letterman. Its always easy for me to there because we seem to always fall back into the timing that we had when I used to come on the show once a week. - CE.

[Hey guys, good morning. Big fan of all your work(s\). A few questions. Chris...We met once in a conference room at Starbucks Corporate...Do you remember me? Jason...what's the hardest part of making the show? Andrew, Jason &amp; Chris...Your depiction of the Marshals Service is pretty spot on. How did you achieve this realism? Did you go on any ""ride-along""? What do the Marshals think of the show? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwzxu?context=5)|Are you a Marshal? How can you speak to the show's accuracy?

 |As you know, I have long since retired from Starbucks but I think the company's growth can be directly linked to my tenure as CEO.

[Jason, I'm a big fan of all your work. One of my favorite things you've done is the whole Je Shirt project. Was there something specific that influenced that, and did you map that out ahead of time, or make it up as you went along? It is really one of my favorite things I've ever read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwwa3?context=5)|Thank you very much. It was not at all mapped out ahead of time. One night I had a dumb idea about that original shirt and wondered if I could sell something to the kind of dummies who wear Che parody shirts. I posted it and no one could tell who it was. That was all real. Then I started writing about how I'd invested all of my money in it and it just snowballed organically over the following month. What is true is that I'm a terrible businessman and I did ultimately lose money on it. But no one died. It was the most fun thing I've done. I'm glad you enjoyed it. - JW.
[Chris, do you ever see yourself working on any projects with Adam Resnick again? Cabin Boy and Get A Life are two of my favorite things ever. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwwa3?context=5)|Adam's my best buddy and an incredible writer. We talk everyday and joke around. After Cabin Boy we both got the sense that the industry wasn't looking for another Resnick/Elliott collaboration and we really haven't developed anything together since. Adam consults on Eagleheart as do I. I think one of these days we'll get the nerve up to co write something together again.
[Big fan of the show. Started watching for Chris Elliott, stayed for the awesome show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwx24?context=5)|The Mick, as those of us in the industry call him, was surprisingly available and willing to do it. I had worked with him briefly about 8 years ago on a Triumph the Insult Comic Dog remote which he pretended not to remember.  PS: If you're a fan, you simply must read his autobiography, ""Life is Too Short."" He tells stories about doing live improv at age 2 and other things that definitely really happened. -AW.
[How the hell did you get Mickey Rooney on the the show? And any personal favorite guest star you had on or want to have on the show? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwx24?context=5)|I think we called Mickey Rooney and said the magic words, which are ""double scale"". He was very funny and nice. He declined the teleprompter we offered, and then instead of the lines we wrote, just said a bunch of gibberish and got up to leave. That's why the editing is so Tim and Eric-y on that scene. Our editor that season, Ben Berman (who now directs Comedy Bang Bang) had to piece it together from snippets that resembled the script. - JW.
[If all three of you were stuck and starving on an island, who would get eaten first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwpyv?context=5)|I'm the fattest, so probably me. But only if they had the time to cook me low-and-slow to render out all that fat. Hey, wait a minute! Friday was the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht! How dare you bring up the rendering of Jew fat! Shame on you!!! -AW.
[Chris: What project are you most proud of being a part of? What project are you most ashamed of being a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwui4?context=5)|Hi. Great question. I didn't create Eagleheart, but I'm really proud of it. I think I'm most ashamed of the crap I've done just for a quick buck -- a movie called Speed-Dating comes to mind. - CE.
[Chris- did you at all encourage your daughters to go into comedy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbws2y?context=5)|Hi. I didn't really have to encourage them to go into comedy. They were always funny, and I think we always knew they would go into it. At some point in the process, both Abby and Bridey became more knowledgable about the whole thing than me. I have to ask them whose who nowadays. - CE.
[Chris, what are the chances of you doing something in the vein of Get A Life again?  What was the pitch process for such an unconventional show like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwy2b?context=5)|Well I would say without a doubt that Eagleheart is in the vein of Get A Life. I think it even goes beyond Get a Life and although I didn't create Eagleheart, I'm as proud of it as I am Get A Life. - CE.
[A question for both Chris, Jason and Andrew, are you ticklish? If so where and are your feet ticklish? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbwpju?context=5)|I think I speak for all three of us guys when I say that none of us are ticklish. But I just can't speak for our feet.

[Hello guys, I just want to say that I really love you show, couldn't get over it the first time I saw it, made me a fan immediately.  Now, who came with the idea of making Scatman a villain? is freaking brilliant. Also, I love the Tinselwood episode, who came with that and what was the inspiration for the episode? Did Ben Stiller really smoke from the crack pipe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxzwn?context=5)|Thanks. It's hard to remember who came up with specific stuff. Mostly we just sit in a room and talk until things make sense. I think I was obsessed with Scatman John and we found out about his record full of scat-themed songs and how Scatting can save the world, etc. Tinselwood one was inspired by us wanting to do a 60's-style ""Goes To Hollywood"" episode and do a thing about how in all of these old movies there are really cutesy cameos where stars show up and wink at the camera that must have gone over like gangbusters back then but don't really work when you don't know who these people are. I think there are a bunch in ""Around The World in 80 Days"". The non-Jackie Chan version.
[Chris: Your daughters, Abby and Bridey, are magical on Twitter and the medium could only get better with one more Elliott on board. When can we expect you writing less than 140 characters at a time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxv5r?context=5)|Chris just said ""never"". - JW.
 |Hi. I don't think I have the same kind of magic that my girls do. Everybody says I should Tweet, so I guess I should. I just don't know how to set up a Twitter account. That side of my brain doesn't work. - CE.
[Jason...what's next for you? what are you working on now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxgmi?context=5)|I get so wrapped up in this Eagleheart stuff that I wind up putting a lot on hold while we're doing it. Right now we're still editing Eagleheart. But I have some scripts I've written that I'm excited to see if I still like. And some new ideas. Not sure! - JW.
[Just wanted to say that your scenes in ""Weekend at Bernie's"" were hilarious.  How did they go about having you bury Bernie? Was it a dummy, or was it actually Terry Kiser?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbz8sj?context=5)|It was actually him. I don't know how the man held his breath like that but I saw no dummies on set. They kept telling me to ""jump on his genitals"" when I hopped over him to bury him, which was the first time I'd heard that word and didn't know what they were talking about. I remember they told me that it was really him during the scene in which they dragged him in the water and his body kept hitting buoys and clanging. But I think they were lying to me, because I was seven. - JW.
[Oh, and where is the Season 2 DVD? I'm willing to buy a Volume 1 Blu Ray with the first three seasons as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbx8fm?context=5)|At this point we are mostly trying to drum up support to get a few more seeds on Myspleen. - JW.
[Are there any Orson Welles-like characters from real life that you guys are obsessed with, other than the man himself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbxcce?context=5)|Orson Welles is a perennial source of obsession. Did you read that Jaglom book that just came out? I have a theory that Welles did not know he was recording those conversations. I am more or less positive about this. What do you think? How fascinating a character is Henry Jaglom??? - JW.
[I dont know much about Jaglom, but I have been reading the book and loving it. I gotta agree with your theory though, theres no way Orson knew he was being recorded. Any other great old-fashion entertainer books you reccommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdby7jp?context=5)|Chris recommends the Kitty Kelley Frank Sinatra biography. - JW.
[Who came up with the ultra-violent death punch technique/scene? One of the greatest things I've ever seen.  Edit: thanks for the reply!! I'm glad it came to you in that dream, because it's amazing. Here it is if nobody's seen it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qe72c/we_are_the_cocreators_and_star_of_adult_swims/cdbx4sc?context=5)|Death Punch was mine. As dumb as this sounds, it was a dream I had while we were writing the first season. I woke up thinking of that scene and that it would be funny if an episode started with that and he spent the rest of it dealing with the emotional ramifications of punching someone so hard they explode. Thank you. - JW.

Some specific questions I have are:

Should I use SCCM or Ghost?

Should I do 1 upgrade at a time or multiple?

 - Doing multiple at a time probably will involve working past hours I am available due to being an hourly intern

What tools other than Ghost and SCCM are available?

- Are there tools I can use addition to Ghost or SCCM that will make the process smoother?

My current Calc II professor definitely knows my face, and I have introduced myself to her once during office hours and I'm always asking questions in class despite the fact that I am currently struggling in the class. 

My questions: 

Do all internships require teacher recommendations?

1qhoys,2,2013-11-12,Dealing with Jealousy,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qhoys/dealing_with_jealousy/,"I'm a student in a highly specialized, magnet program for students who are interested in science and mathematics. One of my closest friends, found a passion for computers and programming two years ago. He's been in love with the field (of computer science) since, and spends a ton of time excitedly telling me about what cool thing he's made, or about the awesome opportunities he's received from his hard work. Which is great--as his friend I'm really happy that he's found something he loves to do and that he's being recognized for his talent. 

I found out today that he received an interview from Google for a six month internship somewhere in Europe next year. Of course, I congratulated him but I can't help feeling jealous about his awesome achievements. Sure, I have awards and have done interesting internships myself, but nothing from anywhere as big as Google. Most of my interests lie in biology and medicine, but I've also worked extensively with hardware (tinkering with circuits, programing microcontrollers). I haven't found a way to integrate my interests, and nothing extremely exciting has come out of what I've been doing with my life. 

I hate the feeling of jealousy, especially between him and me. I consider him to be my best friend, and it's extremely difficult to smile at him and mean it with _all_ of my heart when I know how envious I am of what he's been able to achieve. 

Don't get me wrong--I'm aware that accomplishments (especially grand ones like his) take hard work and dedication and hours upon hours of practice. Just...I feel like I've worked equally as hard and perhaps even longer on the things I love, and yet I have nothing to show for it. My jealousy is petty, yeah, and while it's probably not something that will destroy our friendship, I'm still really irritated that I feel this way at all. 
What should I do? How do I deal with jealousy? 

TL;DR I have an epic nerd friend who does ridiculously amazing things, and I'm beginning to feel jealous of all his accomplishments after working so hard with my own and not arriving at anything (or anywhere) substantial. I don't know how to deal with the jealousy.

Lauderdale?,Illhaveanearbeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qgrvm/life_changing_decision_should_i_move_to_houston/,"I recently got offered two paid internship opportunities. One is in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. This company is a huge software consulting firm with over 4000 employees. They are offering $12/hour with a 30 hour limit every week to learn iOs as a paid intern. Once I learn ios they bring me on full time but could take up to 6 months according to them.

The other opportunity is in Houston, TX. This company is a startup with a product. They are offering $3400 a month as a paid intern for 90 days. Upon this 90 days I will be reviewed to see if I am a good fit for a full time position. 

I am a college graduate with experience in .NET which is the technology the company in Houston uses to manage their product and it is what I am most familiar with. I also live in ft lauderdale currently. So I would have to move to Houston. But at the same time if you do the math in 90 days I will make $10,200 with the Houston company, compared to $3,456 with the Ft. Lauderdale company. Other things to look at is the cost to move and get a new place in Houston. I would be living with parents in Ft lauderdale until I could afford to move out. In houston I would have my own place because I could afford it with the salary they are paying.

I need help or i probably won't graduate.",dmft91,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1qghes/im_burnt_out_suffering_from_cronic_senioritis_or/,"Hello everyone. I'm a senior in Mechanical Aero. Eng. at UF. I just started my 3rd year after transferring from a CC. I'll try to be as direct as i can, but forgive me if i go off on a tangent. My first two semesters at UF went well, enough so that i was invited to a ME honor society (net 3.5gpa). From there my grades have just gone downhill. I'm not really sure why, but i can't ever get myself to proactively study anymore. I'm constantly cramming and doing projects the day before their due. I don't think that it's acceptable, really, and i'm fearing even making passing grades this semester. It even makes me feel bad that i'm a chair in the aforementioned honor society since my gpa is now a measly 2.83. Due to this gpa, pretty much any of the jobs that i'd consider my ""dream jobs"" are going to be out of the question immediately after graduation (ie unless i start somewhere else and work my way up), and because of the classes i still need i'm too early to look for a job, but too late/under-qualified for a good internship. I'm currently working as a civil engineering aid (dad got me a foot in the door, and it's pretty decent pay), but that really won't help me out a lot when i'm looking for MAE jobs down the road, and i've been here for 3 years it feels like i should give this position to someone who could take better advantage of it. (Side note: working on getting a job in the astronomy lab on campus, but progress is very slow with on-campus funding). I guess in total, i just feel burnt out. My drive is gone. My self-discipline to make myself study: a distant memory. So what do i do? How do i reconcile my gpa and stay motivated? Another thing is a lot of my classmates that aren't doing the dual major (either aero only or mech only) are graduating this semester, but since i wanted the dual major, and due to prereqs. and certain classes being offered only certain semesters, i likely won't graduated until Spring '15  (15 hours are all i lack for graduation, would be 9 less if only ME). I'm so sick of school i don't know if i can make it that much longer. Plus, if something doesn't change my GPA will keep dropping (especially since i'm just now getting into the classes that really matter, for example i thought i wanted to work on propulsion systems as a career, but i got a C in the class which can't look good to employers), and i won't get any job much less a shot at my dream jobs. I have hardly any extracurriculars too, it seems like there's hardly ever any time for them if i take any time to relax after classes. I was considering, with the extra time to graduation either declaring a minor or taking a lot of ""gpa padding"" classes to get above a 3.0 again (i've probably already lost the 100% BF, had to bring my gpa above a 3.0 this semester or it'd stay at 75% from here on out, and i doubt i succeeded). All this on top of all the other stressors going on in my life: mom being foreclosed on (i live with her), general money issues/worries, trying to still work as much as i can, car and motorcycle in need of repairs/maintence, haven't been to the gym in months, my recent luck with females has been pretty horrendous, trying to spend time with family as my parents are old enough to be my grandparents and may not be long for this world in all honesty, going through an existential crisis about what all this is worth, seeing people i know who decided not to go to college making good wages and having the time of their life, seeing people in other majors and how easy they have it, the list goes on. I think i've lost myself at this point, so i should probably stop here... 
TL;DR: I think i'm burnt out; my gpa has taken a hit (2.83 current, likely to decrease this semester) and i'm afraid i won't be able to get a decent job; and i don't know how to stay motivated to get it back up with the little remaining time i have (15 hours are all i lack for graduation)"

However, when it comes to actual skills for a job I just don't feel qualified. Most of my coding gets done in JAVA or C++ and I feel like most of my coding abilities have been developed outside of the classroom. It seems to me that I could be literally at this exact skill level without having been to college at all.

I've tried to do some learning online, I've completed every track at http://www.codecademy.com/, I've done several other similar websites.

I Graduated with a BSEE in May. In June I started an internship at a T&amp;D Co-op which will last for just over 6 months (currently employed). I really like the company and my co-workers, however I have a desire to move *towards* the generation side of power. Ideally working on managing energy sources and tying them into the grid, although the job description is not *as* important to me as working for a company that actually produces power (provided the job is still in the power engineering area). It may sound naive, but philosophically I just want to work at the beginning of the supply chain. 


Anyways, the Coop I work for has offered me a full-time power engineering position. Here are some things I need to consider:

* They will pay for continuing education, but only the cost of in-state tuition. I live over 2.5 hours away from the nearest school which would offer an MS in Power, and that school may not even be offering it next year. 

* If I choose this, I need to work at the company a year after completing the degree.

* If I choose distance learning, it will still cost me a lot- at least the amount **over** an in-state tuition and maybe no reimbursement at all.

* I have not taken my FE, and have not signed up yet (hesitant in case I will be moving)

* I am doing well financially (no debt and a few thousand bucks)

* I am willing to move pretty much anywhere to work.

* I have applications ready for a few rural coops (with generation) and large utilities, sending out over the next few days.


SO...
I would like some of you (power engineers or similar) to share your opinions, and answer any questions that you can.


1. What do you do at your job (or past job)?

2. Co-op or normal utility?  Generation or just T&amp;D?  Big or small (in your opinion)?

3. How long have you been working there?

4. What do you like about it?

5. If I were to accept a position at the company, and then get an offer elsewhere in the next 6 months/year, do you think the company would see it as sleazy or disrespectful for me to quit so soon?

6. Do you know of good distance learning MS programs for Power engineering, or something else that might suit my situation?

7. General advice for me?

Thanks so much"
1qf7a8,2,2013-11-11,Interning during school?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1qf7a8/interning_during_school/,"Hey guys,

I'm a junior in computer engineering and I went to my schools career fair a few weeks ago.  Since then, I've had seven different places contact me about internships.  Two of them have offered me intern positions that would start at beginning of next term (1st week of January), and last 10 weeks (the duration of the term).  The intern positions would be 20 hours a week and would be about 10 minutes away from campus (which is already 30 minutes away from my house).  During the next term I will be taking three classes: CS333 - Operating systems, ECE372 - Embedded Systems and MTH356 - Discrete math.  Both the CS and the ECE class have 3 hour labs and the schedule will be 13 credit/hours total.

For other people here that have interned while going to school, how do-able is it?  Up until now, I've just worked at FedEx Ground in the summers and focused solely on school during school.  I have a 3.87 GPA and since I started school, I pretty much do school for 10 weeks straight until a term ends.  My free time is almost non existent, save for a few hours on Saturday and Sunday.  During the week, all I do is school.

Is there any way to tell them that I won't know if I can do it until I start the term?  Because I honestly won't know.  Some terms in the past have been pretty easy and I could have done something else, and other terms (like the current one I'm in), there would be no way without blowing off school."
1qko3k,6,2013-11-13,I want to get into financial engineering.,poor_as_heck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qko3k/i_want_to_get_into_financial_engineering/,"My dream job is to work in one of the trading houses such as Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, etc.  I am currently a sophomore in Computer Science, considering a second major in either Applied Math or Computational Statistics.  However, math is not my strong suit, so most likely it will be Computational Statistics.  I am also open to the idea of minoring in math or stats.  

In terms of classes, I have finished calculus, finishing up linear algebra this quarter.  I know differential equations is important to financial engineering; I may take that in the spring.  Currently in an assembly class, will be taking data structures next quarter.  I have taken macroeconomics and might be taking microecon next quarter.  I have a 3.3 GPA; however, this includes a D- I unfortunately received in calc 4, which I am retaking (replaces the grade).  It should rise to at least 3.5 by next quarter.  I know I need to drastically improve my GPA to increase my chances of getting into a good grad school.  

Other than getting a strong GPA, what else can help me get into a top financial engineering program?  Would any kind of CS related internships be good?  Also, my university offers various tracks for CS: databases and data management, graphics and visualization, networking, security and cryptography, systems and software engineering.  Which one of these would be most useful towards my (dream) career?  What else can I do to get my dream job?"
1qkef2,0,2013-11-13,"Any careers you can think of that involve user experience, design, or HCI-related concepts?",over1imit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qkef2/any_careers_you_can_think_of_that_involve_user/,"Hi guys!

So I've been really interested in Human Computer Interaction for years; I have yet to take the higher level HCI courses, but I am currently taking the intro HCI course and have learned a few design methods and user testing, etc.

Over the summer I worked at the HCI lab in my school, focusing on Data Visualization. I used Processing &amp; Java, which was interesting. In my intro HCI course, our group is creating a library cataloging system in C#, utilizing Expression Blend and Visual Studio. It's pretty fun so far, and I like it a lot more than my summer project.

At the moment, I am interested in the design aspects of HCI; I definitely want to create user friendly software, contribute to projects that help others, and make things pretty and easy to use. I am wondering what kind of jobs I can find, internships or job titles, that I should look out for. Companies like IDEO and start-ups (good culture, great ideas and products) interest me the most.

I am not the most technical person in the world, due to lack of practice, but coding is very interesting to me. At the moment I just feel like I'll get a sub-par job that does menial work, or end up being a grunt worker coding 8 hours a day. I am involved in a lot of extra-curricular activities (mainly the Computer Science Undergraduate Society) and believe my people, administrative and artistic skill outweigh my technical skills. I understand that becoming a better programmer involves practice, so I hope when I have more free time I can focus on individual projects and getting better at using different languages.

Sorry this post was long...but any suggestions or help would be really appreciated!

**tldr; I'm not the most technical CS student, but am interested in designing user-friendly and beautiful software. What careers, job titles or internships should I look for?**"
1qkd74,1,2013-11-13,[Needs Advice] Hedging Bets,The_Right_People,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1qkd74/needs_advice_hedging_bets/,"Hello. Long time lurker. First time poster.

I heard on the radio Big Company was accepting applications for a part-time position well out of my chosen field. I applied. I made it through the initial cull, pre-screen interview, and interview. I received a job offer today about an hour ago.  It offers 14k / year for 20hr weeks and evening hours.  It is permanent, not seasonal.  Plenty of room for growth after i ""grow accustom to the workplace"" - i read this as they want me to wait a year b4 i pursue a promotion from my part time position to a full time position.  The job does not begin until mid December.  There is about a month between now and my showing up for my first day of work.

However, on Monday, a contact within my limited network sent me a posting for a position with Unknown Company, if not related then at least tangentially related to my chosen field.  It *will* require use of my degree, whereas the part time position will not.  Not having heard back from Big Company yet, I of course enthusiastically applied yesterday to the position. I asked my contact some questions and sent her a thank you note. From my questions, I know the initial candidate pool is small, about a dozen people.  Hopefully she passes along my enthusiasm to Unknown Company.  While salary details are unknown, salary.com lists the median salary for the position as about 50k a year, full time and normal office hours. The posting my contact sent me was simply a request for resumes interested in X position.  The employer at the moment wants to remain anonymous, hence Unknown Company.  The email was sent at noon Monday and requested resumes by noon Tuesday.  My contact says they're looking to ""act fast"" and I can see a sense of urgency here. 

Fast forward to today.  I now have an offer with a clock on it from Big Company.  I have until tomorrow to call with my acceptance of their offer.  I am obviously torn about this decision.  I am very grateful for the offer from Big Company for Part Time position. I can no doubt start a career here.  Even the part time salary would help alleviate the stress my partner is under from supporting us.  Student loans start coming due in 2 weeks roughly.  But there's that specter of a 50k full time job in my field, using my degree out there. 

In my young life, I am fortunate enough to have this be the most difficult career decision to make.  I would greatly appreciate any input /r/jobs might have to guide me through this decision. These are my options as i see them.  

1. ~~Accept the part time offer with Big Company. Pass on pursuing the full time job within my field with Unknown Company. Big Company is willing to commit to me, I should commit to them. My word is my bond, all that jazz.~~
2. ~~Pass on the part time offer with Big Company.  Apply for other jobs while waiting to hear back from Unknown Company.  Clearer conscience, yes, but dicey with bills about to start really piling up and an offer of 14k / 20 hr weeks on the table.~~
3. **Accept the part time offer with Big Company.  Continue to pursue the full time 50k / year job with Unknown Company during the one month period prior to work actually starting with Big Company.  This is the grey area I'm not as sure of. **

i've never actually held a full time job before - fortunate i know. I was a student until this past May.  Summer internships sure but the rules to the whole ""workplace survival of the fittest"" are more or less elusive to me at this time in my career.  If this is a no brainer to go with option 3 then please scream it from the rooftops.  Wow it really helped writing all of this out.

TL;DR An offer on the table for part time gig, which doesnt use my degree. Also, pursuing a full time gig which does use my degree. Do I accept part time offer and continue to pursue full-time position during the month before part-time job starts?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I just wanted to ask what advice you'd have for someone fairly recently diagnosed with depression &amp; general anxiety disorder.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddrcw?context=5)|I'm writing out an epically long reply to answer all of your questions, so don't be surprised if you don't see it for a little bit!! I have a 10:00 in 9minutes so I'll have to slip away once they show :-D but I did want to acknowledge that I read your message and I'm working on the reply!
[Background: Born/raised in US. I used to live in Tokyo and got some appalling mental health care for my depression while there. Took too many meds (Paxil, benzos, Xanax, sleeping pills, etc.\) and didn't care much for my doctor. Didn't have access to an affordable English-speaking therapist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddrcw?context=5)|Thank you for providing some background info!! I also suffer from depression and generalized anxiety myself (lots of pressure when you are a therapist sometimes!) so I understand a bit of what you are going through. It's really frustrating when you don't get very adequate help, regardless of where you are. Starting off in that kind of uncomfortable situation probably didn't feel too good!! :-( For that I apologize. I have had many clients who have transferred from other therapists that didn't really work very hard to help them, and for that these clients have years of therapy but haven't gotten any better (some worse!).
[I suppose the essential question is: how do I keep the progress I've made, or even continue making progress, on my own? Do you have any advice? Should I tell people at work about it? I haven't yet, for fear of social stigma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddrcw?context=5)|I decided to be a social worker because I am an abuse surviver and I have always wanted to give back in some way! We're called ""wounded healers"". I find that I am more able to help some of my clients because I can comprehend a bit of what they are going through, however everyone has a different story and everyone reacts differently!
[ a general question: how did you get into your line of work? What kind of schooling was necessary? Without violating your patients' privacy, can you tell us any interesting stories, or perhaps common themes you see amongst patients with similar issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddrcw?context=5)|I will be back in a bit to answer the other ones I didn't get to! Thanks for some awesome questions!
[Thanks if you've taken the time to read all this. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddrcw?context=5)| 
[Are you a recovering addict? If not, do you think that limits your ability to effective help substance abusers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddgdo?context=5)|I've, fortunately, never had an addiction problem. I have tried and done recreational drugs in my past. I also suffer from chronic illness (endometriosis, adenomyosis, and fibromyalgia as a result of chemo treatment), so I have to admit that I sometimes smoke marijuana in order to cope with the constant pain that I am in. I also have spent a fair share of my life going to and loving music festivals. Due to this I have an inside know of drug use, in many different forms.
 |Sometimes I do feel that not having an addiction problem in my life has limited my ability to be effective in substance treatment. I will never be able to comprehend what it is like to be on the brink of life and death due to a substance, or to even feel like I couldn't live without a substance. Sometimes it's easier for me to view the substance use disorder as a part of mental illness, and treat the addictive tendencies, like I would with anxiety, depression or other mental illness. 
[What techniques do you use to help substance abusers? How effective are  they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddgw1?context=5)|I primarily use CBT and motivational interviewing. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is goal oriented and works with reframing negative thoughts to positive ones. Much of the work that is done is developing healthy coping mechanisms, promoting sobriety, discovering triggers, and long term planning, just to name a few. I also suggest most of my clients take part in 2 groups a week and an individual, determining how close they are to their last use and how high their relapse rate is. Many of my SA clients are court mandated to come to treatment, so they also are required to attend AA or NA meetings every day (90 meetings in 90 days) as well as obtain a sponsor and go to drug court or alcohol court each week. 
[For your court-ordered clients, do you have to pee test them as part of the therapy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddu4k?context=5)|Yes, I am able to test them at random. However, it's not just for court mandated clients, it's across the board.
[What advice do you have if one thinks their roommate is suffering from depression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddddku?context=5)|Be understanding when your roommate doesn't want to go out and be social, or have outings. For some people with depression, especially if they are a young adult, many people get the impression that if they got out and just did things, that it would make then happier. Most times going out and doing things makes them feel even more uncomfortable and sometimes, even anxious.
 |Another suggestion I have is to let your roommate know you are there for them, regardless, and that they are not alone. While it can be hard to live with someone with mental illness, (for both parties), just knowing that someone cares about them really helps. I suggest reading what Hyperbole and a half says about depression in her recent blog entries. It helps to put a good perspective of what it is like living with depression.
[I guess i just want advice. How do i help my parents understand, how do i help my little brother, and what signs should i look for if suicide is on his mind? Thats what im worried about..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddf6f2?context=5)|With suicide, it's really hard to say. Those with bipolar disorder can experience such extreme highs and lows that they could feel like they want to harm/kill themselves, and then an hour later feel completely fine. One big thing to look out for is if he goes through a period of extreme depression, then suddenly looks happy and very calm and relaxed, more so than usual. This usually means that a plan may have been established. Never be afraid to ask.
[Thanks for the advice. We all talked about going together and I hope that this comment from you will help put that into motion. Im going to show them your response tonight. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddlhd8?context=5)|I'm glad you care so much about your brother! It's really encouraging! I always feel so sad when family members aren't supportive!
[My roommate often gets blackout drunk and goes into extreme depression. He often takes to twitter to voice his thoughts of his worthlessness or even sometimes saying he wants to commit suicide. Myself and my other roommates often stay up late on friday and saturday nights comforting him until he falls asleep. When we try to confront him when he is sober he often says he doesn't remember us talking to him and deletes the tweets right away in the morning. This has been ongoing for over 2 years. What do you suggest we do to help him?  Tl;dr: Roommate depressed when drunk, but not when he's sober. How do we help him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdde2j7?context=5)|You guys need to tell him, point blank that you don't support him drinking. If you have a depressive disorder, drinking won't help (it it a depressive). Suggest that you won't drink (at least around him), feeling left out by not being allowed to drink when others are makes the pressure TO drink much stronger. He also sounds like he has some other stuff going on as well. As for the suicidal thoughts, I would most certainly address those right away. Assess where he is when he is sober. I always have a saying, drug words are sober thoughts.
[Where did you get your degrees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddcrjs?context=5)|I got my BSW at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania  I am almost done with my Masters Degree in Social Work through Temple University. I was accepted into an Advanced Standing Program, which basically let me complete my degree in 18 months (I haven't had a break from classes since I started!!). My last class is on December 7th, I will, a week after that, be able to use my credentials of MSW. Both great schools for social work!!
[Cool. Good luck with your Masters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddd1zv?context=5)|Thank you!! I'm so happy to almost be done, it's been a long, long road!
[I have a job that involves getting medical records for insurance companies from mental health doctors. While I understand you are busy and do all of your own office work, why will some professionals ignore my calls, faxes, emails, mail, etc. for MONTHS before helping out. Their clients need these records for their insurance policies and a lot of clients get screwed repeatedly by this kind of unprofessionalism. Why does this happen so often?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddhcp4?context=5)|:-( this is the most frustrating part of the career. We have a lot of paperwork to do (as a matter of fact, I'm neglecting some right now! None of which are correspondence related, however). I, personally, tend to get any kind of faxing, phone calling or letter sending done first free moment I have, if I have it. The sad part is, we don't always have the time. I'm scheduled in my office today 9am-9pm, and I have clients pretty much every hour today with the exception of my two DNS hours (do not schedule- for getting paperwork done), and even that time isn't always enough time to get things done. I apologize you are experiencing this frustration. This is mostly due to either a lazy therapist, or an overworked one.
[Why not see fewer patients and tend to the ones you see more carefully? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddm7nv?context=5)|I wish this were an option :-( it's not really up to us how many clients we have and don't have. If the agency sees an availability, they will schedule you. In the city I live in, we have a VERY LONG waiting list for treatment, so it is essential that we fill all of the available time we have so that people are getting treatment and not waiting in limbo.
[Are you taught to act as this social worker did in this situation? - Link to www.reddit.com.  How? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddgf0v?context=5)|Clients get frustrated from time to time over many different issues. How that therapist handled it was not 100 percent appropriate. They should have first assessed what was making you so elevated and allowed you to get out the anger that you needed to and worked you through it, instead of making you feel that you were a criminal and a danger to society. How I would have handled it was by keeping calm and reminding you that, while it is okay to be frustrated, there are better outlets for frustration. First we would have talked about the initial trigger of the anger/frustration.
[I suspect that my sister may have some severe anxiety problems (late 30s, never had any friends or a boyfriend, can't go to a movie or coffee shop, etc. by herself\). I would love to just shrug if off and say it's her business, but the problem is that she takes advantage of my parents -- they even orchestrated the purchase of a house for her. Are there any techniques I can use to talk my sister into getting therapy? Are there any gentle phrases I can use with my parents to convince them that they are not helping her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddf55z?context=5)|Being gentle, really won't help sometimes. Ask if you can hold a family meeting and address your concerns for your sisters mental health, as well as your parents for being co-dependant and not allowing her to be able to be independent. My question is, is she able to hold a job? Is the anxiety interfering with her every day life? Social anxiety can be very hard to live with, but sometimes it can also be a sign of a different kind of issue.
[Have you ever had to deal with compulsive disorders? (Like trichotillomania or dermotillomania?\) They aren't very widely recognized, but I hope that is changing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdded4g?context=5)|Yes! I recently got a male client with compulsive shopping! Of course I also have a large number of OCD clients as well (some of which are effects of another mental illness). I agree with you on how unrecognized it is! When the referral come in for the compulsive shopping, other therapists balked at the thought of working with him because they didn't know what to do. That made me feel really bad for the gentleman in question!
[What do you do when medication is the best treatment for a patient, but the patient won't take their medication?  My aunt is in her 60s, she's been quite depressed for a while and for the past few years has been getting a little more weird--she'll talk about how she feels like people are always watching her, or how there might be people in mirrors, she's also been losing her temper a lot more often for reasons that are really insignificant. I have no idea what her official diagnosis is, but she was referred to a therapist/psychologist and was prescribed medication.  The problem is, she won't take the meds or meet with the therapist. She's a super focused on health and living naturally, which may be a part of her mental disorder, so she's convinced that she doesn't need treatment and that it's bad for her.  My family is concerned about how her thoughts and behavior have been getting worse, but we have no idea what to do. I mean, you can't force someone to take their medication, right? What are our options?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddocc8?context=5)|You can't force someone to take their medication :-( No matter how much you want the person to go into treatment, if they don't want to you can't force them. Depending on where you live and how severe her mental illness is, you can have her admitted to a hospital for a period of time to be under observation. Those are your only real options at this point. You could try a family intervention and tell her why you all feel that she needs treatment, but that doesn't always work either.
[Not sure if I'm too late. I'm graduating with a BA in Psychology this May, and will most likely go on to get a MSW or PsyD. However, I do want to take some time and work instead of going right to full time classes. I am very interested in going into the type of work you are currently doing! How did you end up getting your first job after undergrad? Do you think I would be able to get a job in this field with a BA in Psych? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddfy7u?context=5)|I actually got my job because I had interned for the clinic I work for now in my graduate level internship. I struggled for a year after graduating with my BSW to find a degree due to lack of experience! The reason I got my job was due to the fact that, once I completed my internship, a supervisor got a client that I had transferred over to her, and was very happy with the work that I had done. I was very lucky! I would suggest going straight through with schooling, though expect to feel a bit of a burn out (I haven't had a break yet!). Don't be discouraged if you find something small at the start, work your way up!! Most social workers bounce from job to job the first couple of years before they find that dream job, I was just lucky to be placed at an awesome place for my internship!
[How do I know if I should see a mental health care professional to see if I have clinical depression.  I have a suspicion that I might.  Also - how do I find a good one? And what type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddeuep?context=5)|Regardless if you are depressed or not, everyone could benefit from mental health therapy! We're all struggling with something of some kind. If you feel that your depression is interfering with your ability to live your daily life, then I think you would most certainly benefit from counseling!
[My father-in-law recently got laid off from his job for which he worked 35 years and earned millions for said company.  There was no solid reason to why he was fired, though..  He has been drinking ever since (it happened last july\) and has had different stress related panic attacks (last night was the second time an ambulance had to show up...\) and refuses specialists to help him with his depression and obvious alcoholism.. About 5 bottles of wine and about 2 bottles of whiskey a day..  My question is.. Trying to be understanding or getting mad at him haven't worked, what can my boyfriend, my mother-in-law and I do to get through to him? Thank you so much in advance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddegw3?context=5)|A few different suggestions would be to have an intervention. Interventions should always be moderated by a professional, and it's hard to find places today that will follow through with an intervention. If you cannot find a professional, hold a family meeting with each of you expressing your concerns. Be careful to not attack him in any way shape or form, or to raise to his level if he gets upset or defensive. If none of this works, you all have to decide what you need to do to make sure you aren't feeding into his addiction. The sad part of life is, we can't force someone to make change. If you are honest and open with him about how you feel, he may decide that it's something he should follow through with.
[What was the creepiest thing that any patient has ever said to you? A good friend of mine has a grandmother who worked in a psychiatric ward for a large part of her life, and when pregnant a patient could smell the fear on her, and kicked her directly in the stomach. Very scary. Any incidents like this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddwrg9?context=5)|Me: ""Do you believe that someone is out to get you?"" former client: ""The emperor of China. I have some of his things.""
[Nooo don't bother! You've given me great advice, I'll just google and find the answer i'm looking for :\) I just can't thank you enough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddmivr?context=5)|Very welcomeee! Hope it helps! Keep me updated!
[How do you deal with a roommate with anxiety? I'm never sure what's the most supportive thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddnc1h?context=5)|Patience is the best thing when it comes to a roommate with anxiety. Remember that their anxiety can be triggered by a number of different things and that they have no control over it. If you feel that they are having a panic attack, ask them what you can do to help. Have them take deep breaths with you, at the same time, (slowly) in through your nose out through your mouth. Having someone with them (if they want it) during this time to help direct their thoughts and allow them to slow down those racing thoughts and calm down will mean the world to them.
[Do you believe in the existence of evil (not in a religious sense\), or do you think all bad people have an underlying medical issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddf3qi?context=5)|I believe that all bad people have an underlying medical issue. Even though I might not agree with some of what my clients have done (pedophile is something I struggle with), I still believe that every person is deserving of help regardless of what they are going through or what their story is, to prevent them from hurting themselves or even others.
[While I agree every person deserves help, I believe that some people are beyond the point of working through their issues. Be it a product of environmental influences or a mental breakdown immediately or over time these people embody evil and malice and should be dealt with accordingly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddh2qq?context=5)|Some people's mental illness is really so far gone that, you are right, they appear that they embody evil. Most serial killers have some kind of severe mental illness. This is why catching mental illness early on becomes very important. 
[How does that inform your decisions as a professional? Would you equate giving mental aid to someone convicted multiple times on counts of pedophilia or murder with chemo for a dying cancer patient; ultimately it doesn't make much of a difference. (thank you for the replies btw\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddm777?context=5)|I try not to base an opinion from the start. I'm lucky, in my field that I get such a wide population with a wide range of different things going on, that it's never the same. I put just as much energy into the pedophile as I do the cancer patient. However, if the pedophile isn't participating in treatment (many don't), then I admit that I have a bit more of an opinion of the kind of person they are.
[Have you ever dealt with D.I.D ? What is your opinion on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddqbuk?context=5)|Not yet, although I do suspect with one. My opinion of it is that I think it is amazing what the human brain is capable of. 
[What is the most fucked up mental you've ever had?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdea7he?context=5)|I can't really specify too much information just because of my code of ethics, but I did have a former client who thought the emperor of China was out to get him because he had some of his things. He as also on a lot of drugs at the time, but is doing much better these days.
[What is the typical course of treatment usually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddvshl?context=5)|There really isn't a lot of major treatment out there yet for it, just a lot of guesses and good tries. There is some proof that CBT can possibly help with DID. I would suggest that the person keep a video journal or written journal of each personality. Sometimes it's not about making the other identities leave, as it is to co-exsist with them. 
[Sorry I can't word this better - how often do you encounter cases wherein people have mental illness ""hypochondria"" (that is, they self-diagnose themselves as having one psychological condition or another\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddjd3j?context=5)|1) Often. With the availability of online diagnosis, many people will have a problem (some MH symptoms intertwine) and look for advice online instead of going to a professional. Many times I get people with severe depression that diagnose themselves as bipolar, and are completely convinced my professional opinion isn't right.
[How does one differentiate seasonal affective disorder vs the kind of depression that crops up every now and then when one remembers their issues? Is it also right to assume that SAD makes one zoom in on said issues, or is it that SAD is a more ""general feeling of depression"" kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddjd3j?context=5)|2) at first for me, it was hard. I started to take important notes of when they were feeling depressed. Key words like ""I go through periods of sadness, and then it's not an issue"" lead me to believe it's seasonal. SAD is more a general feeling of depression, but sometimes it can manifest differently. I know some people with seasonal anxiety. The brian can be amazing how it works!!
[How do you feel about the insurance system and mental health? Especially regarding minors? Any experience with this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cde0ezu?context=5)|I have to admit, I am not a fan of the insurance system. Most of my clients come without any kind of health care so I work with them to get public assistance (or in some cases SSI) to cover their mental health therapy costs. I'm under the stance that I believe every person should have access to health care, even if they can't afford to.
[What's your view on family practice doctors administering mental health medication? It happens quite often where I live because there aren't many psychiatrists  around (I've only been able to find one, and it take 4-6 months to get an appointment with her\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdddy7k?context=5)|Should NOT be happening, it is unethical and if they don't have the credentials to prescribe medications, it should not be happening, point blank. I make mental health diagnosis, and sometimes even then I feel like I'm stepping out of a weird boundary (I am able to do so, I only recently have had the credentials to do so, so I'm still in the new-ness of diagnosing). What is happening where you live is illegal, at least in my state.
[My parents have grounded me from my car until I'm 18, (7 more months 3 into the punishment now\) for smoking marijuana. What would be the best way to get them to drop the punishment? I've been sober for over a month now and passed drug tests but still they refuse to give it back to me. Also I recently broke up with my girlfriend because I felt she was too controlling, easily angered, too emotional, and uncompromising, but I still care about her and not sure if I made the right choice. In your opinion did I make the right decision? Sorry for the petty questions ha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddhqpk?context=5)|No such thing as a petty question!!
 |Honestly, your parents have the right to punish you. While it can be frustrating when it happens, and as a therapist I also feel that marijuana is much less harmful than other things, the fact is that in most states it is illegal. Bringing into your parents house puts both your parents and you in risk of legal consequences. Your parents are just looking out for you to prevent that. When you are 18 or no longer living under your parents roof, then the only person you're putting at risk for legal danger is yourself, and then you may conceder if this is something you want to do still or not. If addiction runs in your family I would also be careful, while marijuana isn't bad, when addiction is prevalent in the family it can be a stepping stone to other drugs (not always!).
 |I do believe you made the right choice with your ex. No one should ever be in that kind of position where they are made to feel that way. It's understand to morn the relationship (almost like going through the 5 stages of grief!) but know that it won't last and it isn't forever.
[What is your favourite and least favourite clients to work with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddff0c?context=5)|All of my clients are my favorite :-D (honestly, I love my job)
 |Least favorite are those who don't do anything. Therapy can be a two way street, if I'm doing all of the work than it makes it really hard to get anything really accomplished.
 |I also have some clients with very poor hygiene, :-\ we work on that as a part of their treatment plan, but I've learned to start burning candles. 
[I'm in Colorado so it's not that bad. But the extent of the punishment is the thing that sucks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdeobpj?context=5)|I'm sorry, I know it's rough. Some day you'll be on your own, and you'll get to enjoy the lifestyle more. Another option is to just be frank about it with them and be honest about why you think you should be allowed to smoke, to see if they reduce their grounding on you.
[I tried to hang myself about a week and a half ago.  I was almost successful.  I'm trying to get my health insurance in order so I can see a therapist, but what should I do in the mean time?  Also, when I go in for the first therapy session, what's a good place to start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddfoxx?context=5)|I wanted to address this quickly in my break: Most clinics will accept medical benefits, or will work with you to get outside funding. I would call around MH clinics in your area and see what they offer as far as referral and funding sources. Most of my clients are funded through public assistance/medicaid/medicare.
 |As far as where to start, your therapist will generally determine that. Your first two sessions will likely be a lot of paperwork and history, but if you need to address the suicidal thoughts, do so right away so that your therapist is aware. You are also free to message me in the meantime!!
[If you are still answering- how would you feel if a client confessed he/she had feelings for you? I'm assuming you haven't dealt with this yet being new to the field, but if you have how did you deal with it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddo4y0?context=5)|I actually have (and I am still answering, of course!). In this case, two things need to happen. 1) boundaries need to be placed immediately. Let the client know that in no way can you be in a relationship with them, no matter how flattered you are by their admitting.
 |2) you need to get in contact with your supervisor about it. All therapists should have a supervisor. The supervisor will tell you where to go from there. Generally the client is replaced, depending on how well they deal with change.
[In addition to substance abuse, do you deal with porn addiction? What is your opinion on the consumption thereof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddlfq9?context=5)|This is something new to my practice as well! I've had a couple of sex addicts, but yet to have come in contact with porn addiction. I would treat it the same way I treat other addiction (of course with some minor changes!). My opinion of porn consumption is that it is normal! However when it starts to take over your daily life functioning then it is a problem that needs addressed. 
[Do you have any experience with animal-assisted therapy? Im currently a freshman in high school and am interested in a career with therapy animals. Any advice for me, such as classes for later in high school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddxeoa?context=5)|I don't have any experience, personally, but I know many people who benefit greatly from using animal therapy, so I can't offer much advice! If you go on with your educational career in social work or psychology, you can specialize later in animal-assessed therapy. 
[Have you ever had someone with borderline personality disorder in treatment? If so, what's your thoughts about people with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddu80e?context=5)|Yes I have! Borderline personality disorder is really a tough disorder. They are constantly at war with themselves, and even others around them. I'm always doing research on this, because my borderlines are going to be long term care, and they understand that. 
[My fiance and I agree she might have some anxiety issues, especially if it involves trying new things, such as new foods, or going to new places.  What are some things I can do to help her? Or what steps could we take to help address this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddgoh1?context=5)|The biggest thing you can do is be understanding that anxiety is a hard thing to live with, and to have patience. Let her try new things slowly and at her comfort level so that it doesn't trigger severe anxiety as a result.
[Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply! I will be calling tomorrow to schedule something. Lucky for me there is no attendance policy at my agency.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cdep3ei?context=5)|You're welcome!! Keep me updated! I hope all works out!
[1\) Both a psychiatrist and a neurologist confirmed I have ADHD. I don't consider psychology a real science and the neurologist only used 1 psychological test. The psychiatrist just went through his DSM and asked me if the symptoms are familiar with me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddql56?context=5)|1) Well, I would have to know a couple different things about you. Many adults have ADHD, some even developing later on. If you feel easily excited or agitated, if you feel that you have a hard time focusing on one thing for too long, if you find that you multi-task, if you have a hard time sleeping at night, then you might have ADHD. If there are other things going on, there is a possibility that it's just some kind of ADHD NOS (not otherwise specified).
[2\) I recently lost my faith completely and I have fallen into a depression as a consequence. I don't see the point of living anymore. Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddql56?context=5)|2) I'm sorry that you have lost your faith. That can be a really real world crashing experience. Maybe it's time to look into new faith bases, or try something new? For some people, starting a new hobby or even religion (I have a newly reformed Muslim's now, I think, much happier!), If you really keep feeling this way, maybe counseling would be for you.  Gaining new coping mechanisms would really benefit you and help you find direction.
[I have borderline. I've given up on life and ever getting the help I need to recover.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddoz3y?context=5)|I'm really sorry you feel that way! Borderline is very hard to live with, you are either at war with the world or yourself. Your brain has a hard time not being escapist the instant things start to go wrong, right? (or something around there).
[Do you have any hopes for borderline people in future and how hard (answer this honestly\) is it to cure the sufferers? I've been lied to so much and now I'm past giving a shit. I'm simply curious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddoz3y?context=5)|I have hope for borderline individuals. There are lots of proven treatment methods that help with it. However, if you have borderline, you will require life long care, even just for maintenance. I don't think that it can be cured. Think of it like having chronic illness, while it could get better for a period of time, it's still a part of who you are. Don't let that discourage you though! There is proven therapy to help you! And there is also some good meds out there.
[I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia back in 2010. I've been on different medications such as zyprexa, resperdal, Geodon, and a few others that I can't remember. All these medications have similar side effects which is weight gain and muscle stiffness. Are there medications that don't cause weight gain and still prevent me from hearing voices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddv083?context=5)|I'm sorry that there isn't much out there for medication (that I am aware of) other than those ones, they are considered the best. I've been doing a lot of research to find better options, but I've not gotten lucky yet. There is a lot of new therapy out there to help treat (reality directive). I will keep you updated if I find anything out in the future, okay?
[Is it true that is a joke among mental health therapists that bipolar patients are the biggest pains in the ass to treat? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddhhw8?context=5)|Not at all! At least, not where I work. There are some populations that require a lot more effort than others (Borderline personality disorder requires a lot of work, but no one has ever joked about it, just people groaning at the amount of research for treatment). 
[What advice do you have for someone who is almost finished with their first semester of grad school, working towards MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qje1f/iama_mental_health_therapist_ama/cddxcz2?context=5)|Spend a lot of time for self-care, it is so important! I wishI had took care of myself better, honestly.  Good luck!! You have this!

I'm currently a junior majoring in Computer Science from an esteemed university and have worked various major (Google-size) CS internships. However, after becoming an EMT and working with patients in and out of a hospital setting, I now know that I want to become a doctor. I've thought about this career for several years now and have decided that it is what I want to do. I've already taken the required ""pre-med"" courses and the MCAT.

My question to you, reddit, is what qualities of a computer scientist make for a good doctor? I'm writing my application essay and besides the basic ""logical thinker, algorithmic approach, etc."" I can't think of any good correlation between the two. 

Anyone have any ideas?

How do I find internships in software development?

Then an employee came to me and said that I did very good in selecting her. That in this day and age, it is nice to see someone put faith into a young african-american woman, especially in the IT field. Although that was a nice gesture, it struck a cord with me. Not because this employee felt the need to acknowledge it, but rather that she felt the need to acknowledge it because its still a fucking problem.

I did not hire this intern on anything other than the fact that she was the best person for the job. Had a young white male performed better in the interview, he would have gotten the spot. But that wasn't the case (trust me, that was about 75% of the applicants).

It frustrates me that this is still a problem to the point of people needing to point out when you do the right thing. A person should get a job based on their knowledge and performance. Not their gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. I know I sound like an equal rights poster, but its not 1956 anymore.

If you have experience in Python, in IDLE, this is only slow when running a .py file, but commands typed into the shell run fine.

Here are my laptop's specs (from System Options, HP Envy dv7 7333cl ):

No idea about the motherboard or speed of RAM, if that affects Python at all.

I'd like to develop a *love* for learning..

As the field of biomedical engineering is growing, I want to become a better student and need to develop better studying habits as my first year did not end as strong as I would have liked it to.

We tell each other everything and she has always been there for me. She's by far the best friend I've made in a while. However, as time goes on, the more I see that she is jealous or something is up with her. I come from a hardworking family, and I consider myself lucky for this. My dad paid for 90% of my university and I paid for the rest. I held internships, but I mostly focused on my schoolwork. She knows this, and often makes comments like ""Ugh I can't believe some people would let their parents help them out financially with school - that's so sick I could never do that"" when she KNOWS my parents help me out. 

She is also that one person that ALWAYS likes me pictures that I upload - even if it's a picture of my dog. However, any sort of pics of me on a trip or where I'm traveling somewhere and she won't like or comment on it... She won't even mention the trip to me at all. It's weird. 

Recently, my parents gave me a brand new car as a graduation present. It ended up being a nicer car than hers. She once asked me what kind of car it was and I told her. Later on, I drove up to see her and I followed her to go to this restaurant I had never been to and I told her I'd follow her (meaning she saw my car) - nothing. If she had gotten a new car, I would've said something, you know? 

The thing is - whenever she takes a trip I wish her a safe trip and comment on her trips. Whenever she got a good grade, I immediately congratulated her and felt happy for her. I just never see her do the same for me. Idk... I'm just a bit disappointed cause she has been a good friend but I'm noticing that she is definitely either jealous or not happy with my success...

1ql6az,4,2013-11-13,"Graduating with a degree in GIS next month, need some advice?",unmetamorphosed,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1ql6az/graduating_with_a_degree_in_gis_next_month_need/,"In four and a half weeks I'll be graduating with a B.S. in Geography with a concentration in GIS. The thing is, I didn't realize how poor of a job my university does preparing its students for a career in GIS until I actually started searching through GIS job listings. Programming was fleetingly mentioned once or twice in my Intro to GIS class, and the Geography Dept is only just now adding its first programming class (Python and GIS) next semester (of course the semester after I graduate.) I've been trying to teach myself Python in my spare time over the past few months but it's been tough, and to be honest, programming and I just do not mix. This sucks because the Dept doesn't even emphasize how big of a deal programming, database management and web mapping are becoming in the industry. I have literally zero experience in those. I guess the Dept is geared much more towards an ""academic GIS"" approach.

Anyway, this past summer I interned with my hometown's County Tax Appraisal Dept and finally gained some ""real world"" experience. My internship was two months long, and starting not even two weeks in, the director and the assistant director both began asking if I'd be interested in working there after graduation. I should mention that I basically created this internship opportunity myself (my stepmother retired from the Dept a few years ago, and she's personal friends with basically everyone there. Also around this time I was still dead set on going to grad school, which I am no longer going to do). They were pretty aggressive about offering me a position, especially near the end of my internship, but I politely declined saying I was planning on grad school, etc. They both still specifically told me ""Come talk to us whenever you're done with school. There will be an open door here for you."" 

So fast forward a few months. I'm freaking out because GIS is increasingly becoming less and less appealing to me. However, I did enjoy the work I did during my internship (reading legal deeds/cadastral maps for property divisions, and digitizing the new parcels into the county's GIS database, along with keeping the parcel owner attributes up to date, among other things), I'd be doing essentially the same thing if I was hired full time, and it would be decent salary wise. 

At a few points during their attempted recruitment, they also told me if I signed a contract for 2-3 years, they'd pay for any further education I'd want. Here's the thing - a local university has a 32 hour certificate program in Surveying, which is ABET certified, that I could spend a year or two doing and then take the FS exam. Surveying seems to make much more money entry level wise, and it's very in demand/growing in the state I'll be in.

So I guess I'm just asking for y'all's opinion on all this? I've tried getting my GIS professor's advice but he was pretty unhelpful (unsurprisingly). :/


tl;dr: I'm growing increasingly disillusioned with GIS, and I graduate next month. Should I jump at this steady entry level job for a few years, while I build up whatever GIS skills I can, then transition/jump ship to Surveying?"

I am a CS undergrad at a decent university, well its a state school, but it really is a good program. In fact, you can't even get to upper-level classes without taking an entrance exam, which weeds out a lot of people.

I am a good student, well not straight A's, but I mainly get B's not one C in my CS classes (Gen Ed is a different story). In other words, I am a good student who has a good grasp of CS topics that I have learned so far in the 8 or so classes that I have taken. I know my algorithms, I know my data structures. If you tell me to code up a BST, I can do it with maybe one stupid mistake, but I know the basics.

Last summer I did not look for an internship because I felt my coding was a little weak and I didn't feel confident enough for a dev position. But now I feel strong. Lately I have been fiddling with Python and writing scripts that calls an API, basic but my point is that 8 months ago, I would have not even know where to begin and now I am confident that with the right company, I could truly learn a lot and I am ready to take my skills to a next level with an internship.

**Job Search**

There was an internship/career fair in September. I missed it and there isn't another one until next semester. Now before you start throwing rocks at me, the reason I didn't go was because I didn't care to look for a job then, but after serving tables for 6 months now, I feel I am selling myself short. I have marketable skills and I am working on an in demand degree, there is no reason I can't get an internship. So lately I have been sending out emails with my resume to all the places I find via job sites. To this day, I have gotten one response but then all of a sudden that company was acquired so their internship hiring is on hold. Other than that, I have not received any return emails. I have been job searching for about 1.5 months now. I know its a short time, but I am starting to have doubts. I hate to shamelessly plug in my resume for a review, but I feel you guys might have some insight:

[My resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1566mhjgg0kk5k/anon%20resume.docx)


TL;DR: I missed the internship job fair and there isn't another one until next semester. My plan is to keep sending my resume out via email and responding to job ads. With quotes such as ""Software is eating the world"" and there are not enough developers to fill jobs, then why am I not getting responses back from recruiters/companies?

1qktv1,3,2013-11-13,I want to get into financial engineering. (xpost from cscareerquestions),poor_as_heck,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1qktv1/i_want_to_get_into_financial_engineering_xpost/,"(I don't know the optimal place to post this)

My dream job is to work in one of the trading houses such as Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, etc.  I am currently a sophomore in Computer Science, considering a second major in either Applied Math or Computational Statistics.  However, math is not my strong suit, so most likely it will be Computational Statistics.  I am also open to the idea of minoring in math or stats.  

In terms of classes, I have finished calculus, finishing up linear algebra this quarter.  I know differential equations is important to financial engineering; I may take that in the spring.  Currently in an assembly class, will be taking data structures next quarter.  I have taken macroeconomics and might be taking microecon next quarter.  I have a 3.3 GPA; however, this includes a D- I unfortunately received in calc 4, which I am retaking (replaces the grade).  It should rise to at least 3.5 by next quarter.  I know I need to drastically improve my GPA to increase my chances of getting into a good grad school.  

Other than getting a strong GPA, what else can help me get into a top financial engineering program?  Would any kind of CS related internships be good?  Also, my university offers various tracks for CS: databases and data management, graphics and visualization, networking, security and cryptography, systems and software engineering.  Which one of these would be most useful towards my (dream) career?  What else can I do to get my dream job?"

I have been working part-time the past month at a small company in Santa Barbara as a software tester. They now want me to come more, 30 hrs/week (5 days a week, 6 hours a day). This would mean I would have to move up there, my current commute would be too much for every day. They originally proposed $1000/month, which I declined as it is both not affordable to me to live off of as well as being quite low in general. 

They came back to me saying they really like my work I've been doing and the part-time work would be transitioning to more a dev role and would want me to come on full-time after, since it would be an investment for them to teach me dev work. They want me to let them know what monthy compensation I would feel comfortable with.

This would be a good opportunity for me to get some real work experience since I have had no internships before (I know that's terrible). I'm just not sure what would be fair to both parties.

Thanks for any advice you have!

The Smithsonian has a large data center. Storage is pretty cheap nowadays but creating meta-data, organizing and making that data searchable is a huge challenge. We are currently working on a digital asset management plan for our 3D data. The advantage we have is that we are at the ground floor with this type of data and if we make the right decision early on we will save ourselves a huge headache in the years to come as 3D capture becomes more common.
 |The good news is that raw 3D data is incredibly simple. When we scan an object in 3D we create a point cloud. That point cloud is a visualization of a text file. Each point has an x,y and z value so the raw data can be saved as a .txt file. We know how to make text files durable.
 |My personal plan is to laser etch the .txt scan file of our objects onto a giant stone tablet making the data durable for a few million years. :)

Do you have to often account varying material properties (e.g., absorption, relectivity, size, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qp2t0/were_digitizing_the_smithsonians_treasures_in_3d/cdf0pwd?context=5)|We will choose the appropriate scanning method depending upon what questions are being asked, material properties and objects size.

However, I have not had an internship in the financial field or had an interview with a financial firm. I was wondering what do I have to do to get my foot in the door.
A little information about me. I'm currently working as an intern and have been with the company for over 6 months now. My role as an intern is mainly a market researcher. Before that, I have had years of experience working in customer service industry.

 I enjoy math and had to take high level mathematical courses including calculus 3, linear algebra, etc and I have received a 4.0 gpa in my math courses. I also have an intermediate level of programming skills. My major gpa is a 3.925 and I have taken classes on futures, swaps, options, energy trading and energy value chain. I'd prefer to go into a field of finance that would allow me to apply my analytic, quantitative and computer programming skills. Any suggestions on a career path?

Also I've been paper trading futures for the past year and next week, I plan on trading with money so I have a strong interest in trading. I'd prefer to get an entry level job in the middle office of a trading firm but I'm open to suggestions. Also how would I get an interview in the finance industry? I have applied at several banks but have not heard back. 

I'm active at school and involved in a few student organizations including finance association and honors society. Lastly, I'd prefer not to go into sales."

I feel like I'd like to apply to some smaller companies as well as the big ones to increase my chances of getting an internship. I really don't want to graduate without any experience.

What are some lesser known companies someone could try to get an internship at as a computer science student? Or what are some tools which we can use to find some of the smaller companies?"

A few things I would certainly let the pros do, like the foundation, but for most of the rest I intend to do myself. While I have not worked in construction, I am an engineer and I have (as part of an internship) done interior work on a building (making studs, drywall, electrical, some plumbing, etc).

Of course as I got anywhere near this becoming an actual thing I would read up more on codes and such.

So a few questions I have are:

Did this end up being cheaper than if you had it built through contractors/the standard way? If so, by how much? (I understand you are trading monetary investment for time investment.)

What difficulties did you encounter when it came to things like inspectors?

Did you do anything out of the ordinary with your home? Did this cause any problems?
(One example of out of the ordinary, is that I have something of a fear of cars slamming through the wall and killing someone, so one thing I considered was possibly having those concrete/rebar cylinders used to stop cars, built into the first floor walls. Hidden from view, but there for protection.)

How flexible are building codes when it comes to custom designs? (For example, another thing I've been looking into setting up as a design is a house that is largely a 2ish story hollow shell with a modular panel system that allows for the interiors (walls and possibly floors) to be changed largely as desired. The shell would of course be designed for proper load bearing and such consistent with the needs of this design.)

What were some good things about doing this yourself?

What were the pitfalls and advantages of doing this yourself?

And I suppose finally, if you ever sold this place, how did the fact that you built it alter the final price?

If you have any other thoughts concerning this, feel free to provide them!

Thanks for your time!"

1qnwm2,13,2013-11-14,I am at a major crossroads in my life and need an unbiased opinion of what my best option would be,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1qnwm2/i_am_at_a_major_crossroads_in_my_life_and_need_an/,"Background: I am a 23 year old male, just graduated with a bachelor of science in [geomatics engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics_engineering) , with emphasis on Land Surveying. I have had a summer job with an oil and gas surveying company for the past two summers and just recently started full time with them. Before that I was helping my dad on the family ranch. This surveying job is my first real job, with steady paychecks and whatnot. Note- Ranch is 1 hour from city A (where I went to high school, and now work surveying), and city B(where I went to uni) is 4 hours from my ranch and 3 from City A. 

Here's where I need advice: 
I really hate my job surveying. Working for an oilfield company is a shitty thankless job. It helps no-one, creates more problems than it solves and makes greedy pigs of everyone involved. I work long hours, 10 hours a day minimum for weeks on end. I once had 181 hours in 16 days, with a day off cause it happened to rain and we couldn't work. The money is good, but not great. Overtime and long hours is where the money is, but it sucks working that much. This leads to having no personal life. I get home and am too tired to do anything, except microwave my meal and game or netflix for a while until I go to bed and get up at 6 to do it again. I am also technically always 'on call', meaning I can/will be working unless I have booked days off. I have no guaranteed days off. I only find out if I have a weekend off on fridays when I get back to the office. This means I cannot plan to do anything definite unless I book days off, of which I have a limited amount. Often I have random days off, with which I cannot do anything. Ex. Last weekend I wanted to visit my gf, but was told on friday that I might be working sat/sun, and that we had to find out on sat morning if we were working. It drives me fucking nuts not knowing if i work or not. 

WHy am I doing this with a engg degree you ask? To become a land surveyor you need to article under another land surveyor and do field work (as a party chief) as a learning experience. Currently I am an assistant, and have not worked as a party chief very much, even though I have the education and a cumlative year of assistance experience as well.  To start articling you basically need to say that you're gonna stay in the same place for 2-4 years to get your land surveyor title. 

Why don't I just quit? The company work for helped to pay for school, and so I signed a contract to work for them for a year after school, or I have to pay them back all their money. I still have 6 months left on this contract. :( Also having a job close to the family ranch in City A is good because I could help out often and see my family too, but now I've moved back to CIty A from City B, I have no friends closeby. City A is also small and very shitty, possibly the shittiest in the province. I live for free with my brother, but he is horrendous and does not clean anything, so when I get back from working long days I have to clean up before I can even eat my meal. I am too tired to exercise regularly or even begin to improve myself. 

Some other stuff: 4 out of 10 crew chiefs have quit in the past year due to such shitty work conditions and schedules. There are two other articling pupils in the same situation that would make getting good relevant work much harder for both me and them. I never really intended for this job to turn into a career in city A, it was really just meant to be a stepping stone to stay in city B after school so it feels like I'm in limbo. They have given me a company truck, credit card, phone etc and i would feel bad if i just quit right away and 'gave up' on them. 

So essentially, I feel trapped in a shitty job, in a shitty city, in a shitty house, with no guaranteed time off to visit my friends or gf. I am becoming more depressed and tired everyday and feel like I can't get away. 

I have some options before me though: 

i) I could keep working and just bear it out until I get my contract is done. then get out and do whatever, but it would really really suck, and I would be wasting time by not articling right away. 

ii) I could move to another city with the same company, but start again with a new place and lose more money than staying in City A until my contract is done.

iii) I could quit the job, pay back 8 grand ish and be a free man to do whatever, whatever being:

-another survey job, in a different city with less pay but better hours (to start to get my land surveyor designation)

-possibly applying for an overseas internship with a company that makes and tests survey equipment (3-6 months)(which would be incredible but make my gf very very sad, which is bad cause I really like her)

-ranching (take over the family buisness, and stay poor for life cause land ain't cheap, and live close to shitty city anyway)

-start working at a massive non-surveying company that does oilfield engineering (shitty oilfield stuff still, but better corporate and personal life back in city B)



I have no goddamn clue what to do. Me being sad makes life hard for my gf, and I hate being sad too. It is a shitty situation and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just being a big bitch about it all? I need better work ethic? I don't know. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

This is a major step for me because whatever I choose to do will most likely be my future career, and wherever I choose to live will probably be the place I end up. "

I am not a self-taught programmer already--I am learning as I go and struggling, too, even had to drop out of accelerated calculus because it lost me. I'm a pretty average guy.

But despite all this, I was able to exert confidence in an interview and now have a paid summer internship lined up in Vegas.

I wasn't even going to interview for the company, I just stopped by their information session to see how I might be able to be competitive in the future. Just had a regular conversation with the director of a part of the company and he urged me to interview the next day ""just for the experience."" I said screw it and went ahead to interview **and got the position**.

Bottom line, even if you think like me that you're very average, or even sub-par, don't let that discourage you from jumping on every possible opportunity. If I can do it, you can do it. Yes, **you** can do it."

    so I'm currently a junior and I've been in the Google internship host matching phase and still haven't gotten any interested hosts, but I also have an upcoming return internship offer deadline from another company that I interned for last summer that is coming up real soon (sometime in the next week). I'm debating whether I should take the return internship offer or decline it and test my luck at getting a host match with Google... Has anybody been in a similar situation or does anybody have information on how likely I am to get a host match?

Thanks!

EDIT: Hey guys, so I decided to accept the return internship offer at Amazon for the summer of 2014, and unfortunately enough, Google told me they found a host match the day after! I decided to end the Google process because I respect the two companies too much and don't want to do anything that would damage my or their reputations. It was a hard decision, but hopefully things work out!"

I have a pretty solid background (engineering) and relevant internship experience, so have no trouble getting interviews.  I also have referrals from my internship and performed well in the internship and school.    I think I narrowed my problem down to interviewing.  I am under a lot of pressure recently (sick/unemployed parent), so I have been really stressed out and not performing well in the interviews.  

I'm really frustrated and have been doing my best to improve.  I've been watching youtube videos and practicing in front of the mirror, but still seem to freeze when in the interview.  I'm always sure to smile and make sure I'm positive in the interview.  At this point I'm not sure where else I can turn for advice, and am really depressed.  I've done mock interviews which have helped somewhat, but I still seem to be struggling in the real interviews.  I am overall a very modest and laid back individual, so maybe I'm not tooting my own horn enough?  

Can anyone give examples of how they tell stories of their accomplishments? I'm thinking I'm also not doing a good enough job of story telling to get my points across to the interviewer.  Any advice or suggestions?  Thanks for reading.

1qr5sv,6,2013-11-16,Noob here. How can I get an employer to hire me as a free intern?,just_some_irrelevant,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qr5sv/noob_here_how_can_i_get_an_employer_to_hire_me_as/,"English is not my native language, so please forgive any mistakes.

Short introduction: I'm 20, finished the high school equivalent in Scandinavia last spring and I'm looking into what is literally translated as a 'work experiment'. What it means that the state pays me welfare money if I find work, usually within a field that interests me, and the potential employer doesn't have to pay me anything, only teach me about the job involved. I would be like a free intern for the employer.

I've been using computers for most of my childhood. I know how to assemble or disassemble one, and I can often successfully diagnose problems and fix them. I have some experience with setting up static servers in Linux, and I've been also self-studying programming/computer science for almost a year (I've got the basics down with Java and Haskell, and I have a general picture of how the computer works from down to top - from logic gates to high level languages). **I'm also very motivated to learn more**, thus I'm trying to get into a university to study CS / software engineering next year.

I know this isn't much, but I think I have enough experience to at least justify trying to get an intern position at an IT/tech -oriented company, and I would love to get one for some time before I start going to uni (if I can get there).

The thing is, I have a low self-esteem when it comes to my skills. Whenever I do something, even for a long period of time, I feel like I suck, I don't know enough and most other people learning the same are always better than me. For my whole life I've been surrounded by people who talk too much but do too little, people who talk a lot about themselves and don't pay attention to others. I feel like I've grown opposite of that - If I do something, I don't feel like talking about it unless asked to, or if I'm in a conversation, I want to hear more about what the other person has to say - if I talk about myself to others then I just automatically assume they don't give a damn, and that is often true.

This long wall of text might seem contradictory with what I just told you, but mind you this is the first time I've told about this to anybody and I'm only telling this because reddit offers anonymity.


Main part: the people who know I'm looking for this kind of internship tell me I should walk to the workplace I'm interested at, all confident in my skills and let them know the best things about **me** and why they should hire **me** as an intern. But as I told you about my personality, I suck at that. I've sent my short resumes via email to a few IT-oriented companies this week. These resumes aren't too special, just a collection of factual statements about myself, my basic skills and my interests. I should call them soon and ask them about the resumes I sent them, but even now I feel like they don't care because not a single one of them has answered. I don't think I could just walk in there and let them know why they should hire me, without freezing up. The only reason I feel I should be hired for free is because I'm really motivated to learn to do something useful with my current skillset. I just don't know how to convince a potential employer of that.

I guess this is a social anxiety of some sort, and it depresses me that I feel like I can't even find work I'd be really interested in,  even though it would be pretty much free for the employer.


TL;DR - Low self-esteem. Need tips how to get hired as an intern for which the employer doesn't have to pay anything."
1qqw7h,450,2013-11-16,Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown; or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired.,sharpie32,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1qqw7h/tales_of_an_it_rodeo_clown_or_how_a_university/,"So I was talking about my student loans in /r/explainlikeimfive/ and I briefly brought up my first work experience.  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion (unrelated, but how fukkin' cool would that be.)

I started the job as a ""Security Intern"", which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions, but also meant I got to do audits of the University.  It was unpaid, but it was ""relevant work experience"" that I knew I would desperately need.  This was fine, because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with.  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs.  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games.  Some of them had Autodesk.  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth.  During that time there, I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them.  If one went dark, I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware related.

This was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the ""Security Technician"", essentially my boss and getting paid, was quitting.  He hadn't graduated yet, but had a better job lined up.  Guess who got the bump up?  This guy.  $11/hour to do the same shit I was already doing.  FuckyeahSeaking.  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth.  I could pretty much make up my own hours.  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin' down.  I wasn't building the images or doing the complex stuff, but the IT Arch-wizards were glad I was there.  I allowed them to focus.  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paid.

All great things do eventually go sour though.  (And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet.)  I walked in another day and there was something wrong.  It wasn't the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server...  It was different.  You could smell it in the air.  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin.  (I own that name OldSpice, fuck you.)  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin, who was my boss now, was changing his grades.  Now, you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin?  Well, because that's how you do it when you're a diploma mill!  Who can you pay less than one of the students you're supposed to be educating?  Well anyways, he didn't deny it and he could've got away with it if he hadn't become too greedy.  But alas, guess who got bumped up again?  Not this guy, actually.  No one did.  Which was okay, because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything we'd need for at least a little while.  So life went on with one less friend, because he left mid semester and never actually graduated.

Now's the best time to tell you about the IT Staff.  There was J, who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security.  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than I'll ever know.  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasn't a foreign national.  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells...  (Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system.)  Finally, there was M.  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled.   ""But that's all?"" you ask?  Yes, these 3 guys managed a University of too many.  They did it alone.  They did it entirely without thanks.  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much, but they believed they were making it a better place.  They thought that if they weren't there, then who would protect the neckbeards?  Certainly not their parents...  They paid for them to be here.  To get them out of their basement.  There *was* also the IT Manager, R.  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew.  He had a lot of other roles to fill, but he trusted J, S, M, and I and so we were largely unmanaged.  It was how we survived and it was how the school survived.

One day, sitting with us in our circle of chairs, R just slammed his fist down, stood up and said ""I don't usually do this, but unless any of you object, I'd like to bring Sharpie32 on full time.""  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life.  By the end of the day, there was a contract on my seat.  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit.  I was sad, but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life.  **$32k/year.**  (FYI: happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together.  They are not peanut butter and jelly.  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste, but not jelly...)

Shortly after him, S &amp; J quit as well.  I'm pretty sure R knew they would quit too, but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing.  I don't remember who had a job lined up first, but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together.  This was mostly because of politics, but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation.  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone, with thousands of students and staff depending on them.  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff, things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it.  Sick of not being paid enough (I found out later they made $45k/year each there.  Both had put in 3 years at least, never a raise or vacation.)  Sick of the disrespect;  we'd have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair.  We would have to drop everything, no matter how serious, and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why, fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot.  There were also days, once a month, where we'd be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought.  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned.  (As a footnote:  If they'd known that one day a few years into the future, they'd be lined up (literally) and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered, I'm sure they would've done things different...  But anyways.  I couldn't get fired, because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure, the network, and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty.  So at least we had that going for us, which was nice.

Things really started going down hill close to Christmas time though... that's when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons.  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP.  Windows 7 was coming out and our image, which I didn't know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems, was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it, because of the servers, because of the network.  I made the decision to drop Ghost, mostly because I hated Symantec, but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M$ tokens supported.  Keep in mind, I didn't know dick about doing this.  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in 2 months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows 7 environment.  But also in that time, I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hog.

Why was the Windows 7 shitty?  Well partly because I was still learning, partly because we were using roaming profiles, and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images, discovering if you didn't set the skipRearm flag before you sysprep'd an image 3 times, you irreversibly fucked your image.  Seriously, when Windows 7 first came out, that was pretty much undocumented.  I remember when it started getting cold.  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty.  I remember it reaching 32 in there and I sent M a text, saying ""Hey man.  I'm freezing in here.  I have a jacket but I'm still really cold, my feet are numb.  Can you call maintenance, I can't find their number.""  He sent me back ""lol.""  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline, I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happen.

So can you imagine being 20, being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before 300 computers, starting to image them all and knowing, just fukkin' knowing that if this didn't work, that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but **everyone's** day.  You'll never guess what didn't work.  (Spoiler:  Pretty much everything.)  It took 8 hours to image 40 systems of the thousand we had, because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network, each one was being handled unicast, creating its own link to the server, creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file.  I felt really fuckin' clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit.  But never the less, shit did not work.  Shit did not work for a long time.  At first it was that no one could log in.  I fixed that, it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile they'd pull based on what the system was supposed to be.  Then it was all of the undocumented ""bandaids"" that had been wiped away in XP.  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start &gt; Fucking Computer, because they were Babyboomers and change scared them.  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldn't use Windows 7.  I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition.  Which, believe me, can be a lot if you're not up for figuring it out yourself.  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground, an undocumented network and server infrastructure, and updates that had to be done manually.  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons, because it wasn't worth the drive home.

Shit was still fucked up around Valentines day.  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though.  They fucking should have though.  I would have, if I wasn't me...  They didn't give a shit though.  They could still play video games and that's all they ever needed.  Valentine's day was important to me, because the staff and faculty fuckin' rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick.  (For the record, popcorn comes in 4 sizes: Small, Medium, Large, My Dick.  You get the idea.)  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands.  One pissed off day a few months later, I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig.  She found out and sewed that shit back together.  I wish I'd taken that pig when I left...

Things eventually settled down though.  I persisted, overcame, and continued to do the best I could.  They were worried about the security of the systems, and they fuckin' should've been, so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends.  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him, who I'll call D, M and Sharpie32.  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real strides.

Then one day they hired a new IT Manager.  That was pretty much when things started going down hill.  I could've survived and probably would've stayed there a lot longer if they hadn't brought this guy on.  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on.  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being.  And so he did.  This guy gobbled the President's balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy.  Anything the President wanted, this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience.  None at all.  Guy didn't know dick about management, so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done.  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos.  He ruined that shit for me.  Not that I liked it that much, but I went from ""Meh"" to unconditionally hating that shit.  He'd talk about wanting to ""bang"" her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice, which was his real voice.  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid.  (A kid that looked like a Nair'd chimp by the way.)  Eventually, they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter.  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I won't go into detail about.  Guy didn't know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter.  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable, which was fine, but the guy was making more than twice my wages.

Needless to say, shit got pretty tense in there.  M, D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didn't like it.  Of course, they let go of the guy they could to make a point.  They shit canned M.  I was furious, but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job.  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present.  Universally, up until the new IT Manager, we were all huge gun enthusiasts, M especially.  He found zen in the long distance shot.  He owned a rifle that I've long since forgotten but was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum.  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his going-away present:  The opportunity to shoot a ""grill size"" full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

So of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning.  Got there at 3AM, had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there, it was still pitch black.  Stars look different when there's no light pollution to fuck with your night view.  

**EDIT 1:**  So anyways, we're out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and he's stoked and I'm stoked and I walk it about 150 yards out to the side of a giant hill.  You don't know terror until you're out in the wilderness 150 yards away from the only light, which is a truck's low beams.  There's just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out.  But anyways, I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didn't want to get eaten by a bobcat or something.  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back...  Terrified.  I get back there and M's like...  dude, where'd you put it?  I look back and it's too fuckin' dark to see it.  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and there's a glowstick in there.  I walk out, tie that shit on, and finally get back.  M's already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back.  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this, I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab.  What felt like an hour was probably 30 seconds as M zeroed in, prone, and took his shot.  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death.  At first you could see it spin because of the light, but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off. That's when, for the second time that night, I discovered what terror really is.

It sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to take-off speed, but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably 40 or 50 feet to the right, from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again.  It did this two more times toward us, during which I truly thought it was intentional, but finally died down.  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned, I looked down and M was still prone.  He'd never moved.  He just, in the epitome of alpha male badassery said ""cool.""  We both walked out to get it, partly because you don't leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up, but also because he wanted to show his 8 year old daughter.  He said she loved this kind of stuff.  We shot some targets after that, then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind.  That was the last time I actually saw the guy."

We all know that homework is like 0.05 percent of your final grade and exams are worth 1000.5% so just study for those instead of beating your head against the wall.  Sometimes homework helps you study and is relevant to the exam.  Sometimes it’s a load of shit assigned by a GSI who has their head up their ass.  Learn to tell the difference. 
2.	Continuing on with this exam thing…so you know how you get like no credit for doing homework perfectly?  You ACTUALLY get ZERO CREDIT for going to class.  So if it’s a big lecture, your professor is boring as fuck, you’re tired, and you have a ton of shit to do, SKIP THE CLASS AND STUDY.  Go to the library and force yourself to focus, maybe even read the textbook section on what the class is on and do some examples.  I swear you’ll get more done than if you had gone to class and texted under the table the whole time. 
(But like you have to go to class sometimes.  Remember that.)
3.	Speaking of exams… they don’t actually get you jobs. 
WAIT THEY DON’T?
No. Grades do not give you jobs.  People give you jobs.  So if you want one then you need to talk to the right people.  How do you do this? 
4.	JOIN A CLUB.  I don’t care if you have so much homework the pile touches the ceiling, or if you want to go out and party because that’s what you think you should be doing, or if you’re already not showering ever because you have no free time blah blah blah. Get off Facebook, for gods sake delete your fucking twitter, and JOIN A CLUB.  If you are of non-freakish intelligence (like myself) and you can’t get a 3.97999 without trying, then you are going to need something that will set you apart from the 20,000 other people graduating with the same degree from the same caliber school within 0.2 GPA points of each other.  Recruiters want people with experience.  (No, your community service fraternity does not count).  Join some kind of engineering –related team, club, or organization that gives you hands on work and forces you to apply your knowledge. You will be in the perfect position to talk to recruiters who approach your project team directly, and you will have tons of relevant experience to talk about when you do land an interview.  
Note:  I’m really not full of shit.  Personal story—I have an average GPA, but I am very involved in a team and I made a big effort to talk to recruiters and match a face with my resume.  As a result, after only a month of my sophomore year I had three interviews, which resulted in two internship offers from big name companies.  My friend who decided against joining a club so that he could keep is grades up has a GPA that is 0.6 above mine, and he is also a peer mentor and does community service.  Unfortunately the vast majority of engineering companies could not give less of a shit about how many trees he planted, and his resume just got lost in the shuffle.  Currently 0 interviews, 0 offers.  
5.	Another reason to join some kind of club thing/do research/actually do some engineering thing that’s not just equations on paper is so you end up with a job that you actually LIKE!
Picture this: you go through hell and a half to get all these impossible math physics statics fluids thermo mechanics however many other hard-ass classes done, pay a ton of tuition, and at the end of 4 (or 5 or 6, who am I to judge) years you end up with a job that involves sitting behind a computer in a semi-dark room working on CAD models for the rest of forever.  Of course it pays well. But your life sucks so who cares.  
If you get involved with something that you like while you’re in college, it 
1. Gives you an idea of what you really want to do, and 2. Makes you a thousand times more marketable to companies in that field.  If you like cars, join a formula racing team and get recruited by some awesome auto manufacturer.  If you like skateboarding, take classes on materials and maybe some drawing/design stuff, build some models while you’re in school, talk a material science professor into letting you work for them, and maybe end up with some awesome job designing boards.  Because you have valid experience before you even graduate.   
6.	Don’t flip a shit when you fail a test.  
You will fail a test.  
You WILL fail a test.  
It is not the end of the world when you fail a test.
The important thing to know is how to come back from failing a test.  
The important thing is to not freak out and die.  Just study harder.  Live in office hours.  Suck it up and go over your exam with 2 different teachers.  Do your homework more thoroughly if it’s relevant (you should know this from the questions on the exam you just took!) and spend less time on it and more time on other practice problems if it’s not.  Do anything you can to get your hands on recent practice tests.  Like ten of them.  
But whatever you do, don’t just curl up into a ball and call it hopeless.  There is almost nothing that can happen to you academically that you cannot come back from.  Really.  I once got a 42 percent on a midterm in a non-curved class and still ended up with a B as my final grade.   
7.	Spend time with non-engineers.  This is a short one, but it is critically important.  If you only hang out with other engineers it is incredibly easy to get stuck in the rut of “OMG what did you get on math I’m so stressed out let’s talk about how stressed out we are by the way do you have a summer internship yet I don’t know if I’ll get one I got a C on that last test…”
STOP. 
My roommate is a theater major, and she is one of the funniest, strongest, most motivated people I know.  Hanging out with her gives me a new perspective on so many things, and helps me remember that there are many different types of people everywhere, and they are all interesting and worth getting to know.  
8.	Don’t forget to be a person. 
When you’re seven weeks deep into a semester and you’re so stressed out that your eyes glaze over and you get a rash from sitting in the library for so long, it’s easy to forget that you’re human.  There’s just no end in sight.  No matter how much you study, there will always be fuck-ups in terms of grades, and no matter how much you try socially your friends sometimes screw you over and that cute kid in Statics 311 just WON’T get coffee with you. Sometimes engineering school can feel like getting punched in the face over and over, and having to force yourself, each time, to get up and keep walking.  That’s why it’s important to remember to be a person.  
Remember to be nice.  It’s easy to compete viciously with everyone, including your friends, because you ARE competing viciously with everyone, even your friends.  It’s all about beating the curve, so where others lose, you win. Unfortunately, being ultra-competitive is a really shitty way to go through life.  If someone you know is going through something tough at school or otherwise, don’t stomp on them while they’re down.  Talk to them.  Try to help them through whatever.  You’ll gain people skills by helping them, and they’ll appreciate it if they have even one decent bone in their body.  And when you get stuck in something, they just might return the favor.  
Also, maybe instead of just chilling alone and watching Netflix like a zombie when you somehow get a night off, cook something if you have access to a kitchen.  Go for a walk in the woods and take as long as possible to get where you’re going.  Read a dumb magazine.  Draw.  Lie on your floor for a full 40 minutes and think about your favorite memories from when you were a little kid.  
If you played an instrument in high school, pick it up once and awhile.  It helps keep your head balanced, and your mother will be thrilled.  If you do these things, maybe you’ll be okay when you come out of school despite all the insanity.  If you remember to stop, REALLY REALLY STOP once in a while, and do normal people things, then when you graduate and get a job you’ll be more than just a shell who knows how to get 3 problems sets done in 2 days.  Because then, unfortunately, those skills will no longer be useful.  You go to engineering school to learn how to be an engineer.  Don’t forget how to be anything else in the process.  

Now go study. Good luck.

1quk4t,0,2013-11-17,A few questions from a high school senior with some choices,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1quk4t/a_few_questions_from_a_high_school_senior_with/,"Hello there /r/learnprogramming! I have a few (potentially) stupid questions to ask, that hopefully I can get answers for.

I should start off by saying that if this is the wrong place for questions of this type, then I apologize. If so, can you point me to a better place to ask them/search for answers? Regardless, this community seems to be pretty nice to us clueless types, so I am sure I'll get some help.

Anyway, now that that's over with, my first question would be: **What is it programmers actually do at their daily job?** What does a typical work week consist of? I am still deciding between majoring in CS or going into the Chemistry field (I find both really interesting and fufilling) and it'd be nice to know what to expect if I were to go the CS route. Everything I've done so far is just make silly little programs and solve sample problems like [these](http://hspt.ucfprogrammingteam.org/index.php/past-contests/past-problem-sets) for our school's programming team. 

Additionally, I know that quite a bit of you guys are self taught, but for those who went to college for CS(or anyone who could answer, really) **What is the difference between a school like Berkeley (tied for first ranked (or top 5) in just about every list I've seen) or University of Florida (ranked 39th)?** What's the difference in the quality of education? Will it make a big difference for undergrad? Will it open more opportunities straight out of school? Those are my top two schools currently, and assuming I get into both (I have the test scores) money will be a huge factor in which school I choose. Berkeley is expensive where as Florida is a good engineering school and in state so it is far cheaper. Is the additional student loans I'd have to take on worth the difference in education? I'd love to go to Berkeley if given the option, but is it worth it?

I guess the last thing I'd have to ask is **what can I do to make my life easier in college or when trying to find an internship?** Currently, I know a fair bit of Java and C# and I've gone through the CS50x course on EdX, so I know a decent bit of C. What else can I do to help prepare? Are there any really important languages I'd need to help find an internship while going to school?

Sorry for the wall of text. All of this has come super quickly for me, and I'd like to make the best decision possible for myself. I figured I'd go ahead and ask here. Any help is appreciated! Thank you all!"

1qu3vw,1,2013-11-17,How do I [22 F] let him [35 M] go?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qu3vw/how_do_i_22_f_let_him_35_m_go/,"Ok ladies of Ask Women, can you help me get over this guy? The background on this situation is pretty strange, but please bear with me! In my first year of high school, when I was 15, I joined theatre. I stayed involved for the next four years, and developed an amazing (platonic) relationship  with the male director, Davis. Davis was 28 when I first started, and he was a heartthrob. Every girl in the school thought he was hot. I admired him from afar at first, but gradually got closer and closer to him throughout high school. We were inseparable. There wasn't a question in anyone's mind that I was his favorite student, and even though I was quite popular and had a large friend group, he was my best friend. Over the course of four years, we became closer than I have ever been to anyone. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with him. I had an extremely unstable and unhealthy home life, and Davis was the one person that I could love and trust through all of it. Not only was I emotionally attracted to him, I also felt mind blowing physical chemistry with him. Although we NEVER crossed the line into sexual territory, we were very touchy when communicating with each other, and every touch from him was like heaven on earth to me. I can't even describe the fireworks that went off when he put his arm around my shoulder or pulled me in for a hug. I knew that he was (and still is) married, and that there was never a chance of anything happening between us. Nevertheless,  because of this intense attraction, I had a lot of trouble with boys in high school. I tried to date a few different people, but they just couldn't measure up to Davis. When I was 18, I lost my virginity to a boy I didn't love in an attempt to distract me from Davis. It didn't work. No one made me feel like he did, but I figured I'd eventually be able to move on after moving on to college and making him a smaller part of my life. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. When I was a senior, Davis started his own theatre company. I did a student internship for the first two productions in the fall and spring. After I graduated, Davis offered me a full time job as the co-producer. I took it. I've been working with him for the past four years, and we've built the company into a very respectable theatre that has made quite a splash in the community. I love my job, but unfortunately, I still love Davis. We've worked together every day since I was 15, and been business partners for the past four years, so as you can imagine, our relationship has only gotten stronger. My attraction to him hasn't faded in the slightest. I've tried to date and sleep with  other guys, but none of them make me feel anything like Davis does. With anyone else, the attraction feels forced and fake. It's never that uncontrollable, raw passion and desire that Davis makes me feel. Even though nothing has ever happened between us and he would never cross that line, there's undeniable sexual tension between us that's been a source of gossip since I was 17. It's unbearable for me. He's ruined me for other men, but I know that I can never have him. How can I get over him?  I can't cut him out of my life because my career is built around him. I've wasted 7 years of my life hopelessly hung up on him. What can I do? "
1qtaqr,3,2013-11-17,Cover Letter help for Research Assistant position. Could really use some help shortening this.,inkoso,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1qtaqr/cover_letter_help_for_research_assistant_position/,"""November 16, 2013

To Whom It May Concern:

I am excited to submit my application for the Research Assistant position with the Policy Uncertainty Project that has been posted to the NBER webpage. I am confident that my strong quantitative skills and work experience have prepared me for the responsibilities required of a Research Assistant, while my background in economics will allow me to understand the implications of the innovative research this project is producing. 

As my résumé indicates, I will complete my bachelor’s degree in Economics/Mathematics from U.C Santa Cruz in June 2014. I have received, and will continue to receive until graduation, strong training in quantitative fields such as econometrics, microeconomics, and applied math and statistics. At U.C Santa Cruz I have also refined my communication skills through working for the school as a group tutor for our Applied Discrete Mathematics course. 

In addition, I was an intern for a local investment firm where I worked directly under the president, Jamal Crawford, back testing investment ideas, as well as conducting market research under his instruction. As the attached letter of recommendation from Jamal Crawford indicates, I was capable of performing all instructed tasks independently and diligently. 

I am excited to get involved with the Policy Uncertainty Project because producing data able to quantify uncertainty fascinates me. I have learned extensively about macroeconomics, taking as many courses related to the field as possible, and I know that uncertainty is a large factor in countries’ ability to borrow and finance their debts. This is a field I have been interested in throughout my studies, and I want to be involved in a project that is putting forth such useful and interesting data.

This project would be an excellent segue into my planned graduate studies, as I plan to enroll in a graduate program in economics focusing in macroeconomics. My career goal is to work in economic research, whether it is conducting my own, or working as an assistant, I want to be involved in producing information to better understand the study of economics. 

I have had coding experience in my econometrics course (using R), and will continue to acquire coding skills as I take “The Role of Statistics in Economics”, a course where real economic data is used to perform empirical research, and “Intro to Programming: Python”; both of which I will be taking in the quarters preceding my graduation. In addition to those two classes I will be exposed to solving mathematical problems with MATLAB in an applied mathematics and statistics course “Computational Methods and Applications”. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to fully demonstrate my qualifications and further discuss my interests in your project with an interview. I can be contacted at XXX XXX XXXX to set up an interview. I look forward to hearing from you about this exciting opportunity soon. ""

______________________________________________________________________________________________

This is exactly a page, with larger margins allowing for my header and signature. I think it's a bit long, but the job posting asks for a letter which ""outlines your interest in the position, background and career aspirations and any research project or coding experience"", and the position description says the ideal candidate is planning on graduate school for economics afterwards.

I'm very interested in this position, the research they're doing is something i think is pretty groundbreaking and will be really useful in the fields i'm interested in. I think i'm having problems expressing how interested i really am, but it's hard to do in a couple sentences. I think its a really cool project, and i definitely want to be a part of it. 


Any help is appreciated, this job is essentially perfect for me (most of them require moving to the east cost, and this would be close to home, and it's the most interesting project i'm applying to.

Thanks guys!"
1qt6r4,1,2013-11-17,I feel like I know what I need to succeed and not get mixed up in undergrad classes/college -- Career advice?,StoneChode,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qt6r4/i_feel_like_i_know_what_i_need_to_succeed_and_not/,"I'm 17 -- young, foolhardy, and unsure of what I want to do; insofar as that I feel a 'computer science' course wouldn't accomplish what I would want from it, and I think I already know a good portion of what would be taught for a degree. I think I want to go into startup land and launch a robotics platform for space mining/production, and I remain unsure that a degree will get me anywhere besides having a scrap of paper -- how true is that? 

**What follows is a story of what I know, so feel free to skip over it if you want.** 
   
 I started out when I was 12 in the back of the lab room toying with C++ &amp; C#, just glossing over articles to do quick things like solve my simple algebra homework for me (which was a resounding success).    
   
Then I got into embedded development with my first Arduino, moved on to a robotics competition, busted out some realtime C++ stuff alongside some web development experience using Django/Python and all the favorite MV-* frameworks like KnockoutJS. Alongside all of that came SOLID, Problem Domain solving, git mastery and so on. Then, from a mentor from my robotics team (who was the CTO), I landed an internship with a software consultancy while I was 16.
   
Shit got kinky. I read two 600 page books a week on whatever I could find, worked on massive Sharepoint farms and webapps on a team, did the whole DB shuffle, read a couple books on some data mining and cubes. Meanwhile, the number of languages I had a breadth-first understanding of ballooned as I started fixing projects that would come in that probably would have been better served ""Old Yeller"" style (it was a software consultancy, after all). Then I started writing in-house white papers for my robotics team concerning how to run webservers off of robots, injectable runtime code, moving the business logic of the robot to a ""client-side"" so we could write the robot's logic in whichever way we chose (and separate it out from everything else).

As I'm finishing off college app submissions for Computer Science,  reading that post from earlier made me realize I really don't care about twiddling with algorithms. Looking up the requirements for a Software Engineering course at my state university made me realize that that's an underdeveloped field that I've essentially already covered. I like big, complex systems without all the bullshit that a Large Systems course would attach to it. I feel like I've already learned what an undergrad course would give to me -- so what in the world should I do?

Also, it sounds like I think I know everything. I remain adamant that that's not the case -- I trashed my attendance and significant portions of my GPA to learn and do what I've done, and remain woefully conscious of the fact I've really only hit the top of the iceberg in the deep sea of whatever-the-fuck-this-field-is. However, I also resolutely remain by the idea that I can pick up new technologies in weeks so I don't have to worry about knowing everything -- that everything will come in its due time, or when a client wants it."

 |Lightning one happened while being stupid. I was out with my girlfriend of the time surfing at Malibu Beach. We took to the waves because of the storm coming in and being a dumb surfer kid thought ""Big Waves = Awesome"" Lightning struck the water while I was paddling in and I got ""struck"". Luckily my GF wasn't in the water as well and she rescued me and got paramedics to get to me.
 |Lightning Two happened when I was in Oklahoma. My tires were slashed (typical bully crap) so I walked home in the rain. It picked up into a storm and being in a hay field I was the tallest thing around and got hit. Still have a light scar on my chest were they sewed me up.
 |The morgue incident happened in Santa Monica when I nearly drowned. A fault of the paramedics they black bagged me (something that's not supposed to happen) after I was fished out by same girlfriend and due to a major accident on the L.A. Freeway was rushed to the morgue. The Morgue Tech got my certificate finished within the two hours I was in the drawers (His Quote: ""I was on a roll filling these things out today"")

[Interesting concept.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfu1lf?context=5)|Thanks for asking! Let us tell you a bit about our own backgrounds before we dive into this question: Jason is a Buddhist, and believes in many Buddhist and Shinto principles. Josh was raised Conservative Jewish, but now identifies as Athiest. Greg identifies as Wiccan. We all come from quite different backgrounds and beliefs, so we each bring a unique perspective to the table.
[I think a big challenge for you will be the balance of respecting something many, many people take very seriously but at the same time challenging concepts or ideas those people consider absolute truths.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfu1lf?context=5)|With a game like this it would be way too easy to slip into a personal bias and have it come across as preachy or insensitive to a whole lot of people, so the very first thing we did was throw out EVERYTHING; all of our beliefs, knowledge, and preconceived notions about religion and mythology. From there, Josh spent 7 months just studying mythologies from around the world, and picking which religions and deities to include in the game. The most important thing to us was making sure that we don't step on any toes, so we took a long time learning about the personalities and actions of each deity so that we could make sure their modern incarnations would match the template and ""feel"" of their ancient counterparts.
[Are you using RPGmaker? If not, how do you plan to make it look like you haven't just used RPGmaker? Because it looks like you've just used RPGmaker. :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg686g?context=5)|We are indeed using RPGMaker as a framework. RPGMaker seems to get a lot of flack because it's readily available and inexpensive to use. A lot of people don't realize quite how flexible a program it is if you're willing to actually code. There are plenty of great games made using RPGMaker, including the critically acclaimed ""To the Moon.""
 |We have a ton of custom code in ruby that makes it stand apart, we're not just using the premade systems you find out of the box. We've added a lot custom features that we had to code.
 |We also use entirely custom character illustrations, sprites, and environmental art. Check out some of our illustrations by the very talented [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com/)
 |Basically, to us it makes no sense to dismiss a game just because of the engine it uses. There are plenty of bad flash games, but people don't automatically hate on flash games because they're made in flash. All we ask is that you judge us based on if Theocalypse is fun or not, not by what engine we use to make it :)
[How did you get into teaching games? Also, what's your past experience in games like? (before you began teaching\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwpl1?context=5)|Josh: I got into teaching games because I grew up loving games and always wanted to be a game developer. In high school and college I worked hard to learn a lot about game development, and was offered a job teaching kids because I had the necessary skills.
 |Jason got a degree in Video game art and design, and interned with several large game companies in their art department during college. After he graduated, he was offered a job teaching and it seemed like a good career move to gain further experience.
 |We all grew up on games (especially Greg, he's been playing games since before Jason or Josh were born), and have always had a special place for gaming in our hearts. We're gamers first and foremost, for us this studio is about making games that people want to play and making sure that they're quality and fun.
[Hmm, so the only real games industry experience you all have is an artists college internship at 'large companies'.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfxoz9?context=5)|We have more experience but we unfortunately can't list all of it because it was contract work the was under an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  We should add that Greg has over 25 years of programming experience, and really wish we could brag about our other achievements :(
[Personally, I think you should have kept your teaching jobs but heyho.  I wish you all the luck chasing your dream, like so many others before you.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfxoz9?context=5)|Thanks for the good wishes, we really appreciate it!
[What's going to happen if your Kickstarter fails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwld4?context=5)|If our kickstarter fails, we'll still be releasing Theocalypse. The kickstarter helps us add in a bunch of extra features we really want to see in the game, as well as it allows us to improve our sprite art and soundtrack. We've already spent a bunch of money on the character art (drawn by the very talented artist [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com/)), so that'll be gorgeous no matter what.
[Have you reached out to Youtube celebrities to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwld4?context=5)|We haven't reached out to any Youtube celebrities yet, as the game is still in a late alpha build and most won't talk about games until they're released. If you know any, or are one, who would like to talk about us, we'd love to hear from you!
[What pulls your game apart from the rest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfwld4?context=5)|We think that our setting, story, and tone of the game really sets us apart. Mythpunk is a genre that's not often explored, and we really wanted to make a game that delved deep into it. Tons of mythology, cool new takes on ancient characters, and serious choices and questions makes Theocalypse a game that stands on its own.
[Hey guys I'm wondering about the soundtrack; how you did it, who did it, how much music there is in the game?  Also, how much background in programming and design do you have to have to write and conceive the plots/worlds in video games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg6ptn?context=5)|As far as our background goes, Greg has over 25 years of programming experience and a degree in Computer Science, Jason has experience in professional game art as well as a degree in Video Game Illustration, and Josh holds a degree in Film Criticism and Film Production. Between the three of us, we've got quite a fair amount of actual experience. But how much is **necessary** to make a game? None.  If you have a good idea and know enough to make it a reality, do it. Everyone has to start somewhere.  If what you mean is how much experience do you need to get a job at a large gaming company, it varies from studio to studio. The most common requirement for an entry level position is to have worked on at least 1 to 2 professionally released (and sold) games.
[As a brand new studio with the gaming world as your oyster, why did you pick an RPG as your debut title?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdftweg?context=5)|We all grew up on RPG's, and have a deep-seated love for the Genre. From a financial standpoint it made sense as well, you don't need amazing (and expensive) 3D graphics to tell a good story. We wanted to make a fun to play game with an innovative story that was financially possible for a neophyte studio.
[What RPGs inspired you all to make an RPG and what do you pull from them or change? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfu303?context=5)|Our love of rpg's varies among each of us. Greg and Jason love the Final Fantasy series, and has stayed up more than a few times playing the Disgaea games into the first rays of morning light. Josh is a Shin Megami Tensei fan, and is really crazy about the Persona series. We really love the challenge of the oldschool rpg's, and we wanted to pay homage the strategy and difficulty level of the Persona games and Early Final Fantasy games. We're all fans of games with serious stories that make you think, and we tried to give Theocalypse (our game) a story that people will think about and remember!
[2\) What will set it apart from every other top down RPG that has ever existed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfz3u0?context=5)|1) The three of us were sitting around trying to think about what kind of game we wanted to make, and we were debating between a 4X and an rpg. As we kicked around ideas, someone threw out how cool it would be to see gods from every major religion playing a giant game of risk. From there we thought about it, refined it, set it in the near future, and Theocalypse was born.  2) We think the setting, story, and the battle system will set it apart. Not many games have a mythpunk setting, and we've done a ton of research so that we have a pretty good idea what we're writing about. The updated takes on ancient gods we find pretty awesome, and we promise the story isn't a cookie cutter ""hero saves the world from evil"" story. It's complex, it's got twists and turns, and the story changes based on the choices you make. We also think our changed battle system makes the game more strategic and fun than your average RPG, and all the classes in the game make sure that there's a playstyle for everyone.
[The story premise is cool. Were you guys inspired by any other stories mashing up old myths and gods with our present day world? It reminded me a bit of His Dark Materials which I loved and it makes me wonder if I'm missing out on other amazing stories with a similar premise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfuxtv?context=5)|We're big fans of the His Dark Materials series for sure! We also really enjoy ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman, and the Persona series of games. You should check em out, you'll love em!
[American Gods is in my Kindle queue! Persona I had a hard time getting into but I'll have to consider diving back in. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfv69i?context=5)|No problem! Like a lot of Jrpg's the Persona games start slow but really ramp up.
[Why does every indie dev have to do a Kickstarter campaign now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfuayn?context=5)|Because it helps improve overall quality , as well as expand the scope of their vision.  Let's say you have an idea for a game, but it'll cost you $5000 dollars to make. Game making is expensive and hard to break into; there are fees upon fees associated with game engines, incorporation, distribution, licensing fees, copyright and trademark feed, so on and so forth. If you can't code, do art, and produce music all be yourself, there are costs to literally everything.
 |Crowdfunding helps developers who don't have the means of a larger, established studio gain a foothold and produce content that is quality in a much shorter time than if they had to do it without help. Now, it doesn't mean that no indie developer produces good games without help, but it can be a very beneficial thing to getting a new developer off the ground.
 |If you don't believe in crowd-funding there's certainly no need to donate; but it's a great way for consumers to make their voices heard. If you like a certain idea, a fresh new way of thinking, or jsut new blood in the industry, throw some money into crowd funding. It shows the big guys that people are willing to pay for new concepts, and helps spur innovation!
[So if I'm looking to get into game design, any schools to go to suggestions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg6spg?context=5)|We'll repost what we put before: As far as schools go, it depends on where you are and what you're looking for. I would avoid the online colleges such as Westwood or Full-sail (no offense to those guys!), they're not particularly well respected in the gaming community. If you want to program, look at any traditional Computer Science courses or major at a university. For Art, Illustration or Graphic Design. If you want writing and design, a liberal arts degree such as Literature or Film is a good way to go. The other thing is make sure you have a solid portfolio. It's very important to companies looking at applicants!
 |If you let us know what area you're generally in we can help you narrow it down!
[Personal preference: Xbox One or PS4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfxm4s?context=5)|The diplomatic answer here is both, as our game will becoming out on both platforms. That said, we're mostly PC gamers...
[Were you guys friends prior to quiting and starting up the studio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzp77?context=5)|Josh and Jason met while teaching together, Jason and Greg knew each other prior. Josh met Greg through Jason, and then the trio was complete!
[How much do you guys plan and hope to make from selling your game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzp77?context=5)|All the money. All of it. Seriously though, we'd love to make enough to make bigger and more complex games in the future. We can't put an exact number on it, but so long as we can keep doing what we love we'd be very happy!
[Is the game going to be made solely by you 3 gents or will you be hiring/outsourcing some of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzt00?context=5)|2GZ Studios consists of the three of us and the game is written, designed, and built by us, but we're happy to have talented individuals who also are working on Theocalypse. Our character and environmental art is drawn by the very talented [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com) , and we're currently in talks with composers on the soundtrack. We'd love to be able to expand our team in the future, and one of the founding principles of 2GZ Studios is to help new people break into the world of gaming.
[Ive always wondered how indie-small time studios go about getting the word out about their game? Do you guys just spend a lot of time in social media (ala reddit\) or is there some other way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg06nw?context=5)|A lot of social media, a lot of word of mouth, indie gaming blogs, webcomics, and podcasts. When the game is released, we'll be able to get some larger press from review sites and release announcements.
[How do you feel about youtube LP'ers? Do you worry about your entire game being played and shown on youtube? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg0e8k?context=5)|1) We love exposure and getting the word out about our game! LP's are a great way for people to learn about new games!
 |2) If people want to watch LP's and learn the story that way, it's totally their choice. We're just happy that people find it cool enough to want to watch!
 |3) There are many, many choices throughout the game, especially over which gods to ally with or destroy. It's unlikely that the person playing the LP probably will have made all the same choices you would have, and the game can be replayed a bunch of times to see each different path. We'd be ecstatic if LP'ers did multiple LPs to see all the different outcomes!
[How do you guys feel about Piracy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg0k95?context=5)|Ah piracy, that's always a loaded question. The bottom line is people are always going to pirate games, and realistically overly zealous DRM is only going to hurt the paying consumer, not the pirates.
 |Here's the honest candid answer: whether piracy is good or bad, Developments studios are a still a business, and without revenue we can't eat and we can't continue to make games. We hope that people understand that developers aren't out to ""cheat"" them out of their hard earned money, but rather that we have to charge because we can't make games without the funding. If people pirate the game, we can't stop them, but we hope they'll find it in their hearts to buy a retail copy if they find they like it, so that we can keep on making games that will make them happy.
[Will this game touch on modern interpretations of 'God' or stick to ancient gods e.g. Roman/Greek/Pagan Gods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvh5y?context=5)|We don't want to give away quite too much, but the short answer is yes and yes. There are a few modern interpretations of spirituality as well as a few original gods, but we've adapted many pantheons into the game. We've taken the gods of old and put fresh new spins on them while keeping them true to their roots.
[Obviously I don't expect you to have copy and pasted real world religions into the game but it would be interesting to see which 'Gods' you have adapted into the game, or if you have started completely from scratch in this area. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvh5y?context=5)|Here's an incomplete list of some of the pantheons that show up: Native American, Mapuche, Aztec, Mayan, Egyptian, Guarani, Shinto, Hindu, Aboriginal, Lovecraftian, Eastern European, Traditional Chinese, Norse, Roman, Judeo-Christian, and more. We really wanted to cover a global scale and include more than just the ancient gods that are often used.
[That sounds fantastic! You've definitely got me excited. As soon as I can get my next payment I will be sure to back, the religious and philosophical element of this game gets me all giddy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvrx6?context=5)|Well thank you! We've really put in a lot of work to make sure everything is unique, well researched, and innovative! We have a hunch you'll really like where it all leads :)
[Have you ever considered making Youtube tutorials on game design? It'd make sense seeing how you guys were teachers before you formed the company and could help to promote any games you create, along with bringing in some extra revenue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg273b?context=5)|We'd actually love to do something like this in the near future, and would love to offer some kind of free online tutorials and classes to help future game designers learn the ropes! We're a tad busy with the game, but it's definitely something we'd like to do.
[Dont know if this has bee asked already but what advice would you give to someone interested in getting into making games, like is there certain program's, code languages or that sort of thing that are worth starting with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfva5b?context=5)|The top advice we can give is Stick To It! There are tons of talented people out there, but it's the ones who follow their dream, work hard, and refuse to give up who make it! Also, learning to code will never steer you wrong. Learn as much C++  and Java as you can, it'll take you far!
[Also no my next Holliday, should I save money on a hotel and just get a morgue box?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfva5b?context=5)|Jason advises against it; he says it's cold in the boxes so if you do go that route to bring a sweater.
[Awsome, thanks for the advice on both fronts and good luck with the kickstarter, it looks good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvpsz?context=5)|Happy to help! Keep working hard and following your dream!
[Read that in a George Takei voice. Anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfvwjs?context=5)|That was the intent! [If George Takei or William Shatner showed up in this thread I'd be sooo happy](http://www.livememe.com/msq5qtd)
[What are your all time favourite games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg27ge?context=5)|Jason: Chrono trigger, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Yoshi Story.
 |Greg: Civilization series, Baldur's Gate.
 |Josh: Persona 3, FFVII: Crisis Core, League of Legends! 
[What is the hardest part of game design? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfyxzn?context=5)|Hmmm, that's a really good question. We're going to cheat and give 2 answers.
 |1) Keeping your focus in mind. When we first started designing Theocalypse our drafts came together to form an open-world, 3D game that looked like the unholy amalgamation of Risk, Skyrim, and Final Fantasy that would have 100+ hours of game design, professional voice acting, and over a hundred hours of gameplay. We looked at it and realized that it was a complete mess, and we needed narrow our focus and concentrate our ideas to design the core gameplay. When game designing the sky is the limit, which is great, but sometimes you need to take a step back and ask yourself ""just because you can throw everything together, does that mean you should?"" Figuring out a concrete direction can be tough, and staying true to it even tougher, but it's necessary.
 |2) The second answer is probably QA. Stuff breaks, code decides to freak out, and there's often not an easily apparent answer as to why. Getting things to work properly can be pretty frustrating at times.
[As a games developer without a publisher, which production methodologies do you follow in order to keep work output at a steady pace without the stressful milestones that would normally be set by a publisher? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg5gmk?context=5)|In all honesty, we're literally hungry for it. We quit our jobs to do this full time, so if we don't get the game out and sell it, we don't eat. It's surprisingly good motivation xD.
[That's awesome, I'm glad you guys made such a great decision! I was kind of meaning more your production methods however, like agile methods with iteration, or do you follow a waterfall approach? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg79gs?context=5)|We're following agile methods with iteration.
[Where did you teach game design at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfv1t7?context=5)|InternalDrive Tech Camps! We loved every minute of working for ID, and even though it was time for us to spread our wings we hold them deep in our hearts &lt;3.
[I am seriously considering becoming a video game designer. Any tips on what high school classes or college that i should take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdgrned?context=5)|Coding coding coding! Learn computer science, it will very much help you on your entry into gaming.
 |College should depend on what you want to do in gaming. Writing? Take a Liberal Arts degree like Literature or Film. Programming? Computer Sciences. Art? Graphic Design or Illustration.
 |Hope this helps! Feel free to PM us if you have more questions!
[Will your game have retro style graphics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdgryfu?context=5)|Yes! The graphics are done in 16-bit style reminiscent of the early Final Fantasy games. All the character art is beautifully drawn by [Michael Matsumoto](http://www.michaelmatsumoto.com/). They style is intentional, and we hope you like it!
[That sounds pretty awesome. Why do you think so many indie developers use that style of graphics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdhiexa?context=5)|Mainly because it's cheap, easy, and holds a nostalgia factor for a lot of us (us included). Full 3D models made in Maya or another program take a lot of time and effort to design, as well as you have to animate them after. Sprites are easily created and require much less work to bring to life. For an indie developer, the cost of more advanced graphics can be extremely prohibitive.
 |AS far as the style goes, a lot of people like oldschool sprite graphics. It reminds them of a simpler time, and of the games they grew up on!
[You should link to your kickstarter in your post. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfuch0?context=5)|We didn't want to come across like we're just after cash, but we'll put it up there!
[The concept seems ok, but including modern religions will create a huge shitstorm. One suggestion: Add Finnish gods. Also read Kalevala.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfzf04?context=5)|We understand how important people's beliefs are, and we're being very careful to not step on any toes or insult any religions. We're making sure that characters are portrayed in the way that their own culture views them.
 |We'll definitely check Kalevala out!
[I was looking to go into the field of computer science/game design what college or courses would you recommend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg0val?context=5)|That depends on what you want to do. Do you want to write stories and characters? A liberal arts degree such as Film or Literature is a good start. Programming? Computer Science courses are a must. Art and concept design? Illustration, Graphic design and studio art are all good ways to go.
 |We have never, ever, ever heard someone say that taking Computer Science classes were a bad idea though. If you can code, it'll give you a HUGE advantage in the industry.
 |What country/state are you in? We can give you a more personally tailored answer.
[I have taken basic and i am taking JAVA this year (USA,New Jersey\). Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdg1ekj?context=5)|Hmmm, Rutgers is near you and pretty good. If you have no cost restrictions, then Princeton as well.
[How often do you masturb- ^^ah ^^not ^^worth ^^it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfusiq?context=5)|Oh Myyy...

AmA's should not be fundraisers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qrvm2/were_three_guys_who_left_our_jobs_teaching_game/cdfveoy?context=5)|We added it because a few folks asked for it. We're mainly here to answer questions and hopefully get people excited for a new gaming studio. We certainly don't want to be pushy or make you feel like we're begging!

1qx58h,25,2013-11-18,#Woody,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qx58h/woody/,"My best friend's older sister is pretty Instafamous.

Caroline has always been fashion-forward and very self-aware. Ever since I've known my best friend we've either admired or resented her sister, with little middle ground. Any time my friend would have sleepovers we'd all listen with our ears pressed against the wall to all of Caroline's multiple hours-long phone calls and listen to her flirting and giggling. This was when she was in *Jr. High*. We hardly ever saw Caroline when she was in high school because she'd always be off with one of her many suitors, or all her friends at some underage club.

Now that Instagram has become a ""thing"" Caroline has bested us all at that, as well. She does the weekday themes, and hashtag-this and hashtag-that. Caroline was big on the leggy shots in a bathtub, or holding a beer up next to her giant sunglasses by a pool, or snapping a quick photo of her half-eaten salad - #*sofull*.

Instagram has become an epidemic. It's everywhere with its shitty filters and the paragraphs of tags. Caroline was no exception to this (truthfully, neither was I, but I'm not as fond of my face as she is), and now she has nearly 5k followers, the majority of them people she's never met, all liking photos of her bellybutton ring and the new bikini she bought.

This past August Caroline moved to New York for an internship. She never calls home, so my friend's family has hardly heard anything from her. If they want to reach Caroline they just log onto Facebook or her Instagram and make sure she's alive. Eventually she'll respond to their missed calls with a short text: call u l8r! xo

Then, sometime in the middle of October, my friend got a call from Caroline early in the morning. It was sometime around 3 AM, she told me, and Caroline sounded frightened. She was telling my friend all about this guy, just some guy she'd met at a book signing she'd gone to, and how he hadn't left her alone for days.

When my best friend called Caroline back the next afternoon she didn't answer, but a few hours later insisted everything was fine through texts, and that she and this guy were going out for dinner that night.

Rolling her eyes, my friend turned her phone to me that night and showed me Caroline's Instagram. It was a photo of two plates and candles in between, and two glasses of red wine - #*classybitch* #*wino* #*Woody*

We both assumed Woody was this creep she'd been referring to. My friend joked he must have had enough cash to sway Caroline's decision and over the next few days there were more photos and more hashtags to come.

Caroline hadn't called my friend back, and, not unsually, she wasn't returning any of their mother's phone calls, either. Still, her Instagram was active with pictures of two pairs of feet propped up on Caroline's coffee table with #*cozy* #*Woody*. Another, the next day, was a picture of a cabin with a long porch surrounded by woods. Caroline's car was parked next to the cabin and it was tagged #*cabininthewoods* #*vacay* #*Woody*.

Nothing was too unusual until my friend and I were browsing at the mall and she showed me a picture of Caroline lying on a mattress. Her hand was propped under her head, her eyes closed, and she was wearing a plain white dress that was strangely out of season for Caroline. #*sweetdreams* #*Woody*

""It's so fucking weird,"" my best friend had said. ""It's like she's going to marry this guy, or something. And how sleazy is that, to just snap a picture of her and put it on *her* Instagram?""

At first I'd assumed my friend was jealous. We were both jealous of Caroline a lot of the time. I mean, she'd gotten to go to NYC, she was gorgeous, and my best friend's parents were practically paying for her to live in her apartment.

The following week there were countless calls being made to Caroline's phone. My friend had pointed out how odd Caroline's new guy was and her mom went into full-panic mode. This time, however, Caroline didn't even reply in texts. It was like this guy was brainwashing her. Maybe he'd convinced her to cut ties with her family? She hadn't updated her Facebook in a while, either.

A couple of days went by without any word when there was another picture. This time it was of wooden beams, a concrete wall, and stacked boxes. #*Woody*

""Is she moving in with him?"" My friend wondered.

Then another the same day. This time the picture was of the same mattress as before, but it was in a corner on the floor. Next to the mattress was an iron spike that had been lodged into the cement, and around it was latched a thick chain. The chain was pulled taut out of the picture. #*Woody*

This sort of out-of-the-ordinary situation, when reading it in this context, seems like a cause for alarm. At the time, it was definitely alarming, but didn't seem like enough to report to my friend's mom. People were still liking these photos. That last one had at least 300-something likes before my friend even showed me.

Over the next few days the pictures continued, but nothing stuck out until the one of a stove with a pan that had two eggs frying in it, and two mugs of coffee on the counter next to it. Behind the cups there was a bottle of chloroform. #*Woody*

We told Caroline's mom and then the police. There was a huge debacle and the cops telling them there was nothing they could do about it. These photos didn't prove a single thing. They were obscure, and more than likely a ploy for attention. Besides, the office said, 700 people *liked* it.

My friends family packed up a few bags and bought plane tickets. If anything, Caroline would have a big surprise when she got home that evening.

That day I kept up with Caroline's Instagram account. The final photo before I got a call from my friend was of two pairs of feet side-by-side. One pair was shackled at the ankles, the other in shiny brown loafers. The shackled feet were bare and pale and bruised, and the toenails were painted a hot pink. #*cozy* #*love* #*Woody*

The call that night was unsettling. My friend was tearful and told me that Caroline's apartment was unlocked when they got there. The inside was trashed and there was spoiling food in the garbage with flies everywhere and dishes piled. She said it was like Caroline hadn't been home in weeks.

Their family went to the police in NYC and filed a missing person's report a week ago. Their father got himself a hotel room and both my friend and her mom came back. I haven't seen either of them, and the whole family has been trying to deal with this privately, but all of Caroline's friends on Facebook have been leaving concerned messages, and everyday there's a new photo, with new likes and always signed #*Woody*.

1qwu3x,4,2013-11-18,Should I leave my job? Details inside,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qwu3x/should_i_leave_my_job_details_inside/,"I have been working at a company for almost a year now. I feel as though my work environment is passive aggressively hostile. 

I began as an intern, and during my time as an intern I was drunkenly propositioned for sex by the lead dev (who is the person I directly report to, this was after a work party where we all were given a lot of shots of alcohol). He called me cute, so I thanked him and returned the compliment. He then suggested that we stop beating around the bush and hook up. I tried to deflect the question and instead ask if he wanted to hang out and watch tv. He never responded- maybe he passed out? I guess that wasn't the right response, because it might sound like I was agreeing to sex. Let me be clear: I WAS NOT. As dumb as it sounds, I just wanted to become friends with a coworker. My crime isn't wanting sex, but rather being desperate for friends.

Anyway, the day after I guess he sobered up and immediately texted me to apologize. I told him it was ok and to not worry about it. I'm sure he felt kind of embarassed after so I tried not to make a big deal over it. 

I never reported this to HR because I didn't want to get him in trouble and he apologized anyway. However, I do wonder if he is telling other coworkers a different version of the events as a preemptive way to save himself in case I ever do tell HR... I think it's too late to report to HR anyway, since this was almost 6 months ago and I no longer have the text messages in question. Working with him isn't an issue anyway, we work together fine more or less.

That's not the issue why I may need to leave my company though...

My boss gives me dirty looks. He clearly does not like me. I thought that this was something that would blow over, maybe after a month or so if I continued working and kept out of sight, but it keeps continuing. There was even a time where he kind of hit me, across the back of my neck. He does not respond to any of my emails, and any time I ask him a question in person I can tell he doesn't want to talk to me.

Now, it's a very passive aggressive thing he is doing. He acts nice in front of everyone but every now and then while he is talking to me, his face changes and he has a look of disgust on his face. Just a split second. It's a micro-expression that reveals a person's real feelings. Everyone does it but most people are respectful enough to keep their face in check. I have been bullied a lot in school... and I recognize a lot of the same actions. I finally told HR, but the HR person didn't believe me. Well, they were understanding and listened to me and told me to come back if it happens again, but I think they think I am just imagining it. I am not. I might be socially awkward and nerdy, but I sure as hell can recognize dirty looks and passive aggression when I see it. Especially if it has been going on for the past 4-5 months.

It makes me incredibly anxious to go into work. I don't want to have to see my boss, let alone talk to him. I actually hate going to work now. I am very rarely assigned work and when I am, it is often low-level stuff. I feel incredibly alienated and under-utilized. The only possible friend I had at work died in a freak accident.

I don't know what to do, or how to proceed. I feel like I am being forced out of my job, without actually being forced out. I am afraid I will not be able to find another job as this is my first real job. I am afraid that I will not be able to work in this industry because my boss' dislike may follow me to another company. I think I need to leave, but I feel like I am stuck here, unhappy and slightly scared."
1qwpi8,1,2013-11-18,Should I do undergrad research?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1qwpi8/should_i_do_undergrad_research/,"Hey all,

I just transferred to a 4 year out of CC and am taking my first chemE course, material + energy balances, and I did quite well on the second exam. The professor emailed me afterwards and recommended me to a grad student doing research and I wondering if I should try to do it (Still have to do an interview but I'm sure the recommendation helps). I feel like I won't really know much of anything or be able to do much which means a) Won't do much or b) do really boring, menial things.

Is it still worth doing for the experience and will doing things like this help me get internships later? I don't know too much about the research but it's on fluidized beds.

Thanks!"

:--|:--
[As a freshmen undergrad engineering student what advice do you have for me and others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgtm99?context=5)|Pursue internships, get to know your professors, seek leadership oppys in campus activities, get good grades, learn to code.  And frankly, you'll never have so many opportunities for sexual (mis)adventure, so live it up a bit!
[As a mechanical engineer is coding that important? and well see how the other sexual misadventures go, already had one ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgtqyj?context=5)|Yes, coding will become increasingly important.  And at the very least MATLAB.  Only one misadventure so far -- you've had three months already, stop wasting time ;-)
[What is the right way to learn/teach coding to aspiring engineering students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgvm1a?context=5)|It depends on the student, though generally I believe you learn by doing.  If I were starting-out, I'd think of a tool/app worthwhile to me, and try to figure out how to build it.
[I don't know how the male/female ratio is in America, but it's pretty low here in Canada... so by misadventure do you mean ""experimenting""?  Jokes. Jokes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgy8ni?context=5)|Ha, well yes the male/female ratio works against you if you're a straight male engineer.  But it's your job to find a solution :-)
[Why are big companies like AT&amp;T, Merck, Pfizer getting out of the R&amp;D business? Seems like fundamental R&amp;D requires deep pockets. Who has the deep pockets now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgpykl?context=5)|Big companies aren't very good at allocating R&amp;D capital.  The VCs do a much more efficient job, and the entrepreneurs have much greater incentive to innovate on their own.
[I wanted to know, out of the freshmen that come into college, what types of students usually drop out/don't make the grade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhis1r?context=5)|Good for you!  RIT is a good program, and I'm impressed that you're already taking classes there at your age.  The first two years of engineering are the most difficult -- physics, chemistry, and math through differential equations.  These are abstract and difficult classes.  The students who don't do well are those who had an easy time w/ high school material, so never really developed good study and time management skills.  Work on those now, so that you're disciplined.  No one can float through DE.
[Also, do you know anything about how colleges accept Engineering students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhis1r?context=5)|As for admissions, test scores, GPA, difficulty of courses taken, AP credit are all important.  If you already have college credit (and good grades) in the intro engineering classes, you'll be in VERY good shape.
[Basically, any tips for a kid looking to study Mechanical or Chemical Engineering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhis1r?context=5)|You sound bright -- take a look at the top schools -- MIT, Stanford, Cal, Caltech, U o Ill, U of Mich, etc.
[What are your thoughts on the tuition bubble in higher education? Do you think the cost of today's college degree is worth the amount of debt the typical student accumulates to earn it? If you think this is a problem, what can be done to address it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgqcj9?context=5)|I think this is a huge problem.  Degrees in my field -- engineering and specifically computer engineering -- are still worth it.  There are many of career opportunities and salaries are pretty good.  On the other hand, getting a liberal arts degree from a private university doesn't make much economic sense.
[Can you think of any factors that would hinder innovation in the field of, say, structural engineering? I'm wondering if there are any similarities to cases in the health/hospital sector where doctors/surgeons actively fight new methods of practice as it would make them 'out-dated'.  There is also a lot of pride connected to ones field of expertise (neurology, radiology, etc.\) making it hard for some to function in an interdisciplinary setting, which, as i understand, is getting more and more important to find new and better solutions. Any comments on this? Have you had experience with mentality such this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgwbid?context=5)|You hit the nail on the head.  Look at a person's self-interest.  In the surgeon example, he/she learned a certain technique during residency/fellowship.  They're highly unlikely to ever change -- and there's little pressure to change.  We see so much innovation w/ the Internet exactly b/c there's a huge incentive to find something new and better.
[Do you have any tips for presenting a new niche in a company's market, such as proposing adding a new sub-division that caters to a specific product?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgq46s?context=5)|Are you familiar with The Innovator's Dilemma or The Innovator's Solution?  Both good books to read.  Basically large companies tend to make products with more and more features, pricing many new customers out of the market.  That's fertile territory for finding new niches.
[My goal is to study marketing after I finish my major in Japanese, working with companies that have business in Japan and trying to find new niches for specific companies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgqeww?context=5)|Japan is a great place to spot emerging trends, and introduce them to other markets.
[I saw that you recommended learning to code. I'm studying civil engineering, and don't think I'll have more than one coding class. As a CE, do you suggest learning to code? If so, what language should begin with? Could you direct me to some good resources so I can learn on my own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh10fi?context=5)|In this day and age, I think every technical person needs to learn to code to some degree.  MATLAB may be useful to your profession, as well as various simulation packages.  Learning to code apps can set you apart from the competition.  Why not code an app, for ""fun"", just for yourself.  Create something that solves a problem for you.  Share it with your friends -- see what you learn about coding, and also see what you learn about creating a product.  If you take it seriously, I predict you'll learn a lot.  GL!
[Yeah, I would probably consider it more of a hobby if I pushed myself to learn it... Any leads on free resources to teach myself? Books you could recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh8e5o?context=5)|Code Academy seems to work well for people.  Or go to Amazon and find what books are popular for what you want to learn.  Yes, think about it as a hobby.  Build something fun for yourself, your friends, your gf or bf, your mom.  
[I am still researching on Olin! By the way, which US school would you recommend for undergraduate Computer Science? And one that is not incredibly difficult to get into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgwuq3?context=5)|Large state school -- Illinois, MSU, etc.  Not easy to get-in, though the education is on par with Stanford/MIT/Cal.
[Just curious as to how much background you have for admissions?  My reason is this:  I'm a 30 year old man working in the chemical industry for the last 8 years.  I am currently a research and development technician for a major chemicals manufacturer but I feel that I have hit a peak in my career and would like to surpass it.  I have taken 3 years of college before but left due to financial and family responsibilities (I didn't get anyone knocked up I just had to help take care of my dad...sick at the time, has since passed\).  I also wasn't that great of a student (GPA 2.4\).  I am intending to take classes at a local community college in the hopes of getting my mind back in the game and possibly getting some grades up to apply for a four year university for Chemical engineering.  I work with many alumni of the intended university.  Will my employment background play a role in my application for college acceptance?  Do you have any advice for what I can do to increase my chances of getting in (other than the obvious - boost my GPA for the core courses required for the program\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgzndo?context=5)|If you're applying for U/G, then your GPA, test scores, and activities matter the most.  Sorry, based on what you posted, it doesn't sound great.  You should emphasize your work experience, how you have grown, what you have learned, and what you plan to do.  GL!
[I am in highschool and doing Running start and I am pretty sure I want to be a mechanical engineer.  Do you have any advice into how to get into an engineering program? Also how important is work experience and how can I get it while in college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh898v?context=5)|Admissions to an u/g program mostly depends on test scores, GPA, and taking plenty of math and science in HS.  AP courses would help too.  Internships are indeed important in finding a job, depending on your field and geography, you might even be able to work part-time for a technical company during school.  Good luck!
[What do you think about the Georgia Tech scandal that the NYTimes highlighted? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgum8n?context=5)|Yes I mentioned that below.  I don't know anything beyond what's stated in the article.  Using those facts, it seems like everything was above-board.  Look, if a university wants to foster economic activity, then money will change hands!  They seem to have received consideration for IP, etc.  It seems difficult to believe that many other professors on that campus will start companies soon.
[What do you think sets certain startups apart from their peers?  Is it just a *better* product or something more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgs6od?context=5)|All sorts of possibilities.  Better understanding of the customer, superior execution, creativity in design/execution, more profitable business model.  All are important, but it essentially returns to the customer.  Why do young people use Snapchat so much?  It's fun, and provides them something they didn't have before.
[I'm a senior in high school and currently applying to colleges. What characteristics do you see in engineering students that set them apart from scientists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhq9ev?context=5)|It's really what motivates you -- scientists want to discover new things, while engineers want to build new things.  ""Pure"" science is difficult these days, b/c new discoveries typically require huge investments of resources.  Engineering, due to the Internet and other technologies, provides many places to innovate and truly influence the world.  Make sense?
[What do you think about the alternative energy field.  Is there still value in the research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgr482?context=5)|Most certainly.  Bill Gates has made major investments with his money (not the foundation) into the field.
[Specifically, how do you feel about the future of ultracapacitors for energy storage if graphene can increase their energy density?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgv3o1?context=5)|Not my field of expertise.  Flux capacitors?
[What do you think of companies like Modular Robotics, ATOMS, and littleBits that make it easier for kids and adults to add mechanical and electronic components to their traditional toys? Do you think these are more or less helpful at getting people excited about engineering than slightly more complicated kits like Arduino?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhal29?context=5)|My children really enjoy LEGO robotics.
[As a recent business major, how could I contribute or be a part of these expanding start-ups? I currently work a typical office job but I have always had a mind for the market, budgeting, etc but not much in terms of revolutionary ideas or leadership skills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgrpi9?context=5)|Depends on your geography.  And for most start-ups these days, you need some sort of computer skills.  Can you learn to code?   People do it from books, Code Academy, all sorts of places.  And if you're going to jump-in, Google ""Python"", and see what has the best reviews.  It might sound like a long-shot, but I know two very successful CTOs who started just this way!
 |Another idea for you is to try to find the most customer-facing job you can.  Sales, sales support or something like that.  You'll learn how the customer's needs can be better filled, and suggest how your company can create new products (intrapreneurship), or you can prepare to go on your own as an entrepreneur.
[Lately I've seen a lot of universities open innovation centers/hubs for entrepreneurs which I find amazing to help develop technologies but on the other hand they have such high restrictions on licensing technologies the professors have developed, why the contrast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgsj51?context=5)|It's a difficult balance.  The university wants to stimulate innovation and economic development, but also wants to retain some economic ownership.  In my opinion, Stanford does it best -- they make it very easy for students and faculty to start companies -- they take some $$$, but they also wisely understand that they're investing in an ecosystem that will repay them many times over.  To see the wrong way to do it, look at this guy who got raided by armed officers from the GBI -- [Link to www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/technology/reaching-for-silicon-valley.html)
[Im on my last stretch in an MBA program with an ""entrepreneurship and innovation"" specialty. I want to start chatting with engineering students with awsome ideas, in hope that i'll find, the ""idea crazy guy"". What is the best way to approach folks with that profile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhg6g2?context=5)|You ask a common question -- I hear it so much that I often wonder why no one has created better tools to help facilitate this (hint, hint).  For now, I suggest attending business plan competitions, networking with your friends, audit an innovation class in the engineering program, etc.  Also, as an MBA, what do you think you can add to the team?  Product mgmt, sales, market research, branding, PR?
[How could one go about launching a startup with minimal financial capital - how much capital would they need, what types of internet startups would be most realistic, and finally what would you say is the key to a successful startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgrs8k?context=5)|We live in a Golden Age of startups!  You can create an app for very little capital -- quick and easy.  What is the key to a successful start-up?  Start with understanding customer needs.  Ask your friends, your family, complete strangers -- use their imaginations and think of things they want their smartphone to do for them.  Then make it :)
[If I wanted to make an iPhone app what kind of programming and design background would I need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgs1c7?context=5)|You can start pretty simply here.  The best way to learn is by doing.  Make an app for yourself to do something useful.  Build from there -- [Link to developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html)
[If i'm going to learn a code language, where do I start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhmfw0?context=5)|Think of a tool/app you want to use for yourself -- something to entertain yourself, or improve your life in some way.  Go to Code Academy and figure out how to build it.  Then build something for someone else.  You'll create some cool things, learn to code, and perhaps stumble upon a great idea!
[WHat are some tips to study well ?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh43zc?context=5)|Allocate 3 hours outside class for every 1 hour inside.
 |Read the text, and try sample problems before the professor covers the material.
 |Find sample solutions, work on the problems yourself, and only look at the solutions after you hit a dead-end.
 |Form a study group and work with other students to learn the material.
 |Visit office hours as much as needed, and ask your professor for assistance.
 |After you learn material, self-quiz.  For example, before you go to bed, ask yourself the key concepts you learned, and try to recite the answers.

[How do you feel about the difficulty of Engineering programs at the University level? Do you think it's too hard, too easy, too rushed for students? I'd like to hear what you think based on your experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhl61p?context=5)|Sorry to hear about your experience.
[How would an individual get access to funds to get their ideas started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgqxhi?context=5)|It depends on the idea.  If it's technology oriented, there a plenty of Angel Investors out there.  Try taking your idea to someone who has done well in your industry and persuade them to invest in you!
[Engineers =/= salespeople.  Selling an idea is not what people like me do best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgs06p?context=5)|Good engineers recognize each other.  You need to persuade people you've found a good opportunity, not ""sell"" them into doing something they don't want to do.  Zuck, Page, Brin, Gates -- none of them are ""salesmen.""
[What do you look at the most when admitting a student for a PhD program? Do professors pay attention to emails sent by prospective students- do students increase their chances of admission by emailing profs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdguqa7?context=5)|We track summary information -- previous university, GPA, test scores, country of citizenship, language skills, recommendations, fit with research interests.  I get so many random emails -- if you want to approach me, please find a mutual acquaintance, it really helps cut through the noise.
[My SO is a freshman mechanical engineer and is having a tough time with programs like LabView and Matlab.  Any usefull websites to help her learn it or any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh6fik?context=5)|Mathworks provides a lot of online resources.  She should also form a study group, work with her TA, and professor.
[Do you think something is wrong with how institutions teach engineering? What was your solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh215g?context=5)|There's plenty wrong, but here's an interesting idea being tested at the H.S. level -- the flipped classroom.  I wonder how this might apply to higher education?  [Link to opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/turning-education-upside-down/?_r=0)
[The trouble is that her teacher really isn't doing much in the way of teaching them how to actually use the software from her perspective and the TA's can't reveal them too much and can't take the same amount of time to teach that the teacher can.  But thank you for the resource!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdh9r9j?context=5)|Sorry to hear that -- I hate when teachers don't do their jobs.  Can she form a study group?  Can she afford a tutor (or barter expertise in something else to get tutoring)?
[What field are you in (computer eng, EE, ME, etc\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdgqwd6?context=5)|Typically Internet, though my students range across all engineering disciplines, and beyond.

[I'm currently a Junior at Arizona State University studying computer systems engineering. Many people say that it gets easier after graduation. Is this really true? What is the engineering life like after graduation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhqa19?context=5)|Happy to share my knowledge, but need to know more about where you see yourself going.  To a start-up?  Silicon Valley?  A larger, more established company?
[Either silicon valley or a more established company. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1quudc/iama_engineering_professor_teaching_innovation_at/cdhswt8?context=5)|The hours are long in SV, but the perks are pretty amazing.  Good salaries, stock options, tons of free gourmet food, and other great perks that are hard to imagine (massages, parties, on-site medical, valet service).  Very generally speaking, the hours are easier in larger companies, and they don't offer the same perks.  Either way you'll still work pretty hard, but you'll get a lot more in return than a letter on a piece of paper.

As you can imagine, time is one of my problems; I have a long commute of 1.30h - 2.00h and sometimes (at least once or twice per week) I have to do overtime, so I have little time to study.

Furthermore, I am somewhat tired of the job. I am learning bad coding practices and I do not feel I am progressing in my career. We do not use version control, we do not have automated tests, so before each release on production we deploy copying each file to our ""testing environment"" (windows 7 machine) and test during the day. Our deploy is: get WinSCP and transfer one by one all files. We do a diff on each file that has been modified by the team (of two, + boss) to check and merge changes. I am underpaid, ~26000$ per year. I also have other tasks besides programming, for example opening tickets for networking access or something like that, which takes time and the deadlines remains to be the same, so I am often behind it.

I have made some mistakes, and they were fine with the mistakes, so is like I feel I owe them that. I tried to convince myself that I could get a part time job, but I do not feel confident about my skills/knowledge and also I got used to the lifestyle I wanted as teenager (nothing big), just have money to buy my gadgets, go a lot to the cinema, avoid public transport as I have my own car, pay my VPS, etc...

What should I do? Leave job and just study? Part time job? Study and then internships?

Thank you very much in advance."

I am a senior in high school, and for the last couple of months, I have been thinking about majors that interest me.  
  
I was interested in going into pharmacy, but the current state of pharmacy, as well as the future of pharmacy, has me very worried. Pharmacy is currently over-saturated, and many people will predict that this trend will continue for many years on. Although I do know that no one can definitely predict the future/outcome, it has me very worried. Pharmacy has been something that I have always wanted to go into, but finishing six years of school just to come out unemployed and with six figures of debt worries me.  

Because of this reason, I have considered going into med school, but:  
1) I'm not sure if I can handle 8 years of intense education + 3-4 years of internship (working 16 hour shifts, supposedly)  
2) med school is also very expensive  
3)I do not know of all of the career paths available to med students, but anything surgical-related will be difficult for me.  
  
I do have one definite back up major, which is computer science, but it does not interest me as much as pharmacy.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you

Then when I got to college, the first year I was taught purely C++.

My second and (currently) third year though have been focused completely on C. Now, I've gotten pretty good at C and being able to use it but somewhere along the ride learning C I've completely lost touch with OOP.

I cannot for the life of me remember much about OOP, things such as classes and methods and how things are set up and work with OOP.

I need to get back into the OOP world especially now that I am beginning to search for internships and careers. I know it sounds very basic for where I'm at in my education and that's why I'm so frightened at how lost I feel.

I know the very basics, I would be able to write a (fairly simple) program in Java if you asked me to but it would take me quite a while to figure it out and I would have a difficult time understanding it again.

I once had a great handle on all things Object Oriented but this track in C has gotten me so lost.

Any help would be super greatly appreciated!"

1qxzy0,2,2013-11-18,I'm a bit concerned for my safety,Sloph,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1qxzy0/im_a_bit_concerned_for_my_safety/,"It seems stupid to me, the impetus for my present suicidality. I have an intense loathing and fear of bureaucracy. Every time I know I have to deal with a bank, an agency, anything like that, it seems like the end of the world. 

In February, I had to withdraw from school because of PTSD; I was unable to go to classes in any capacity. So I thought I'd give myself a bit of time and jump back into it. That was to be this summer, in which I worked at the IT place I had been working at, and stayed at the house where I was sexually assaulted. Perhaps because I was not yet emotionally ready to live a normal life, or perhaps because the house I was staying at was a very bad choice for me at the time, I couldn't handle the summer. I quit and moved back home with my parents because I'm a pathetic sack of shit. This left me with some unpaid bills and a lot of stuff at the university that I need to take care of (financial aid, registrar shit, things of that ilk). 

It's been almost a year dealing with PTSD, and I feel like I've stagnated. I am self-aware enough to know that lately I've been dealing with depression, probably because I can't get back to my normal life. When I was at the top of my game, I was handling 12+ hour days with a drive and passion that I'm afraid I'll never be able to regain. 

So I'm at the point now at which I have to take care of all the bureaucratic stuff that I let slide. I need to contact the registrar to let them know that I haven't dropped out. I need to contact financial aid to see what's available for me now. I need to find suitable housing for Spring. Perhaps I need to get a loan at a bank to fund my life until I finish school (just one more semester, plus a summer internship, and I have two degrees). And I need to register for classes, obviously late (unpaid bills from the school because I dropped out). I might not be able to get the classes I need, which means that PTSD will have pushed back my life two years. I've always wasted one year, and the thought of losing another (to employ litotes) is not exceptionally desirable to me. 

And this makes me feel very suicidal. Yeah, I'm scared about going back to school, about having flashbacks in class. But right now, that doesn't scare me as much as trying to do everything I need to do to be able to get back into classes. This always happens; I put off the bureaucratic garbage until I need to deal with it all at once, and it feels like too much for me to handle. I keep putting it off, because I hate it oh so much. And then I feel suicidal. I know cognitively that if I just take it one step at a time, it won't be so bad, that it won't kill me. But that doesn't resonate emotionally. 

I don't think I can muster the courage to make those calls, to do what I need to do to reclaim my life. It makes me feel worthless and pathetic. Because this has been hanging over me, I haven't been able to enjoy anything, engage myself in anything. 

So I'm feeling suicidal. I've felt this way enough in the past to know that I'm probably going to make it through the night, but I also know that this feeling is going to persist until I take care of everything that needs to be done. I don't know if anybody has ever felt the degree of alienation I feel when dealing with bureaucracies, and I know it sounds really silly, but it feels like too much for me. I've already cut tonight (the nice, classic cutting that I did frequently about 5 years ago, primal, rage-filled slices, in which I cut so much my body shuts off the blood flow to my arm because of the blood loss. It feels fantastic, looks like art to me), but obviously the problem isn't solved. I still need to make those phone calls, meet with those people, and try to organize all of the bullshit that needs to be organized to get back to my normal life. And I don't think I can do it.

I really want to give up so I don't have to deal with this stuff. I don't even know what I hope to obtain by posting this, but I guess making my misery known has some sort of inherent value. 

I don't have a plan to off myself. But I don't know how I can deal with the way that I'm feeling. "

I'm an Illinois Resident transfer student who was admitted to UIUC's CS program for Spring 2014.  I've also been accepted to UIC's program and I wanted to get your opinion on weather's UIUC is worth the extra ~20k I'd pay in housing/food/driving over 2 years.

I would basically be paying no commuting costs for UIC because I am in a unique situation where my dad works downtown and I could drive with him everyday and live at home.

I know the top companies recruit from UIUC and UIUC's program is ranked 5th in the country whereas UIC is 57, but I've heard from other that where you went to school doesn't matter after you 1st or 2nd job.  Also based on UIC's COE career fare page it seems like Microsoft, Motorola, etc also recruit from UIC, but no Google/Apple like UIUC for internships.


I've also noticed from UIC's curriculum that there's a lot more math required for the CS degree than UIUC's curriculum.  

Can any UIUC CS students and alumni advise me on if it was worth the extra money going to UIUC or if I should just go to UIC and save the extra money (how have you seen the UIC CS alumni fare in the career world compared to yourself and other UIUC alumni?).

When you guys were doing your internships, did you see many UIC CS students as well?

I'm really interested in electrical power (electric machines as well). I'm also doing undergraduate research for a professor (no works published unfortunately).

The main things I've heard that engineering universities look for in grad students is:

*   GPA (is it extremely important?)
*   Undergraduate Research (many forums I've read say that you should have your name published on some work of some sort)
*   Some type of major-related work experience (whether it be at school or for a company)
*   A good GRE test score (how good is ""good?"")
*   Three letters of recommendation from employers, professors, etc

I guess the main point of this post is to ask what to prepare for when applying to universities.  Thanks for reading.

[Hey Charlamagne, I love the breakfast club, and have been a big fan of yours ever since I heard you speak on Kanye being a walking contradiction.(I still love Ye, but like you I don't like Kanye Kardashian\) I respect your opinion on a lot of things, and thanks to your words of wisdom(I can see Envy and Angela shaking their heads already\) I'm living my own truth in ways I wasn't before watching you on youtube everyday while on break. I've agreed with 95% of what you've said, and furthered my understanding of hip hop culture, and rap music, but there is one issue I don't feel you on, which leads me to my question.  In your interview with Talib Kweli, you say that you believe that men should be allowed to have multiple wives, but women should not be allowed to have multiple husbands. While I agree that western civilization has trouble accepting polygamy as a viable option for marriage, and that consenting adults should be allowed to partake in polygamy if they want, I don't understand why you think Men should be allowed a right that women aren't. In the interests of gender equality, and assuming that polygamy was legalized tomorrow, shouldn't men and women have the same rights to have mulitple wives/husbands? In regards to polygyny, or polyandry, isn't it an unfair double standard to say Men can partake in this, but women can't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditr3v?context=5)|It's as simple as this. When guys have multiple women we are considered macks, pimps, when chicks bang a lot of guys they are hoes. I didn't create those rules. It's the law of nature!!
[Do you find it interesting that sometimes (well a lot of the time\) when you do interviews on The Breakfast Club, Envy doesn't really know a lot about the talent he's interviewing? Do you think he should do a little more research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditv3n?context=5)|Envy does do research. He's just an idiot.
[What are your thoughts on Kanye's new video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditpbe?context=5)|Terrible. It looks like something that should air on public access television. It looks like one long Vine Video. That video could have been dope if he would have put Jay Pharoah and Nasim Pedrad in starring as him and Kim. Shit would have been funny.
[Glad I caught one so early, what is the funniest thing that has ever happened to you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiu3qb?context=5)|Funniest thing ever happened to me. Last thing I can remember is me peeing outside and my cousin telling me that I have to register as a sex offender and for some reason I laughed so hard that I sharted on myself.
[You're an opinionated guy, and it can be tough to change your opinion once you've taken a public stance on something. Have you ever done a 180 on something? What was it? What made you flip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditkp1?context=5)|Well alot of my opinions are just based on music. So yes my opinions change about certain artist. It's just all based on the quality of their work. Also personalities like I used to be a huge fan of Kanye West but this new guy Kanye Kardashian can't stand him i'm hoping he gets back to reality and makes me like him again.
[ off, I hope that guy court can boost you into centre stage — we need people with personalities such as yours to cut the bullshit and ask the questions that are on everyone's mind. Your interviews on Vlad and The Breakfast Club have taught me a great deal about rap battles, gang bangs, and perspectives on current celebrity culture.  Are pig roasts or sexual acts involving two guys and a girl a violation of the guy code? Have you ever been in a similar situation? - Has there been anyone that you've really wanted to sit down/meet/interview that you haven't had the chance to, and why? What would you ask them?  EDIT: One more: - After you talk to guests on the show in the way that you do (i.e. sucking a fart out of a girls butthole\), what's the real success rate of them actually seeing you off of the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiuf6e?context=5)|It's not dick riding when you show love bro! It's all good! I've never heard what your describing as a pig roast? Running trains yes i've done that in my day but I don't prefer it because sadly i'm an intimate guy and I like kissing and shit so I can't do all that if i'm ""Pig Roasting"" a woman. It's nobody I actually want to interview. It's more so like hey such and such is coming to ""The Breakfast Club"" and i'm like ok cool. That will be dope.
[Charlamagne, Do you ever think we will ever see Gucci back on The Breakfast club? Also, thank you for being the most honest person in the industry! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditl3h?context=5)|I don't talk to niggas after 5pm and Gucci Mane is one of those niggas I don't think I want to talk at all.

Who was the biggest bore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiuaiy?context=5)|I love interviewing all the legends. Jay Z, Fat Joe, Irv Gotti and Ja Rule, Goodie Mobb, those are guys I grew up on and have been fans of for years so having convo's with them is the best. Nobody has even been boring but we did an interview with Paul Mooney that he never aired because I respect people's opinions but he just came off as very racist. I don't mind you expressing your opinion but he just seemed very prejudice...
[You seem kinda sexist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdivixj?context=5)|All men are sexist. First thing men think when they see a woman is ""Would I bang her or not?"" Now if you're smart you eventually get past those thoughts but the mere fact that I thought that makes me a sexist.

[How does one become a member of the GuyCode family? Are most of you just scouted at events or did you go to a casting call? Also, love the show, it's hilarious. Settle this for me, if a woman uses about 75% of the toiletries in the house, mind you these are roommates, should the guy still pay for everything? I have to and it's bullshit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cdiu69r?context=5)|#CodeGang is like the Illumanati. We are a tight bunch. The ark is kind of closed. We don't take kindly to newcomers. It's a lot of hazing that the NCAA doesn't approve of that goes into this Code thing.

They do a lot of things centered around the lifestyle wheter it's music with the Miley Doc or Kesha's reality show, social media craze with ""Catfish"" people's obsession with wanting to be in relationships like Andrew Schulz's ""The Hookup"" or something we are all obsessed with WOMEN with ""Girl Code"" the culture is bigger than music so MTV has grown with it and reflects that.
[How do you stay motivated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r293d/im_charlamagne_tha_god_from_mtv2s_guy_court/cditl1t?context=5)|The fact that i'm from Moncks Corner SC and nobody from where i'm from is doing what i'm doing or has done what I have done so I have to finish the task.

I'm /u/josho493, I'm a 20 year old developer in Oklahoma, USA! I am very passionate about developing web applications and coding. The work very rewarding to me and that's why I'm currently studying it in college. What I'm hoping to find is a (20-30 hrs/wk) part time job or internship that can help be build my resume while providing value to your company.

Languages: PHP, Javascript, HTML5/CSS3

I have extensive experience using the Twitter API and have developed many applications using it. I also have experience with FFMPEG, Mailing lists, Dropbox API, and MySQL. Photoshop isn't one of my strengths but I am able to complete some pretty basic tasks. In addition to everything else, I have experience with creating, producing, and editing video.

I hope to hear from someone soon!"
1r28yc,20,2013-11-20,Job offer: Midwest versus Silicon Valley,zzqqoo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r28yc/job_offer_midwest_versus_silicon_valley/,"I graduate this May and have been hunting for a job for the past few months now. I go to a modest state school (not terrible, not known for STEM) in the south, I have a ~3.5 GPA in ECE, and am currently in an internship-type situation doing Java-based software development.

I've been incredibly lucky to get an offer with a great salary (given my experience and the low cost of living in the area) but it has a few hangups:

The first thing is the location. I can't shake the desire I have to try to get out to the west coast. Part of this is I guess silly romanticization, but I do feel that I'll have much more opportunities to further my career out there than anywhere else. However, I haven't had much luck with my job search despite focusing on Bay area companies. Obviously there is a lot of competition, and I lack a big-name internship to bolster my resume but I'm a pretty competent programmer and I interview well.

The other thing is the technlogy used at the company that has given me an offer. It's not the latest and greatest stuff, but it's not ancient. The software is healthcare-based, so I'm convinced that it will have an impact and be meaningful work. I'm just worried I'll get out in 3 years and not be able to market it into an opportunity where I want to be (west coast). They are transitioning from VB to C# (but it will take many years and there is a chance I will be using VB) and use an aging database system, but are also doing work in iOS/Android with a lot of web development as well.

So what would you do in my situation? Would you hold out for your ideal choice, or take what you can get and try to benefit from the experience?"

I am currently going to Cal State Fullerton for Graphic Design, though in all honesty, I'm not sure what my end-game plan is, or if it's truly what I aspire to be. When I first started college it was for film, but then I was led into design because I felt I'd have a lot better chances and more opportunities in creating images for things like movie posters, album covers or book/magazine covers than I would be editing films. I've always thought it would be awesome to be the creative mind/art director of a marketing company, so it would be MY IDEA that was on that billboard on the freeway or that commercial on TV. Now I just feel like I need someone else's input or idea in order to motivate myself to do something, but when I do get an idea from someone I feel like I'm really putting myself to the task and doing a fairly good job at it. 

I feel like I am multi-talented but have never truly dedicated myself to know everything about one topic, just a decent amount of knowledge in a decent amount of topics. I enjoy anything computer related, and have skills in Microsoft Office as well as Photoshop and Illustrator. I have basic knowledge of CSS/HTML (I actually even designed the site for a promotional products company. I KNOW it needs work, but I have no real instruction on how to make it better, and I have to propose a plan to change it, but not knowing how long it would take me and what skills I'd have to learn in order to make it work, I can't really plan it accurately.) I've had experience life guarding, teaching swim lessons, making sandwiches, and working for a promotional products shop as their in house graphic designer. I enjoyed the graphic design, but my boss in all honesty didn't know that much about design, and never had any criticism or anything for me to work with. Basically what I created was what we went with, and hopefully the client liked it. I've wanted to find a paid internship or another gig like this with someone who actually knows something of the trade and can critique my work, give me advice, and basically sculpt me into the better designer I aspire to be, but so far I haven't had any sort of teacher to look up to in order to gain the hands-on experience I desperately crave.

My last job I was making sandwiches at a Panera Bread type restaurant, and right now I really just want any job that will give me some money to save and a little extra for spending. I've applied to multiple restaurants (even just to be a dishwasher), grocery store delis, seasonal sales and retail positions at the mall, gamestop, bestbuy, every graphic design opportunity I see on craigslist. Out of 40+ applications I have been called for one interview at a restaurant, and that was 2 months ago. I honestly just want something ASAP so I don't have to be empty handed this Christmas for my friends and family. I still live with my parents, so I'm surviving comfortably, but at the same time I'm constantly under stress with the fact that I'm 24 years old, with no degree, with no job, being a burden to my parents and not being able to provide for anyone, let alone myself. I don't know who to turn to for help or advice in my situation and just hope that somebody will read this and can enlighten me with their own experiences and any advice they are willing to share with me. I'd really appreciate it, because at this moment I feel so lost and can't find anything to point me in the right direction."

1r6ebm,13,2013-11-21,Six Ways to Pass as Privately Educated (a thinly veiled rant),brangdangage,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1r6ebm/six_ways_to_pass_as_privately_educated_a_thinly/,"Directing is a trust fund baby's game. Are you a trust fund baby? If so, good for you. Couldn't happen to a better person. Seriously. Furthermore, go fuck yourself. Your kind, with its consequence-free paradigm, dilutes the talent pool in the entertainment industry and has an undue influence on the American narrative — which is why, in the 1970's, movies were about urban, interesting looking, colorful people, and now, they're about suburban, dead-souled superheroes. And thanks to ""unpaid internships,"" your ilk will maintain its stranglehold on the industry for generations to come.

I am not so fortunate. I had three strikes against me as I embarked on this profession. Number one, I am publicly educated. Number two, I am Irish Catholic by heritage, meaning one look at me and every person thinks, ""I'm going to colonize and oppress the living shamrock out of that average heighted guy with the eyebrows."" Number three, I am interested in the happiness of others. Numbers two and three are related, baked into my motherboard, and problems I'll contend with for life.

Number one, on the other hand, could have gone another way.

My high school was extremely traditional. How traditional? It was founded in 1635, one year before Harvard. Six years of Latin. A strict adherence to 17th century educational principals of discipline, rigor and gratuitous suffering. If you raised your hand, you had better have the right answer or you get the hose again. In the hall? Where's your lavatory pass (that's right, lavatory)? Hard work was king. Colorful complexity, as a desirable trait, was, in the eyes of my instructors, a notch below rabies. Lunch break was 19 minutes long. Lollygag time did not exist.

And here's the lesson one takes away from this. If you speak, spit out the right answer fast and get out of the line of fire. Go along. Do not be noticeable for fear of a misdemeanor mark. This is, obviously, fantastic training for the bottom of any number of executive food chains.

My wife, on the other hand, went to a private boarding high school only 25 miles, yet several centuries, north of my own. At her school, probing complexity was the name of the game. An interesting and deep answer was prized higher than a correct one. Students probably rode around in golf carts or were carried on sedan chairs by lower classmen. All enjoying the overwhelming message: I am a complex person and my complexity has value.

This dichotomy bears out in the following way: at dinner parties, when you find yourself bored to tears by a person's long-winded answer to ""how are you?"" chances are they went to private school. That other guest, who got everyone else talking but left without divulging so much as their last name? Public. And it bears mentioning, the one who snuck off to go to the bathroom but really was doing all the dishes? Parochial. God bless those poor bastards.

To be a director, in this industry that is now overrun by Thad Claddingtons the Thirds, who only feel comfortable hiring their own, we must learn to pass. Every yacht-treading, blonde, white-slacked villain from all the 1980's John Cusack sex comedies grew up and decided to become an agent or development executive and we, the John Cusacks of the world, only too excited to be granted the right to work, have been tossed outside the gates.

Luckily there is a way back in. A secret body language taught to and understood by only the privileged. And here I am to blow the whistle on it. I humbly present: Six Ways to Pass as Privately Educated, or... Six Secrets to High Status Body Language, or... Six Methods to Put Peasants in Their Heads...



**1. Never touch your face**

Ever. Don't touch your face. Dead give away. Don't rest your head on your hand. Don't pick your teeth or wipe your mouth. Don't check your nose for bats in the cave. All of these motions are dead giveaways that you care a little too much about the impression you're leaving on the person with whom you are in conversation. Did I say the person with whom you are in conversation? I meant the plebeian upon whom you are briefly bestowing your glorious presence. And if they must stare at some particulate matter in the corner of your mouth, SO BE IT, it is a small price to pay for the attention they are receiving from you.

**2. Delay your reactions**

If you laugh right away at something funny said by this plebeian, you lose at the game of status. If however, they say something undeniably funny (a sure sign they need to impress you, and how gauche is that?) and you pause one Mississippi, and then meaningfully blink while firing a quick breathe from your nostrils, indicating you get it, but are too important to truly laugh, you win. And you have just committed what is known as a status attack. Let silence into your exchanges and watch your opponents begin to tap dance. Get comfortable in this silence. It is the sound of power draining from your conversation partner. Now, for the love of god, keep them on the ropes.

**3. Freeze! Now move in slow motion**

Confidence, it has been said, is the absence of insecurity. Insecurity is demonstrated through energy leaks. If you cannot manage your energy, or if you are generating more than is appropriate for a situation, it will leak out of you any way it can: through excessive blinking, leg-thumping, weight-shifting, over-sharing of autobiography, looking to see what a loud noise was, manic changes of subject, and worst of all, the overt seeking of validation. Meanwhile, in science, temperature is the measure of how much undirected energy is in something. Therefore: cool down, direct your energy to the task at hand. Have slow, powerful thoughts. Focus on the present. Don't stir. You're fine where you are. Success will seek you out. Be still. People lose their minds over the quietest, stillest person in the room. Be that person.

**4. Don't acknowledge the new person**

This makes me insane. I should pause here and say I don't ethically condone any of these tactics. In fact I find them repulsive, BUT they work, especially when your status is under attack, or when you need to impress someone who falls for this bullshit. So, this next one is a sadly ubiquitous anti-greeting among the highly statured. When you greet a group of people you know, and it contains a stranger, take forever to acknowledge them. Start long, endless conversations with those you already know and make the new person awkwardly wait, hand half-mobilized for a shake. If I had a nickel for every time I've been on the business end of this adorable little maneuver. *** This neutralizes any potential status attack within the other person, and gets the first lick in while they are vulnerable. It's also heartless. I can't bring myself to do it. Ergo, I will never succeed.

**5. Consider your eye contact a gift**

Have you ever Facebook-cruised your buddy's new girlfriend (or boyfriend) prior to meeting in person, and thought to yourself, ""uh-oh, those are crazy eyes."" The muscles around our eyes are one hundred times too strong for their intended purpose, i.e. dragging our eyes around their sockets to look at stuff. Why do we have all that extra brawn? To convey meaning. To give away how we feel. To reveal we are, in fact, crazy. We are transmitting all sorts of sensitive information when we make eye contact with another. And we all, although we don't realize it, have the capacity to interpret these cues. Therefore, don't give away the store. When you look at someone, you essentially say, this is me, this is what I'm actually thinking and feeling. So bestow this information only on those with whom it can be trusted. (I have to stop here again to say these six tactics are dick moves. Make no mistake, I have a hard time relating to people who do this stuff, but, then again, I am not high status. I am not successful. So if it is success among the successful that you seek, here you are.)

**6. Withhold intimacy**

I am a compulsive hugger. When in doubt, hug it out, that's what I say. The amount of hands I've swatted away, in favor of going in, is innumerable. And I therefore remain, in the hearts and minds of all who know me, utterly harmless. In probably a bad way. Got an intense project that needs a strong leader who'll guide us out of the chop? Don't give it to Hughes! He'll just make everyone feel good. This concept even works in relationships. The more you withhold intimacy, the more you gain power over the other person, who will then have to give something up to get it back. This is also useful when blocking scenes. Point is, don't be me. Don't offer your hand first, don't offer a hug first, be totally fine and intact and privately educated, and someone will slip up and offer you their hand. Or at the very least, wonder what you think of them.

 * * *

With these dastardly and effective tools, you'll be able to move through cocktail parties with the upwardly mobile. New people will seek your approval. You'll be sought after for projects and social engagements. You'll even be able to detect other in cognito charlatans. And you can give them the slow Renaissance Fair nod as if you're both wearing cloaks. But remember, we only visit the privately educated world to accomplish the mission of being successful. We do not take up residence. We do not forget where we come from.

Godspeed, and happy rejecting, you successful, privately educated so and so.

 

*** If I ALSO had a nickel for every time, after someone ignored me for two-thirds of an evening because I was the new guy, only to suddenly open up without warning once I was wholly off balance, and then have had it explained to me that this person is in fact ""shy,"" I would be a very rich man. Attention ""shy"" people: boo-mother-scratching-hoo. It costs us outgoing types just as much as it would you to extend ourselves and save a dinner party from the yawning abyss of awkward silence, but the only difference is we bother to do it.  Why should we feel bad for shy kids on the playground? We should really feel bad for the outgoing kids who get rejected by the shy kids. The shy kids, as my good friend Mozhan Marnó recently pointed out to me, do the rejecting. The outgoing kids (like my smily son, all indications seem to suggest) offer the overtures. Down with the shy! Up with the community builders!

I am ""self-taught"" with Python, and know a little Java and Javascript. Quotes around self-taught because I know that I am still very new at all of this. 

I have been introduced, through mutual friends, to some people who are starting a company. They have just been friends thus far, but have recently offered to have me work on what they are building. They would basically mentor me into being hired when (hopefully) this thing takes off. 

So, to cover my bases I am still applying for summer internships, as I have no delusions about the success rates of start-ups. However, I was wondering if anyone with more experience might help me know what I should and shouldn't be doing for these people. I am mildly concerned that they would be bringing me on to try and get some chump code written and then drop me when they make money to start hiring better people. However, I am not looking to begin interning anywhere else until the coming summer, and this opportunity starts much sooner. I am thinking that any professional coding experience is good professional coding experience at this point . . . 

Plus, I am looking for projects to fill out my free time anyway. This would be nice and directed. 

What do you think would be appropriate to try and get in writing? And how should I go about asking? 

Also, even if it fails, wouldn't getting to code for these people be a good way to generate some presentable code for future opportunities? 

Thank you!"

1r60ru,1,2013-11-21,"Did I jump the gun? Almost graduating, may have accepted offer from company after internship prematurely.",SniffSocksForJesus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r60ru/did_i_jump_the_gun_almost_graduating_may_have/,"First of all, I want to thank everyone for all the advice on this subreddit.  Without it I don't think I would have gotten an internship in the first place.

A little background: I am a 25-year old CS transfer student at an okay UC who dropped out of high school, screwed around at community college for a long time, and finally I'm about to graduate with a ~3.0 GPA with a B.S. in Computer Science at the end of this quarter (December).  I didn't decide to be a CS major until two years ago when I took a Java class at random, and since then I've loved it and am almost done with my degree after two years of very intense studying.  I read a lot of CS/coding related subreddits and keep up with current trends, but I feel like I have little time to do side projects when I come home from school.  In other words, I'm well read on industry trends but I don't have much experience coding in a lot of them.

I landed an internship at a company of about ~2500 employees in the Bay Area over the summer through a referral.  I ended up working on a GWT-based web project that was a little boring, but the company was great and I really liked everyone that was working there.  I ended up doing a decent job and they offered me $95k salary offer plus a yearly stock plan (an additional $11k in stock that you can access after the end of each year, there was a term for it but I forgot what it was).  This was a much, much higher offer than I was expecting, especially with my GPA and experience.  The catch was that when they gave me the offer at the end of summer, I had to accept it before the end of October, which basically meant I had very little time to browse other companies.

I loved the internship in many ways.  Nobody seemed to be overly stressed, people rarely stay in the office past 6pm or work more than 40 hours a week.  Everybody is very friendly, and there isn't a lot of cutthroat competition among the employees which I really like.  The job itself is a bit boring (a LOT of CSS), which is my only complaint.

Given the amount of the offer, the fact that the job is fairly stress free, and the fact that my GPA isn't the highest nor is it from a prestigious school, do you think I was premature in accepting my offer?  I have friends that told me I could do better, but I wasn't so sure and I would have rather not worried about finding a job while I'm finishing up my degree. 

**TL;DR** Very average student at a very average UC, got an internship, it was low-stress, people were very friendly, company is awesome (not top-tier but still great), CSS is boring, offer was 95k with additional stock every year, was forced to decide on offer before I had the chance to see if I could do anything else, wondering if I jumped the gun too soon."

How can you tell if an internship is better than another one? They don't exactly give you a detailed idea of what you will be doing, besides the team that you will be interning with. Is judging by pay / how famous the company is a good metric?"

where else to go. I am not sure that R/AskReddit is the place for this 

type of question/venting, but I just need to tell someone. The past 8 

months, have been breaking me down week by week, but today was my 

breaking point. 

My wife has a nasty flu, and asked me to pick her some medicine up from 

work today. I walk into a pharmacy close by me, and I pick out some 

cold medicine, a bottle of Nyquill, and some juice as she requested. My 

card declined. The total was only around 12 dollars, and my fucking 

card declined. I ended up only being able to only afford the cold 

medicine. 

On my way to my car, with my tank only half full, I can only feel 

ashamed of myself. I began to cry uncontrollably in the car. I cannot 

even afford proper medicine for my wife. I don't even know what I am 

doing with my life, I cannot even support my family.

I just realized this probably isn't even making sense, I feel so lost 

and helpless right now, I just keep typing and typing, let me try to 

explain better. 

My family, is my wife, my nearly 2 year old son, and myself. We have 

been having Money problems since the beginning of March. I work full 

time, My wife internships (unpaid), goes to school, and is a stay at 

home Mom. We used to do just fine, selling and buying things on Ebay, 

until we were banned from using the site. I was banned for not 

communicating with my customers in the required time that Ebay 

enforced. (I was supposed to answer questions within a day, but due to 

my schedule, It would sometimes be later than that) With that revenue 

gone, we slowly started to feel the pain, until where I am today. I 

literally have 1 dollar in my account, 1 dollar. My gas was shut off 2 

months ago because of late payments. I am 2 bills behind in my gas, 4 

bills behind in my electric, and I will not be able to afford rent on 

the first. I have crazy land lords, who will probably have me evicted 

if I do not pay them on the 5th, and I will not be able to. I went to 

college and did not graduate, debt collectors have started to garnish 

my wages for the payment. I barely have any groceries in my house. My 

wife knows we are struggling, but she wasn't aware of how bad. I am now 

broke until Friday, even when I get paid, it wont cover barely any of 

my bills. I feel like my utilities are going to get shut off again, and 

that we are going to be evicted.

I have ADHD, and I have left it untreated for about 5 years. Recently I 

missed a promotion at my job, because I talked too fast, and was unable 

to put my thoughts together. Because of this, I went to a doctor to get 

medicine to treat my ADHD again. I feel like the medicine is making me 

even more crazy. I thought treating my ADHD would help me get my life 

together, but it is still the same. 

On top of this, Thanksgiving is next week and Christmas is right around 

the corner. My son is 2. This will be his first coherent Holiday. I 

won't even be able to give him and my wife a real Holiday. 

Nothing is coming together for me, I feel like I am failing at life, 

and worst of all letting down my family. What kind of Father/Husband 

can't provide for his family? I am doing everything I can and working 

my ass off, it is still not enough.  On my way home from the pharmacy I 

seriously contemplated driving as fast as I can into another car. I am 

lost.

Looking for your insights/advices! *VERY LONG*,kellonathan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8x9z/a_soontobe_graduate_from_a_liberal_arts_college/,"Hello r/cscareerquestions,

I have a feeling that this submission is going to be quite long, rather rant-y stream of consciousness with a somewhat naive and biased perspective toward industry and life in general. Overall, it's written by a whiny 20-something. If you're still interested, please go ahead and I hope you can share some of your stories and/or insights.

*****

Coming back to school after the summer of my junior year of college has been pretty interesting so far---many of my friends were talking about how they missed this place, bragging how 'boring' their summers were and we constantly talked about college stuff (whatever that is), whilst being in this thick social bubble. As much as I love being in school and missed this place, I realized, the time has come; I was emotionally over with this place. I was ready to move on. And this descrepancy between my ideal image of 'being a young professional' and the reality of sitting in a class that I am not really interested anymore, started to depress me quite a bit. I knew I had to get out of this place as soon as possible, just for the sake of my sanity and started to binge-apply for jobs in the city of my dream---San Francisco Bay Area.

I redid my resume and wrote cover letters just like everyone else. And I sent them out to companies that I have found online as long as they have an established office space in the bay area. As first, I was pretty confident---I thought, at least, I have decent amount of experiences that would place me as a pretty good candidate (again, at least) for a new grad. But since I started to get incessant stream of 'thanks-but-no-thanks' messages from several places, not to mention the majority of my applications that are being ignored, I started to question myself: ""Am I doing it entirely wrong?"" ""What am I missing?""

*****

**Education Background + what have I done so far**
I am a senior at a private, liberal arts college in Midwest. It's pretty well known around here, but not nationally 'famous' enough to take advantage of my school's name. (I don't want to do that anyway---but It's always on the top 10 list for liberal arts college rankings and other lists, so I assume people who are into that kind of stuff will probably recognize the name at least.) I am majoring in computer science and fine art. I have some internship experiences in web development and design; while I currently have an offer to work there after I graduate, I really want to get out of this town to be honest. I also have my own consulting+design startup that I started with a good friend of mine over the summer and we had couple paying customers too. 

**Am I looking for something too specific? Or am I just straight up not good enough?**
I am mostly looking for an entry-level development/front-end design position at a small, medium size startup in the bay area. Not that I am saying that I am not interested in working for a bigger company, but I want to have a bigger sense of responsibility and autonomy from my job. I eventually want to have my own startup later, but to do that successfully, I believe that I need to have some experiences in working for such companies before I actually start one by myself. It definitely sounds cliche, but I desire to work for a company that's building something meaningful. I want to build something that has lasting impacts on our future. That's my ideal job. That's it. However, I came to realize not everyone is lucky to have one's ideal job. And I found my biggest fear called 'what if I am not good enough?' I first started value of my education; I endear my liberal arts education background that has enabled me to develop such valuable insights in life, but to be honest, I am not sure how attractive this would be in a job market. I love my education because it made me realize how 'humanistic' and philosophical computer science and mathematics actually are, not because it made me to learn how to code in Python and Java. But I guess, this argument won't probably work at a job interview. 

**What does it take to get hired? What kind of people are companies looking for?**
This, I could never figure out. Several people mentioned that I should be more active on Github and do more open-source works. While it is certainly a noble idea, I am still very skeptical of building a Github profile for the sake of self-branding; it feels somewhat artificial and fake, and it is just not me. I don't do open-source 'side-projects' when I have free time. I want to have a life outside of technology realm, too. When I feel like being productive during my free-time, I like to do community theater and volunteering at neighborhood schools. I like to be active on local politics and community issues because I know that's where I get my inspirations. Maybe that's it---I am not one of them. Am I? Am I not? Do I have a wrong mindset as a job candidate?

*****

So here are the some of my mind-boggling questions...

- How often does a small startup tend to hire a new grad right off the college? Any suggestion on new grads who want to join a startup in its beginning stage? 

- Would this fit my lifestyle/career-goal?

- Am I doing it wrong? Or should I just give a bit more time?

- How does anyone get a job? If you recently went through this whole process of landing your first job, what was your 'key' to your success, if there is any?

*****

Disappointment is quite disorienting and would like some of your insights and guidances. Thank you for taking your time to read my horrible writing. (I just wanted to spend some time taking a step back from my life and share my story to people I don't know.) I am very much looking forward to hearing from you."
1r8vy7,6,2013-11-22,Is this semester going to badly hurt my chances of an internship this summer?,Genoe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8vy7/is_this_semester_going_to_badly_hurt_my_chances/,"I'm a sophomore in my 3rd semester. Last year I did pretty good, all A's and B's but I got a C- in precalc. Right now I'm sitting at a 3.183 gpa. However, this semester I've been struggling. I'm at a C- right now in Object Oriented pro. and Data Structure I(OOPS I) and the same goes for Calc I.  However, part of the reason is that this semester I started working (Only 6 hours a week plus most weekends but it's between classes which just really makes for a ton of running around the entire campus all day). I also joined ACM and after coming up with a really good story and gameplay concepts for the video game we plan on making over the next few years. I guess you could call me and a friend of mine the ""Directors"" of the project. 

Anyways, Calc has been getting better throughout the semester but I will most likely barely scrape by in OOPS I. Next semester I've got a much harder schedule and I'm leaving all the video games home and reducing how much I work (and it won't be in between classes). The twist is that I've been invited to a shadow day at Kohl's in Milwaukee. It's basically a huge full day tour of what they all do in IT (it's even all expenses paid, including the hotel you check into the previous day) and I'm afraid that I'm gonna go there and make a decent impression, but have any chance of an internship there ruined by my grades. I also got an email from another company saying they saw my resume on this career website my school has and that they want me to apply. Basically, I'm afraid everything is going to go hell after they see my grades for this semester. Did I seriously screw things up for myself this semester or should I just make sure I do better next semester? Am I blowing this whole gpa thing out of proportion? Another issue is that my schools career fair is in February and I'm sure all the employers are gonna be wondering about my ~2.5gpa from last semester. 

I should also note that next semester will weed me out for sure if I shouldn't be doing computer science. I've got discrete math, intro to software engineering, and compute arch. + operating systems (assembly), and two gen eds. (NO I was not setting up some sort of brutal schedule on purpose, that's what I'm supposed to all be taking)."
1r8vld,6,2013-11-22,Unexpected Interview,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8vld/unexpected_interview/,"I went in for an interview today after being contacted by a recruiter about a software engineering position, I told the recruited I'm only 2 years into my CS degree and only have about a year of professional programming experience and I was interested in an intern position. When I got to the interview it turned out that the recruiter hadn't mentioned my inexperience and the president of the company proceeded to interview me for a regular Software Engineer position. I managed to hold my own (mostly by agreeing with what he was saying), and he told me the salary for the position was 75,000$ a year, and that I should come in next week to give a brief presentation on how I would proceed with a project they're working on. He said if the presentation goes well they'd like me to start working December 2nd. I was caught completely off-guard by all of this, since I was expecting a 10$/hr internship at best, and I'm not really sure how to proceed from here.

Edit:: I'm currently attending UMUC part-time, this post wasn't asking whether or not I should drop out of college to pursue this job opportunity, I intend to finish my degree regardless. I've been working various full-time jobs since I began college to pay the bills and avoid student debt. I'd like to push forward and do my best to work this job since it pays better than my current full-time job (almost 3x as much). I'd love to hear tips on adapting to an enterprise environment from working on open-source projects, and what kind of pitfalls I can expect going from working on class and personal projects to independently developing functionality for an internal blog editor.

[Question for Zach... How was the process of making an achievement that gave items on TF2 go? Did you aproach Valve or was it the other way around? Where did the idea come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl1tx?context=5)|Robin Walker, the ""head"" of the TF2 team at the time, was a big fan of SpaceChem. When he found out that we were in the same area, he invited me out for lunch. We talked about the game, how to use playtesting to make your game not suck, and the idea of cross-promoting SpaceChem with TF2. Considering the nature of TF2 cross-promotions at the time (frequent but still a ""fresh"" idea) and the autonomy that developers at Valve have, it just made sense.
 |A few weeks later we'd signed a little paperwork, built a TF2-themed mini-expansion for SpaceChem, and gotten word from the TF2 team that they'd finished our models. When it went live, we sold a stupid number of copies of the game!
[ nervous_testpilot, NeRepro, biffikins, JuliusFB and KalFB, Ronimo_Koen and nog1potje and tpathuis, krispykrem - thank you for investing into Linux gaming with your ports!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4jd?context=5)|Hey, just to give you a proper answer on Linux..

I'm personally also very happy that we have a pretty solid Linux port that stays on par with the Windows version.
[For the Awesomenauts team - I love your game, I've spent countless hours playing it with friends since release day - but the Linux port could use a bit of a touch up, for the sake of controller support and SDL2 and such.

Because of this there's a lot of technical prowess but when it comes game development studies, Finland is just getting started. I study at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences where we work in teams with artist, programmers, producers and designers to make games. This gives a very good platform to move into the game industry. A lot of game dev schools are now popping up in Finland so it's gonna improve and become more popular, in no small thanks to Rovio and Supercell.
[What game development frameworks have you guys used, and what do you recommend?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl77q?context=5)|Unity for me, I've worked in Unreal and Flash before, but Unity is just damn near perfect for what I like to make.
 |I used XNA at the start of Monaco and I loved it.  I like MonoGame, but I worry a little about its future.  Currently prototyping in Unity.  Unity has a ton of cool features, and the biggest danger is that you get soo much stuff for free that it's easy to get distracted from teh core goals of your game prototype.  Having that many tools at my disposal has actually made prototyping a little slower, since I'm constantly fooling with things that aren't necessarily central to evaluation of a prototype.
 |I recommend Unity3D. I make my own games in my spare time in Unity. It's easy to learn, huge supportive community. And they recently released 4.3 with 2d support, if you're into that. Making a game in Unity actually taught me how to code. At Ronimo we have our own tech/engine btw.
 |We started building SpaceChem with XNA, back when XNA was still relevant. When we decided that we wanted to support Mac and Linux as well, we switched to a custom OpenGL/C# engine, which we've slowly built up into something that lets us build elaborate looking, cross-platform 2D games.
 |[Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/) was written in .NET and [Truevision3D](http://www.truevision3d.com/), an engine that's no longer being updated, but was quite good 8 years ago.
 |The [still-in-development sequel](http://universesandbox.com/blog/2013/02/new-universe-sandbox/) is being developed in Unity. Stepping through the code isn't as elegant or smooth as it would be in XNA, fro example, but the cross platform support of Unity is pretty magical.

[How difficult is working with the Steam web API? Was it easy to get all the integration working that you've got going on? Good job on the site by the way, it looks really good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkm61g?context=5)|The steam web API is actually very easy to use. It falls into two categories: User authentication with OpenID and user data acquisition with Steam's web API.
 |For OpenID authentication I used the lightopenid library: [Link to code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/lightopenid) - With basic php knowledge this can be implemented in minutes. It basically just returns the user's 64bit steam ID.
 |Once the site has the user's steam ID it uses the SteamWebApi - [Link to developer.valvesoftware.com](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_AP) - specifically 'GetPlayerSummaries' and 'GetOwnedGames', to get the user's information. GetOwnedGames is nice in that you can actually tell it which games you want it to filter for, so don't have to parse 100+ games.
 |And thanks! There is a lot of information we need to convey to users and it took a few iterations to get it to be intuitive, especially since browsing 35 games can easily be overwhelming. A ton of credit must be given to the fantastic MixItUp javascript plugin ([Link to mixitup.io](http://mixitup.io) that allowed me to easily handle the grid/list sorting of the games in such a visually pleasing manner.
[Thanks for the expansive answer! I'm currently doing web development at uni and this is really interesting stuff.

As a visual learner this really helped me. Even better, unlike many other video learning sites, tutsplus actually makes it easy and encourages you to download the courses you want, so you can pay for one month, download a few dozen courses, and then work your way through the videos during your free time without pressure of having to pay again.

I personally really like having the satisfaction of ripping tiny yellow post-it's off of a wall when I'm done with something, heh. As our team is quite big for an indie development company I do think it's needed to have some form of organisation to keep track of what everybody's doing and how long that particular thing takes. That being said - I think the most important thing is that you use a practice that's right for you, whether it's conventional or not. Whatever get's the job done, right?  I wrote the current version of [Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/) by myself over about 4 years. The development process was: what new feature could I add or improve today?

 |My love for video games! I've always wanted to just become involved in the industry somehow. I mean isn't it super awesome to be able to help make a product that you enjoy spending your spare time with after?
 |I've been making games all my life.  When I was 7 my mom gave me a book from which I could transcribe code and make a little ASCII skiing game on the C64, I've been hooked ever since.  My first game in professional game development was as an intern at Presto Studios on Star Trek: Hidden Evil (unless you could the fact that I interned for an early internet gaming portal in 1996)
 |Been fiddling with games for as long as we had a computer, so it seemed only logical. We got a computer (ZX Specturm!) when I was around 10. Being able to shape whole experiences is kinda like magic, though back then I mostly wanted to experience the big arcade games.
 |I took a programming class in 7th grade that really kickstarted my enjoyment of programming, but I never pursued it as an end goal. I found it fun to create simple [simulations](http://dandixon.us/programming/) throughout high school and college.
 |Post-college I thought I wanted to go into film making, but later realized video game development was a legitimate career and more fascinating to me. About 8 years ago, because of my film work, I got a job at Surreal (working on now cancelled title ""This is Vegas"") as an assistant producer.
 |Wasting time in High-school downloading free game demos, stumbling onto a tiny game called 'Lugaru' by (at the time) one-man developer ""Wolfire"" and falling in love with their dev blog.

[Funniest bug you've ever encountered? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkl4p4?context=5)|In Awesomenauts, during a playtest session someone once forgot to properly commit their code making the defending turrets instantly killing anybody who came nearby.
 |In my new game, enemies occasionally rotate 90 degrees and walk up towards the sky. It is a thing of beauty.
 |There's a mission in Ironclad Tactics where you face a giant sentry robot that strafes back and forth on rails. At one point during development, something broke, and the sentry ""jumped"" off its rails and started charging toward the player's side of the battlefield.
 |Although I guess this is the kind of thing that was funnier if you were there...
 |During QA testing of Trine 2's Goblin menace expansion, the mummies would sometimes glitch out when they got too close to one another, causing them to rhythmically oscillate back and forth. It had a very thriller-esque look to it.
[To #MikeBithell: What is the purpose of the lights/shadows in TWA?

I've never laughed so hard before playing with friends trying to get our mage to plop down clockwork boxes correctly. Man xD.
 |I am an embarrassingly massive Frozen Synapse fan. A thing of beauty. Knowing Paul socially means I have had to work to temper this embarrassing fandom.
 |Thomas was Alone. I tried the trial on XBLA, was hooked instantly. Bought it, finished it in one go, loved it.
 |I'd have to say FTL :)
 |For singleplayer Mark of the Ninja, and for multiplayer Awesomenauts. I love the art style of Mark of the Ninja and it has superb level design for a 2D stealth game. Probably one of the best stealth games out there. Awesomenauts on the other hand brings platforming gameplay into the MOBA genre in a 2D fashion which I think is brilliant for gameplay. Add to this great character design and colorful art, and yeah, I'm pretty much sold.
 |I'd also have to say Frozen Synapse.  All the meta functionality surrounding a rock solid core game is amazing.
 |Jamestown! I've always *wanted* to get into a shmup, but they're often too hard and require too much genre-experience. Jamestown, on the other hand, has a fantastic learning curve that let me reach the end while still teaching me a ton about the game.
 |Also, the story! It's very minimalist, but just so cool!
 |Thomas was Alone, it's in the name.. But I also really like Mark of the Ninja and Stealth Bastard.
 |I really enjoyed Terraria. Good memories of playing cooperatively with my brother.
 |Hmm.  Maybe Mark of the Ninja or Space Chem. Hard to say, tons of great games.
 |I think Frozen Synapse doesn't get enough love. I don't know many other turn-based games that consistently provide such high-octane clutch gameplay.
 |And FTL has to be high up there as well, if only judging by the 'hours played' counter in my steam library... I am -sooo- waiting for the upcoming content update!
[Question for Julius and Kai... I was happy to see the changes from Trine to Trine 2 (mainly the removal of the mana bar\) and from Trine 2 to The Goblin Menace (with the impressive use of color and cinematics\). How did this evolution take place? It was a particular idea or is it where you always intended to go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8axo/were_the_indies_involved_in_huge_seal_ask_us/cdkkzvv?context=5)|The mana was removed, mainly because it was often a source of frustration (when you ran out for example) and it didn't bring much to the gameplay, so we felt removing it was the way to go. This allowed us to focus on making other things more fun. Some people have said that they miss the mana though!
 |As for the graphical changes, those were probably the result of everyone improving their skills and setting a higher bar for the sequel. We wanted to get a storybook feeling with the use of colours and different types of sceneries, and the art team really did a good jod with those :)
[Currently the indie game scene is experiencing something of a renaissance.

 |The indie game scene is doing great mainly because downloadable games became viable since a couple of years. As long as that scene continues to thrive the scene will continue to grow.
 |As for the AAA scene, hard to say. It seems last generation already completely killed everything between indie and AAA due to the economics of development. And most of the bigger publishers are now moving into that same space as well, producing indie-sized downloadable games as well.
 |I hope this doesn't catch up to the actual AAA games, because I personally love my Assassin's Creeds and Mass Effects.

Ultimately, find the stuff you care about, and find people you care about to do other stuff.
 |I don't think it's necessary to know all the in's and outs, but since game making in a bigger team really is exactly that - a team effort, it makes communication with your colleagues a lot easier. Especially as an artist I've noticed that being at least a bit tech savvy with our in-house editors and whatnot makes it way easier for me to adjust and test things. This way I also have a way better sense of what the limitations of the current game I'm working on are, which enables me to make smart choices when making textures and whatnot beforehand rather than finding out about them afterwards.
 |The more a programmer understands about art and the more an artist understands about programming, the easier it will be for them to communicate and work together.
 |If you're a decent programmer who can kinda make art, then you'd be able to make a game without relying on anyone else. You could always bring in a more talented artist after you've proven your concept to be playable and fun.

It also helped that I had a computer at home and my dad had a programming background (easily an advantage over most kids).  I think that programming classes should be required as programming teaches logic and reasoning and problem solving, which are also critical skills outside of programing itself...

1r8hu3,46,2013-11-22,What are you experiences with interns?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1r8hu3/what_are_you_experiences_with_interns/,"So an interesting story to go with this topic: 


My company recently brought in a new intern to the company. I really didn't want to hire an intern, would rather a full sysadmin ... but politics as usual. He was recommended by a higher-up, so I had no choice but to at least give him an interview. About two weeks ago, he stops by and we begin talking. Far as I could tell, he had never done anything *remotely* close to what we were looking for. He couldn't navigate a linux terminal, didn't know much SQL, and I had to help him through the OSI model. However, he kept explaining that if I tell him what he needs to learn, he can do it. So to please every party in the scenario, I told him to come in the following week to see how he does, and we'll meet again about the position. 



Fast forward to the following week, he's now my shadow. He's struggling a lot, but learning pretty quickly. Our NOC is pretty fast-paced, so it's imperative we have someone who can learn relatively fast. I have him come in the following Monday to kind of see how he's feeling, and how he likes working on the network. He tells me he's been studying a lot, and wanted to know if he can show me some of what he's been learning. Sure, why not. 



He proceeds to pull out his laptop, and fire up his Fedora box. He starts showing me some little tricks he learned (running processes, grepping, etc etc). For giggles I ask him how he would compare two files to see if they were the same. Without hesitation he just opens up vim and writes up a cutesy little bash script to md5 two files and compare them two each other .. He also give me a tour of his MySQL database setup, and was happy to query things I asked him to look for. 


All this from a person who had **never** touched a terminal, or even bothered to mingle with databases. No prior experience, and has literally just started college. Compare that to the computer-science student we brought on previously, who spent three weeks trying to learn basic linux commands (cd, grep, cat). 

So I'm curious, what have other sysadmins experienced when it comes to interns. I'm pleasantly surprised with my current one, and maybe someone else has had a similar experience?   "

I'm a current university student pursuing a BS in CS, and I should graduate by next year (I'm currently finishing up my first semester of Junior year). My degree has a definite focus on software development, although I'm starting to take a lot of network security classes, and what I've seen so far in that field interests me. I love software development, but it's definitely something I can see myself burning out on quickly.

I also love using *nix for anything, and messing around with my different boxes (installing different application stacks, making new and different networking setups, shell scripting). I've heard that systems administration is the way to go for that kind of specialization. However, in my current position in an IT department of my university, I've gotten pretty frustrated with dealing with non-technical people and hyperactive project managers. I get the impression that a sysadmin would have to deal with the same kind of stuff. 

Sorry for the rant, my question is what I should do at this point. I need to start applying for internships, and I don't know what way to go. I could apply for development internships, which seem to be much more prevalent, or I could try to find some sysadmin internships, which so far seem much more scarce. If I want to possibly get into network security at some point, would one option be better than the other?"

I've always loved Legos, taking apart things, using AutoCAD in high school, you know typical signs of a young engineer to be.

I want to know what the field is like. In CS you hear there are jobs everywhere, you can get lots of internships over the summers at big companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and in a city like this starting salaries nearly 6 figures is not at all unheard of. But how does ME compare? 

Say I don't get into the CS department at my school or I end up liking ME much more, what is the demand like for ME? Is it very common to have a job lined up right after graduating? I'm guessing pretty likely, as also with CS, ME degrees can also be very versatile and cover a wide range of jobs. What about salary? Comparable?

Should I just stop worrying about demand/salary and just do what I truly find more enjoyable?

PS. I also love bikes, maybe one day I could be building my own bikes or parts."

1raatv,75,2013-11-23,Night Float,TheGroovyTurt1e,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1raatv/night_float/,"So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind.  I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community.  The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. 
I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.  That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night.
So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.  I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue.  Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry.  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility.  He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure.  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 
Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here.  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious.  The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it.  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night.  It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry.  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up.  When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed.  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 
I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry.  I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed.  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him.  ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" 
 He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do.  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home.  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient.  I helped Jerry back to his bed.  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK.  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar.  I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it.  I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 
I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back.  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge.  In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle.  In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing.  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full.  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise.  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?""  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room.  I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming.  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill.  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep.  I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital.  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes.  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. 
I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man.  The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them.

im in my 5th week of an internship in a local machine company. my project is to create a program to save data in an XML file and read from this file. 

I start at the beginning. I have a *.csv file with over 600 rows. Now i created a class and parse this *.csv file into 600 instances of this class. With this data, i create an XML file (XMLdata).

Now the plan is to load this XML file into a Treeview for better viewing. For this plan, i created a XML view File (XMLview). Here i use 2 Attributes (text and tag) for the Treeview (one for the Treeview Text, and one for the Node Tag).

I have to say that the first part with the class is not implemented. My boss told me to hand write an XML file first, and show it with the Treeview. After that, i start with the csv parsing etc.

so i made a handwritten XMLdata and XMLview. but i dont know how to get all the information into the treeview. Maybe my whole idea is somewhat wrong and you guys have a better idea? maybe using only XML Attributes and no elements? 

thinks i tried and failed: 

XML -&gt; dataset and view in datagridview, and from there to a treeview(i read somewhere to never allow 2 control elements access to a single dataset)

this is how it looks now, but because i only have Node Text, i have no chance to display all the values in the textboxes: http://imgur.com/Ixs85jA

my class:

    public class data
    {
        public string ID;
        public string clearname;
        public string result;
        public string writeable;
        public string readable;
        public DateTime timestamp;      
    }

Edit: For the XML files. look here: http://pastebin.com/dyr93vat

i used this Snippet for the XML import: 
http://dotnet-snippets.de/snippet/treeview-export-to-xml-or-import-from-xml/705

but i discovered ""LINQ"" two weeks ago and maybe it is better suited for my task?

Edit: I also used this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364253/how-to-deserialize-xml-document to get my XML File into a class.

Over where I worked, we had around 400 Linux virtual machines which were all managed by chef (opscode).

One of the dba came to me and asked me if I could change the owner and group to (example) mysql:mysql recursively of every files in a said directory. Sure I said, easy cake especially with chef! It's only a matter of running chown -R mysql: directory.

I did 2 things wrong. First, I was a bit tired and in a hurry so I did not take the time to find and change the directory ownership in the chef config. I just told myself, I'll have a script run on all MySQL machines and that will do the trick. Second is, the script was ""chown -R mysql: *"" (* since I was in the said directory when the dba queried me).... Well yeah...No.

I don't know why my brain did not raise the red flag, but when chef runs, it runs from /. So the script would actually change the ownership of EVERY files on the mysql servers to mysql:mysql

So I pushed the config to the chef server, go on a random machine, launch the client and oh boy, when I saw the script being executed my heart just stop beating for was seemed an eternity. It was at this point I realized how retarded what I did was.

""Good thing"" with chef is that the client were I worked was only running each 30 minutes, so I manage to get on the chef server and revert everything. Only 1 machine got affected and I had a clone of it that was not affected.

That day I learned that even if I'm in a hurry, I can't just use the fastest solution to a problem if it is not the right way of solving it. Otherwise, terrible things could happen. Even today when I think about it, I have cold chills in my back. Feels like that would not have been a good thing for my career as a junior sysadmin."

1rc3ox,0,2013-11-24,whats the point?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rc3ox/whats_the_point/,"Everywhere I turn there is disappointment.  

I suck with women and as a result 21 years of my life I've been single and alone.  One reason why I have never had a girlfriend is my lack of social skills.  With those lack of social skills I also have no friends either. 

I see shit on reddit like /r/gonewild, /r/realgirls, and /r/happygirls and it just pisses me of and makes me sad at the same time that I will probably never experience that.  The feeling of having someone there by my side.  The thrill and enjoyment of sex.  The fun of having your other half there.

I used to flip shit on craigslist until I was forced out of the market due to so many people doing it.  I checked back in on it today and apparently one fucker than flagged my ads all the time has gotten to the point where he's making 6k a fucking month.  He brags about that shit on youtube.  What. The. Fuck.  I barely made a grand in 4 months of that shit. 

School isn't doing so hot.  I may have had a chance at an internship interview but I need money to pay bills and I would have had to quit my current job to pick it up.  College is supposed to be the time of your life before you sell your soul to a career and have no fun at all.   

Life is just grinding to a halt.  I'll probably end up a poorfag scraping by paycheck to paycheck.  Masturbating and cruising 4chan and reddit for hours on end. 

Its cold as fuck these days too.  I wake up pissed off.  I get out of the shower pissed off.  I get pissed off sitting in a cold car on the way to work.  Fuck the cold.  Fuck this shit.

1rfxze,15,2013-11-25,How I landed a job in one of the most competitive industries in the world.,xchn,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1rfxze/how_i_landed_a_job_in_one_of_the_most_competitive/,"* **Industry**: Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)
* **Job**: Analyst

Trying to find a home for this. The goal is to help everyone though so forgive me if I'm incorrect. Read on if this applies to you.

**The process before the process...**

I should start by telling you about my background. I graduated from a non-target school (a barely Division 1 state school with strengths in Ag Business and Nursing) with a Finance degree and an *okay* GPA (3.3). I networked pretty hard in college; being naturally gregarious this was easy. I studied abroad in Asia for 6 months but I did not have an internship. I landed a job in a management and leadership program in a Fortune 500 company directly out of school. Hated it because of the industry mainly. Had to get out to reclaim what remained of my soul.

I spent 18 months at the first company. It's important to reach 2 years, and 3 if you can manage it. I just could not, so I started grinding as hard as humanly possible while in an industry related to the one I wanted to be in. I was critiqued by HR professionals, networked somewhat through personal channels, and went through about 50 iterations of my résumé (no joke) for different industries -- treasury management and banking, supply chain management, financial analysis, sales, etc.

After completing those 50 iterations of my resume I then applied online for countless jobs. I had to jump through clunky and cumbersome application software hoops, uploading a resumés, sending tailored cover letters, answering an abundance of questions already in my resume. It was a very redundant process, and very frustrating.

Lots of grunt work occurred in addition to my already tiresome job. Keeping the face of the company I worked for while being in a management and leadership program, combined with hating it, is very exhausting. 

I did get two phone interviews through web applications though. These led to one panel in-person and one phone interview. I did not get offered either. I attribute that mainly to a huge lack of confidence and some desperation to get out of my first job.

Although I was still working in the job of my nightmares I had great feedback from interviewers (without them actually even giving me feedback). Because I was even considered among possibly hundreds of great candidates (a US top 25 business school is right down the road), I felt great. I still had a lot of work to do but I felt like I was on the right track -- THAT in itself is valuable and a boost of confidence. You have to find ways to validate what you're doing. As they say, practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. Corny but true.


**How I proceeded after failure...**

I will now address how I changed my approach. I hear a lot of folks complain about struggling to get some where with the job market as it is. I can understand that. Here are a few components of a successful candidate.

Being intelligent might actually be less than half of getting to where one would like to be. If I had to index components of the process, I would assign a 40% value to being smart. 

The other 60% is energy and passion. People buy passion and energy if it sounds credible. Combining intellect with energy and enthusiasm is deadly. Many believe the common denominators between highly successful people are energy and work ethic.

**Where to invest a lot of your time**

* Learn what you don't know. You can't sell yourself very well without a solid foundation in the role you want -- or at least a sound understanding.
* LinkedIn. No, I'm not advertising for this company. It's just the best we've got in terms of widespread professional networking. I hope that changes. Competition is great.
I got hired into the consumer goods industry as an analyst. Here is my process.


**A more step-by-step process**:

* Look at countless job profiles in the field you're trying to be in.
* Adapt your resume to those profiles. Incorporate buzz words that are laid out in the requirements/desired competencies. Why? Software like Taleo and other interview architectures will fish resumes for key words. These automated processes just makes HR's life easier considering the large volume of resumes they see.
* As most of us are aware, when writing a resume be concise and try to impact the reader as quickly as possible.
* Go learn enough about those buzz words and desired competencies to feel comfortable with them -- both in conversation and in execution.
* **Aim to be better than the next guy in the areas you will be asked about.**
* Create a meaningful LinkedIn presence.
* Message a recruiter in your desired industry. Make it straight-forward. Be passionate (or fake it -- both here and in the interview). Be succinct and very personable. I say fake it because charisma is a trait not all of us have. Giving yourself a little push when you have their attention is so very, very important... even if it's not in your personality. 
* Keep in mind that different kinds of recruiters exist, and most of them are trying to place big talent. They want to place a manager, director, or VP level recruit. Why? Their commission is fatter. The firm employing your recruiter will pay them handsomely (can be north of 25% of total compensation). Hang in there though. Someone is interested in you. Just keep playing the game!
* Continue all steps until you get a bite.

**Playing the long game...**

* At this point you're chomping at the bit because you know that you're ready. You've studied what is needed to study. You continue to keep your nose in periodicals and other news resources. It gets exhausting, but you want it badly.
* Now your head is in the game. You can speak generally about a broader range of topics in the field than when you started. You SOUND smart, and you really are to boot. 
* **Boom**. The recruiter lands you an interview **because you sold yourself to them. You went to *them*. They believe in you. They think, ""This guy or girl is SMART and HUNGRY. I would recommend them to my best clients.""**
* A good recruiter is going to prep you for each subsequent meeting with the company. He will instruct you to view the hiring managers' Linkedin profiles. Do it. Learn as much about them as you can. Talk about their successes in their career. Ask intelligent questions about what got them there. 
* Proceed through 2-4 interviews. Corporate America is often structured this way. There may be more interviews. 
* Be the THE MAN they want (or THE WOMAN!). Flex a bit. Be confident. You worked hard. Now you can talk casually and comfortably about the job. You're a great fit. Help them realize that. Their main concern, however, is being able to work around you for 8-9 hours per day. Be likable! It's a survival tactic.
* SMILE. Laugh. Weave words. Be transparent and as honest as you can be without raising doubt. Always leave your answers on a good note. Make them feel good (hiring managers/HR). You want them to say, ""I love you,"" after 5 minutes of meeting you.
* Get said job.

Just wanted to be a (sorta) motivational speaker here to all you engineering students.  I graduate in about two weeks and I'm incredibly excited. I'm not the best student, but I'm unique.  I'll be honest, I have a 2.83 GPA, nothing stellar.  There are many more students then me that are ""book smart."" However, I've found that being book smart won't get you anywhere near as far as being able to critically think will.

Anyway, here's something interesting to think about.  As you can imagine, with a 2.83 GPA my resume isn't stellar, I've had a couple internships, but what really makes me stand out is my senior design project.  I won't get into what it is, but it is hundreds of times more complicated then many of the other groups at my school (ok, maybe a hundred times is a little exaggerated, but i'm serious, its difficult).  I had an interview on Friday for a position with a very large company--they employ near 70,000 people which means they can pick from the cream of the crop. I had one phone interview prior to being asked to come in for a full day interview (10am-3pm). Anyway, I crushed the interview, so much so that they verbally offered me a position on the spot.

Moral of the story (TL;DR): GPA isn't everything, work hard, take on challenges and you can get any job you want. While in school, don't stress about what grades you're getting as long as you're passing. Ask for help and you'll get help. 

Best of luck to everyone out there."

Some of you might remember me from a similar thread that was posted a couple of weeks back. Well, I am back again after a successful spell with a couple of folks  giving them practice in programming interviews. I had to delete the last thread to cut the incoming PMs so that the number was manageable.

Who am I ?
I am an engineer at Amazon(can verify if you are really interested in taking this up.) looking to help provide interviewing  practice to people who are interviewing at Software firms - both internship as well as full time. 

Why?
When I was interviewing one of the biggest pain points was lack of practice in actual interviews. I could sit and solve problems all day long on paper, but when it was d-day my performance would not be of the highest standards. I am looking to fix that same problem with other folks out here. All along I received help from unprecedented quarters and I would like to do the same in whatever way I can.
Also - There is nothing more awesome than helping people get successful.

How do I sign up for this?
Send me a PM with the following information.
- Name
- Email address
- Position (Intern / full time)
- Companies you are interviewing for (If there aren't you can say meh)

Do I have to pay?
NO. It is FREE! I will need you to fill a feedback form for me once you are done :) 

What does this cover?
- resume overview
- Phone screen practice
- Verbal feedback
- Email feedback.

What happens next?
I am looking to have a slot or two next week ( week after thanksgiving). Last time there were a lot of PMs and I managed to get replies across to most of you (sorry if I missed any). After your PM I would definitely try my best to accommodate you. If not, we will set up some time in the future. 

The interview would be mainly around algos/DS/OOPS , so if the position you are applying for does not have any such interviews, this will not be of any use.

Cheerio!

My main focus is routing and switching and I would like to be doing work in an ISP or an IXP. My dream internship would be at AMS-IX(as unrealistic as that may be).
My current goal is to get brushed up to transfer and finish the CISCO track at the community college so I can possibly get some hours as a student assistant. I'm more then likely headed to UMUC to major in Computer Networking. You also have to pick a minor and I want to go for computer science. The school choice is contingent on how much in classroom courses there are but this is all speculation. I'd like to stay in state but I'll keep an open mind.
Does anyone have any words of wisdom or suggestions?"
1remo7,1,2013-11-25,Getting Good Feedback from Manager/Supervisor,cs_student404,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1remo7/getting_good_feedback_from_managersupervisor/,"Hey Guys,

I have a question about getting good feedback from my managers and supervisors at work. I have worked 4 internships in the past and I find it difficult to get good feedback from my supervisor.

A lot of times at my internships, I do not have scheduled weekly meetings with my supervisor nor do I get a lot of 1 on 1 time with them. When I do get feedback from them, a lot of times they are always the ""You're doing fine"", ""You're okay"", or ""You're getting there"" type of feedback that basically answers my question but gets me absolutely nowhere.

I find that this type of feedback is what is holding me back from getting to the next level (sooner) and I find them super valuable. I am not the rock-star intern that can get everything done without help because I don't necessary always have the technical background especially with specific technologies/framework/language that the job require. I think I am hard working and have lots of potential to be better. 

What frustrates me the most is that at the end of the internship, I am required to get written feedback for my college program from my work supervisors and sometimes they can be quite harsh or quite constructive or the ""You're doing okay"" useless type of feedback. Some of them include could dive deeper and try different strategies when solving a problem, don't be too shy/quiet, etc... I don't understand why supervisors are so hesistant in sharing this type of feedback with me during the internship as opposed to afterwards when I am leaving the company. Not only will the feedback benefit me in getting better, the company benefits from getting an even more productive intern. Also, I would absolutely hate to have certain negative traits that can be easily fixable for me to not get the returning internship or full-time offer.

Does anyone have suggestion on how to get good feedback? Sometimes I think it might have to do with the fact that some companies just do not want to invest time on interns (they come and go in a few months and are good cheap labor).

Thanks in advance!

I am a freshman (prospective computer) engineering student. Therefore I know my credentials are lacking and I have slim chances at getting an internship. I was referred to this internship through a connection with someone pretty high up at the company, and while I know they take on a good number of summer interns, I have no idea what the internship entails exactly. (The company is a car company though) 

I've never written a cover letter before and basically followed some online example. I'd really REALLY appreciate some feedback!

1regbj,0,2013-11-25,whats the point?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1regbj/whats_the_point/,"Everywhere I turn there is disappointment.  

I suck with women and as a result 21 years of my life I've been single and alone.  One reason why I have never had a girlfriend is my lack of social skills.  With those lack of social skills I also have no friends either. 

I see shit on reddit like /r/gonewild, /r/realgirls, and /r/happygirls and it just pisses me of and makes me sad at the same time that I will probably never experience that.  The feeling of having someone there by my side.  The thrill and enjoyment of sex.  The fun of having your other half there.

I used to flip shit on craigslist until I was forced out of the market due to so many people doing it.  I checked back in on it today and apparently one fucker that flagged my ads all the time has gotten to the point where he's making 6k a fucking month.  He brags about that shit on youtube.  What. The. Fuck.  I barely made a grand in 4 months of that shit. 

School isn't doing so hot.  I may have had a chance at an internship interview but I need money to pay bills and I would have had to quit my current job to pick it up.  College is supposed to be the time of your life before you sell your soul to a career and have no fun at all.   

Life is just grinding to a halt.  I'll probably end up a poorfag scraping by paycheck to paycheck.  Masturbating and cruising 4chan and reddit for hours on end. 

Its cold as fuck these days too.  I wake up pissed off.  I get out of the shower pissed off.  I get pissed off sitting in a cold car on the way to work.  Fuck the cold.  Fuck this shit.  

Oh, and I didn't win the lottery either.  Not even a buck.

There is no good in my life, what is the point of it?  "

The greatest adventure i've already had was when I took the train from San Luis Obispo (in central California) to Santa Barbara with a backpacking backpack and a 26in mountain unicycle. I asked the owner of a bike shop if i could leave my bag and unicycle at his shop while I walked around. 

The whole town was partying for a big event called Deltopia and i made some friends and started drinking. half way through the day I met the owner of a local restaurant and drank some with him. His pedal cart was stolen by some drunk guys and i helped him get it back. he called up some of his employees and tried to get them to come into work but everyone was too drunk already. i volunteered my services and he put me to work. I ran food to customers for 4 hours and took care of some minor service issues. he paid me $100 for my work and i left. I found a spot to sleep on couchsurf.org and passed out. 

i got up the next day, went back to the restaurant and swept the floors and cleaned up in exchange for a burger for breakfast. I walked along the beach and asked to borrow a boogie board which i got and caught a couple waves in the freezing water. 

That afternoon i met with the core group of organizers for Lucidity festival and helped them pack up. we drove over the mountains to the Live Oak Campground and i helped them set up the festival for 4 days. I was volunteering as a media intern with them so i got food from the volunteer tent and slept where ever i could find a spot. the festival was 3 or 4 days long and the most fun i've ever had. the day after was my birthday and i think im going to count it as the best birthday week i've ever had. I hitched a ride back to SLO after the event and had some money left in my pocket.


The greatest adventure i have planned is going to happen over winter break.

In a couple weeks i'm going to travel out to Boston to see a long lost friend. We're going to take the train all the way across the country from Boston to San Francisco in January.

I'm a graduate student doing a CS from a pretty good university. I have a couple of technical  internships (at fairly large places) and a couple of years of work experience in the industry before that. 
Now I've been preparing for  full time SDE interviews and I've given a couple of them too . But at my last interview, I drew a blank slate at a fairly simple problem. 
Moreover, over the course of prep, it seems as though I forget the stuff that I prepared a bit ago, so I find my self confused as to whether I should just review or go ahead and finish topics and come back to review. And it also happens, that I get called for an interview when I'm sort of in the middle of my preparation and then  I proceed to look up questions specific to that company and lose track of my earlier progress.

Am I doing the prep wrong? Any advice on how I should proceed? I'm also open to pairing with anyone else who may be in the process.

I'm positive I have the pre-requisite knowledge, and to be frank, from people I know at these internships, I know I'm more than qualified for them, but I don't think I can land interviews because maybe my resume doesn't portray what I really bring to the table. Everyone I talk to says everything looks great and think I'm overqualified, but maybe they're just bsing due to friendship.

1ri6e1,0,2013-11-26,Finish MBA or Follow Job Across Country?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ri6e1/finish_mba_or_follow_job_across_country/,"Last May I finally landed my dream internship at a multinational pharma company after searching for over a year. My 3 Months turned into an end of year extension. Everything has been going great, I like my job, the company, and my coworkers. I have learned a ton about how corporations operate, and I am payed well. Unfortunately my contract ends the 31st.

I met with my manager last week and he told me that another extension would be a tough sell. Contract Manufacturer QA doesn't have the biggest budget, and the senior director above him was very non-committal when he approached him about extending me. The decision is ultimately made 3 levels up.

He also let me know that we are hiring a number Internal QA personnel on a permanent basis at one of our Midwestern locations, and that I would more or less be a shoe-in based on my performance and his recommendation once these positions are posted.

The problem is that I am 29 credits through an MBA in the northeast. Looking at schools in the area of the potential position, I could transfer either 3 or 6 credits maximum. I feel that even though this is a great opportunity, I should finish school and that I might regret my decision if I transfer. I'm not sure if I could handle starting from scratch and have doubts that I would finish my degree.

On the other hand, the job search was long and miserable. It took over a year to find someone willing to give me a chance. I'm not sure that I want to do that again.

Does it make sense to put school on hold and move west for this position, or should I buckle down, start searching for new positions and hope for the best? What would you do?"

Our school is kinda in the middle of nowhere so there aren't too many internship opportunities during the academic year.

I might need to take some summer (2014) classes to catch up so that I can graduate on time. However, this means I probably won't be able to participate in any summer internship. If I have a decent GPA and some substantial personal projects, would it really be a big deal if I graduate with no internship experience? Or do I absolutely need to have one at all costs?"

The position itself is very compelling, I'd be doing work on an operating system which is what I want to do when I graduate. 

My main reservation is time. I'm almost 24 and will have a full year left when I return. I lacked definite direction when I was a bit younger so I've been in college for a long time already. I'm a little worried that I won't be able to gear back into school mode for a year upon returning. Despite all its merits it also seems like another delay in the seemingly endless progression of events leading to my eventual graduation. 

Overall I know I should take this, I guess I just need reassurance that this is a good idea. "

I would love if a major university did a study on that exact question. Sadly it does effect your tolerance to the female body, being straight after all, I've had naked models in front of me and seriously forgot they were naked when I asked them to go to set. They usually respond, ""Should I get dress"". But I do get erections but it takes a model doing cartwheels now, haha.
[Haha awesome answer.  I suspected as much, I get bored seeing my gf naked everyday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4hsk?context=5)|Lol, same boat... try and catch our podcast debuting on our youtube channel for Penthouse World.
[*Sadly it does **effect** your tolerance.*  I was going to correct you to ""affect"", but the verb form of ""effect"" is actually also kinda cromulent here...

I named the dreaded Undercrown shot by accident.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnd0hr?context=5)|Guys we have gotten an absolute kick out of this thread...I feel the need to address this in the podcast.

[Do you ever get free sex because of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn48ip?context=5)|Never... Penthouse is pretty corporate and has no tolerance for such activity. But I've heard otherwise on other companies. But me personally, never.
[How do you feel about porn fans that get all their porn for free online? (IE. everybody.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ric?context=5)|Lol, nature of the beast. Look at the Music industry, people can easily get music for free but they had to find themselves being able to adapt and change to a ever changing consumer market. Porn is like that, yes you can get free porn, its no secret, but I feel porn has opened up other related fields: Cam Shows, Stripper appearances, custom videos. Which is like the music industry. YOu can see more music artists on the road because they can't rely on just song downloads, so now they have to branch out to: merchandise, licensing, festival appearances etc etc.
 |Porn and Music are both similar in that battle: Yes its Free, but here are other options and better... blah blah blah, haha hope I answer your question.
[Would you be okay if your daughter did porn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn56xu?context=5)|I currently don't have a daughter. But if I did, I would rather have her be a doctor or a lawyer like every parents dreams. But no one sets out to be a air conditioning repair man, or a pool cleaner, but I know some pretty cool air condition repair guys and some awesome pool cleaners. I guess what I'm saying is ""Of course not, I don't even think porn stars started out dreaming of being a porn star"" But I respect your question.

[How does the whole process for scouting a location work? How much does it usually cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4axs?context=5)|There's websites dedicated to just porn locations. It ranges from homes in the Hollywood Hills to a Loft in Downtown L.A. Which brings in another topic of revenue for people who rent out there homes. Porn essentially is paying some people's mortgages, haha. But it could range from $1200 to $1800 for 8 hours. But that comes with conditions, no illegal activity, bring your own bedding, clean up afterwards, etc etc 
[A lot cheaper than I suspected...especially for a company like Penthouse. Couldn't you just rent the house for ""recreation"" or pretend you're on vacation to get lower rate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4l9b?context=5)|It's better to go through a location rental company and have them deal with insurance, neighbors, etc etc... thanks for the question and hopefully you can catch our podcast next week for the Brendan and The Bear on youtube Penthouse World.

What sort of impact has piracy had on your industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ain?context=5)|Big impact.

[Have you accidentally been ejaculated on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn44lg?context=5)|The camera I've maned has been squirted on by the female talent but I've never been hit personally. Never by the male talent.

[How much coke gets done on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4bsd?context=5)|None ever that I experience, but I've heard from other companies that that could happen. But it's pretty professional, if we suspect someone is using, we have to tell that person to go home or reschedule. But personally, its better if everyone's clean, it makes for a better shooting day. 
[Follow up question: have you ever had a girl breakdown and have to quit halfway through filming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4k3r?context=5)|YES YES YES: Ranging from Boyfriend drama, Secretly got drunk behind our back and went into rage, one model accused everyone of stealing her phone, it was in her purse... Its always a colorful days but a model freaking out is rare but it does happen.
[How does the ""talent"" act offstage?  Is it a pretty cool place to hang out, or is everyone just in and out for scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4e3v?context=5)|Talent offstage are pretty chill and professional. They come in first for hair and make up and usually hang out. Believe me when I say Porn is a SMALL WORLD and we get to build relationships with a lot of the girls that come in. Sometimes its like family but overall its great hang out but surround by the urgency of getting and setting up for the next shot.
[I've always wondered, is there ever a guy who just can't cum when the money shot scene comes? I feel like I wouldn't be able to on command with so much pressure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5jp4?context=5)|Unfortunately yes. Now I'm going to reveal some porn secrets but oh well: When that happens you either 1.) call ""cut"" and have him jack off until he's ready 2.) politely ask the female co-star to ""help him get his edge (lingo for nut, pop, etc) which she will politely go over and ask what he like: His nipples licked, tickle his balls, maybe she bends over and he licks her butthole (which I've all seen) and wait for him to cum, which he will then inform the crew he's 2 minutes away and lastly 3.) FAKE POP it in her mouth our pussy with a fake semen concoction, which thank god I never had to do. Hope that answers your question.
[How does the fake cum work? do you put it in their bladder or is there like a secret tube or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6d6q?context=5)|Put it in a tube and squirt it in her mouth or vagina.
[Where is the other end of that first round bracket? sorry but it makes it hard for me to breath while looking for the second bracket.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn77gk?context=5)|SAUDI FAT OGRE, if i could give points for best name I'd throw em your way. I'm sorry about that one. I'd fix it but it's kinda our thing now. B.
[How did you get into the business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ca9?context=5)|Starting shooting music videos. That work dried up once the record industry went down. Tried working freelance on different projects and a classmate that I went to film school with told me about Penthouse and offered me a job. You be surprise how many film school superstars started out by editing and shooting porn. I won't name names but I personally worked with 2 guys that went on have their movies premiere at Sundance.
[What is the worst freak out or flip out by a model on set you've ever witnessed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5weo?context=5)|Model comes in asking when she will get paid -Tells everyone she's going to jail because she killed someone drunk driving a month earlier -Gets drunk behind our back in the girls bathroom -Attacks cameraman on live web show -Then quickly passes out (snoring) touching herself -Call her agent -Agent picks her up -Never saw her in porn again after that.
 |But that was the most extreme in 7 years of porn. Generally not even remotely like that and that was a exception to the rule.
[Did she make it onto Efukt? I feel like I've seen this video...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6eof?context=5)|No, we would never release our content presented in that form. Just not our style. If it's showing the model is a shitty way, we edit it out. Trying to keep it classy here at Penthouse, haha. But I must admit I have seen a but of crazy videos on that site.
[Have you ever shot non-porn features or content? Do people co-mingle between the two worlds? What did you think of Boogie Nights and 8MM? How long does it take for the stigma, if any,  to wear off? What percentage of people you work with have no shame / are just doing a job  / enjoy it for what it is / just ended up there? Does Hollywood blacklist you (or\) what is their attitude?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6453?context=5)|Long list of questions but here goes: Have I shot non-porn? Yes (music videos, commercials) Co-mingle between the two worlds? Yes but mostly secretively. We've had celebrities visit our sets but I wouldn't feel comfortable mentioning names. Boogie Nights? Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius Stigma? Look, Kim Kardashian has a sex tape, Miley Cyrus is shoving her camel toe on MTV. Porn is becoming less and less Taboo Percentage? Not Sure Hollywood Blacklist? Maybe, depends on your angle and project. Diablo Cody who wrote JUNO was a stripper. Kim Kardashian &amp; Pamela Anderson have sex tapes, A-List celebrities have leaked photos, Lars Von Trier has a movie out that has real sex with A-List actors like Shia Labouf. I'm sure there is a Hollywood blacklist for some but if you approach it genuinely from your experience, then you are who you are.
[What do your parents/friends think about your career, and have you been shunned by any of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5p9m?context=5)|Friends think its awesome and my cousins feel the same way. I haven't ask my 60 year aunt how she feels what I do, because I could pretty much gage what her feelings will be. But Friends and Family under 40 generally think its cool.
[I second the question about erections...do you just think of oh, I dont know...Margret Thatcher naked on a cold day&gt;? or is it just one of those things that people don't notice...? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4cnv?context=5)|Desensitized I guess. Being on set is a stressful atmosphere, you're more worried about getting that camera angel correct as oppose to hitting on the naked girl. But hopefully you can see and hear our podcast when it debuts on our youtube channel next week.
[Calling the girls 'camera angels' isn't considered hitting on them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4veb?context=5)|Lol sorry typo ""angle""
[Do you prefer the naked female body now after being in the industry or some lingerie tease? How have your tastes for intimate relations changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7mvn?context=5)|Personally I prefer lingerie, I like a little left to my imagination.
[How has your work as a director affected your views on pornography and sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4i9o?context=5)|A great deal, being raised Catholic and a (cough cough) former alter boy (don't worry, never got touched) its change my view on porno and sex in the sense that EVERYONE does it. Okay, Almost everyone does it and you shouldn't be ashamed of it. The internet exist because of porn I feel sometimes, but as long as everyone participating in whatever crazy kinky shit your getting into willingly, that should be your right. But if you feel dirty about it, then maybe get another hobby.
[You're being chased through the streets of Los Angeles by a pack of angry polar bears.  You don't know why they are there, but you know why they are angry.  They will eventually catch up to you, but before you do, you have a choice to make.  There is a subway station 30 feet to your left and a limping homeless man 30 feet to your right.  in front of you is an alley that appears to end with no exit.  Which direction do you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdna0s7?context=5)|Mate that's a hard one. i didn't know they travelled in packs but I guess that's the hand I've been dealt. I'll just wait for the doctor to show up.
[Fezzes are cool.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdng0j6?context=5)|Allons-y!
[Do you have certain things you HAVE to shoot set out at the start of the day? Not just a shot list, but are you provided with any kind of brief from higher up of ""This video must contain x, y for z number minutes"", or is it all down to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6fv5?context=5)|We definitely have a set agenda. Its almost down to a science: ""Okay 4 more minutes of softcore"" ""Let's build up to their first kiss within the first 4 minutes"", things like that. And strips have a formula. Basically almost everything has a formula... kind of, haha. Sorry. hopefully I answered your question.
[How was this formula derived? Market research, statistical studies, personal preference, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnwna5?context=5)|As a director you know how many hours you have the talent for, when we pen our scripts we know how long to spend on each scene, experience is key. I'll touch on that during the podcast. It was a learning curve that's for sure.
[Are the girls normally genuinely turned on? Or is it mostly fake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn59wk?context=5)|""turned on"" is somewhat subjective. But the sex is definitely 100% real.
[So fake.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5vcf?context=5)|Haha, well shit, if you have to fuck upwards to 10 guys a month, they are not all going to be super horny and turned on. But that dick is definitely going into that vagina, that sure ain't no CGI effect, haha. But I've seen male and female co-stars fucking off camera in the corner because they are genuinely into it. So its totally subjective upon the talent 
[What is the weirdest thing that has happened on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6zpm?context=5)|The cops showed up once. It was pretty funny when they realized the noise complaint was from a porn shoot. They just smiled and told us to try and keep it down. It was a Pool Scene.
[ then the cops slowly walked up to the scene while taking off their clothes and turning it into a 4 way. Right? Right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnwnwc?context=5)|Hahaha, there's a script in there.
[Thanks for the AMA. I have a couple of questions!  When you are dating, how soon do you tell your date what your profession is? Also what reactions do you get from women (or men?\) when you tell them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7i40?context=5)|2 - for me (Brendan) My wife knew from the first date we went on that I worked in porn. I'd say her first reaction was hysterical laughter then a barrage of questions.
[For people that act in porn, is that their full-time job? Or do they have other jobs also?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7i40?context=5)|1 - for the most part it is their fulltime job. A lot of them have their own enterprises on the side (clothing lines, perfumes etc)
[When you watch porn outside of work do you constantly critique it or just enjoy it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5h9q?context=5)|I must admit I do critique it but I try to enjoy it.
[Film student here. Offer any internships? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn64da?context=5)|Advice: Check craigslist in L.A. I'm sure they pop up. Currently none at Penthouse at the time.
[What does your family think about you guys being in porn? Are you going to tell your children, assuming you have any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4mzz?context=5)|As far as me (aka Gerry) I try and hide it as much as possible to my Mother, but the rest of my family think its pretty cool.
 |As far as Brendan: Everyone knows Everyone loves it.
[Has any family members or friends asked you for help in making a homemade porn video? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5gcw?context=5)|Lol, no. Not yet... hope never, haha.
[How do your significant others feel about what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn7wde?context=5)|They're completely fine with it. It's a job not a lifestyle and it certainly doesn't follow me home.
[What do you think as technology develops will be the next ""big thing"" in porn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ojd?context=5)|Penthouse is still keeping on pursuing the advancement of 3D within porn and generally, the next ""big thing"" in porn: who knows, interactive porn. it's being discussed.
[Edit: developed to develops.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4ojd?context=5)|Brendan is currently working on a interactive porn app for Penthouse.
[Interactive?  How so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5b9a?context=5)|Top secret, just kidding. The app superimposes the girls image over your live feed, aka skype, facetime, but would you like us to address this further for our podcast... We will be more than happy to go further in explaining the idea and process.
[How many of the actors/actresses you shoot have plastic surgery? is it a common thing? is there a stigma against it? or are you not told that stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8edy?context=5)|Our talent varies as much as peoples personal taste. We try to cater to as many markets as possible. A good percentage of them have had breast enlargements but there are a lot of girls that haven't had any work done at all.
[Penthouse is still around? I thought the magazine had stopped publishing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5pld?context=5)|Penthouse is still around. Just saw some at my local 7-Eleven :)
[How did you get into the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4mkh?context=5)|By chance, I touched on it earlier. Got connected with another Film School friend of mine who was in porn.
[Tisch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5mg3?context=5)|No. School out here in L.A.
[Has it had a positive or negative effect on you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn4dby?context=5)|Porn has had an overall positive effect. Meeting different people and having a job that has a creative side is a bonus. Stay tuned out podcast debuting next week on our youtube channel for Penthouse World.
[What do you think of all the ridiculous restrictions trying to be passed in Cali on pornographic actors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8orz?context=5)|Personally I don't agree with it one bit, but it's a political issue left to others for debate, we will adapt to law changes.
[What's something in Krafty that we would find interesting? And are there vegan porn stars? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn5rfk?context=5)|""Krafty"" not sure what that means but I'll try and answer to the best I can. So before we order lunch, we always ask talent and crew if they have any dietary restrictions and we accommodate and diets: vegan, gluten, etc etc 
[Does Penthouse employ any female directors/camerawomen? Are they regarded any differently than men for being in that profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnaxtk?context=5)|The president that runs the company is a woman, she used to direct films here also. There are a lot of females that work on set and with the talent. It's a very diverse work force that's for sure.
[How do normal people get started in getting a job like that? (Assuming there isn't an inside connection you have\) I assume there isn't a ""Careers"" menu on the site, haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn663a?context=5)|Normal people like myself start from the bottom typically: first you become an assistant editor, then an editor, then a script writer, then a production assistant, then a camera operator, then finally a writer/director. Well that's at least how I did it. 
[Gotcha. Though, how would someone become an assistant editor? Where would you even apply for something like that? Question stays the same with any porn company. I'm asking for, err... A friend. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6fc2?context=5)|Honestly, Craigslist is your best bet. You just have to look for the secret words in the job description. When you see an ad for an video editor that states: ""Must be comfortable with adult related content."" That equals, ""Hey we shoot porn, care to edit vaginas"" 
[Is most ""amateur"" porn actually staged, because it seems to me that it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9566?context=5)|It depends. There is proper amateur which is you and the mrs making a home movie together, then there is amateur couples that get hired simply because they are amateur...sort of a one hit deal though in my opinion.
[If you weren't in the porn industry what would you see yourself doing, would other occupations not live up to the excitement of the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8ffo?context=5)|I've had many gigs outside of porn that I loved. I could easily see myself working in a more mainstream field but the porn industry is a lot of fun.
[What inspired you to get into film making? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6y3e?context=5)|Probably seeing movies when I was young and learning what a director was and a cinematographer was. I first went into Photography in High School and then College but later changed it to Film. But grabbing the family video recorder and shooting homemade movies with my friends probably sparked that interest.
[Will Penthouse be doing 4k porn? Any plans already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9qke?context=5)|Just discussion phase at the moment. Nothing as of yet.
[Working in the industry, do you find you can still enjoy porn for how 14 year old you did? I often find that working in a particular industry makes me either concentrate too much on the small things (pun\) or lose interest completely.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnb8ac?context=5)|That's a good question. I was discussing that one with Gerry earlier on.  For me personally I remember sneaking into my old mans room and stealing his magazines (penthouse black ironically)  Since working in the industry I have found myself not watching it at home...probably because I'm not getting paid to do it lol.  Also the hunt for porn when i was a young teen was a lot more fun than typing into google 'big tit asian threesome'. Kids have got it too easy these days! 
[Not quite sure how to word this..Do actors (probably more likely females\) ever get emotional or have freak outs, while shooting? I watch a lot of porn but I would never actually have the guts to do it, do any actors ever have mid-scene regrets over what they are doing or sudden modesty issues? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn8rom?context=5)|We've had very few freak outs on set. Most of the talent that walk through the door are very professional but there was the time I addressed in a previous comment with a previous actress who had Boyfriend drama on set.
[Do you get a free subscription to Penthouse? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn6j82?context=5)|Yes. We get a stack of Penthouse Magazine for anyone to grab every time a new issue comes out.
[You mentioned going to craigslist for starting out doing behind the scenes stuff, but where would one go from there? Lets say you do enough craigslist based films to where your name gets passed around among amateur directors/pornstars to where they request you for the film. How do you move out of amateur porn if not by accident? Do you send some of your work to porn companies or just hope your work gets stumbled upon by a big time producer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn900s?context=5)|Under the tv/film/video section of the jobs tab. if you type in adult to the search bar you would more than likely see a post if it's up. 
[I doubt big time companies look for behind the scenes people on craigslist, unless they do...I don't know. But my question was more specifically where do you go to possibly get into a big time company once you've broken into the industry doing amateur work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9cy3?context=5)|I got my job starting from craigslist (brendan) so they do hire from there,not all the time, but they definitely do post there. if you have the credentials to match the job you'll get the call.
[Whats the grossest thing you've had occur on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnb08z?context=5)|Seeing how it's 2am here I'll have gerry answer that one for you tomorrow - brendan.
[Have your standards heightened or lowered at all since seeing all the porn actresses every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn63pe?context=5)|My standards pretty much stayed the same. But sometimes your taste are subject to the right casting for the script.
[Have you ever jacked off on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9ek8?context=5)|Haha me personally no, but I'm sure it happens 
[Silly question from me: So porn isnt real, they arent really enjoying the sex or even HAVING it, its just to get the footage out etc etc. So, in an orgy porn, when the camera focuses on one couple or like a certain side, does the action just die down everywhere else with a few moans here and there?  Do anybody actually keep going at it after the shoot has ended? Or real backstage sex etc? Or are all backstage sex staged anyways? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnam1b?context=5)|DoubledCashew asked that question earlier but I have seen actors and actresses continue to go at off set when we stop rolling.
[My husband wants to get into the business, any advice on how to get started? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn9k5b?context=5)|What aspect of the industry does he want to be in?
[How can I work for Penthouse!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdn89v7?context=5)|See previous answer ;)
[How has working in porn affected your dating/love life? Have you ever had any experiences where your date is just disgusted or the opposite? Or if married, does your wife ever question your line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdndbiw?context=5)|Gerry - engaged, fiance is very supportive  Brendan - married, wife thinks it's hilarious 
[Obviously very late to the party, hopefully someone can still answer this question. Do the guys actually cum in the girls (when the videos don't end in a cum shot\)? In heterosexual porn there are no condoms used, so is everyone on wicked strong birth control? Or is it fake cum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnc610?context=5)|The guys really cum, we went a little more in depth earlier but yes it's real.
[Would you want porn films to make it big in hollywood? and if so, which actress/actor do u want to act in YOUR movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdncn1h?context=5)|It's about as mainstream as it's going to get. we broadcast in a few different countries. But I doubt anyone would take a porn movie seriously enough to make it to a theater...theater owners would be handing out boxes of tissues with the 3d glasses.
[With all due respect but from my understanding (and I could be wrong\) but you guys don't show penetration, right?  So with that prefaced what is Penthouse's competitive edge in today's porn market when you can see things like Midget bukakke for free on any tube site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnd6g6?context=5)|Industry secret, any softcore movie you see will have a hard core counterpart. we film them at the same time and just make sure the soft doesn't show any dick during editing.
[I have a question? Are you proud of your work, I mean will you tell your kids about it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdncxh1?context=5)|At an age when it's appropriate.

[Does your sex drive get reduced because of watching porn like all day? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdncsan?context=5)|Haha no not really. You tend to forget you're even watching porn. I'm looking for 3d convergence errors, soft core issues, audio problems etc so I'm not really paying close attention to the action itself.
[Which editing software should I familiarize myself with if I want to get a job in the porn industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnimuo?context=5)|I would recommend a variety. final cut or premiere. after effects, cinema 4D. the more you can do the more they want you, just like the girls.
[Being a director do you guys think about directing a legit movie with a serious script? if so people might not take it seriously because of porn background ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdnc8jh?context=5)|A lot of the production crew are involved in other projects completely outside of porn. I try not to over think it.
[Female squirting - real or pee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rgvgz/i_am_a_a_porn_director_for_penthouse_ask_me/cdndfw5?context=5)|It's real, we have a few actresses that are squirters

1rgy5t,0,2013-11-25,[Serious] What career/job advice do you have for a soon to be college seeking to move up the ranks quickly?,search2348,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rgy5t/serious_what_careerjob_advice_do_you_have_for_a/,"I start working at Bank of America (Technology side) when I graduate and I have never worked in that professional of an environment. Previous internships I've had have been more of the business-casual and start up style companies. I am not nervous, but I want to do the best I can.

Any advice is welcome, as I know I have a lot to learn. (ex: addressing higher ups in the company, dressing style, socializing within the company, etc)"
1rgn7y,5,2013-11-25,Should I sign this internship contract?,creativelogic101,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1rgn7y/should_i_sign_this_internship_contract/,"Is this a bit strange to be included in a contract for an unpaid internship with an entertainment media company?:

Image 3: http://i.imgur.com/YvIm7Wx.png
 
 

My concern is that by agreeing to this I am essentially putting myself at risk to be accused of unfairly using any ideas that I may have come up with during my time with the agency, even years down the line. Could it even be the case that I could be accused of coming up with an idea years down the line that was similar to an idea I had while interning, however untrue that accusation may be? And is it strange to require me to cover their legal fees/lose the right to a jury if this were the case? (Currently located in New York).

I am pretty upset with this possibly unfair contract since it is a high-profile company. I had to do several interviews to secure this position. Still, I don't want to put myself at risk in the future. 

Should I sign this contract?

1rghue,8,2013-11-25,CS Internships in Chicago?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rghue/cs_internships_in_chicago/,"For a number of reasons, I'd like to stay in the Chicago area for a summer internship. I'm a junior in Computer Science at a very very good school for CS and I have a decent resume/GPA. I know most people head to Silicon Valley/Seattle/East Cost for dev jobs, but I was wondering how I could find internships that would serve me well in the city of Chicago."
1rlnul,92,2013-11-27,"Graduated with a BS in ME in 2011, had no internships, and haven't landed an engineering position since. Feeling really lost, what can I do?",mouselamp,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1rlnul/graduated_with_a_bs_in_me_in_2011_had_no/,"I studied mechanical engineering and graduated with a bachelor's in it in 2011 with a 3.34 GPA, but throughout my time at college I never had an internship. After I graduated, I didn't have a job for about a year, and for the last year I had a job in a completely unrelated field. I've interviewed at a few places and really felt like I came close to some, especially over the last year, but nothing really landed.

Now, 2.5 years after graduating and with zero relevant experience, I'm really having a hard time figuring out what to do. I apply to job postings that don't list any experience requirements, and never hear back. My resume is pretty thin. I think part of the reason I haven't been able to land an ME job is simply because I have no real passion for it. I only realized that during my senior year, when I felt it was too late to do anything about it. I really don't have any idea what sort of ME job I'd like to do. In school I understood most of what I learned in all of my classes, but I never really felt like I knew what to do with it. 

A big part of me just wishes I could get some ME job doing anything just to have some experience on my resume, but I don't think many places will look too hard at a guy who hasn't done anything with his degree in two years. 

Another part of me wishes I had studied computer science, as I've always liked programming but just haven't done a lot of it. I'm considering taking some CS courses at a community college and teaching myself some other languages, and then trying to get a programming job with my knowledge listed on my resume, but I don't know if that's a good idea. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, or does anyone have any advice? I feel like I'm at the point where I'm already forgetting the stuff I learned, and if I don't find a way to use my degree soon it'll be too late."

1rkywg,2,2013-11-27,Looking for off-campus roommate from Aug 2014 on,[deleted],Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/1rkywg/looking_for_offcampus_roommate_from_aug_2014_on/,"So it's a little early to start looking but I don't think it hurts to get a head start. Right now I live in a huge house with far too many messy roommates and I'm looking to change that next year. I'm looking for my own place right now but that likely won't work out due to the higher rent prices for a 1 BR or Studio. I'm interested in living in one of the nicer and newer apartment complexes. Paseo Verde by the train station is the one I'm really interested in, though I would consider others such as the building from the future at 18th and Berks with underground parking, the Modules, whatever that place in front of the Montgomery Police Station is just east of 12th, Lighthouse Apartments a little further south, any very nice places like this that become affordable with a roommate.

Paseo Verde is currently my place of choice though, so many amenities and comes down to about $700/mo per person when split 2 ways. Places are huge and extremely nice and in a great location. I don't think they are furnished but I have plenty to bring.

So a little about myself: I'm a going for a BBA in Management Information Systems, maybe a Masters in IT Security as well. I'm a sophomore right now and a junior starting next semester. I'm interested in soccer, music, cooking, video games, movies, and general nightlife activities. I like to learn skills in my free time is well like web development. I also have an internship down in University City and go home one or two weekends a month. I'm easy to get along with and am always a reasonable and level-headed roommate. Basically all I require of you as that you're willing to keep common areas clean. My biggest issue with my living situation this year is the kitchen is disastrous and living room is filthy, so I spend more time than I would like in my clean room.

So if you feel you may be a fit with me as a roommate and also are interested in living at some of the same properties I am, inbox me or respond here. Thanks for reading"
1rkk1r,0,2013-11-27,Night Float Part 2,TheGroovyTurt1e,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1rkk1r/night_float_part_2/,"So, things have taken a turn for the weird during night float... and the dangerous.  I'll back up and say that the shadows and tappings are still present as ever but had...I guess hit some kind of plateau? Over the past few days I've gotten used to them to the point of completely disregarding them...almost. 

Last night Jerry coded, the overhead operator reported the code, and I made a break for his room two floors below me.  When I got to his room the code team was already on the job.  I took over performing chest compressions while the defib paddles were put in place (thankfully we have enough resources to not have those ridiculous old school ones that still seem so popular in movies). 
As I was performing chest compressions, I began to notice just how dark the room was despite the bright over head lights that are turned on during a code. 

I looked at Jerry his eyes sunken into his head, eyes that were once so desperate as he held my wrist tighter than I ever thought any gomer could.  I wondered if I would ever see Jerry's eyes open again.  I was becoming fatigued and relieved of chest compressions by another intern, I turned and looked at the monitor, it wasn't looking pretty, but it had become a a rhythm worthy of shock (V. Fib for all you ACLSers out there).  As I heard the senior running the code shout clear and deliver the shock, the entire room seemed to brighten back up again, the shadows briefly retreated, but just as quick as the light came it left, and the darkness swarmed in. 
Immediatly we jumped back into CPR while keeping an eye on the monitor, I took another turn at chest compressions, this time paying more attention to the shadows around the room than to the fragile man's chest I was compressing.  

What seemed strange to me was that with every compression and release the shadows seemed to have an eb and a flow that corresponded to my compressions.  Between performing them and monitoring the shadows (instead of the monitor like I should have been), I almost didn't here the senior yell ""clear!""  I got away to see another shock delivered, with a subsequent burst of light, but this time, more of the light remained.  Somehow I knew we had Jerry back.

I shouted that I had a pulse almost before I actually felt that reasurring sensation in Jerry's neck.  I looked around the room, and saw the shadows still present, but distant.  I couldn't help but feel a little cocky, I thought of my favorite scene in GoT.
""What do we say to the god of death?"" 
""Not today.""
I walked out of the room with more swagger than any intern has the right to.  I turned around for one last look, the room became almost pitch black as the over head light turned a muted gray.  Jerry coded again. 

We started again, pushed drugs, juiced him so many times a plug in generator would've been jealous, and compressed his chest enough that I know quite a few of his ribs were broken.  At the end of all of it he was pronounced dead.  The room's muted light returned to its base line as a feeling of nausea came over me. 
I returned to my floor feeling confused, angry, terrified and guilty.  The shadows and the tapping have once again increased in intensity but now seem to have a more malevolent playfulness to them instead of simply moving they seem to dance, the tapping that seemed so rigid and mathetical now has the cadence of a nursery rhyme. 
All of this scares me enough, but what trully fills me with fear, dread and worst of all helpelessness.  The dark and the tappings, seem to have taken a liking to the pediatric wing.  I don't know what to do.

:--|:--
[You've spent around a month per country, where do you stay? In hotels, hostels, apartments?  How long did it take to get your business automated to the point where you could just take off?  Did you sort out visas before you leave or did you sort them out while on the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozhnm?context=5)|I say I average to about 2 months per country. I try to be as thorough as possible when traveling to a country since I usually have to cross border-to-border (overland) anyways.  My spending on accommodations has increased with time. Sleep is extremely important as it's what keeps you agile for both on the road and business. In the beginning, I would stay in dormitories, which was great fun as you get to meet so many new people, but it turned out to be not so great for doing work at night. Dorms turned into shared rooms at hostels, then to single rooms in the recent quarters. I got a real idea of how sustainable this nomadic way of living is when I lived in a private apartment in Bali via AirBnB. That was a much appreciated comfort!
[Do you have employees running your business back home? Or is this a one man operation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozhnm?context=5)|One thing I noticed in Tim Ferriss' book is that his sports nutrition supplements company must have either been an extremely automated, heavily bootstrapped business that was in a very high profit margin, or that he's over-inflating his income. It's impossible to run a fully functioning and growing online store with a single hire that is the assistant. I know I've tried that model and it was impossible in my experience. I have a couple of employees who are located from all over. We communicate via emails and Skype.  The business was running for nearly a year before I left my country. It's easy to automate a business, but it's much harder to grow it passively. You always need to put in the time to grow a business!
 |I sort out the visas on the road. I had no idea where I was going to go next when I first landed in my first country, Singapore.
[Singaporean here, I'm interested in how you find our country!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0jvl?context=5)|Singapore was the first country I visited! It's an amazingly modern country with a lot of growth ahead. Very polite people and very impolite taxi drivers ;) My company is actually incorporated in Singapore! 
[Glad that you liked it here! Sad to hear about the taxi drivers though, they can get rather grumpy at times. Wonderful website by the way, I think it's quite the novel idea. It'll make a great gift for Christmas!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp2f2n?context=5)|Thanks for the kind word! Hold up on making that purchase. Wait for the Black Friday promotions :) Check our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Postertext) for the coupon code tomorrow.
[Say you found a special someone and wanted to have kids. Out of all the countries you have been to which one would you raise your kids in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyr8d?context=5)|I don't know if I'm being biased because it's my home or I'm really that lucky to have been raised in a truly multi-cultural and diverse country, but I really love Canada.
 |I would want my kids to live in a place where the people are kind and are from a full range of backgrounds with wilderness/nature/mountains/lakes just a few hours away.
[Is it lonely? do you keep in touch with friends? do you make new friends? In your perspective, what is dating like or what would it be like if that were to become something you wanted to take up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozg9g?context=5)|My friends can attest to this. I'm absolutely terrible at keeping in touch with friends. It's gotten much better now that I've installed LINE (IMO a much better alternative to Whatsapp) on my phone and computer. And I know there are a lot of Facebook haters out there, but for someone like me, Facebook is a god-send. It helps so much in keeping up with old and new friends who you've crossed paths with.
 |Yes, it does get quite lonely sometimes. But all that's needed is to join a local tour, head to hostels or just talk to people on the street!
 |Dating on the road is very interesting and confusing (and fun)! Sometimes it feels like a very long extended date when you spend days or weeks traveling together, seeing and experiencing some unforgettable things with just the two of you. It gets confusing when you don't know if it's just the lust of traveling that you're feeling or if they're genuine feelings for the other person.
[Dating is definitely ""interesting and confusing (and fun!\)"" - there's almost no better way to get to know how someone handles life than traveling with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp123l?context=5)|Agreed! But I think it's important to realize that the way a person carries him/herself in a settled life is very different when they're traveling. Traveling brings out different sides in people, but those sides are in no way defining.
[If you could give your past Day 1 Company starting self one piece of advice what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0wf7?context=5)|Picking a country to incorporate your business in is far more important than you think! Singapore is a great country to start a business in with their tax incentives and structures, but I find it to be a poor choice in hindsight given that my business is online-based and that most of my customers are in the US.
 |I wish I had incorporated it in the US. It's worth paying more taxes just to get the newest and best technologies, tools and services to help out with work. For example, I really really want to use Stripe's payment services, as well as the full feature set from Shopify. 
[You're Canadian.  Shopify is a Canadian company.  Canada is one of the few countries that can use Stripe.  Why not just incorporate in Canada?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp41x8?context=5)|I thought the tax savings would have been worth it for Singaporean incorporation. Also, I was thinking of possibly settling down in Singapore so I wanted to establish a business there (so I can more easily get residency).
[How do you handle clothes? You can't possibly bring all of your clothes with you, that'd be annoying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0kvu?context=5)|I wear mostly tech clothes. They're comfortable enough to wear and they can handle the nastiest of environments and the harshest activities. I prepare clothing for all seasons. It's not too heavy at all. The bulk of the weight comes from my work gear: electronics and such.
[What are ""tech clothes""?  Genuine question - I have no idea but I'm curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp230i?context=5)|Lightweight, durable, fast drying clothes :) The kinds you buy at outdoor gear shops.
[What kind of nasty stuff do you get into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp26u7?context=5)|Can't tell you. Too nasty :o.
[Want to do the same thing , just need to know , did you have money at the start ? how you launch this ? I have no money , but truly want do this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoze16?context=5)|I started my business with about $150 dollars. The business had been online for about a year before I started my travels.
 |If you're interested in doing the same, I highly recommend reading 4-Hour Workweek, as well as frequenting sites like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
 |I was fortunate enough to have some entrepreneurial experience before launching Postertext, and I would recommend doing the same before starting a business that will be funding your travels!
[Have you read ""The 100$ Startup"" ? I wonder if it is equally usefull as the book you recommend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp23m6?context=5)|Nope, haven't. Sorry, can't make the comparison for ya.
[My question is regarding what you've learned and how you've matured in the 3 years. I look at the last 3 years of my life, and a lot has changed (finished uni, lived in big cities, different relationships, etc\). Do you find that you have a bunch of 'aha' life defining moments or a collection of great memories that merge together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ioi?context=5)|Hey Nick! I've written this response so many times now. You've asked such a great question and I don't even know how to begin to express how I've grown over the recent years. This won't be all encapsulating but I'll give a couple.
[All my best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ioi?context=5)|Meeting a range of personalities from different backgrounds and cultures who perceive the world around them and their accounts of history so differently, I realize everything is a matter of perspective, and that it's most important for a balanced individual to see things in as many perspectives as possible, despite how it makes you feel. Beauty is in all things, just as well as ugliness. It's great to be uplifted by beautiful moments (and there are an abundance when you travel) but you only polarize your view of the world if your tendency is to see it with a smile on your face. I would rather see the world as it is then to be constantly happy. To travel is to experience the world, and traveling for however long I've traveled my experience has taught me to see the world in full color.
[If you had to pick one place you would travel to again, where would it be? And do you always travel alone, and if thats the case, whats it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyyln?context=5)|I would love the opportunity to travel to each and every single country again after a decade or two. It would be immensely interesting to see how each country has progressed and how the travel experience has changed. If I were to pick one single country though, it would perhaps be Myanmar. It's perhaps my favorite country that I've visited and it was relatively recent that Myanmar opened its borders to the world so I'm sure the country will be (and already has) been going through some monumental changes.
[Im more interested in the financial freedom you have. How did you get the idea for your business and how have you been growing it? What is the biggest challenge you've faced as a business owner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0jvd?context=5)|I got the idea from a posting here on reddit several years ago. There was a lot of interest in this kind of illustration but very few were taking the idea as a serious venture at the time. I decided to make a poster for a friend of mine who's an avid reader and she suggested that I should consider selling these prints. After making a few illustrations, I made a post on reddit to get feedback and suggestions and it blossomed from there! This is very much a lifestyle gifted to me by reddit!
 |The biggest challenge would be to find passionate and talented people who can work in their home environment without a boss around. I'm very happy to have found the staff that I work with!
[How do you get past the language barriers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoz2td?context=5)|Luckily, most people understand hand gestures **except for South Koreans**. I would make hand gestures for sleeping and eating (flatly clasps hands beside head; one hand carrying bowl and the other scooping action), and I would say 1/20 people got the hand gestures compared to say 1/5 in other countries. I didn't have to use too many of those gestures though except for outside of the cities since most people speak decent English.
[Were there any countries you visited that did not speak English even in the major cities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoza9b?context=5)|Most locals would be able to utter at least a few words in English in the countries I've visited. Even if it's just a word, the context of the situation and their body language is usually enough for communicating. As for fluency, I find South Koreans to be the most timid with their English. I have no doubts that they understand English but they didn't speak it to me.
[You can get a book that is very small and is just pictures in various categories so you can point to what you want rather than having to use sign language. Link to www.amazon.co.uk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ssz?context=5)|That's a nifty idea! My hand gestures has helped me well enough for my travels so far. If that fails, I might just consider getting that book!
[Do you stick to cheaper areas in order to afford your lifestyle? Have you ever thought you weren't going to have enough to make it home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozv86?context=5)|I started in South East Asia because it was the cheapest to live in. The business was still in its teens so it would make more sense that way.
 |Never had a problem with the finances luckily.
[Speaking of finances, what do you do for a bank? Fellow Canadian here and I am thinking of going to live and teach in se Asia, I am with bmo now as my bank. Can I keep this, or do I need a new bank account when moving to a new country? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp27sl?context=5)|Select Service from TD Canada was the best option 3 years ago. Check out redflagdeals and peak around there. There might be better alternatives now.
[How much do you make per quarter? How much are you spending to travel and live per quarter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyjjn?context=5)|The thing with being a small business owner is that your income is directly tied with the company's. That said, it's somewhere in the low 5 figure range.
 |I don't have a real budget when it comes to traveling since some countries have very different living standards and costs of living. I always just try to live like a common local when I'm traveling: taking public transport, eating at local restaurants where there are most people, etc.
[So 10k? Per quarter or yearly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyy0e?context=5)|Quarterly. And more than that :)
[How much on average would you say it costs to travel and live from country to country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoz103?context=5)|Sorry, I really don't keep count. It's already a bit crazy keeping up with the everyday happenings of a company.
 |EDIT: See OliverTheWanderer's reply above. He does a great job answering it!
[Interesting... I think its great that you've taken such a proactive approach to traveling while also maintaining a stable business. Has it been taxing for you? I mean, you must get very little sleep...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoygic?context=5)|It can get very taxing, but the good thing about being self-employed is that you have some control over when and how much you work. During my most productive days, I may be traveling across several cities and doing work in my room at the end of the day for many hours. But during my rest days, I'm staying at a comfortable city for the entire day at a cafe doing work on my laptop.
[How do you deal with the copyrights? Can you just freely make these AWESOME posters off the books or do you have to call someone first? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0g5r?context=5)|We're working on getting rights from publishers but they respond very slowly. It's a long process to get rights for contemporary books.
 |The titles we've covered are from the public domain so no copyrighting issues there.
[How did you get started on your business? How did you tesch yourself what you needed to run it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0arj?context=5)|I've always been entrepreneurial during my university years, participating in campus events and conferences relating to startups and business even before starting my first business (several years ago).
 |Read books, and participate in entrepreneurial communities both locally and online. The most important advice I can give to any aspiring entrepreneur is to start a business project right now, **today**. You have no excuse to not start one. It's extremely simple these days. All the tools and resources are at your fingertips!
[I am nowhere near this kind of environment but i've always felt a pull from this world. My only solution is through the web. Where should I start? Is there a forum you can recommend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0r4a?context=5)|[Link to news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a great place to start!
[So, being an AMA, I guess I'll ask... How long do you plan on doing this? Three years so far, are you just going to keep going until you don't feel like it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyt3m?context=5)|I'm not quite sure how long I'll keep doing this. I can see myself traveling for at least another 3 years, but my pace of travel might need an adjustment. Being on the road on a daily basis then having to work a full day's work at night takes a toll on your health. I guess I'll keep going until I feel the need to start a family.
[Intersting story here... I've always been motivated to try this way of working, unfortunately, i'm currently doing an engineering school so I prefer to be graduated first.  Through the comment, I saw that u recommended some books, but have you some advices for beginners who want to do like you ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozw71?context=5)|Yes! Start a business right now! The internet has allowed anyone to learn as much as they like on any subject. There's a plethora of resources online on entrepreneurship. I hear the community at 4-Hour Workweek is quite active and helpful too. I don't visit their boards (too busy with reddit :)) but they would have a lot more specific resources for you as most people there are trying to establish this work &amp; play lifestyle.
[Did you hire someone else to handle transactions or write the code for your website? I can imagine that being an issue for a college student ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ya3?context=5)|There are a lot of pre-packaged ecommerce solutions out there. If I was starting out today, I would definitely go with the hosted SaaS solutions such as Shopify or Big Commerce. No coding involved!
[What a neat idea for a business. At first I was confused on how you would automate this, but then I realized I was stupid lol. All you would need to do is come up with the designs and then arrange the print around them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0bl3?context=5)|It's not quite as simple as just illustrating something and then selling it. I like quality in all things so my approach is more quality than quantity when it comes to our art prints. My staff and I spend hours brainstorming and discussing each novel in question. We have a real passion for not just representing a book aesthetically but to capture and embody the soul of the story in a way the author would have done him/herself if they were an artist.
[How long does it take for you or whoever comes up with the designs to create one for a person that requests a book instead of picking from already made prints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0bl3?context=5)|There's been competitors who's sprung up in the recent years who I envy for the quantity of works they push out, but again, our focus is on the quality. After all, these art prints are for the diehard fans out there.
[How can I join you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyj9n?context=5)|Pick up Tim Ferriss' book! I had a rough idea of how I was going to travel and work at the same time, but reading his book really laid out the foundations for me. There are a few clever tips that has helped me immensely during my first year.
[Can you highlight the main tips that you found the most useful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0tfv?context=5)|On traveling or on business+traveling?
 |For solely traveling, I would suggest picking only a handful of must-see destinations and fill in the gaps as you go. You get less of a feel and understanding of a country if you only visit the must-see locations as they tend to be mostly touristic places. The fun parts of travel comes from the inbetweens!
[Do you ever touch base back in Canada every once in a while, or have you been overseas exclusively for the last 3 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozmcx?context=5)|I've been exclusively overseas.
[How do you get at your money while travelling, do you have a home bank in Canada and just pay crazy service charges to get at it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozmcx?context=5)|I keep my bank accounts in Canada. I'm with the Select Service plan with TD Canada Trust, which waives a lot of international fees. I highly recommend it. No ATM fees!
[Do you still have to pay income tax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozmcx?context=5)|Yes to income tax! There are ways to get around it given my nomadic lifestyle, but it's not worth the risk of tax trouble on the road and the lost of my Canadian passport!
[They recently changed the name of Select Service to the All Inclusive Banking Plan. Just a heads up, cause it confused me and many others I know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp14a2?context=5)|Thanks for that. I would have never known. 
[My offer stands!If you are ever passing trough N-W Romania It would be my privilege to invite you to a beer or some traditional food(or even an interview if i'm lucky\)!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xsc?context=5)|I'll take you up on that offer once I reach there! And I'm happy to have motivated you!
[What countries have you visited?, out of all the countries which one is your favourite?  When travelling do you have a certain budget, What type of hotels do you stay in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdozt6a?context=5)|Most of Asia, with Central Asia finished next year. My favorite country would be Myanmar. See my other comment for more details.
[Most of Asia? :D have you had the chance to visit Lebanon maybe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1wrn?context=5)|SOOON.
[Ever been to Byron Bay in NSW, Australia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp19qj?context=5)|Yes, the Gold Coast is beautiful. Rented an RV for it. So worth it.
[Hey, great site! I was wondering how you built your site, did you hire out a designer or design it yourself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ae7?context=5)|Thanks for the kind words! For the first iteration, in order to bootstrap and test the idea, I used a free template. After since, I've hired professional designers and developers.
[Country with the prettiest women?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1y4a?context=5)|Myanmar 'dem eyes.
[I thought about doing this last year and looked into it a bit. I have read Tim Ferris book that you mentioned.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0ecy?context=5)|I think it's important to first get a sense of what being a business owner is like compared to being an employee. I know entrepreneurship is a ""cool"" thing to do these days, and it's caused a lot of people to get into it for the wrong reasons. In my case, I was lucky to have worked in several different companies in different capacities in the form of 4-month internships. It's really helped shaped what I think I would enjoy doing as a career. I would highly recommend finding an internship to begin with if you're just beginning your studies. Not only will you get paid, you'll have the work experience and some guidance in your career.
[You said you have mainly traveled across Asia. Have the cultural differences between asian countries and your home country been difficult at times? Do people look at you funny, etc.? I'm assuming you're caucasian, of course. =p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0qgi?context=5)|Haha I'm of Asian descent actually, which has helped surprisingly well! Most locals either see me as part of them or as someone not too far away.
[Do you do the design your own posters? How long did that process take (to design 57 classics\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0els?context=5)|I did the first dozen. Now I have a small team of artists.
[What was the first book you ever did? Which design has been your personal favourite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1qs4?context=5)|The first was [The Wizard of Oz](postertext.com/the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz-poster)!
 |I have so many favorites. But if I had to pick one, [The Phantom of the Opera](http://postertext.com/the-phantom-of-the-opera-poster) would be in the top 5.
[Hi /u/tiredrod! I'm very Thankful that you are sharing your experiences with us today!  I am currently working on building a platform for travelers and not-yet-travelers to learn how to become location-independent online entrepreneurs like yourself. I take a lot of inspiration from Tim Ferris' ideas, particularly regarding 'lifestyle design.'  What are your favorite aspects of being an online business owner? What are the worst?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xcb?context=5)|The best aspect of being an online business owner is to be able to work anywhere you'd like! Just as long as you have a computer and an internet connection, you can get just about everything done. The worst would be having to work in different time zones with the team.
[I didn't know if I could, I bet you didn't know if you could either - until we tried. And the truth is, we can do anything we set our minds to, if we believe it. It's only when we limit ourselves that we lose our power to live the lives we imagine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xcb?context=5)|Nice website you got there! When can we expect the full version to come out?  Sure thing! Could you send me an email at peterkao@postertext.com? My inbox here is a bit flooded.
[What are some of the challenges of being a business owner without a 'home-base'?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0xcb?context=5)|One of the constant challenges is to remain as productive as possible in a variety of locations and situations. I remember having to have a quick impromptu meeting while waiting for a bus in the middle of nowhere. It wouldn't be possible to do what I do if there were no smartphones.
[I've already built-from-scratch and run (for three years\) one craft-based business that I could have been much more successful at, except that I tired of the work I was doing (seamstressing does a real number on your back, among other things\).  Regardless, it paid all bills!  So I fully realize the feasibility of starting an online business.  What I'm not sure about at this point is the nuts-and-bolts aspect of running a printmaking business, with a large degree of creative involvement on my part, while on the road.  I read all of your responses so far, and they seem to indicate that you have a staff back home working for you?  Do they do all the actual materials handling (paper, printing, shipping\), and you orchestrate?  Do you print on the road?  Was there ever a point where you ran your company entirely by yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1otr?context=5)|I would recommend finding a local professional print shop. They would be able to sort you out with all your needs! It wouldn't be scalable to print on your own unless you want to manage ALL facets of your business.
[After being in a country for a month or two, how exactly do you decide where you'll go next? Do you have a list of places you want to go and just randomly choose one? Or do you try to move to an adjacent country to limit the traveling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp0t74?context=5)|Adjacent country since I try to travel overland.
[How do you deal with the fatigue of travel? Do you set a certain pace and stay in one spot for stretches of time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1eik?context=5)|I didn't have a pace before, I would go at whatever speed the country beckoned. But fatigue during travel is a serious issue since I have to be wide awake and agile for both business and travel.
 |It may be much better for the business and even my travels if I slowed down the pace a bit. Currently, I average at about 2 or so months in a country. I'm thinking half a year to a year maybe a good break in between some quicker travels.
[I love some of your company's designs! (Though I wish you'd produce an Anglo-Saxon version of Beowulf...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1al6?context=5)|Thanks EverNorthwards! We may consider doing original language versions of some prints if there's enough demand for it.
[Serious question though: as someone who's been self-employed in foreign countries, how have you coped with taxes and registering your income? Or have you not? I worked freelance/as a one-man company, and it was a royal pain in both countries I lived in, but I suppose if you're running a larger company you could 'leave' that in your home country while you travelled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1al6?context=5)|The business is incorporated in Singapore and we have accountants to handle that side of things. Even with their help, taxes is one thing I absolutely hate about business ownership. I pay personal income tax to Canada. I may move back when I'm done with my travels. Can't let go of my Canadian passport! It's been great traveling with it.
[Did you gain ancient wisdom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp180r?context=5)|Yes, so ancient that I've forgotten it all.
[Which is your favorite country and your worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdoyr1h?context=5)|It's always hard to pick a favorite of something unless you break your preference down into categories, but I say roughly overall I liked Myanmar the most. Traveling in that country is like being transported back into time; developing cities and villages, unpolluted and magnificent sceneries, and most of all very kind people!
[Are you hiring ? ( im serious \) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp2526?context=5)|Send me an email at peterkao@postertext.com ( i'm serious too :) )
[Hypothetically, what would be the best way to kill you and assume your identity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdpa7cy?context=5)|[This.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094/)
[Exactly what I want to do and I have roughly 2 years before I finish college (high school\) and if I can help it, don't want to go to university.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp12ku?context=5)|Keep at it man! I've created a handful of websites in the past. All fails, but you learn something new each time.
[Currently attempting to have a go at my own site with no success, how do you keep your motivation to keep going and eventually hit the point where you can live off a website or two?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp12ku?context=5)|What drives me to keep going at it is the creation part. I love creating things. Try to find passion in your projects. If you can't, then perhaps entrepreneurship isn't a suitable route.
[I've read Tim's book, and it's awesome. But I still can't seem to find an actual Muse, or it's just that i'm too scared to think of one and take risks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1em7?context=5)|I think Tim's method of setting up a dummy site and creating Google Ads for it is a great novel idea that works.
[Hey man. I've been doing the same thing: running my online business and traveling around the world for the last year and a half. It's been awesome (my girlfriend has been traveling with me\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp19a4?context=5)|Cool!

[Do the posters include the text of the full book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdpcbxt?context=5)|We try to fit the entire book into the poster, but for extremely long titles such as War and Peace, it's simply not possible!
[What credentials do I need to be hired by you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp2427?context=5)|What are you good at and what are you passionate about? Email me at peterkao@postertext.com.

[When I travel for a long time like that, I just bring 2 or maybe 3 sets of clothes. Extra underwear and socks, basic outerwear.  That means doing laundry every few days, like most people do anyway.  Totally doable, all you're doing without is a gigantic wardrobe full of minor variations in style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp1fhi?context=5)|Yup, traveling doesn't change some routines at all. The good thing traveling in Asia is that you can get someone to do your laundry for cheap!
[I too would like to know how to full time travel. I'd love to see the dinosaurs in person one day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rneli/ive_been_traveling_around_the_world_for_3_years/cdp3fbi?context=5)|They're great in person. I would highly recommend seeing them.

Positions,thedude1107,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rmp01/perception_of_google_internship_for_finance_dev/,"I am a sophomore in CS at a top school and my goal for full time is to work at a prop trading firm or a hedge fund (as a software dev., looking into trading as entry level or as exit op)
I have an internship offer from Google and I am strongly considering taking it for this summer.  Even though my goals are to work at a trading firm, I am attracted to Google for THIS summer for several reasons such as:

-Experiencing Google's environment (I may never work at a Big Tech again)

-Internship diversity (as opposed to consecutive internships at trading firms)

-There is finance company that I want to intern at junior year and then full-time, interning there this summer would mean two internships at the same company and then full-time.

I am faced with the dilemma of choosing Google or an internship more relevant to my target industry at a top hedge fund / prop trading firm. My question is am I potentially harming myself  by putting off my target company for a year to work at Google?"

What is your best advice?,faceinthegrass,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1rm644/im_changing_majors_from_mathecon_to_electrical/,"I am 3 semesters into Math+Econ but this week I decided I am far more interested in Electrical Engineering. In addition to next semester it will take me another 3 years to graduate. 

I was hoping you could tell me things that I should already begin doing so that I can begin building my resume. What programming languages should I know? What specialties are there in EE? What skills should I be building so my resume looks better when I begin applying for internships? What clubs should I join?

I don't want to be the guy in his 4th or 5th year trying to join clubs because he didn't do shit his first 3 years.

The only things I really have going for me is that I know C, C++ and Java, and I'm part of the Undergraduate Math Club and Ski and Snowboard Club."

1rqkhk,3,2013-11-29,Opportunities for internships as a highschooler,Habstinat,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1rqkhk/opportunities_for_internships_as_a_highschooler/,"I'm a highscool junior in New York. I've always been interested in *nix-like systems and have been running my own GNU/Linux webserver and utilities from my house at least since I was a freshman. More recently, I've started seeking shell accounts from invite-based free shell services just for kicks and have become fairly active on SDF, Blinkenshell, and Insomnia. I even found a way to access a dump of some user information on Blinkenshell a few weeks ago (really it wasn't that complicated; just found a wtmp.old file that had bad permissions so I could read it with who or lastlog); I reported to the admins and they fixed it up promptly, but also told me ""well, it may nopt be a feather in your cap, but this was originally discovered by a user who finds security holes for a living - for the u.s. government. odd that the list you got was from a year ago, though"". 

Despite my efforts, after a teenager gets told that about one of their accomplishments, it's pretty hard for them not to get all cocky about it. Becoming a *nix sysadmin is truly my dream job, and I started to think that getting an internship somewhere may not be out of my reach.

However, opportunities seem sparse. As someone without any professional experience in the field and no certifications, I appear underqualified for just about every sysadmin application I've found online. Basically, I'm just not sure how I would go about getting started. 

If it matters at all, I took AP Computer Science last year and got a 5 on the AP, although what I do at home really goes beyond that by a lot. I know most scripting languages pretty well and started reading K&amp;R C but haven't finished the book yet. I really do like the old stuff and I've read a few books on UNIX / MIT Media Lab history. I have a few years' experience of working with my own *nix machines and like to buy obscure hardware. I've set up and worked with Apache, Wordpress, Mediawiki, Etherpad, Elgg, phpMyAdmin, Shellinabox, etc... for myself for fun. However like I said, I haven't had any ""formal"" job experience yet. Although I know a bit about Windows system administration from reading other people's experiences, I don't really use Windows at all myself, let alone administer it.

And so I ask /r/sysadmin, how should someone like me go about seeking job opportunities in sysadmin-ship while in highschool?"
1rp0lw,30,2013-11-29,How to approach going back to college after leaving due to poor academic performance? Or should I keep on track of being self-taught?,time-capsuled,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rp0lw/how_to_approach_going_back_to_college_after/,"I went to a 4 year university as a CS major immediately after graduating high school (this was about 6 years ago now). In my first two quarters I had had a lot of difficulty adjusting to college life (generally wasn't ready to be entirely self-sufficient, among other things). 

After leaving college I took some classes at my local community college over the next 2 years (the plan was to go through my colleges academic reinstatement program which required that I take some classes during my leave from university and get decent grades). Due to personal issues I continued to do poorly in CC classes. I would lose motivation sometime into the semester and either fail or get a D in 1 or more classes (never a CS class, always performed well in those). For reference, I've complete intro to CS, intro to OOP1 and 2, and data structures and algorithms. 

Its been about 3 years now since I've taken any classes. About a year and a half i decided I didn't need to go back to university to become a programmer and started down the self taught path. At this point I actually consider myself a fairly good programmer. I continue to spend a large portion of my own time trying to hone my skill. I understand basic MVC architecture, principles of SOLID design, and a bunch of other things I could list off (and constantly researching and learning more).

In the last 4 months I've even managed to find  a job (albiet a very crappy one. programming php, the entire codebase was written procedurally). The other programmers (only 2 others) aren't graduates and have little to no understanding of conventions/architecture/design patterns. The pay is dirt low, but getting any job on no experience was difficult to begin with. (this job actually started as an internship but it become pretty clear quickly that I was actually a more adept programmer than either of the other two there. I'm trying not to sound arrogant and just state facts. I have nothing against my coworkers (I actually like them outside of the fact that collaborating with them is oftentimes stressful).

After 4 months of working at this place, I am still constantly reading job listings and sending in resumes with little to no success. Pretty much every job listing is looking for a person with minimum 2 years experience and a degree. I feel that if I could just get a real interview that I would nail it (maybe I overestimate my current abilities but feel like between my current skill set, enthusiasm for coding, and ability to learn that I could handle pretty much any entry level position but I'm constantly precluded from even getting passed the screening process because of my lack of experience.

After working 4 months where I'm at its making me reconsider school, but I'm not sure its the best option. I feel like if I went back to school I would have to start over from the beginning and that the majority of the material I'd be learning is stuff I've already learned on my own (at least in the beginning). So I guess my question is two parts.

One, how do I get from submitting a resume to actually getting an interview?

And also, how should I go about going back to school? My gpa is still kinda in the shitter from before.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks for the help!"
1rokkd,0,2013-11-28,In college super slump,arvvvs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rokkd/in_college_super_slump/,So I'm attending a top 100 university with a decently known CS program. However getting into the CS program is hard. The person in charge is expecting more out of me than students already in CS. My GPA and grades before the summer were good but the summer due to summer classes destroyed my GPA (curve was smaller due to smaller class and I had no social structure and support). And this semester I'm taking 3 hard classes (one of which is the hardest math class in the university) one of which is CS with a test nearly every week. And with an assignment that's rather time consuming every week I feel as if this semester is not going to end well (and I'm trying as hard as I can although my weekend isn't as well used as it should be). I am a junior now undeclared and while I'm considering pursuing economics as a backup major it doesn't appeal to me as well as CS does. To be fair CS is no longer my favorite class as it was previous semester. I'm unsure what to do and even more unsure of the future. What should I do to make sure I have a decent chance of getting a job in CS after graduation or even an internship?
1rofpw,5,2013-11-28,Looking for advice on how best to go about paying for college myself and striking out on my own for the first time.,mightneedaTHROWAWAY,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1rofpw/looking_for_advice_on_how_best_to_go_about_paying/,"I made a post about my situation [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1roc0s/im_going_insane_but_its_four_months_until_i_can/) if you want to read this with some context. But the summary is that my mother is smothering me and interfering with my life to the point that it's almost impossible to work, set up internships for my future, and even pursue the major I want. I'm still 17 (I skipped a grade) and I attend an out of state school, and I don't turn 18 for another 4 months.


At the end of the school year (thus saving me from having to just tell my parents I'm leaving halfway through second semester, them to stop paying, and forcing me to drop out of school (oh bad grammar but oh well)) I will announce to my parents that I'm not coming back home-- I'm 18 and I'm moving out. I want to stay at my school over the summer working on summer research with a professor, and if I can't do that I want to work on the paint crew on campus as well as working off campus, both of which are paid and paint crew gives me a place to live for free.


This is where it gets dicey. My college is wonderful but pricey, and even with scholarships it will be very tough to try and pay my way through. I want to stay in the state where I currently attend college because my education, future career opportunities and boyfriend are all out here on the East Coast. (As for the boyfriend, I know that's not the best reason. I realize that we're very young, and we've only been together for 3 months, but we've gone through some tough things together in that time, love each other to pieces, trust one another implicitly, and want to have the opportunity to be together for a while longer so we can see if we really do want to be together for the long haul. But we can't do that very well at opposite ends of the country, and even if we do break up he's still my best friend, and I'd still want to be out here on the East Coast) So I have a few options for the next school year...


- Option 1: I've applied for almost $100,000 in scholarships, in addition to my $24,000 in scholarships for merit from the school. It will take another year until I can apply on my own financially because as of yet, I'd still need my parents for the FAFSA, so I'd need either some of these scholarships to go through or have to take out nearly $20,000 in loans this year. Even with these loans/scholarships, I would still need on campus work and maybe off campus work, as well as trying to set up an internship at a local historical site. I would live on campus, which is expensive but guarantees me a place to live.

**TL;DR: Get scholarships (if I'm lucky) or else take out nearly $20,000 in loans, work part time and live on campus.**


- Option 2: I could also switch to being a part time student (I walked into college a sophomore so spreading out my education a little bit wouldn't set me off track. I would take either a semester or an entire year like this, whilst working and trying to get an internship. I would, however, have to live off campus. There are a number of affordable apartments ($350-$650 a month, and I'd only to $650 with a roommate) within anywhere from walking to biking distance, and the city my school is in has a very good public transportation system.

**TL;DR: Switch to being part time at my college and focus on working and saving money, so I can come back for Spring semester or the next year; live in an apartment off campus.**


- Option 3: I could take a semester or a year off. This once again wouldn't put me behind, and instead I could work and save, living in an apartment near my college, and come back once I felt a little more financially stable.


**TL;DR: Take a semester or a year off, work my backside off to save to come back for Spring semester/next year, live in an apartment off campus.**

All of these options are would be just for next year, and no matter what I'd be applying for scholarships subsequent years and loans are always on the table. I'm just fed up with my life at home and how it's derailing nearly all of my life choices (internships, my relationship, on campus involvement, pursuing history and theatre instead of political science, basic lifestyle choices) and the fact that I am miserable living with my parents.


I know all of these would be really hard work. I've had a job for the past year (at Target) and could foreseeably try and get transferred out of state to where my college is. Regardless, I am determined to work hard, sacrifice and make tough decisions to try and build my life as an adult. My independence, dreams of working on my art and eventually becoming a scenographer, and my boyfriend are all really important to me, and I don't want to give that up just because it would be tough.

Even so, I'm not sure what to do. Am I being realistic? Does anyone have tips or advice?"

1rsu6s,5,2013-11-30,Career change from R&amp;D Engineer (Mechanical) to Data Scientist,urfaselol,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rsu6s/career_change_from_rd_engineer_mechanical_to_data/,"I am a 26 year old guy with BS degrees in Biomedical, Mechanical and Material Sciences Engineering from a top 50 school. I've been working in the medical device field in R&amp;D for roughly 3 years and been doing product development and R&amp;D for a heart valve based company on contract. Despite being in this field for as long as I have, I'm not too sure if I want to stay in this field. The amount of regulation is insane and there's a high barrier for entry in terms of innovation and upward mobility. 

My contract is about to expire and I've been looking at checking out data science. I enjoy R&amp;D and been interested in data science for a while. I always wondered what's making companies like Facebook/Yelp/etc so profitable despite not selling any product and also what kind of information people are extracting from this data

I'm definitely no stranger to data analytics and statistics as I am a very technical person. I've conducted many a mechanical and physical tests to get lots of data points before and drew conclusions from it. What makes data good and what makes it reliable. I have some programming experience. I've programmed in labview and matlab before to do various mechanical testing. I've also have got experience with C++ and java. 

My question is if it would be possible to get a data science internship or even an entry level position with my background? If not what should I do to get started to make myself more competitive? I've been watching data science on coursera to try and more of a feel of the field. I want to try and avoid spending the cash to go back to school if I don't have to.

1rsd63,33,2013-11-30,The Sequence,Desequencer,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1rsd63/the_sequence/,"*[The Forest Through the Trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xjmqj/the_forest_through_the_trees_a_story_in_eight/)*

Two. One. Zero.

A countdown.

Two ten.

A time. A date. An address.

210.

The number’s a bad omen. The whole sequence is no less evil.

2, 1, 0.

By the end of this paragraph there will have been 210 numbers and letters in this story so far, if you believe it. And now it all goes downhill.

The number and the sequence are bad, haunted, unlucky, or whatever else. That’s not to say it follows me around or anything. It’s just that whenever I see the number, I can be sure that something bad is coming. Your apartment number might be 210, but you will never have any problems, as if I’m the only one who can ever see any bad come out of it. That’s what I used to think, anyway.

I studied psychology in college. For my senior year internship, I worked at a local psych ward. The name isn’t relevant, but the address is: 2100 Calhoun Street. I remember standing at the door for a brief period of time staring at the street number, trying to decide if it was going to be a problem. Nothing ever manifested there, though, until this particular day, when I decided I’d had enough psychology.

This was a couple months or so after my girlfriend had been killed. I was still having a rough time, since it was my fault for getting into trouble where I shouldn’t have been meddling. But that’s the past, and all I can do is learn from it. That doesn’t stop me from having the newspaper clip about it on my desk. If that wasn’t bad enough, the article went into detail about why she was killed. I was too busy protecting Hannah, this random girl I’d met, to protect the girl I loved, and it didn’t even matter after Hannah went missing anyway. But I digress.

I was at my makeshift desk, reading over the article for the thousandth time, when my advisor approached me with a folder. He knew I was good for my work but was reasonably distracted, even after the time past. That’s why he brought me the folder; it was an old case, but one that was interesting, at least in the psychological sense. “Check it out,” he told me, and left me to it. There was a lot of psycho-babble, but a few things that stuck out.

The first was a picture of the room this subject was kept in. It was clear he had a deep-seated psychosis by the scribbles of all sizes covering the walls. “210,” the writing said.

“210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210. 210.” And so on.

I swallowed hard and turned the picture over. Even though I had never been in the room, I felt like I was. “210. 210.” A heavy air. “210.” The walls closing in. I threw the picture over my shoulder, and it fluttered face-up onto the floor beside me. “210.” The picture reeked of a bad omen. Now I wanted nothing to do with this case, at all.

Looking back to the folder, I would have shut it and returned it to my advisor if I hadn’t seen the second picture. It was of a girl, face-down in the woods, with a knife in her back. The picture made me sick, almost to the point of vomiting. Not that it was particularly gory, but [I had seen it before](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pjumn/believe_him/).

The room was warm, but the heat was seeping out of my body. I shivered and closed my eyes tight, putting the picture back on my desk blindly. The timestamp on the photograph read February 10. 2/10. As much as I hated to keep delving into this case, it didn’t matter. I was already in it.

Last was a note left by the subject, who had escaped the ward, like it was some kind of prison. It was written neatly and legibly, much unlike the writing on the walls. It read:

*You won’t be able to find me, so don’t look. I used a false name. But it’s okay, I’m doing much better now.*

*I just need to go get Sarah’s dress. That way I can put an end to this, and start myself on the path to full recovery.*

The only thing I could think of was my mother. Her name was Sarah, and she died in a beautiful white dress. I wondered how much of a leap this thought was, but I’d already established that I was a part of this case. Why wouldn’t it be her?

Who had the dress? I only had one family member left: my brother. I was on the phone with him as I rushed out the door.

“Hey bro, what’s up?” He was jovial as always.

“Samuel, who got Mom’s dress when she died?”

He paused, and I could almost see him recoil from the bluntness of the question. “What?”

“The dress Mom died in, who got it?”

“Uh, I don’t know… Why?”

“Do you have it?”

“No...”

“And I don’t have it. Who else could have gotten it?”

He didn’t know, but he humored me with his thoughts. “Grandpa probably had it. I don’t know what he did with it. What’s this all about, anyway?”

I started up my car. I didn’t know where I was going to go, but I had to go somewhere. “Just curious,” I lied.

“You sound more frantic than curious.”

How could I explain it? Could I explain it at all? What do I even say, that someone obsessed with the number 210 escaped from a psych ward to go steal our dead mother’s dress and do…whatever with it? As I was pulling out of the ward, I had an idea. “Is Dad alive?”

He laughed out loud at that one. “You think Dad is alive and has Mom’s dress?”

“Who else?”

Silence. “Well, not me. I don’t know, man.”

I beat my steering wheel with an open palm in frustration. “How do we find out if he’s alive?”

“Dad’s dead, dude.” He spoke forcefully as if I was insulting him, but quickly calmed down. “Besides, that dress is haunted, remember?”

“Huh?”

“I told you that. It’s why she died.”

“And I told you that’s stupid.”

“Regardless, I’m glad it’s disappeared. We don’t need to deal with it anymore. Just come over and chill out for a bit, alright?”

I was in my car but was driving aimlessly, so I relented. “Fine. I’ll be over.”

Since I’m a poor college student, I’m generally lazy regarding filling up my car. The gas light was on when I started it up, so before I got to my brother’s place, I would have to fill up. Then I saw the price of gas at the first station I got to: $2.10.

Hell no.

I drove right on by. I would fill up at the next one. Only, I never made it to the next one. I was lower on gas than I thought I was, so I puttered to a stop on the side of the road, my frustration mounting. There were woods on both sides of the road immediately next to me, and no gas station in sight. Fuck. I looked at the time. 14:10. I kept my clocks on 24-hour time so I would only have to see “2:10” at most once a day, but I still knew what time in the afternoon it was.

I called my brother again and told him what was up, leaving out the part where I passed a gas station because I was scared of the price. He left to help me out after poking fun, which was alright by me.

Sitting alone in my car, I began to smell a strong odor. It was piercing and floral, but not really unpleasant. The only unpleasant part was that it was giving me a headache. I rolled my windows down, but the smell got stronger. It was coming from outside, and I was stuck there. Fuck again.

In the distance, I heard a church bell ring. I rubbed my eyes and tried to stifle my rage. When I looked up toward the edge of the woods beside me, there was a woman staring at me. It was my dead mother, in the same white dress she had died in.

My eyes stayed wide open on her. I shivered. My breathing became shallow. She mouthed something with articulation that looked a lot like “Two ten.” She turned and walked into the woods.

“Wait!” I shouted, as if she could hear me. I opened the door and almost got hit by a car, blaring its horn as it passed. After making sure the way was clear, I left my car and ran into the woods after her.

I was running through the woods without a path, cutting myself on brush and branches as I tried to catch up to her. Despite how calmly she walked, I never seemed to get any closer to her, even as I ran. She would disappear behind a tree as I passed, and be just as far away when I got around it. Nevertheless, I kept my eye on that beacon of white in the forest.

Fighting through some thick brush, I emerged in a relatively open part of the woods, with trees scattered on a field of high grass. And there was my mother, facing me, within shouting distance. “Two ten” she mouthed again. Breathing heavily, I trudged through the grass toward her, but she stepped behind a tree and disappeared as I got close.

She was gone, but I came face-to-face with a pair of feet. With apprehension, I craned my neck to look up, finding a girl hanging from the tree. I fell backward.

It was [Hannah](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pcgfz/follow/). I didn’t know what I expected after hearing that she’d disappeared, but I began to sob anyway. I’d found her, and she was dead.

Looking up at her through my tears, I could see that she was wearing the same beautiful white dress that she was when I met her. I realized then why my gaze had been so drawn to her on that day. She was wearing my dead mother’s dress.

I haven't done an internship yet. My GPA is around a 3.0 and I am finding it difficult to get any interviews at companies for 2014 summer internships at this time. The only work experience I have is a failed start up that I worked for for a few months doing web design. I do home some leadership position on my resume, but other than that there is nothing on my resume that shows I have experience aside from my list of coursework. I would like to get an internship doing software engineering. I have had a few interviews sophomore year but no offers. This year I am finding it increasingly difficult to even hear back from companies. 

I have began looking and applying to internships online and through my colleges career website but I still haven't been able to even get an interview this year.

I am beginning to worry that my lack of experience at this time has impacted my chances of getting an internship.

Is there anything I am doing wrong or should be doing at this point in time to improve my resume and skill set so that I can actually get an interview? Because I think that if I can actually get one, I will be able to  answer the technical questions fairly well."

:--|:--
[I spent a bit of time amongst the natives in British Columbia. I quickly discovered most Canadians are quite upset with all of the things the native peoples receive from the government and how much of it seems to go to waste. I've seen firsthand many problems with alcoholism and other problems. My question is, how do you think these problems can be overcome? Does the government have a role in fixing First Nations problems?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpw5m3?context=5)|Our tribe doesn't receive any money or resources from the government unless there's a settlement on something. All of our money comes from the casino and other enterprises; however, tribal members get per capitas and have access to many resources from that money. And sometimes, people take advantage in all the wrong ways.
 |I don't know quite how the problems could be overcome because I've experienced first hand that an addict will not get better unless he/she *wants* to. No amount of consequences are going to change that. However, I think resources should be limited to those who are going to use them right. I've advocated for drug tests before access to scholarships/emergency funds/etc. on our reservation but it's a tough rule to implement. You can't just go around drug testing people and those tests cost somewhere around $35 each where I live.
 |I don't think the government has a role unless they are actively providing for that tribe (if that's what they do in Canada... I'm unsure). My tribe is sovereign so it's up to us to overcome it. And believe me when I say we are trying. It's hard though... people will do what they want to do. 
[What instance(s\) drove you to make this decision?  You seem very dedicated to your tribe - was the decision more for you or for them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugvz?context=5)|Originally, I wanted to be a doctor but I wasn't cut out for it. I started studying philosophy and changed to be pre-law. My dad (who is full Native) pushed me to intern at our attorney's office and I found that it was really eye opening. They had me travel to look at another tribe's court system and help our court expand; they even involved me in business decisions. I didn't really know that we still had to fight for some rights before I worked there.
 |But also, as of now there are no tribal attorneys in the office. I think it's important to have our people in those kind of positions.
 |Edit: to answer - for both. It helps me secure my future as well as be a part of helping my tribe move forward. 
[Could you elaborate on still fighting for rights?  It isn't something you hear about often (unless you live in OK like me\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvbo5?context=5)|We mostly deal with fishing and hunting rights on our tribe.
 |Also, in WA State last year they implemented a new law where alcohol could be sold in grocery stores but this made the taxes go up to like 24% or something. And the government was trying to tax our smoke shop that amount. But taxes are different on the reservation because we are a sovereign nation so they had a court case on that.
 |Also also, we received a settlement last Summer for water rights... I wasn't involved though so I don't know what it was about. 
[I'm Metis and I wonder if you face extreme/minor biggotry/racism still?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugg7?context=5)|I think the most bigot/racist things I encounter these days are ""haha you guys have a casino"" or the ""*how* - I can speak Native"" people. Most often people are just curious what a reservation is.
[My second question is what kind of law are you going to study to help or be employed by your tribe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugg7?context=5)|If I go to school back home I'll be studying Indian Law. If I can get into the school that offers that program at least... Our attorney's mostly deal with business and treaty rights so hopefully I can get a grasp on those.
[My third Do you ever go up north in Canada to go see how the natives up there are doing ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpugg7?context=5)|There's an anthropologist who has helped our tribe a lot. She's about 90yrs old. Last Summer I went with her on a trip to Canada (to help her get home safely). Myself and the other intern did a little walking around and visited the museums and stores. But other than that I haven't visited the First Nations' people; it would be awesome to dedicate a trip to that someday. 
[Keep me as a contact then Im in Ottawa me and the wife are both Metis and we have 4 Res' in our area you are going to be shocked to see how poorly they treat us and how shitty the land they took and gave back is. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpur40?context=5)|:/ will do; I know the government sometimes still fights tribes and some can't fight back. We fight back and often win. We live under two treaties and are really involved in making sure we get those rights. But I know our tribe is lucky to have received good land and 20 years ago wasn't doing so well. 
[What college did you go to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq6ika?context=5)|I'm at Johns Hopkins currently. And I hope to go to UW law school.
[*""how""*  Poached.  ^If ^you're ^not ^familiar ^with ^the ^joke, ^and ^you ^have ^a ^sense ^of ^humor, ^I'd ^be ^happy ^to ^tell ^it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqcm5l?context=5)|It has something to do with when settlers spoke to Natives they always asked how or something right?
[Idk if your aware but Dartmouth college (which is an ivy league\) was established to help native Americans in terms of education, and often give them special privileges, so if u cant get into your other choice,Dartmouth might be a great option for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqem6q?context=5)|Wow, thanks! I'll certainly put them on my list. 
[How do natives want to live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvk9d?context=5)|Alcoholism is common. I think there's many factors to it. I mentioned in another question how Natives commonly have more ADHs than other races which means we process alcohol quicker (don't throw up and rarely hangovers). But also, some people grow up in very tough households and turn to self medication. My father was severely abused as a child and is a Vietnam War Vet - he's an alcoholic. 
[Is there a desire/fantasy to return to a nomadic life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvk9d?context=5)|I don't think that there's a desire to return to nomadic life. I think people want to hold true to their heritage but also adapt to modern life. We fish/hunt/gather but also buy grocery store food. We have powwows as well but our tribe only holds three a year. Some people travel to other tribes to participate but I don't.
[Sweet jesus, he never had a fair chance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvzh1?context=5)|Hmm there's a shaker church (kinda like Quaker but not if I remember correctly) and a Pentecostal church on our tribe (my aunt owns it). I think there are less people involved in the Shaker church than there used to be but funerals are still held there. My parents were never very religious and I used to go to the Pentecostal as a kid but by choice and without my parents. There's no pressure to go I think in many of the households.
[What about religion? What is popular amongst your tribe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvzh1?context=5)|All in all though we are pretty spiritual. Don't drop an eagle feather (and have it blessed if you do), don't go to the cemetery after certain hrs... stuff like that. 
[Is it possible to ""join"" your nation ? like becoming a US citizen ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpwduz?context=5)|You have to have a certain amount of blood quantum in order to be enrolled. I think there are rare cases where someone is ""adopted"" in but I don't think they have access to *all* of the resources.
[How do you feel about it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpwduz?context=5)|They recently lowered the blood quantum. I don't see it as anything negative. If someone has whatever amount is applicable, they should be able to enroll and have access to the resources we have. Some people think it's bad though; they think it will lead to people taking advantage of it. But there aren't a lot of cases where someone finds out they have Muckleshoot blood in them... so I don't think it's so bad. 
[Crushing my dreams of becoming a badass indian chief, one post at a time :o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq0cez?context=5)|We'll make our own tribe... with blackjack and whores?
[I've very recently started getting interested in the law, mostly due to the Illustrated Guide to the Law. What would you recommend as a first read about the intersection between federal and tribal (or Muckleshoot specifically\) law?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvsz9?context=5)|Woah that's an awesome link. I've bookmarked it.
 |I hate to say I haven't done a lot of reading of public material. Most of what I've read on our legal system is from our attorney's office. However, [here](http://www.muckleshoot.nsn.us/about-us/overview.aspx) is an overview of our tribe and it has some of the court cases (specifically US v WA) that reflects my tribe. 
[What do you think keeps many Native Americans from using their resources afforded by government for free education? I recall seeing another ama where a member of a (perhaps Canadian?\) tribe cited the view from other tribe members that going to a white man's college was selling out their tribe's way of life. Is that a common viewpoint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvgtm?context=5)|I don't think anyone feels like that from my reservation. We have a Tribal College but it's more like a community college and the people that attend it are mostly the older generation that missed out on going to college when they were younger. The government doesn't give us (me) the resources though; my tribe does. I know there are government scholarships but they aren't for everyone if I understand correctly.  I think people are just afraid sometimes too. I'm across the country right now and it has been very hard. We grow up in a small community where everyone knows everyone. I'm the first in my family to go to college.
[What is life like in reservations? Do you have the same luxuries as the rest of America (internet, television, running water, electricity, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpupr2?context=5)|On my reservation we do. Many of our people live in poverty but I believe it to be by choice. Our tribe has many resources - emergency funds for members, food bank, scholarship, jobs, etc. So many people don't feel a need to work... But there's also those of us that are helping to expand our tribe. We have a casino, smoke shop, market and deli, government system, amphitheater, lodge and spa etc. And it keeps a lot of our people employed.
 |I know our tribe is doing fairly well in these terms but there are others that got land in deserts that aren't so lucky...
[What do you think about the redskins name change debate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv9u3?context=5)|I agree that the name is offensive but I hadn't thought much about it until it became a big problem. I acknowledged before all this but it was more of a ""hmm that's offensive"" and moved on. 
[Do you feel like progress for those in your tribe to become wealthier and healthier individuals is prevented by the traditional values/rules your tribe holds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx23s?context=5)|I don't think our tribe is held back by traditional values but I know that some tribes are. We are a fairly progressive tribe. We still have our culture but we also participate in modern culture. Our tribe really encourages tribal members to get out and go to college somewhere off the rez. They want everyone to get their education and choose what to do with their lives whether it be on the tribe or off.
[How do you feel about assimilation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx23s?context=5)|I think we've lost a lot of our culture. Way back when, when the Europeans forced the Native children to go to boarding school and speak only English a lot of languages were lost, a lot of traditions were lost. I don't know if it was for the better. I can't say that I don't appreciate where my tribe is now. We are fairly wealthy; we are huge contributors to charity and all of our members have access to resources... but our language is nearly dead. And I don't dance at powwows though I've always wished I did. I think it'd be nice to have *more* of our culture so long as it doesn't hold us back. (but then again, who decides what held back is?)
[If you don't mind me asking...was alcoholism a problem on your reservation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv6gc?context=5)|It is :( My dad's an alcoholic.
[I've heard that on many of the reservations alcohol has been, and continues to be, a large problem. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv6gc?context=5)|I did a research paper on alcoholism in high school. Native Americans have the most alcohol dehydrogenases of any race. Which means our bodies process alcohol really well. So... I don't suffer the negative side effects of drinking. I rarely get hangovers. So people are more likely to drink because they don't feel the negative effects. Not that that's an excuse... just some insight. 
[What's your opinion on the idle no more movement? Has it played any role in your choice of career path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx64f?context=5)|No treaty rights should be infringed upon. The government has a horrid past of giving land/rights to the indigenous people and taking it back. We have a phrase called ""Indian giver."" It's always been kinda tossed around growing up. Like if I gave my sister a toy then took it back she'd call me an Indian Giver. I never understood it as a kid lol. But I do now. Anyway, any government that makes a treaty and gives rights to a tribe shouldn't infringe upon those. From my understanding that's what Idle No More is about. I don't follow the movement but I understand it. I think I have the same thought process going into my career; I hope to keep our rights as well as help my tribe progress.
[I'm only asking this because you brought it up in an earlier post, is ""how"" an actual greeting in any native language, as far as you know. It just seems like a Hollywood cliche. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpx64f?context=5)|As far as I know, ""how"" is not an actual greeting. In our language, ""hoyt"" is goodbye. I don't know hello and I'm pretty sure the spelling I used for the previous is not correct; it's just the sound it makes in English. 
[Indian Giver is an insult towards North American Indians. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqdxeu?context=5)|So I've learned... interesting. 
[Maybe marry in?  /u/danileigh?  Have a kid that's a member?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq04qx?context=5)|Of course if you marry and have children they could be enrolled (as long as they meet the quantum for whatever tribe). My children will be enrolled but I'm unsure if there children will be. Marrying would make you a part of the community but wouldn't allow you to enroll yourself. 
[I've heard about the rampant alcoholism present in the reservations, have you seen any of it first hand? How bad is it? Are there any programs in place to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv8br?context=5)|This is my answer on the same question: 
 |&gt; It is :( My dad's an alcoholic.
 |&gt; I did a research paper on alcoholism in high school. Native Americans have the most alcohol dehydrogenases of any race. Which means our bodies process alcohol really well. So... I don't suffer the negative side effects of drinking. I rarely get hangovers. So people are more likely to drink because they don't feel the negative effects. Not that that's an excuse... just some insight.
 |There's a lot of drug and alcohol use on our res and the police/tribal council are really trying to combat it. My dad's an alcoholic, two of my sisters are addicted to prescription pain pills, one of my nephews is, etc. The tribe will pay for rehab indefinitely. My sister has gone so many times. And they have a halfway house for after. They really really try to help people get better but no one will get better unless they want to. Our court is working on a system now that requires rehab for people who commit crimes and fail a drug test (there's rampant theft on the res to pay for drugs). 
[In Canada (major cities like Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary\), one of the things I have noticed is that I have yet to see any native person who looks well to do. Is it similar in the US and in your tribe? And does that mean that richer people live on reservations or richer ones blend in more? Does the tribe help those who have settled outside of the sovereign lands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq1gah?context=5)|I think it really depends on where you are. There are some reservations that are doing really poorly and you won't see anyone doing well on them. Whereas, on my tribe you mostly see people doing well and the ones that aren't are poor by choice. I mentioned my father is an alcoholic but he's a functional one- he makes six figures.  The people living off the reservation can still have access to most of the resources but I'm unsure which specifically. My father is an elder so the youth crew comes and mows his lawn; I'm sure those that live far don't receive that lol.
[Does the ""my mother says I'm 1/8th native but we have no proof"" type of person insult you or make you mad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpy15e?context=5)|No, it doesn't insult me or bother me. Sometimes I'll say I'm Native and about ten other people will chime ""me too!"" but it doesn't bother me haha. I'm half but I look completely white.
 |I'm lucky enough to know which tribe I originate from, be enrolled, and have an active life in our community. But I know that others don't have that and that's okay. 
[Did you follow the Baby Veronica case a few months ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpvduv?context=5)|I didn't but I just read an article. But I think that's an issue that is on every reservation. We have an ICW system and our tribe does everything it can to keep our children in our culture. And they work to NEVER terminate parental rights. I mean, if a parent gives them up then so be it but our tribe works very hard with parents to keep them involved. I've never heard of anyone on our tribe being disenrolled either. 
[I have a few Native friends and was surprised to learn a few didn't know about the scholarships and grants offered to Native Americans. (Where  live\) Why do you think that is? I thought that all students were aware of minority scholarships and would actively seek them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpw82s?context=5)|There could be a lot that contributes to that. My tribe has it's own scholarship program so I never thought to seek outside scholarships. I know they exist though. All kinds of minority scholarships exist so it's a no brainer that there is some form for Natives.
 |I guess it depends on how badly you feel the need for it; some people are content with taking out loans, some people can pay their way, some people just don't care about going to college in the first place, and some people don't want to put the work in to write essays and stuff and compete with others for scholarships. 
[If you feel like answering another question... So, what's the deal with Tribal law in regards to federal law? I believe I learned that each reservation is subject to its own law, as a sovereign nation, as long as those laws don't contradict federal law; which to me means that each reservation is like its own little country, which is pretty cool. Do many tribes take advantage of this? How often does this come into conflict with state law? Regarding that, when I am traveling through a reservation can I be held accountable for crimes in violation of the tribal law, even if I were not aware of them? Or, perhaps, prosecuted for violating state law, even though I'm in sovereign state? Please forgive my rough interpretation of this issue, but I'm so fascinated by it. On that note, do you need an assistant? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq5h64?context=5)|I think I answered a similar question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq9gyr)
 |I haven't learned everything there is to learn about it yet but those are some examples. 
[How do I win at blackjack?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpxcs0?context=5)|I'm not sure. I'm more of a slots player myself. I'm terrible at blackjack. 
[Where does your tribe get the money from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpzcwz?context=5)|Most of it comes from our casino but we also have other enterprises. We have a market and deli, smoke shop, bingo hall, lodge and spa, etc. 
[Will the tribe members now consider you an outsider elitist? I knew someone who left to get a degree and training in counseling and they considered her as an outsider because ""she was too elitist to stay and now she's high and mighty.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq42pl?context=5)|That's how it was for my father. He got into West Point and when he left the tribe rejected him; when he got there, the white people rejected him. But this was a long time ago... It's not too bad now. So far, I haven't gotten any negative reactions from tribal members. 
[I have multiple ancestry ties to the Cherokee tribe and have multiple family members on the Dawes roll. I have applied to be on the Dawes roll, how do you feel about outsiders joining the roll? I had no idea I had so much Native American ancestry until I started searching into the matter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv58q?context=5)|Our tribe just put a new law in where more people can enroll; I think they changed the blood quantum necessary. I personally don't feel anything negative for new people enrolling. It can't hurt to expand our tribe. Good luck to you!
[Do you speak a native American Language?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv2xs?context=5)|I don't :( I think my dad does. Our tribe has a language but I only know a few words. 
[You should learn it, name it please, and make sure it does not die out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpv5ze?context=5)|It's called ""Wulshootseed"" and I have some tapes. It's very guttural. I know I should learn it :/ a few young women are certified to teach it on our tribe so there's really no excuse. 
[How many people out of the tribe total speak it? And if you don't mind answering, why didn't you learn it growing up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq3y4t?context=5)|I don't know the amount of people that speak it; the elders know it and a handful of the younger generation do. I went to our Tribal School until 2nd grade and then switched to public school. I know it was taught in Tribal School but I never got a firm enough grasp when I was there.
[Does anyone write in it? A quick search seems to indicate the script is ""Americanist phonetic notation"", which seems to be Latin chars plus some combining marks, invented by Europeans. If people write in it, do they feel the script to be part of Native culture now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq3y4t?context=5)|There is script but I haven't really seen people writing it. I have a blanket that has script on it with our tribal logo. I believe people feel that it is a part of our culture now but I'm unsure.
[What would you like to tell people who don't understand Native culture, and are misinformed or ignorant on the subject? Are there any misconceptions that you'd like to clear up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq78cb?context=5)|After this, that I didn't get into college purely from affirmative action lol.
[I wish you the best of luck in school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq78cb?context=5)|But really, that being Native doesn't mean the government gives us money. It's quite the opposite actually. We get our money from tribal owned businesses. And other tribes weren't lucky enough to receive land that could be developed. Some reservations are compared to Third World countries.  
[How do you personally feel about affirmative action? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq8k2a?context=5)|I think it has run its course. I think it was valuable to have for X amount of years but we don't particularly need it. I know people think I got into Hopkins simply because I'm Native but I worked my ass off to get here and everyone else should too. 
[Shouldn't you be outlining right now? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq0krj?context=5)|As in doing work? Yeah... I have a lot of finals to study for :/
[Do you think you earned your scholarship academically or got it because you are Native American?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq8w9a?context=5)|I have my scholarship because of the tribe I belong to. Muckleshoot offers them to every tribal member. If it was from a different source I could claim it was academic. Our tribe requires a 2.0 GPA to keep our scholarships which is straight Cs so... not all that harsh. However, I'm currently attending Johns Hopkins so I'm a far cry from nonacademic.
[Do you have a tribal tattoo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq4dgf?context=5)|I don't haha. Not yet at least... 
[Since your studying law, have there been any examples where a ""genetically predisposed"" argument has been used to defend a Native American with an alcohol related crime? And was it successful? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq5as8?context=5)|I don't believe there have been any cases like this... but I wouldn't know for sure. It would be really stupid if there were (I mean I get it but excuses are stupid). 
[Did you grow up on your ""rez"" or off? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq5gjz?context=5)|I grew up on my reservation. The only time I've been off is the last 4 years during college. 
[What are your thoughts of John Redcorn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq3mhe?context=5)|Haha you asked this twice. I don't watch King of the Hill anymore and don't really remember the character. I don't find Hollywood's portrayal offensive to the point that I rally against it. I know that almost all of the portrayals are wrong and I started watching a documentary about it... but I just don't bother with being too offended. 
[Thanks for answering my somewhat cheekish question! If you have any questions regarding law school please feel free to ask. I'll do my best to talk you out of it :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq9u3k?context=5)|Haha the attorney's on the tribe ask me every year, ""Are you sure you want to go still?""
[I am so embarrassed about some of the stupidity on this thread. That's awesome that you are working so hard. I remember being really embarrassed and astounded by the misinformation about Native Americans in public school. I thought the book ""Lakota Woman"" was an amazing read about the second occupation of Wounded Knee. Do you have any other suggested reading about Native American life in modern America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqp2k8?context=5)|Sherman Alexie is a rather good Native author of books about his life growing up; they are fiction but I think a lot of it reflects his real life. I've only read a few but there was a movie on one too: Smoke Signals.
[Also, as a lawyer for your tribe what kind of legal issues are you expecting to face, and what inspired you to become a lawyer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqp2k8?context=5)|And, I've been interning in our attorney's office during the Summers. Our court is just now expanding to deal with civil and criminal law (before it was just family law - ICW cases and whatnot). I think by the time I take the bar exam I'll be coming back to an expanded court system. I think there'll be a lot of legal jargon that needs to be continually revised as the years to on; contracts with the state, jails, and police... etc. I've also helped in some business deals for the tribe as well. I think just knowing that I could do something for my tribe (since they're paying for my education but also because it's my life and will be my kids' lives as well) is awesome. So far there are no tribal members in our attorney's office and I think it's time we had at least one of us working there in that position.
[I have been under the understanding that Native Americans of a certain purity (something like 1/16th?\), that can prove their heritage, get free higher education.  That's how a friend of mine got his.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq64xb?context=5)|I've never heard of that... but I don't know everything. I go to JHU and it's a private university. I'm betting they don't pay for certain Universities but again... I don't know. My tribe pays for mine specifically.
[What are your thoughts on Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl (and ICWA in general\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq2wbu?context=5)|I didn't follow the case of Baby Veronica but someone asked about it earlier in the thread. I think she was a minuscule amount of Native but it ended up being a huge deal anyway...
 |Well in general, I support our ICW system because they try realllyyy hard. BUT, and this is just me personally nothing reflecting my tribe, I think it's impossible to keep all of our foster children on the reservation. I think they do a helluva lot better job presently but in the past it would have been valuable to look outside of the res. Our ICW was understaffed and overworked and kids went forgotten. And those kids aren't doing so well these days.  
[Is paint huffing included in the drug problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq10qx?context=5)|No, it isn't. It's mostly prescription pills. 
[What do you think of anthropologists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqetux?context=5)|In what way? They are certainly valuable. Forensic anthropology interests me most out of all of the fields. However, anthro itself is important. 
[Who's got the worst reputation in aboriginal affairs presently, Canada or the USA? If there's even a difference..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq7z5y?context=5)|I'm honestly not sure. From what I've learned in this AMA I'd say Canada because it seems like their government still holds their land (in trust at least). 
[How is thanksgiving handled on a reservation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqbydy?context=5)|On ours, we celebrate like any other family :)

I've only met one other Native person here at Hopkins and I believe he was 1/4 (also appeared white). 
[In kindergarten all of the native kids got out of class got to go to the library, eat pizza and take a book of their choice. why didnt i?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdqd4uj?context=5)|Wait, why didn't I get to do that?

I am asking this because I have never seen one... except on a static map.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdpxupd?context=5)|It differs across regions. Some tribes were very unlucky and received desert land. Those reservations live in complete poverty. They had nothing to do with their land; our reservation was lucky though and we got land that could be developed.
 |There is a large drug problem on the reservation so some places look really... impoverished. The people who do drugs become desperate and they steal in order to feed their addiction. They'll do whatever it takes to get their fix even if it means stealing from their own family. It sucks and I hope we can overcome the drugs, or at least to a point where so much of the community isn't doing it.

But, all Indians have a full ride.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rqlls/iama_native_american_woman_on_a_full_ride/cdq8zig?context=5)|I don't think that's true... and if it is, then please point me to the grant/scholarship website for *all* natives.
