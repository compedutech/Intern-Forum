1449xd,6,2012-12-01,Building an important web resource. ASP.NET or PHP/jQuery?,barseno,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1449xd/building_an_important_web_resource_aspnet_or/,"I'm an Application Programming intern at my employer, and I've been assigned a project making a sort of web dashboard to be used company-wide by the I.T. teams (multiple locations).

My dilemma when planning this project is what I should be building it in.  There have been no corporate-wide applications like this prior to now, so there are no standards.  The only requirements that have been asked of me are:

Build it in ASP.NET with Visual Basic (old .NET framework to boot),
Make it secure,
and make it useful.

The expectation is for it to be in ASP.NET with VB code-behind, but I know I can do so much better with a PHP/jQuery built page. I just need to know if it's worth it to convince the team.

Here are my current pros and cons lists for the two frameworks, as well as additional notes about the project:
Also, I will edit these lists with any pros and cons anyone mentions.


**Additional notes**

* I want to expand access to the dashboard to mobile devices.

* Need to use Windows AD authentication to login.

* Would like to make as much of the work I do reusable if I expand the dashboard with more features.

* If I want to not use ASP.NET, I'll need to make a hell of an argument for my decision and have overwhelming reason of why it would be better.

* I've taught myself asp.net, visual basic, and php since I started working there this May, so it's not really like I favor one over the other because of familiarity (from college I'm a C++/C# game developer)

* The dashboard will be used for on call schedules, team/project rosters, and potentially be expanded to provide SOP's, remote access, and other useful tools. 

* The outcome of this project for me may heavily determine what I'll be building any future projects in.


**ASP.NET**

*pros*

* Is what we use for internal application development, so it will be supportable by anybody in the department.

* Easily ties in to Active Directory with code I'm already familiar with.

*cons*

* Old framework. (Think ASP 2.0, 3.0 if I'm lucky)

* Weird server/client architecture.

* Looks weird and old.

* No cool jQuery widgets, so potentially less functional / clunky.

* Pages require compile, so less on-the-fly changes, and more critical to save source code.

**PHP/jQuery/jQueryUI**

*pros*

* No compilation of project before use

* AJAX/JSON support is awesome

* Easier to keep up to date (in my opinion).

* Using open-source widgets and libraries can help make the project development go faster.

*cons*

* Need to justify its use over ASP.NET for the project

* No one in the department knows PHP, and few know much javascript, so it would be unsupported by anybody but myself.

* I don't know yet how I would do AD authentication for access security.


These are just the pros/cons I can think of at the moment, and I'll add any more that I think of.  Any input that I can get toward either side would be great! 

Part of the importance in this project to me is showing what is possible with current frameworks over old coding methods.  Another part of it is to show what I can do as a programmer/developer.  I'm graduating in the spring with a game programming degree so I try to bring those philosophies into my application development when it makes sense to."

However, during my college years I was depressed and really shy, and usually failed to make a good impression to my bosses. The depression, along with insomnia also contributed to a lack of concentration and focus, which affected my performance. During many of the internships I was given very mediocre reviews.

Since graduation I started seeing a therapist and went on anti-depressants, and feel much better.

I've since started searching for jobs, but because I've never had a good/close relationship with any of my previous employers, I have no references. I've tried contacting a few of them through email and by leaving messages, but only 1 has responded to me.

So, without a good list of references despite having a number of professional experiences, do i still stand any chance in getting a job? 

If I volunteer and get references from them, would employers consider them? Or would that be seen by employers as being negative, since I haven't been able to find a paid position?

1430z3,0,2012-11-30,"Graduating college, might travel, need advice. (unfortunately long)",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1430z3/graduating_college_might_travel_need_advice/,"Hi folks. This isn't about post-graduate ennui, but maybe more about avoiding it. It's also very long, and I'm sorry, woops.

I'm a U.S. college senior who is going to be graduating in a few weeks. I took a year off from college, what would have been my sophomore year, to study Spanish, go to cooking school, travel a bit, but have made up a semester's worth of credits and so am technically graduating a semester early.

All of my friends graduated last year or are graduating at the end of this year--I'm the only person I know who is going to be going through this transition when I do. I know that I will make more friends, I know that there are a lot of great people I have yet to meet, but I've only ever lived with strangers and girlfriends, and I'd like to at least have the opportunity to live with friends once before everyone becomes too old for that. The trouble is, the twenty or so people I'd wanna live with are all in leases that started last summer, so they're all going to move around again this coming summer, and I'd really prefer to be free to at least have the option of joining up with some of them. 

Here's my position:

* I've been educated as an artist, and have no immediate job prospects--an MFA is likely down the line, and I'm going to be working on my art no matter where I go or what I do, but am not in a position to immediately leverage my work into something paying. My work doesn't require me to be stationary, though--I don't need a studio or anything.

* I have nothing substantial pulling me in any direction in the near future. No matter where I go, I'm probably going to be doing the same thing--working a non-career job and working, working, working on my own stuff, both because it's what I care about and to get a portfolio together for MFA applications.

* I have done unpaid internships in my field of study before, and I'd like to avoid them (for the near future, at least).

* I have money. Not enough that I can just do whatever and have it be fine, but enough that I could bankroll the spring if I thought I was doing something worthwhile, something that let me justify spending the money. If I'm not working, I have to feel really good about what I'm doing instead--I couldn't just slack off, I'd feel enormously guilty.

* All the people I would live with (which, aside from job prospects, seems like the best reason I would have to move to a specific place) are in NYC, in leases, and I wouldn't be able to live with them until the summer.

* I've been working hard as hell for years and years, and wouldn't mind ""forcing"" myself to take a few months off by occupying myself with something that didn't give me the free time to feel guilty for not working, but that also didn't seem like a form of stagnation.

My prospects certainly aren't bleak, and I'm feeling very good about the long term. For the short term, though--it's not that I'm in a bad position, I thankfully have a safety net, but it's more that I have a lot of momentum coming out of school and want to channel that into something that is neither a compromise nor something I'm doing just because I need something to do. My problem, as I see it, is that I have this sort of ""dead time"" in the spring--unless a career-relevant job comes up in that time, I'd like to keep away from firm commitments (leases, for instance) until the summer, which would leave me freer around career stuff, applying to MFA programs, etc.

Here are some possibilities:

* A friend and I were vaguely planning to take the Trans-Siberian Railway together--he's been abroad for a couple months, we'd meet up in Moscow in January, swing across Siberia to southeast Asia for a few months, play it by ear about where we go and for how long, and come back whenever. A friend is going to be in Berlin, wants me to visit her around late March, so that could work if I was coming back then--another friend is in Tokyo, floated the idea of getting a very cheap place somewhere in southeast Asia for a month (I have no idea how realistic that last bit is in terms of legality or availability).

Obviously, this sounds like a dream, and I'd have no compunctions about putting my life on hold for something like that. Also, the friend I'd be traveling with would, in some ways, be a very pragmatic traveling partner--he's great with organization, itineraries, finding things to do. On the other hand, he and I weren't doing so well the last time he was in the States--getting on one another's nerves, and he's sort of expressed that he might be (manageably) romantically attracted to me, which is not reciprocated. I'm nervous about spending that much time in that sort of situation with someone that I don't feel totally good with. He and I have acknowledged that if I go and it's a disaster and we stop being friends, that would still be something interesting, something memorable, but worse comes to worst we could just get on a plane and come back early. Still, he and I really weren't very good at being friends the last time we were with each other.

* Another possibility is going to check out Eastern Europe/Scandinavia on my own for a bit--there are a lot of areas there that I've really wanted to see for a while, but I've never traveled alone, it's a very intimidating notion, and I'm concerned that I'll go over in January, get sick of it in February, March, April, decide to come home, and be back in the same position but with an even less utilizable ""dead time"" of two or three months before the summer.

Then there are pipe dream-y possibilities that have occurred to me but that I haven't really researched or explored, like: getting a seasonal job at a Nat'l Park, the kind that covers room and board, or going to a random tiny cheap place in the U.S., subletting for a few months, and working hard as *hell* on my own stuff.

So, that's about it. If you've read this far, I'm **enormously** grateful. But, as someone who has (basically) been in school his whole life, I am having a hard time guessing what I'm going to want when I get out, so, anyone, any advice is enormously welcome.

Thanks again."

I can no longer afford to go to school and I am not too positive about my prospects here in good old America.  I would like to go somewhere, anywhere that has a more socialist, but still democratic government.

My program of study was information technology with a minor in business administration.  Ideally, I would move to a country in which I could find a job in my field, and then use the income from that, or government help to finish my degree.

I have done an internship at a fortune 500 company with facilities around the globe.  I do not know any foreign language fluently, but am willing to learn and am confident in my ability to do so.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I would like to get out of the US before it turns into a corporate run Orwellian police state.  

I, like many other American expatriates on here, have lost faith in my country.  I don't think that I fit in well with this superficial culture of materialistic consumerism.  I believe that the general population is far too brainwashed for the so called ""sleeping giant"" to be awakened again.  Just look at how the occupy movement has fizzled out.

I've learned a small amount of Java and I'm about to finish a c++ course. I have also taken a class teaching Unity, but I wasn't sure where to focus to learn game design.

I guess my main worry is that I will get really good at C++ and then find it doesn't really have the applications I'm looking for.

I have been employed at company X, for 2 years. My manager seems like a reasonable understanding person. Recently I was contacted by company Y when they saw my resume on linkedin. From the job description and salary range, I would much prefer to work for Y. They have asked me to go in for an interview. My manager at X does not know. I'm going in for an interview soon, and I will take a personal day for company X during that time, which is fine.

So I got the form you fill out to officially apply for a job for Y and there is a section (with 5 blanks) to fill in any professional references (immediate managers). I'm very lacking in this list, since company X is only my first job out of college. And the internship I had in college, company Z, went out of business and I have no contacts left there. So that leaves the professor I TA'd for once during grad school as my only reference. 

So here is my question, should I:

A) Leave my current manager out of the reference list, never tell him about this interview unless I get a job offer from Y and I take it. So if I don't get the job it's as if it never happened, and all will be fine. Will this potentially hurt my chances for company Y? Will it look bad that I had an internship and a current employer and I have no references to speak for me?

B) Talk to my manager, and tell him everything, and tell him I'm putting him down as a reference? It's just weird to think of telling him ""Hey, i like this job and all, but please say nice things about me when they call so that you can help my chances of getting a different job and screwing you over"". And yes, it would be an inconvenience for company X if I left since they currently have no one that could do this position, so any person coming in would have 0-experience at the job and have to be fully trained again.

So, reddit, please, what do I do? Thanks!


--------

UPDATE: They asked me if I could get more references, I said not my current job, and they said that's fine, but if I could get professors from my university that taught me or that I worked with. I provided them a couple and they were very content, waiting to see if I get it or not, thanks!

-------------------------------------------

I'm rather frustrated at this point in my career. I have a B.S in CIS (so not a real computer scientist - hard maths are not my strength) and ended up doing web dev for my internship and my current job (using PHP almost entirely, some Python and more than a bit of JavaScript). My current job pays crap (17 an hour in a higher than average cost of living area), no benefits, holidays or paid time off either, and to make matters worse, I'm the only developer (two html/css/design devs) - so I'm a JR Dev, but also the lead...

I like to consider myself a decent programmer, I follow the standards as I understand and know them, use OOP unless it's unnecessary, and work at writing only secure code (As best I know how - and try and constantly learn more about security). However, lately, my boss has been getting on to me about several things, a general trend of not being accurate at my time estimates (I suck at this) and bugs that pop up in my code regularly.

We have implemented a QA procedure, but often breaks down into usability and feature creep rather than finding bugs. And each feature added at the request of the boss, often adds it's own bugs, especially when a feature requires a bit of a rewrite of code.

I'm feeling pretty incompetant at this point. I've been with this job for about 2.5 years now, shouldn't I be producing bug free code? My boss sure thinks so, and it's getting frustrating on my part troubleshooting modules and plugins (Drupal and WordPress) that interfere with my code - though often I'm required to troubleshoot two plugins or modules I didn't write and ""fix"" them anyway.

Added to this stress is the whole interviewing process of which I am not good with. While working here I've been applying and interviewing elsewhere (only a few interviews in 2.5 years of being here and looking - my low experience contributes to that I'm sure), and the panel interviews really stress me out. I'm the typical introvert programmer and getting in front of people is hard enough without feeling like I should know more than I do.

Should I re-think my career path here? I love to program, but if I'm truely inept at this stuff, perhaps the rest of the web dev world is better off with me in another field...

How do I make myself more marketable so that I can demand a pay raise from my company.  I'm working for next to nothing and I want to stay at this job, but I feel the only way to not hurt relationships and get my raise is to prove I'm worth something at another job then demand the pay raise.

I currently have a ton of linux experience (as in I've been having fun with it for a decade or so.  So I know my way around)
I can do entry level programming in ruby and entry level stuff in the rails framework.
I can fully configure and even cross compile onto routers freeswitch and I'm decent at troubleshooting (a business class VoIP/PBX)   
I'm entry level at working with amazon web services.  Have built a few websites from the ground up (nothing amazing).
I'm currently working on building an ecommerce using magento.  I expect to be entry level in that in a month.

I'm just curious what you guys would do to be more marketable?  I've got a lot of niche skills and I'm thinking I need to gain some mainstream talent just to market myself.

Just for reference (and please don't nail me to a cross for working for so cheap.  It started as an internship at a brand new company) I get paid 25k a year.  I would like to move up to 40k/yr in the next year.  I don't know my startups annual income. 


TL;DR

 - Is it acceptable I ask what the annual gross/net income of the business is?  I'm the only full time employee with two bosses if that matters.

 - I want to get a raise by making myself more mainstream marketable, getting a job offer then showing my bosses.  Any suggestions that line up well with my niche capabilities?  If nothing lines up what is 'hott' right now?  (I can learn anything quickly.)

Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to replace that hardware with a new box immediately, but it would eventually get replaced. That being said ...

I had found an older HP ProLiant DL 380G4 that had been retired earlier this year. Nothing physically wrong with it; the system that was running on it just got upgraded and virtualized. So we decided to use that to temporarily rebuild the application server until we got a faster piece of hardware to run it on. Time for a new ticket to be issued to the intern! He needs to learn, right?

He took the install DVD with Windows Server 2008 R2 back into the room and started trying to boot to it to install Windows. Problem was, he never could get it to boot. No matter what he tried, it simply wouldn't boot. He called me back after about an hour to get a second set of eyes on it to figure out why the server wouldn't load the disc. I quickly verified boot order (sanity check) and as soon as I pressed ""Save and Exit"" in the BIOS, I had realized what had happened.

Need a [hint](http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/12028_div/12028_div.html)?

After removing the DVD, I pulled my keys out, popped the hot-swapable CD-ROM drive out of the server, popped a DVD-ROM drive out of another server, stuck the DVD into this new drive, and powered on the server. The intern left to hang his head in shame.

tl;dr - The average person spends about 2 years on the phone in a lifetime. Help Desk technicians, therefore, are overachievers."
148vcl,7,2012-12-03,"College senior with highly likely finance job position: spend an extra year doing a double major in econ, or graduate in May with Philosophy degree? ",fembot__,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/148vcl/college_senior_with_highly_likely_finance_job/,"Relevant facts: 

* I am 21 years old. Graduated a year early from HS. 
* Doing an econ degree will take an extra year, but if I just get philosophy, I can graduate in May. 
* I don't really like econ, nor am I particularly strong in math-type classes. I haven't made it to the heavy math classes, but I have a feeling taking them will drag my GPA down. Coupled with the fact that I'm pretty burned out anyway, my GPA could be seriously crippled.
* Taking the 5th year would give me the opportunity to do another internship this summer. Would probably open more job opportunities. 
* This sounds stupid, but one reason I have for staying in school is to be with my S.O. who will be here for the next year as well. 
* My scholarship runs out in May 2013, so i'll have to take loans to cover the 5th year. 


Bascially, my question here is:

*  is having an econ degree relevant to a career in business/finance, particularly if I already have an in at a well-respected company? 
* Is there any reason that I should either stay or go that I haven't considered? 
* What would you do if you were me?

148t01,2,2012-12-03,I have until Friday to accept an internship offer for the summer. I'm concerned about etiquette considering the timing...,theguyjb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/148t01/i_have_until_friday_to_accept_an_internship_offer/,"Last week, I interview with an IT consultancy company that offers programming summer internships. This morning, I received an offer, and have until Friday to accept or decline it. 

I have applied for many, many internships, and several absolutely will not contact me before next year. I believe some of these would be significantly better for my career. My concern is turning down the offer I have and then not receiving another.

Can I accept an offer and later reject the company? It seems like a move in bad taste. I do not want to mislead the company, but was not expecting to have to make a decision this far in advance. 

It should be noted this is a nationally known company that will pay me decent enough for the area, is close enough that I could still take a summer class, and that my interviewers were knowledgeable about code and overall pleasant. 

I will have just enough hours to be considered a Senior when the summer begins, so this is likely my last chance to get an in-school internship. 

**TL;DR** I would like to know the etiquette towards accepting an internship six months in advance and then having to reject it because of a better offer.

Any tips appreciated.",[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/148pgb/third_year_computer_engineering_student_ill_be/,"This would be for resume (edit: and learning) purposes and my personal website. Let out your creativity! (But please keep in mind that I am a noob)

Some background on my situation:

- I have a very good amount of experience with C++, good amount with Ruby on Rails, and less so (but wouldn't mind more time on it) with Java.

- I've pretty much just concluded my first Electronics course (haven't taken Computer Architecture or Embedded Systems yet, however I'll be getting books on both subjects rather than waiting for class to start).

- The problem is that **everything** interests me (as I'm sure a lot of you face); Even business, fashion, 3D modeling... I love web programming, thought about doing an android or iphone app (I've also dabbled with Objective-C and Cocoa 2D), but I've also suddenly become very infatuated with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi (I know, they have different purposes), specifically Arduino. 

- I've acquired the books ""The Arduino Cookbook"" 2nd Edition and ""30 Arduino Projects for the Evil Genius"" to get me started on the subject because I've never programmed on a microcontroller.

- I have this really strange urge (like some people have for ice cream) to use these books to have my first Arduino project be making a thermometer since I saw my co op advisor had made one when I walked into his office..

A good friend of mine in my class just got accepted on an internship for 6-9 months with Apple with ridiculous pay, and it sort of lit a spark in me."
148ok2,2,2012-12-03,Unemployed recent college grad who has been rejected from every single job application that used technical interviews: What can I do?,throwaway923457,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/148ok2/unemployed_recent_college_grad_who_has_been/,"I graduated this year with a degree in computer science from a state school. I graduated summa cum laude with an A average, had several internships, and did an honors thesis. Former classmates and former co-workers have expressed confidence in my abilities. I have an active side project that recruiters have liked. It sounds like I should be able to find a job, right?

I suck at technical interviews, though. All my internships were from organizations that didn't offer them, or I had prior connections with them. I've been rejected by Microsoft, Google, Amazon, just to name a few. I've been rejected at every stage from the initial phone screen all the way to the on-site. I've known for a while that I suck at these interviews, but I'm afraid to ask for help because I suspect that the reason I keep failing technical interviews is that I am actually a bad engineer. With no way to get real world experience, I am beginning to think this more and more.

I just can't seal the deal. I've bought several books on the subject, including Cracking the Coding Interview and Programming Interviews exposed. The only thing I haven't done is mock interviews, because I don't know anyone who can help me do them.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm getting desperate."
148b44,6,2012-12-03,My first attempt. Please review my resume for a Business Analyst position. Yes I read the sidebar already =),champtang,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/148b44/my_first_attempt_please_review_my_resume_for_a/,"Hi r/resumes,

I have recently graduated in May 2012 and it's about time I pursue my career. I read the sidebar, dozens of post on this subreddit, and other website to write this resume. I think it's OK but only time will tell.

Some things that I already have concern about is that all my relevant experience are volunteer work, unpaid internship, or self employment. I never actually worked for money before the regular 9-5 way so I'm not sure if I'll be misleading people with my resume. 

Also, I'm still doing everything on the experience list but I don't want to put ""present"" because it will come off that I'm currently employed and is trying to jump ship (true but I'm not getting pay for my current work since it's volunteer or my own free time). How should I list the timeline?

Also, most business analyst job description ask for knowledge in Excel, SAS, and other data analysis program. I thought about putting a ""Relevant Skill"" listing all the software I know but instead opted for adding these software keywords into each bullet points showing that I know what the program is and that I know how to use it. Yet, I still feel that some HR will miss these from skimming and I would lose a chance for a job because they didn't see a clear listing of Excel, Sas, SQL, Access, etc.

Lastly, Billy Bob isn't my name and I'm not for the Wizard of Oz.

Thank you all and I'll be sure to pay it forward!

[What is the most embarrassing story about Cenk you can remember?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc6jw?context=5)|Holy shit, I can spend the next 4 hours telling Cenk stories. One quick story. He went on a date with my ex-GF. When they got back to her place after dinner, things started to get a bit romantic. Then he had to take a dump. She lived in a tiny apt in NYC so when he came out of the bathroom, the place stunk so bad that she had to ask him to leave. She opened all the windows even though it was bone chillingly cold outside. 
[Big fan of TYT here, been watching since 7th grade.. I'm a high school junior just beginning to look at colleges, and I have a couple questions.  1: what's your advice to someone my age who wants to pursue a career in journalism/polysci? What kind of journalism offers the best jobs, opportunities, etc (I.e. broadcasting, newspapers, etc\)  2: what's it been like to see tyt expand so rapidly as it has these past few years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcfh3?context=5)|Journalism is dead. Sorry, but it's true. So few people actually do journalism now in the US, which is why TYT is so popular. You don't need to have a degree in anything. Just be well-read and learn everything possible about your world. Read everything. 
[3: what kind of process do you guys go through when picking stories for the show? what do you look for?  4: What's it like working with a Turkish barbarian like Cenk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcfh3?context=5)|It's great to see TYT grow so fast. It'll grow even faster in the next 2 years.   Cenk is truly an awesome person. We've been friends for 28 years now and there are few people I've met in my life with as much integrity. 
 |Ana, John, Jayar, Cenk, and Tom pick the stories with input from the rest of the team. We look for things that are important, topical, viral, relevant, and entertaining. 
[Why are you called the ""Audio Guy?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcbhv?context=5)|It's a really dumb story that's not really even funny but Cenk finds it hilarious. When I first started at TYT, a YouTube commenter thought I was the audio guy b/c I sat next to Jayar one time. Cenk thought it was really funny that someone mistook me as Jayar's assistant. So he called me that a few times on air. 
[What does it take to get hired at TYT and what are some positions that you are looking for in the next year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc7en?context=5)|We have a very stringent hiring standard at TYT. First we take people on as an unpaid intern. If they are good, then we make them a paid contractor. Then if we think they have the smarts &amp; the personality &amp; work ethic, etc, we make them an employee. We are slow to hire, but we never fire. 
[Unpaid intern? Haven't you guys railed on that in the past (I'm thinking Georgia State Government\)? Maybe you could expand on that a little. What kind of hours are you talking about? Do these folks typically keep their ""day jobs""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bccm6?context=5)|They come in a work a few hours a day for a few weeks or a couple of months. They usually have some other income source (usually small). Then we progress to paid contractor and then full employee. The reason for this long process isn't just to save money, but for us to have essentially an extended interview process to make sure that whoever we hire really fits our culture here. 
[Where do you hope TYT is at in 1 year and 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc8gv?context=5)|In one year I want TYT to be at 100 employees with 20 owned and operated shows and 50 channel partners. In 10 years, I want to see TYT offices in UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, and more 
[When MSNBC and Cenk parted ways, were you relieved or disappointed?   Can we get some ""Elbow drop from the Sky"" tshirts? Shits hilarious.  I get the sense you and Cenk are mentoring the rest of the cast. Any truth to that?  Watching the stream of Cenk at the Money Out of Politics conference at UCLA was awesome, can that happen more often?  I love Cenk, but it seems like he really dominates the airtime, any way to dole that out more evenly? I feel bad for Ana sometimes =\  My roommates love TYT now, my little bro a PoliSci/Business major, and a few other randoms...but you guys deserve more attention...how do we get there?  Who is the ONE person you would love to have on the show for a Cenk Pay Per View beatdown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bgamo?context=5)|I was happy when Cenk left MSNBC. His time commitments to MSNBC made my life and those dedicated to the online show much more difficult. MSNBC just wanted Cenk, not TYT.   I guess Cenk and I are mentoring others in some ways since we are much older, but we learn so much from them as well. I love the team we have, really smart, dedicated, good people. 
 |Yes, we'll do live streams of TYT staff playing games (not me or Cenk, we don't play video games)  Money out of politics conference at UCLA was fantastic, not just Cenk, but all the other panelists and participants. Lessig was his usual outstanding self. 
 |Ana will LOVE you for this comment. Look, Cenk's a talker and it's impossible to shut him up. What can we do?   We have been doing a lot more marketing and PR this year and our numbers have shot up. We'll keep doing that. Thank you for spreading the word about us.   I'd love to have Bill O'Reiley on for a mano-a-mano showdown with Cenk. That would be great for so many reasons. 
 |We'd love to get NDT on the show. We have been trying to get him on The Point to no avail so far. 
[A lot of TYT fans get pissed off when you guys do segments on gun control. Pretty much all of the Facebook comments are anti-gun control, and they get a large number of likes. I'm personally neutral on the issue, but I was wondering if you take the dissatisfaction into account, and what your response to one of the main arguments pro-gun TYT watchers use, which is gun control would end up the same as the failed drug war? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcj8a?context=5)|We are heavily in favor of gun control. The idea that we shouldn't regulate such a deadly device is so idiotic to me. If we can't regulate guns, then maybe we can't regulate explosives. What if I preferred to arm myself with grenade instead of guns. Can I walk into stadiums and churches and schools with a whole bunch of grenades? The 2nd amendment never specifies ""guns"". It just says ""arms"", so I guess if we apply the pro-gun logic, we can't regulate ANY weapons.
 |I don't care what our fan reaction is going to be. We report our opinions and commentary honestly. We don't fake it for popularity. That's why I think our fans love us even when they disagree - b/c we aren't lying or pretending.
[What are your responsibilities as a Chief Operating Officer at TYT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc99i?context=5)|I handle all aspects of the business side of TYT, everything from managing our relationship with YouTube, making partnerships with other content creators, green lighting new shows, developing business opportunities with other companies, speaking with potential investors. I also oversee the day to day operations to make sure that things are running smoothly - hiring people, setting schedules, determining salaries and bonuses, etc. 
[What do you think was the turning point or catalyst for TYT's success? Was there a time when it just surged or was it gradual growth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcd7k?context=5)|There was no single turning point. Cenk built this thing brick by brick over a period of many years with a tiny budget and a tiny staff of dedicated, poorly paid, people. We got a real boost during the Bush years when we were the only news outlet screaming AGAINST the Iraq War. Also, we made the critical decision to post our videos on YouTube rather than just on our own website. This was back in 2005 when YouTube first launched. Getting an early start on YouTube really helped. 
[What is your favorite show on TYT Network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc75z?context=5)|Easy. Pop Trigger. I love this channel even though I generally hate celebrity and pop news. The host, Samantha Schacher is an absolute gem. I totally love her. She is smart, beautiful, engaging, funny, and truly kind. She is fantastic. Bree Essrig is also amazing and we are incredibly grateful that she is part of the show. Lastly Tom Hanc at TYT has done a masterful job of producing the show. 
[Do you think TYT will one day have a Science channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcgx9?context=5)|That is my dream. I am a massive science geek at heart. We just need to find the right talent to host and produce. I want to do it right, and to do so, it's going to take some money. 
[A few months ago I saw you at VidCon in front of the Starbucks. I didn't say hello because you seemed preoccupied.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcon7?context=5)|Yes, I will be at all VidCons. Please stop by and say hello next time. I am never too busy to meet our audience. We love the support from you guys and we understand that we wouldn't be where we are without you.
[Will I get to see you again next year at VidCon 2013? Who from TYT will probably be attending? What about Playlist Live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcon7?context=5)|Not sure about the live playlist. I'll ask our tech guys about that. 
[What was it like when you lost to my fantasy team in the TYT fantasy football league?  Also, how many people try to get jobs at TYT and what do you look for in someone that wants to be part of the actual TYT army?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bd11w?context=5)|When I lost to you in fantasy football, it was the most painful moment of my life. Not.  We get many, many inquiries about working here at TYT. We look for really smart people who are independent minded, easygoing, and have a great work ethic and integrity. Also, I only hire people that I like at a personal level. Would I enjoy or dread sitting next to you on a cross country flight? If the latter, no way do you get hired. 
[What did you guys do in celebration of the President's victory last month?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bca4z?context=5)|Nothing. There isn't much to celebrate in my mind. Yes, Romney would have been an utter disaster for the country, but I think Pres Obama has a TON of work to do to help the lives of ordinary Americans and get the country back on the right track. His record on civil liberties is appalling. His position on cutting SS and Medicare to fund tax cuts for corporations scare me. I like Obama and I'm rooting for him, but I'm holding his feet to the fire and want to put as much pressure on him as possible to do what the people want, not the corporations and the wealthiest 0.1%
[Has there ever been a time that you and Cenk have ever pissed each other off to the point where there was yelling involved?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc9xm?context=5)|Yes. This happened many times, usually during sports. We are both hyper competitive and sometimes our emotions get the best of us. 
[What do you think will happen to news on television? Will there be a place for it in five years? Fifteen years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcgzg?context=5)|I think television news has to evolves to become relevant. Fox News viewers are dying off. MSNBC has become the establishment Democratic channel. I'm not sure what CNN is. They have to be HONEST with their reporting and stop calling everything even. TV is dying anyway, and TV news is dying even faster. 
[Is there a TYT Keith Olbermann feud?  Can you guys get Dylan Ratigan on the show so we can get an update on where he is now that he left MSNBC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdgaw?context=5)|No feud with KO. He took a few shots at us when he left Current but there was no feud. Cenk and Dylan are good friends. Dylan is taking a well deserved break after his long days working in NYC all these years. He'll resurface in 2013. 
[Thks for doing this Steve, watching you guys since i was living in NY, and now moved to Istanbul. are you guys planing to open a branch over here in Turkey? And how would you plan to keep your way of thinking with too many different views(if TYT go global\), is that means no border, unite? :\) thank you for your time ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bd85f?context=5)|Yes!!! We definitely want to expand to Turkey. BTW, I've been to Turkey and LOVED it: Istanbul, Bodrum, Selcuk (sp?), Pammukale, and Ephesus. I'd love to visit again. 
[Hope to see you guys soon in Istanbul, may be i can work for you guys :\) btw spellings are correct 98% ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdeih?context=5)|That would be great. We should have a meet up with fans in Turkey.
[Are you guys considering doing another arm wrestling competition like last year? It seems like it would be much more interesting this time round since TyT has so many more female employees and contributors.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcb9x?context=5)|No arm wrestling b/c a few of us actually injured ourselves. We want to do other competitions though. Dance off? Ping pong maybe? Not sure yet. 
[What do you recommend to students or recent grads studying journalism now? Ana and I were both student reporters who didn't end up getting into the small-market news route, but our (especially hers\) paths are not easy to imitate. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bctfj?context=5)|I actually don't have any recommendations b/c I never went to journalism school. Everything is so scripted now on TV and corporate interests seem to trump so much that I find TV journalism just awful (if not dead). Print is much better, but the really good stuff is buried and headlines are often sensational. Not sure what you get out of journalism school and not sure what the best path is. I do love investigative journalism, but less and less of that happening now.
[What was your career path prior to becoming COO of The Young Turks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcn91?context=5)|I ran and operated a number of other businesses. When I sold one of them in 2010, Cenk asked me to come on board at TYT. I took on the role of business development but then gradually took over the head of all operations. 
[We're seeing that digital drives the bus in content production. What initiatives/ plans to you have continue/ strengthen TYT's digital/ online presence? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bch64?context=5)|We want to increase the amount of content that we generate, both by increasing the number of shows and increasing the output of each show. Also, we have big plans for global expansion. 
[How did Cenk's conservatism when he was younger affect your friendship with him? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcggl?context=5)|Cenk's youthful conservatism was comical and the rest of the guys in our group bonded by mocking him. Sometimes, he was fucking unbearable. It's great to see his evolution.
[Thanks for doing this Steve! great read. Not sure if you are still answering but ill toss you a question.  When are you going to visit my nations Capital? Ottawa could use a visit from TYT!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7benst?context=5)|What's up, bro?! Great to hear from you. You know how much I love Canada so I'd love to visit Ottawa soon. The problem is, I love Vancouver so much that I'll probably visit there again, which means my next visit to Canada won't be Ottawa.
[Wow, that's awesome. Is that recorded somewhere? I went back and forth all night, but missed it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdgpl?context=5)|I don't think that's available, but I know they want to have a real debate one day. Stay tuned. 
[Weren't TYT on Revision3 at some point? What was it like working with them? Why did you guys leave that network? It's a goal of mine to get on Revision3!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhcd8?context=5)|Yes, we were with Revision 3 and those guys are FANTASTIC to work with and if I had a small YouTube channel, I'd definitely want to be a part of their network. We left them b/c we wanted to be independent. As nice as they were, we just didn't like being part of someone else's network. We wanted to be on our own. 
[Did they reach out to TYT to be one their network or did you guys go to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhro6?context=5)|They reached out to us. We are still very close with them and meet up for dinner/drinks all the time. 
[The other night, Gideon Yu came in and had dinner at the restaurant where I work. He was very unpretentious and I would never have known he was anything other than an average joe wearing a t-shirt if his dining partner hadn't name dropped him when he realized they'd forgotten to make a reservation. Did you get the chance to work with him or correspond with him when he was at YouTube? Is he as unpretentious/awesome all the time as he was that night?  Also, do you think Psy will be the first to break 1 billion views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhria?context=5)|Don't know who Gideon Yu is. Sorry. And yes, Psy will def be the first to break 1 billion views. He is an international sensation and I really can't believe how fast he's become so huge. 
[What are some BIG issues you've disagreed with Cenk on and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bck4k?context=5)|Not really. We used to disagree quite a bit about gay rights and women's issues, but we pretty much agree now on most of it. 
[Yeah it's always going to be a bit awkward.  If you don't know her that well I think it's probably best to act like you normally would with small talk.  Or just perhaps say something you'd say to someone who had a big change that's more typical like losing a lot of weight.  So if you met someone a couple of times in a professional setting and they lost a lot of weight the next time you saw them, you probably wouldn't say anything.  But if you knew them well you probably would say something positive.  I think the same idea applies to people who have transitioned.  Most of the proper etiquette comes with what not to ask like about surgery or what medical procedures they've had done.  That will be taken in the same way as if anyone was randomly asked about their genitals, not well.  Also important is to not ask about their old identity, because trans people are really trying to seen for who they are, and those questions tend to imply you're asking ""but who are you really?""  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bgnfp?context=5)|This makes sense. Thanks for the feedback. 
[Was there any weirdness going on between Jennifer Granholm and Cenk during the Current Pres. Election coverage? Cenk was keeping it real, and it seemed like there were a few times she shot off her eye lasers. Mad props to him for keeping it real with one of the Dems' big convention speakers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bchw8?context=5)|No weirdness at all. Cenk is very close with Granholm, who is genuinely a sweet person. 
[What specifically did you find unappealing about a career in law? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdh58?context=5)|I was a civil litigator in a large law firm. We represented a huge multi-national corporation. Our client would sue and get sued by other large multi-national corporations. There were millions, sometimes billions at stake so they always settled b/c neither side wanted to risk losing everything. I really didn't give a shit who won or lost and they always settle anyway. They paid well but it was a soulless existence. 
[Hi Steve, longtime fan here from New Zealand currently studying journalism. It is my goal to bring TYT to new zealand and I see here that you already have plans to expand globally. How exactly are you approaching this aspiration and what advice to you have for those on the other end who wish to help make it happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdcqn?context=5)|Once we have sufficient funding, we want to visit all the different countries where we want to set up TYT and we'll have an audition to hire 4 to 6 hosts for that country's TYT. It will be a while before we make it to NZ, but keep in touch with us so you'll know when we are out there. 
[Is Ana and Cenk as attractive as they seem online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdb1n?context=5)|They both look better on camera than in real life just like most celebrities do, but they look pretty close to what you see. I saw Alec Baldwin once near my house and was horrified at how bad he looked in person. Maybe he was having a particularly bad day. 
[I'm a composer/songwriter and I'd love to write music for the show, whether it be for advertisements or for the breaks. How do you guys select music for the breaks in-between segments during the live shows? Who selects the music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcihy?context=5)|Jayar or whoever is running the sound board (Ricky, Dave Koller, Mark, etc) choose the music during breaks.
 |Yes, we have several composers who do stuff for us. 
[If an offender reoffends after getting released from prison instead of getting the death penalty then who's to blame? Did you know 84% of rapists reoffend after getting released from prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bird1?context=5)|I don't understand your question. We don't execute rapists. 
[Could you have another all-producers The Point episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7ben4g?context=5)|Yes, we will do it the week between Christmas and New Year.
[What is TYT? who is cenk/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bisdr?context=5)|Www.youtube.com/theyoungturks.

[What do you think has been the secret to your success as a COO?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bjxpq?context=5)|No real ""secret"". Just work hard, have good judgment, do the right thing, and get lucky every now and then. 
[How hot is Ana in real life, don't lie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bfcnt?context=5)|Come on, she's like my little sister! No, she's not hot at all to me but most people find her hot. 
[You should host or co-host more often.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bcl9r?context=5)|Thanks! I get that a lot. I do enjoy co-hosting on occasion but I don't like to do it more than once or twice a month. Besides, I have so many duties here that I really can't host more.  
[I do declare! Tell how you really feel about Cenk's ""rich guy"" imitation. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bdr1x?context=5)|It SUCKS. His ""rich guy"" imitation is the same as his ""British"" imitation, and he uses the phrase ""I do declare"" for both, but I told him that that phrase is more of a southern US thing than a British thing. It's his go to move. What can you do? 
[I just read through all of your answers and half-way through I realized that I was reading them in your voice.  I have no idea why your voice has been internalized, but maybe it's like Morgan Freeman and it's just hard to get rid of...  Thank you for doing this, very cool!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bh0rx?context=5)|Wow, what a compliment to be compared to Morgan Freeman. Thanks!
[Actually, I can't believe you replied to that. :\)  In all seriousness though, I definitely like what you add to the show and most of your opinions are well-thought out and add to the conversation at hand.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bhqh7?context=5)|I have a huge advantage in only chiming in when I have something smart and well-thought out to say. It's so much harder to host as you're up there just talking extemporaneously. Cenk and Ana do a really amazing job, so I try to give them a pass when they misspeak or misstate something, but I'm a cranky sticker about facts and figures so I get annoyed anyway. 
[Just a comment, You guys are the best. I watch every video on the main TYT  channel and most of the live streams. Best news source ever. You guys dont give a fk what others think. Mainstream media is too mainstream. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bfbsn?context=5)|That's exactly right. We tell it as we see it. That doesn't mean that we are always correct, but it does mean that we always say what we think and that we don't put a corporate spin or suck up to power for access. Thanks for the continued support!

[I just want to say thank you for being the one to consistently regulate on the show; not everyone has what it takes to stick it to Cenk if need be (still love ya Cenk lol\).  PS: You, Jesus, and Jayar need your own show. NOW.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14akfz/iama_chief_operating_officer_at_a_top_youtube/c7bc95e?context=5)|Thanks. I've been calling Cenk out for 28 years now. I agree with him 92% of the time, but when I disagree, I let him know. To his credit, he takes criticism really well. He's the anti-diva, which is great.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[With the ever aging generation of survivors, it seems very likely that in the near future there won't be any survivors left to tell the stories themselves. Is the museum undergoing any preservation efforts capturing modern day stories or the like? Do you see this causing any challenges or changes to the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ame9m?context=5)|We have a huge collection of oral histories: ones we have done, ones from other organizations, and ones from the Spielberg Shoah collection.  These testimonies are going to be increasingly important as the witness generation passes away. There are definitely going to be changes and we've been talking for a long time about what will happen when the survivors aren't with us anymore. We are doing our best for now to capture as many stories and collections as possible while the survivors are still with us (hence the National Tour) and are grateful for the number of people willing to share their stories.  We also work with a lot of children and grandchildren, and I think that will definitely increase in the future.
[I ask these questions in good faith and out of genuine curiosity towards your opinion on them, so please don't take it the wrong way.  Why do you feel a holocaust memorial museum, on the other side of the ocean from where the holocaust happened, opened nearly 50 years after the end of the holocaust, is necessary?  Do you feel it is more necessary than one for any of the more recent similar atrocities (Khmer Rouge, Rwanda, etc.\)?  If so, why?  Why do you think there are no museums to these other atrocities despite there being many for the holocaust?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an8da?context=5)|The Holocaust was a worldwide event--we have over 100 countries represented in our collection (either from refugees who fled the Holocaust to these countries or about the Holocaust in these countries).   We are Congressionally mandated to focus on the Holocaust (1933-1945) rather than on other genocides, but part of our mandate is also to draw attention to contemporary genocide. We have a Committee on Conscience which works to educate and raise awareness on more modern genocides. We try to raise questions in our exhibitions about medical ethics, propaganda, the fragility of democracy--all questions which are also relevant in studying contemporary genocide and are important for any citizen of a democracy to think about. You can see the Museum's mandate here: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/about)  and here is a link to learn more about the Committee on Conscience: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/about/)
[I thank you for the answer, however I was hoping to get your opinions on the subject rather than a description of your mandate.  Why, for instance, do you feel there are no museums to other, more recent, and equally world-shaking genocides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anwdz?context=5)|There are museums in the countries in which the genocides occurred, but to be honest, this is our specialty and we (Kyra and Becky) don't know as much about the commemoration of other genocides. Our colleagues in the Committee on Conscience would be much more familiar and if you have specific questions about the commemoration of different genocides, you can ask them.
[Were you working when this this happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am455?context=5)|Kyra was on the 5th floor of the Museum in her office. Becky was on travel for the Museum giving a talk in Boston. We loved Officer Johns. He was a really great guy and that day changed all of us.
[What, if any, changes took place to museum policy following the shooting? What do you think the general response of museum goers was following the shooting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am6hf?context=5)|The public outpouring of support was incredible--we got to greet our visitors at the door the day we reopened and there were lots of people who came specifically to show support. We're not privy to specific security changes, but we had metal detectors and that sort of thing in place years before the shooting.  There is a memorial to Officer Johns right inside the door with his picture and we now have a student leadership program named after him.
[As a history major who aspires to eventually get a doctorate to research/teach others about the Second World War and the Holocaust, I want to thank you for all you've done to spread knowledge on these events. I've been to your museum twice, most recently in July. I had the honor to meet and speak with three survivors: Bob Behr, Erika Eckstut, and Henry Greenbaum while I was there.  Hearing their stories from before and after the Holocaust was fascinating.   I am ecstatic that your museum allows ordinary citizens an opportunity to speak with survivors so they can share stories from their entire lifetime.  It really adds a much more personal feel to the exhibits.  Rather than simply looking at pictures, your exhibits come alive in the lobby and in the Wexner Center.  After I listened to Mr. Behr speak to an intimate group of people in the Wexner Center, I approached him and thanked him for spending some time with us.  He thanked me for listening and asked what I do with my life.  I told him about my education and what I want to study.  I'll never forget what happened next.  His eyes lit up, he grabbed my hands, held them tight, and quietly said ""Thank you."" again.  He followed with something like: ""I'm old; I'm not going to be here forever.  We *need* people like you to teach future generations about what happened to us to it **never** happens again."" He thanked me once more and went on his way.  When I tell people I'm a history major, I usually get the ""History is so boring."" speech and I try to justify my dream as best I can.  That conversation vindicated my desire to teach and gave me a tangible story that I can tell to others.  My apologies for not having a question in that wall of text.  Considering this is an AMA, I might as well ask a few questions.  **1.** I would love to have your job.  If I'm not teaching in a classroom, I'd love to teach the public through a museum.  How does one become the curator of a museum?  **2.** What is your favorite artifact or exhibit in the museum?  **3.** What is your favorite book(s\) on the Holocaust, particularly survivor/liberator testimonies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aozp2?context=5)|Thank YOU! This is so great to hear, and good teachers are incredibly important in teaching this history.  (And aren't Bob, Erika, and Henry great?)  Everyone who works here seems to come from different backgrounds, which is definitely an asset. Kyra's background is in art and Holocaust studies, and Becky's working on a PhD in History. We have colleagues who went to school for Museum Studies, Library school, Public History, Education, etc.
 |I think we answered this elsewhere, so I don't want to repeat, but you can see some of our favorites here: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/research/collections/curatorscorner/)
 |Becky's ""favorite"" Holocaust book is ""The Lost"" by Daniel Mendelsohn. Kyra's not sure of what her favorite is. 
[How many deniers do you get in an average week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am15k?context=5)|Personally, we don't encounter very many deniers (not really any, honestly), but we can't speak for other Museum departments. 
[Do you have an FAQ or other online resource you recommend for dealing with deniers (particularly in online forums?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amazg?context=5)|I don't think we have anything specifically about online forums, but you should look here and see if this will help: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/teaching/denial/)
 |On the Museum's tour, the curator of our permanent exhibition, Steve Luckert, is doing a program called ""Technology in the Hands of Haters: Imagine www.thirdreich.com"" 
[ I just want to say the USHMM is by far one of the greatest educational experiences of my life. I first went when I was 14 and again when I was 20. The way the exhibits are presented is simple but overwhelming to the human emotion and I appreciate your work tremendously. My question is how did you become the curators? What are some things about the job most people might not know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an5kz?context=5)|Kyra began working for the Collections department managing the Museum's collections database and eventually became the curatorial assistant and worked her way up.  Becky was an intern at the Museum after her junior year of college and then joined the archives staff after she graduated. We both really wanted to work in museums, and this one in particular. (Becky actually came to the Museum as a Girl Scout when she was 12 and decided then that that was where she wanted to work.) We both feel very lucky and honored.
 |Regarding what people might not know--there much more paperwork and much less Indiana Jones type adventure than you might expect, but there is some crawling around in attics and storage units. Just not as much as we'd like.
[What question do you wish Reddit asks you that hasnt been asked yet? Please answer it..  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aosyp?context=5)|Ooh, that's the best question yet.
 |Since there's two of us, we will both answer the question of what is the strangest artifact we have been offered. If you ever get into a conversation with us about this, it will be a long conversation. We have been offered a wind tunnel; Hermann Goering's yacht; Hitler's bathroom tile (green, by the way); a live US Army issued grenade; leaves from the tree outside the building where Anne Frank was in hiding; and a stone someone picked up while visiting Auschwitz on vacation.
[I hope most of those artifacts were given with good intentions, I have an old copy (1990s\) of the Anne Frank diary. Will you take my donation? lol ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aozr5?context=5)|We have almost a shelf of books about Anne Frank in our Library. So thanks, but...
[Is your museum about Jews only or are the exhibitions also about Poles and Soviet civilians? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amtbg?context=5)|We present about all victims of Nazi persecution regardless of race, religion, home country, or sexual orientation. We also collect materials, memoirs, and testimony from all victim groups, so if you know of any collections from Polish or Soviet civilians who were targeted by the Nazis, we would definitely be interested.
[Do you find that there are mostly Jewish people who visit the museum? I myself am Jewish, but I am well-aware that there are other groups of people who died in the Holocaust. It seems, to me, that it's only the Jews who get mentioned. Is this the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ana8t?context=5)|The majority of our visitors (almost 2 million a year!) are not Jewish. The staff is split pretty evenly--Kyra is Jewish, Becky is not.  We really see it as a human story rather than a Jewish one.   It's really important to us that all the stories are told.   When you go through the exhibit, we discuss and display artifacts related to all the different victim groups. Demographically, Jews and Roma were targeted in larger numbers and for ethnic reasons, which is why there is sometimes more of a focus on these groups.
[Is that job as depressing as it seems? I visited the museum when I went to DC and it was incredibly depressing as someone with both German and Jewish heritage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anser?context=5)|Kyra says she does not find her job depressing since she meets the most amazing people and gets to learn about their incredible stories. Becky seconds that, and adds it makes her feel so lucky--it's hard to be depressed or upset about your own life when you have seen what other people have been through and experienced.
[How do I get more involved with your museum? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an68n?context=5)|You can look here for volunteer opportunities: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/volunteer_intern/volunteer/)
 |Hope to see you soon!
[I've been to Yad Veshem with my grandmother who is a survivor. She had a very hard time going through the exhibits. Is this Museum gruesome? is is suitable for children?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amg6c?context=5)|We generally recommend the main exhibit for ages 12 and up (though it's at the discretion of the parents). We also have a children's exhibition called ""Remember the Children: Daniel's Story"" which is suitable for 8 and up. We also try to mask the more gruesome film footage behind safety walls so people can choose whether or not they want to see it.
[How many artifacts are currently on display, and how much is in storage? What kind of conservation concerns do you face with Holocaust-era artifacts and archives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am8x6?context=5)|Probably only about 2% of our collection is currently on display and the rest, while it is technically in ""storage"" is housed in a conservation facility with a full staff. Unless there is a conservation concern or it is being prepped for exhibition, we make all our material available to the public in our archives and reading room.  We're really proud of that--our collections are so historically important and we (and the people who donate them to us) want to make sure these stories are told as widely as possible.
 |As far as conservation goes, everything is reviewed upon arrival, and we have textile, book, paper, artifact, and photograph conservators on staff. They work to preserve the material, but we don't restore it to the way it looked originally. For example, if there is a tear in a piece of clothing, they will stabilize it, but not mend it.
[Do you rotate artifacts then? How ""permanent"" is the permanent exhibition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7amljs?context=5)|We rotate artifact on a regular schedule depending on the needs of the specific object. Paper is rotated more frequently than clothing which is rotated more frequently than 3-D objects.
[I have heard that of all the collections that the museum has, one of the largest is Nazi flags. If this is true, what have you done with said flags and how have you collected so many? Also, what was done with all the hair that was originally displayed in the museum and then removed?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am8o4?context=5)|First--the hair: We never had it on display (though we have a photo mural of hair). The decision was made not to display any hair out of respect for the survivors and victims, and the family members who visit.
 |As for Nazi flags, they are one of the top items we get offered on a weekly basis because so many soldiers brought them home as souvenirs.  We are offered them the most, but we don't think it's what we have the most of. Since we only have two Nazi flags on display, we are only able to accept flags of a specific size range for our exhibition needs. Exceptions are flags that are not currently represented in our holdings (unusual ones, or flags signed by liberators, etc).  If we're not able to accept a flag for our collection, we try to help the owner find an appropriate repository for it, since it does have historic value.
[Would you please tell us a story from someone who survived the camps and visited the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7am33w?context=5)|That happens almost every day. We have a great group of survivors who volunteer with us. They greet the public, do a speaking series in the summer, travel out to schools, and help us translate documents. Kyra and I work with Fritz Gluckstein ([Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/remembrance/survivoraffairs/meet/detail.php?content=gluckstein) whose father was Jewish and mother was Christian. He survived doing forced labor in Berlin. He's awesome.
[What do you think is the most unique artifact that you have in your collections either on display or in storage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anm43?context=5)|Regarding the textile part of your question, the textiles are kept the way they are when they arrived to us, just stabilized and de-infested if necessary.
[Also, since I sew and am a costumer I'm wondering about garment preservation, are textiles that are being restored and preserved sewn and patched to try to replicate their original look or are they kept the way that they are just cleaned or preserved in the condition in which you receive them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anm43?context=5)|As for the most unique artifact, we do have one of the Ringelblum milk cans on display (though it is on loan to us). We have such a wide variety of material, and every item has a story behind it that's unique. We have the only known photographs of Josef Mengele while he was at Auschwitz, a diary kept by a Mexican-American Catholic Holocaust survivor, Martin Niemoeller's typewriter--we could go on and on.
[How close are you guys to the Yad Vashem organization in Israel?  Since its been over 60 years since the Holocaust, how many new artifacts does the museum still receive? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aoanm?context=5)|We work very closely with Yad Vashem and share information (though our collecting mandates--what we collect--are slightly different, so we complement each other too).  We are still receiving nearly 400 new collections a year. We kept thinking it would slow down at some point, but we're pleased that we are still very busy!
[What are the differences in your collection mandates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7asxnu?context=5)|Our collecting focus is broader, and we also collect materials that relate to the American perspective of the Holocaust.
[Really? I thought all the Holocaust Museums were affiliated. Interesting.  So you guys each have your own collections? So all the Holocaust museums are competing for the some objects? I always thought the D.C. museum was the main one and the other museums were like branches or franchises. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aojbz?context=5)|We are the national museum but there are museums and educational centers all around the country. There is an Association of Holocaust Organizations, but it's made up of independent organizations. Sometimes we borrow objects from each other, but we all have our own collections. We all have different collecting needs, mandates, and audiences, so we're rarely in competition with each other. We all have the same end goal of Holocaust education and remembrance.
[Is there any artifact (or artifact related story\) that has particular meaning for you or that had a strong effect on you personally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7an2a2?context=5)|It's so hard to pick just one or two, which is a cop-out answer. We just had a discussion about it after reading your question.  Kyra thinks that her favorite artifact is Kiki the monkey puppet, which was used by an American liberator in France (we actually have film footage of him entertaining newly-liberated children with the puppet). Becky's favorite is a little diary written by Selma Engel in the weeks and months after she and her boyfriend Chaim escaped during the Sobibor uprising. They met and fell in love at Sobibor and escaped together (even though they didn't speak the same language). We made Curators Corner videos about these stories (because they were favorites) which you can see in the link above.  Otherwise, it's hard to pick because our relationships with the survivors and veterans are special to us apart from the collections themselves, so it's hard to separate.
[How much does it cost to maintain annually? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aoz95?context=5)|We are partially funded by the federal government and partially by private donations.  If you want the full breakdown, you can see our annual report on our website: [Link to www.ushmm.org](http://www.ushmm.org/notices/)
 |Needless to say, we're grateful to all our supporters.
[How do you feel on a human emotional level seeing , what is in essence pure evil everyday ? ( i mean the holocaust and the killings\) I guess it would be similar to being a curator of a Deathcamp museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ankc4?context=5)|To some extent, you get used to working with the subject matter--not unlike a doctor or a police officer. You don't ever forget what you're doing but it's your job and it gets easier.  We're also seeing the subject through materials donated by survivors, liberators, and rescuers which is easier than seeing it through the eyes of perpetrators. That being said, we do collect material related to Nazi perpetrators, which is a growing area of Holocaust scholarship. That is a little more difficult to work with.
[Can you explain more about that aspect of perpetrator research? I would imagine it would be a unique yet disturbing point of view. Do you buy the "" I was only doing what i was instructed to "" excuse?. And thank you for what you do BTW :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao7fc?context=5)|We have a photograph album in our collection which was the personal photograph album of the adjutant to the final commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. I (Becky) have done a lot of work with the album, and it seems like there is a lot more scholarship coming out about perpetrators. There's an understanding that we can commemorate the Holocaust, remember the victims and honor the survivors, but if we really want to PREVENT future genocides, we need to look at the people who did it and see how they and their societies got to that point. We are also doing oral histories with perpetrators, witnesses, and bystanders in Eastern Europe. Our upcoming exhibit, which opens in April 2013, is called ""Some Were Neighbors"" and is about bystanders and witnesses.
[Thank you for doing this, this is great! I wanted to ask what the demographics are of the USHMM. I ask because I work in a Holocaust museum in northeast Philadelphia and we have a very sizable non-Jewish volunteer base (I would say about 30% are not Jewish\). What percentage of the staff and volunteers at the USHMM are Jewish vs. non-Jewish?  EDIT: I'm not Jewish myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao2rq?context=5)|I'm not sure in terms of volunteers, but the staff is probably pretty evenly divided between Jews and non-Jews. 
[That's fantastic. I think that really speaks to the universality of the lessons that are learned from the Holocaust and for whom those lessons apply. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao823?context=5)|Agreed! 
[I went there last year when I was on a school trip to Washington from Ottawa and our teachers gave us a strict warning before to be as respectful as possible because of the nature of the museum, so my question is what's the most disrespectful thing you've ever seen someone say/do while in the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anjpd?context=5)|It always gets loud in the spring when we have an increase in school groups. We (and the other visitors) are always grateful when teachers have properly prepared their students.  
[Why does the museum hardly carry any Nazi ""memorabilia"" (weapons, uniforms, documents, etc\)? Is it harder to obtain pieces like that, or do you restrict certain items from the exhibit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aunv2?context=5)|The primary focus of our collection is to educate people about the Holocaust.  While some pieces of Nazi memorabilia, such as documentation and propaganda, certainly help us do this, other pieces such as weapons and uniforms are more peripheral.  These items relate much more to the military history of WWII.  We do have some examples of these items in our collection, and get offered them quite frequently, and in fact we do have a couple pieces included in our permanent exhibition.
[How do you feel about the fact that it's 2012 and we still don't have a museum on the national mall dedicated to the genocide of the Native Americans? How do other museums/curators feel about this sad fact?  Or is it simply never talked about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7av2cw?context=5)|Several people asked about why the Museum is located on the National Mall, so we’ll try to answer that. Obviously, Kyra and I are not the decision-makers in our location, but we feel strongly that having our Museum on the National Mall is important. You can read the comments here about how much the Museum has meant to people, and we feel strongly that citizens of democracies should ask difficult questions, which we think we do here at the Museum.  We use the history of the Holocaust to encourage people to question how we (as individuals and as a society) act in the world and how we deal with hatred and prejudice.
 |The [National Museum of the American Indian](http://nmai.si.edu/home/) is located on the National Mall, a few blocks from the Capitol, and if you have questions about how they present their history, I would encourage you to contact them.  We really don’t feel as though the two museums are mutually exclusive, but both are important enough to be on the National Mall.
[What's the best story of a visitor you've heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7ao4qt?context=5)|Kyra got a phone call from our information desk to come meet with visitors and it turned out be two sisters who were two Holocaust survivors who were visiting us from Canada. They brought with them their little brother's violin. He didn't survive, but the violin did (with one of the sisters in hiding).  That was a more unexpected day.
[I have a big interest in the composers and music included in (and related to\) what the Nazi's termed ""**Entartete Musik**"" (""Degenerate Music""\) -- and on a related note, I've always meant to follow up and learn more about the visual artists considered ""**Entartete Kunst**"" (""Degenerate Art""\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7awog0?context=5)|For us, the majority of the artwork in our collection was created during the time period of the Holocaust in camps, ghettos, in hiding, and in response to what was happening. We have a lot of books about degenerate art and looted art here in our library.  Please come and take a look!  We also have an [online exhibit](http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/music/) about our music collection.
[I moved to the Washington DC area fairly recently, and intend to visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum -- and wondered if there were any materials I might want to specifically look for related to either of these?  Has the museum ever done any special exhibits related to either of these topics? - or are there any planned for the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7awog0?context=5)|There are no immediate plans to do a special exhibit on either of these topics, but we do have an extensive collection of art and music.  There was a great exhibit on Degenerate Art in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. It looks like that exhibit’s catalog is online if you do a search.
[I am incredibly interested in the holocaust and always have been, and I try to go to the USHMM every time I'm in DC. Can we hear some of the best stories you guys have? Greatest stories, best reactions, most touching moments? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7arbr1?context=5)|There are so many to choose from! It’s always rewarding when we can reconnect people with their family’s history.  In 2004 at a survivor gathering in Las Vegas, Kyra received an autograph book that someone’s wife had saved in which her childhood friend Anne Frank had signed an entry.  There were photos of the two girls (Anne and Eva) together along with a third girl (Susanne).  Turned out that Susanne was someone we were already very familiar with.  Although Susanne did not survive the Holocaust, her sister Barbara did, and in 1990 Barbara had donated her family’s collection of photos.  We were able to send Barbara these newly discovered photos of her sister, and needless to say she was completely floored.
[Why are non-Jewish victims and survivors of the Holocaust always so under represented in today's memorials?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7avbjz?context=5)|There are two main reasons for why it might seem as though there is more focus on Jewish victims and survivors than on other victim groups.  First, demographically, Jews were targeted in much larger numbers and for specific ethnic reasons (the Nazis believed Jews were a distinct, degenerate race). To be honest, in one's representation of the period, the larger numbers mean more attention should be paid.
 |Second, historians rely on the source material available to them.  Many Jewish survivors came to the United States or went to Israel, and brought evidence of their experiences with them.  In contrast, the majority of handicapped victims were killed, Soviet POWs were targeted within the Soviet Union at the end of the war, and homosexuality was still a crime in Germany after the war. Roma survivors continued to be persecuted after the war. Many Polish survivors returned to Poland and were living behind the Iron Curtain. So these victims and survivors did not always have the opportunity to keep their materials or tell their stories. We would very much like to increase our ability to tell their stories through documents, testimony, and artifacts, so if you know of any materials that could help, please do contact us at curator (at) ushmm.org.
[This museum holds the most powerful exhibition I have ever seen. Whenever I go, I am most particularly struck by the train cart that Jewish people where transported in to death camps. Do you have any information as to how the museum acquired that artifact? Or any story behind it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7asugw?context=5)|The railcar is the largest artifact we have in our collection.  The Museum received it in 1989 with a fresh coat of paint on it.  We had it restored back to its original state and it was installed in the building in 1991.  The building is actually built around the railcar.
 |There are some really neat photos on our website of the day it was installed, and [a story](http://neveragain.ushmm.org/news/entry/railcar-permanent-exhibition) was just posted yesterday on our 20th anniversary website about the installation.
[Hi, not a question about the museum but about curating. I'm a college student and although my field is in education, my concentration is in history and I've always been interested in how museums operate and all the stuff involved with it to potentially one day open my own museum. What's the day to day life of being a curator, what degrees do you hold, how do you decide that you wanted to be a curator, and what advice can you give for anyone that is interested in curating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anj51?context=5)|We answer lots of emails and phone calls--we receive on average 2500 offers of collections per year and we accept about 400 of them, but we respond to everyone and try to help people find repositories for their collections if we're not to take them. We meet with people who have material and talk about their family's experiences. We make sure the collections are housed properly, do research and catalog them, and write the legal paperwork to complete the donation.  Sometimes we give presentations and answer reference questions about our collections. And today, we're on Reddit!
[When is the LA event? I'm only a few hours away! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anhji?context=5)|On Feb. 17th at the Skirball. It's a free event. Look here for more:  [Link to neveragain.ushmm.org](http://neveragain.ushmm.org/events/entry/events-losangeles)
[Do you have any veterans whether they were in the United States Army or the Red Army that helped liberate a concentration camp come in and talk about what it was like? Also do you have any artifacts from any of the G.I. camps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7aqp2v?context=5)|We do a lot of work with WWII veterans, primarily American, but also on occasion British &amp; Canadian as well.  Unfortunately, we have very little from Soviet liberators as most of that material is still in Russia.
 |Kyra has been doing a lot of work with a group of 350 American GIs who were captured as POWs and sent to Berga, a sub-camp of Buchenwald, where they had to perform forced labor. But we don’t tend to collect material from soldiers who were kept strictly in German POW camps under the Geneva Convention--but we do for soldiers (like at Berga) who were then targeted for racial or religious reasons.
[Another question, what kinds of things is the museum doing to really get across the message of the holocaust and get it to stick with people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7anlss?context=5)|We have an enormous website that we're translating into multiple languages. It's our most important portal to people who might not be able to come to Washington, and we get many more online visitors than visitors who go through the permanent exhibit.  We also have a teacher training program nationwide, have traveling exhibits, and do as much outreach as we can to communities outside the DC area.
[Hi, thank you for doing this IAMA.  One of the most moving documentaries I have ever seen on TV was done a while ago on the BBC called 'Hitler's Children'. It was about the descendents of those who were high up in the Nazi chain of command and how they tried to deal with the guilt of having such close ties with those responsible.  Have you ever had experience of people visiting your museum from the perpetrators side rather than the victims? (As in relatives/descendents trying to comprehend the scale and reasoning behind what happened\) Do you think such people would be welcomed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147ten/we_are_curators_at_the_united_states_holocaust/c7azu20?context=5)|I (Becky) haven’t seen Hitler’s Children yet, but I’m excited to see it. I know several of the people featured in the film, and I am friends with several descendants of perpetrators. As long as people come to the Museum with a sincere desire to learn about the past in the hopes of never repeating it, we welcome anyone to the Museum.

I have had interviews before, and assume most skills carry accross, however I've never had a phone interview.

Not necessarily on topics(have been lurking around this subreddit long enough to pick up on those!), but things along the lines of having a plenty of paper and a pen to hand, or particular do's and don'ts that I wouldn't have come across in a face to face interview, or even better issues, that arise out of sysadmin related interviews such as someone reading out a bash script over a phone?

Many thanks in advance!"
14btvr,32,2012-12-05,I've been lying to my parents for the past 2 years about going to school.  What should I do?,Shmeves,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/14btvr/ive_been_lying_to_my_parents_for_the_past_2_years/,"It's more complicated than what I just posted.  My life's complicated.  

I'll start from the beginning.  I graduated high school, got into a decent college, went for a year.  I didn't do so well (no motivation), failed/withdrew from a ton of classes.  So my parents and I decide that school is not right for me, and I come home to take community college courses.  
I tried every new semester to go, but after a period of about 2 weeks, I'd just start skipping, making excuses to my teachers, etc.  Eventually I'd end up not going altogether, and 'faked' my grades to my parents. 

Well, it's almost the end of the second 'year', and I decided for my last quarter I'd take the money for the college and purchase a kick-ass gaming computer (something I've always wanted).  Bad idea, I know.  

Ends up being my parents find out I spent 1,400 dollars on my bank account and I've concocted a lie about how I sold pot over the summer.  Yeah, good idea again.  

Now they want to see my bank account and other stuff to prove all this, and that I'd paid for the coming semester (more details but the gist of it).  

I'm going to have to come clean and state I have not been going to class for the past 2 years. They'll probably kick me out.  I may have a friend I can stay with for the time being, but I don't know where the hell, what the hell I'm going to do.  I'm also a volunteer firefighter (great, I know, a lying firefighter, issues there too), and would LOVE to be able to continue with my company, but I have to be within 5 miles of my towns border, and I'm certainly not going to be able to afford to live in my town (think McMansions, top 1%, CEO's, Celebrities.  Yeah, that lovely place).  I also have barely any work experience, other than a paid internship at my fathers company (as in the company he works at, not 'his'), and lifeguarding.  I don't know how I'm going to get money to pay for rent in an apartment.  

I have issues on top of all this.  I don't mind 'lying' per say.  I wish I could avoid it, but if it gets me an easier path, I'd do it (other than at the firehouse.  One place I do not tolerate it at all).  I have some sort of autism (aspergers), which somewhat explains my non-motivation.  I just don't think college is for me.  

So I've been seriously considering joining the military.  Marines, Army, whichever is better for me. I thrive under discipline.  Under orders.  I need somewhere to go.

Anyways any advice for a bonehead like me?  I'm scarred. 

EDIT: I'm 20 years old and a male if that changes/helps anything

EDIT 2:  I'd like to clarify after reading the responses.  I wasn't clear in stating what i meant by aspergers.  I've been diagnosed with it.  But I'm not saying it's BECAUSE of aspergers i'm lying, unmotivated, etc.  It's contributed some, being alienated from everyone, having next to no friends, no relationships etc.  But I do know there's something else wrong with me.  I was very elaborate with my lies keeping this a secret, making fake schedules, grades, hiding in cars while I was 'in class'.  
I've told my mother, not my dad yet (he has no empathy for pysiciatric problems).  I'm probably not going to be kicked out, and going to get help with my huge problem.  I've just always had issues with motivation.  I don't care about things other than firefighting, video games, and my family (not enough to not lie).
We'll see what happens."

[Love you guys. Listener for 5 years, VIP since Mothers' Day. I've always wondered,what the hell happened to Dina? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797ow5?context=5)|Keith: You are referring, of course, to Dina of the famed Advice with Dina segment, where our favorite drunk chain smoker heard your advice questions and she gave you advice straight with no chaser. She said work was becoming too much and she didn't have the time. I believe she became in a bad place with the death of her father and wasn't up for making coughing funnies. We'll have to check in with her. I know she got married and hated it. I think she's since been divorced but I'm just guessing.
[So, why aren't you guys more popular on Stitcher?  When you going to tell the listeners to descend onto that site to give you some upvotes?  Seriously, *Nobody Likes Onions* is easier to find on Stitcher.  WTF?  Link to stitcher.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797qwb?context=5)|Keith: I guess after I figure out what Stitcher is. I just heard about Reddit. Hit me up on LinkedIn and we'll discuss it further.  - written from my Google Circle account.
[Seriously, don't make me check if you're on LinkedIn &amp; Google+. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798kwe?context=5)|Not on those.
[How much do you make in a year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797lar?context=5)|Chemda: Our podcast sustains our lives as hosts, a separate studio for the show, and we have a staff of about 10 people including interns, full time, and part time people.
 |Our money is made mostly through our [VIP program](http://www.keithandthegirl.com/VIP) but we also have [a store\] (\[Link to www.keithandthegirl.com](http://www.keithandthegirl.com/store)) and sell (few) ads in our shows.
 |If we tell you the exact number, our lovas will find out what we make.
[Is it a struggle to make what you need to live?  Do you think it would be easier to just have a desk job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7984h8?context=5)|Chemda: There is no way that a regular desk job would work. The only reason we work well with the ""desk work"" we have now is because we know it allows us to do this for a living.
 |The struggle is that we don't know what will work for sure. We have to try a lot of things and always think ahead but that's something that is sooo worth while and, a lot of times, fun.
[I'm a big fan btw - I've been listening since episode one.  I love what you are doing and I love the message you send out.  I am just vary curious about how you make it work for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79868u?context=5)|Chemda: Best way to make it work is to always pay attention to the balance, I think. Make sure that you put in the work but also make sure that the art is there.
[What's the closest either of you ever got to quitting the show?  What made you stay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797uuj?context=5)|Chemda: It's fair to say that breaking up made us nervous about continuing the show. We didn't want to quit but for the first few months after we broke up with each other we would randomly ask the other person something like ""you still like doing this with me?"" And even when we were mad, sad and whatever else people who break up go through, the answer was always ""you are the best co-host for me.""
[Also, who was your worst guest ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797uuj?context=5)|We don't have a worst guest. We have harder times than others with guests. Sometimes even our favorite people vibe differently on the show than others. For the most part, it's a fun time. Even with guests who are more difficult. We just play off each other. It's not up to the guest to make the show its best. (We HAVE IMed each other during the show though... things like ""what the fuck is he talking about"". and then we make sure we get on course.)
[KATG! It's been so fun listening to you guys for the past 5 years. You've grown so much and introduced me to a ton of hilarious comedians. I'm a few months behind in shows, but I'm catching up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797odr?context=5)|Chemda: Thanks for listening over the years!  We have been recognized more in the past couple of years. It's fun. It's not on a big level so it's not intrusive. We like telling each other (and Lauren and Cat) when it happens.
[Who broke up with who?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797sam?context=5)|Chemda: We were broken up months before we said it out loud. Living with each other was a technicality.
 |One day one of us asked ""Are we broken up"" and the other said ""yes"".
 |It was no shocker. I'm not even sure we cried that night. That was the official end. We recorded a show about an hour later.

[Most of your guests are stand-up comics coming in through the NYC area.

 |With that said, our favorite is Reddit, and we just put all our money into it. Here we go...

Also I don't know that I'd have the time to play along. It seems like his episodes go on for days. I need him out the studio the minute we say goodbye.
[Would either of you ever quit the show if your significant others grew tired of how much of your private lives you share with the audience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797q1p?context=5)|Keith: It's hard to answer that because you're making a whole new person up that we're with. I need to be able to tell stories of my life and see who relates. I don't need to share stories of my significant other per say, but my significant other has to understand what I do for a living, and how important being open and honest is to me.
[Chemda:  You are offered to go on tour with one band out there right now . . . .  who would it be?

[Few more questions:  - What happens to the sleeves? - How do I get to diamond status? - Is Keith sorry for what he is to be sorry for? - Do you know when a version of Siri with Myq Kaplan’s voice is coming out? - When is the next opportunity for me to staple my balls to a table for KATG?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7986rf?context=5)|I gotta breathe, baby.

 |Actually we have enough characters, right? Ok, we'll do it!
 |Chemda: Sure. Why not? I think it would be fun.
 |My character would be a princess with an all-pink castle in the clouds.
 |I would want a hand in what our characters would come off like, but, to some degree, you have to allow for some creative license.

[Chemda, you helped me have the confidence to come out after hiding my feelings for a long time. I deeply appreciate both Keith and your influence in my life over the past 6 years.   Totally unrelated question, but what products/process do you use to keep your hair so beautiful? ;\)  Also: I remember listening to you talk about your coming out process, but I was wondering if you could discuss more about first discoverying your feelings for lauren? Did you ever question your sexuality before Lauren? (this maybe could be a good Whats My Name? episode\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797tkx?context=5)|Chemda: It means a lot to me to hear that I had a positive influence on your life! Thank you for listening!  About Lauren: Both Lauren and I kept the questions flowing when we first met. We were extremely drawn to each other but made sure to not promise anything before we were ready. I think, like any other relationships, dialogue (and awesome sex) always gets you where you need to be. :)
[If I, or any fan, saw you on the street/restaurant/bar/club, what, if anything, would be appropriate to say to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798s57?context=5)|""I love you, Keith. Keith and The Girl is great, and I love you.""
[With all the extra shows under VIP, is there any plan to make KATG a production studio?

We'll see. I know I don't want to produce someone else's show, and I'm not sure how I feel about other people messing with my buttons and knobs. Enough crazy things stop working right as is when it's just me.

[How's you're standup career lately Keith? I loved the WTF show you recently did, what's Maron's garage like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79atog?context=5)|Keith: Thanks. My stand-up career is me doing stand-up once a year, and it's going great. We're approaching album #10, and I'm very excited.
 |Maron's garage is more a shed then a garage. He also might be 1/2 a hoarder, I'm not sure. But he was very nice, and we were comfortable in his shed/garage/studio.
[Where is the furthest a fan has flown in for a KATG event? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797maj?context=5)|Keith: Let's go to the globe... Probably Australia, mate. They came out for KATG events, my annual stand-up show, and our clockwise flushing toilets.
[You've done a couple a couple of episodes on Sirius/Spice channel, did you receive feedback of how well you did or didn't do? Was the intent just to widen your audience base or was there more to it such as a regular Spice gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799aqv?context=5)|Keith: It was fun. They wanted to see what we had and they were very pleased. We just got over people calling in to masturbate.
[Keith - Honest question: On average, how many days a week do you find yourself wearing sleeves?  (Alternatively, if the number is too low, how many days a month do you find yourself wearing sleeves?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799qq5?context=5)|Keith: I wear sleeves mostly when I'm out and about so that my big guns don't scare people. In the studio, I get so heated over my passion for the listener that I opt for sleeveless attire.
[What's the stupidest/most annoying thing you've had a fan do? Sending tapes of KATG to Keith's father?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798d08?context=5)|Keith: That's up there. Luckily my dad already thought of me as a dirtbag.
 |Some fans are odd in that they do things to upset us to get our attention because then we'll actually be closer.
 |It's kooky out there.
[What does monthly bandwidth cost for downloads?  What does it cost for the video feed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797tco?context=5)|Michael (tech guy): Server costs (including bandwidth) about $600/month. The video feed is over ustream so that doesn't cost us anything. We'll be hosting webcam chat parties during live shows in the future but the monthly figure I quoted should include the cost of that extra bandwidth.
[Good to know.  While that sounds like a lot, it's a lot more reasonable than anything I would have considered, particularly for a show with an audience of your size.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798d1q?context=5)|Michael: I expect 2013 to be a big year for KATG with lots of growth and new audience. We're doing things like this IAmA that should expose KATG to more people.
[Actually, a related question would be how much do you anticipate the show growing over the next few years, and how much will those costs rise as a result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798d1q?context=5)|I'm currently migrating to a new server (with SSD drives - very exciting) that should be able to handle a lot of growth, so that cost should stay the same for a while. Most of the bandwidth comes from downloads (store purchases and VIP) using Amazon S3. As they increase, the costs will increase appropriately.
[Ass-kissing moment - of all the KATG supporting characters, I think I'd want to hang out with Michael the most.  He's an appropriate balance of grounded, geeky and social.  Plus learning about the mechanics of a unique, creative industry is fascinating, to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799lqr?context=5)|Michael: That's so amazing to hear. Thank you, I'm flattered!
[Can you bring the prayer back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79a38v?context=5)|Keith: We decided that for a new listener only bad can come from it. No one new would start the show and think, ""A prayer? Yay! I'm in!"" After a poll to our listeners, we learned that those who got accustomed to it and liked it also agreed.
[Why did you break up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797sm6?context=5)|We don't reeeally know the exact why. It wasn't one thing. It was more like the differences between us that don't make it a good idea to be a couple came to the surface of our relationship and we tapped out. 
[What equipment do you use to record your show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797lcq?context=5)|Keith: We use a Mackie ProFX12 to record, our main 2 mics are Heil PR40s, and the guest mics are whatever we started with: a cheaper Sure mic or what-have-you. We slowly upgraded to these nicer things over the years. You can start with basic mixers, mics, and headphones for all under $200.
[How much  bandwidth does  your  Site/RSS feed use in a  month?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797m2t?context=5)|Michael (tech guy): The traffic we control is about 3tb. That includes traffic from the web pages, the VIP downloads, live feed and any other self hosted items.
 |Libsyn hosts the public RSS feed so I don't have bandwidth data on that. We also broadcast the live shows using ustream so I don't have those numbers.
 |We're going to be hosting a new chat program (thanks to the Kickstarter project) that'll let fans share their webcam when they chat so that'll increase things a bit more.
[What would you say the average daily impressions on the site are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798w94?context=5)|Michael: Traffic is spread out across our Facebook, Twitter, subreddit and other social media pages so it's hard to know exactly what the numbers are. I'd say overall we probably get tens of thousands of impressions a day.
[Since this started as a thing to promote Keith, what would you say really cemented the fact that this was what you wanted to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798pl6?context=5)|Before the show we: go over what we need to accomplish that day/week/month. We read/respond to emails. Keith (and sometimes Danny) go through news items for the show. We eat together. Joke around some.
[The show's made leaps and bounds in quality since when the podcasting community was new - what kind of process did you go through to improve things like sound quality? Shows seem much more organized than they were then, what is an average day pre-show like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798pl6?context=5)|Chemda: I was having so much fun doing this and was able to make a living. I think that solidified things for both of us.  The sound quality gets upgraded from time to time. We also hire people to tweak things here and again so that we can keep the quality as good as possible.
[Who is your favorite guest ever?? other then me of course  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79ab5l?context=5)|Keith: It IS you though, so...
[What has been your most favorite episode?  I know you've both said that if an episode was actually shitty you wouldn't put it up, but has there ever been one that you've seriously considered that for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798jua?context=5)|Chemda: There are moments when we wonder if we missed some jokes or explained ourselves as best we can but usually the other person helps us with our perspective.
[Hypothetical . . . . Mayor Bloomberg bans KATG from NYC   (new anti Super-Party law\) . . . . .  where do you reset up shop and continue from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c7999ua?context=5)|Keith: We start our own city SNYC (Super NYC), and no mayors are allowed. Governors are of course. We have no way around THAT law...
[Would sleeveless fleeces be the mandatory garb? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799els?context=5)|Keith: Just be you, baby. Unless you is an asshole.
 |Chemda: That would be up to the town meeting.
[What is your 5 year plan? Is your ultimate goal to be broadcast on terrestrial radio or satellite, or do you prefer to remain web-based?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797udq?context=5)|Keith: No 5-year plan per say. Just to keep growing our audience. As for radio, if the audience, money and care is right, we'll look into almost anything, but I am liking it this way so far.
[Is next year really going to be the last year of the April 15th week? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797n8z?context=5)|Keith: Every April 15th I have been doing my big stand-up show. This next one will be 10 years. I'm debating about it being the last one, but who knows. Regardless, they'll always be live events for people to come out to, and I don't see April 15th Week being any exception.
[How can fans truly help make your show more popular/successful.   Getting the word out / telling co-workers about it doesn't always work/help.   Living in NYC, I am sure I can do something to help as this would be probably the biggest fan base.   Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798mrh?context=5)|Chemda: Everything helps. Talking about us, posting comments on websites, facebook, twitter (use #KATG). Also, wearing our shirt, handing out stickers, inviting people to our events (online or otherwise). The marathon will be in January. It's a good opportunity to have friends listen and ask them to subscribe on iTunes. Send people your favorite episode... whatever you do to spread the word is GREAT!
[In the last year or so, a good portion of the daily show has become talking about your other content i.e.VIP, and as a (sadly\) non-VIP member, I wanted to ask, do you think that putting your creative energy into paywalled content has reduced the main show? Do you fear that you could end up pushing the VIP so far that you start losing quality/viewers from the main show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79a4ly?context=5)|Keith: Not at all. You're understandably jealous that you aren't part of KATG VIP. But how often do we really talk about VIP programming? And when we do, why WOULDN'T you want to hear about it a little? We tell you a little more about Danny, we told you why cabbies don't pick up black people like they do white people... It's still interesting even if you can't hear the whole show.
 |Don't be jealous. Are you missing out? Of course you are. But we're trying our best to include you.
[What the hell happened to Cursing Michael? Also, how many interns are there that we never really get to hear from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799w6d?context=5)|Cursing Michael is in school and is doing his thing.
 |Interns have come and gone that have not been mentioned on the show. We don't/can't talk about everything that happens in the studio. Sometimes, they don't want to be talked about. 
[Hey!  I've had you guys in my ear 5 days a week for going on 7 years now, you're pretty much a fixture in my life and I feel like I know you better than I know some family members.  Is it a weird feeling knowing that so many strangers know so many intimate details of your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c797os4?context=5)|When we have live shows, we get to talk to a bunch of listeners. They often quote the show, mention a personal story that we shared, and/or try to shock us by bringing up intimate material we shared with them on the show. Most people then follow it up with something like, ""is it weird that I know so much about you?""
 |Nope. It's not weird. I love it. You know me. You listen to my show. And you came to my event.  It's flattering and wonderful.
 |PS Thanks for working with my brother to help put our subreddit together.
 |Keith: It's not weird. I'm sharing personal things that I wouldn't necessarily share with my family. You know me better than they do also.
[Hey guys!  Love the show but sadly stopped listening a couple years back.  When I was subscribed I know there was a pretty tight community of those on the chat and the forums.  How do you feel about the relationship you have with your listeners as well as how your show has sculpted their relationships with other another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799xse?context=5)|Keith: I think everything is only bigger and better.

[Brumski?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c79804r?context=5)|Keith: No brumski.

Can you imagine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c799ns0?context=5)|Michael: Fun fact: Reddit plays a trick with the upvote/downvote numbers to throw off spammers and people who create fake accounts so they won't know if their vote was registered or not. Reddit will fake the up/down vote number for each person but the overall number is always the correct.
 |So we might have more or less down votes than you're actually seeing.

[I guess this is more for Micheal:  do you guys host off a vps, a dedicated server or are you in the ""cloud"".  What business need dictated your choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1428fc/weve_been_making_a_living_from_podcasting_for/c798k22?context=5)|Michael: It's a mix of dedicated server and cloud. The website, databases and chat run on a dedicated server. The new server will be more than twice as powerful with SSD drives. I like dedicated vs VPS or cloud because of disk IO (hence the move to SSD). VPS and Cloud have terrible disk drive latency and don't work well for things like a database.
 |We use Amazon S3 for the store downloads, VIP and any other large file downloads. S3 is perfect for things like that.

So this is my second year at my university, and from a company at a career fair who I chatted with and gave my resume to, I received an email, which led to a phone interview soon.

I'm really excited because I have a strong resume. I have some technical experience (school project, past research internship), lots of work experience at various jobs, lots of involvement in clubs with strong positions, strong communication skills, etc. None of it is made up, either, I can back it up.

The only thing I'm nervous about is my GPA :(. Since I'm a transfer, none of my grades transferred, only my credit. As a result, last year was rough, and I got B's and C's, which leaves me at about a 2.75 major GPA. Yeah, i know it's low, but our chem e program is rough. 

I'm working my hardest to raise it, and it really border-line depresses me, but I'm staying positive and working really hard.

So I know this company is going to ask me about my GPA, especially because I left it off my resume, and I'm almost certain they have a minimum GPA requirement. Do I have a chance, with my strong resume and experience?

TL; DR: I have a strong resume, but low GPA, because chemical engineering is hard. What do I say when they ask about GPA, do I have a chance?"
14eqlp,1,2012-12-06,To pursue fancy office job? Or follow my dream of being a writer?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14eqlp/to_pursue_fancy_office_job_or_follow_my_dream_of/,"Hi redditors,  

A little background: a couple years ago I was kind of lost in life (I had an undergrad degree but no job). My true dream is to be a writer but I felt it wouldn't pay the bills, so I picked a random degree to pursue and got into a prestigious school.  
Earlier this year I completed it, receiving  a Masters, plus internship experience with the Government and being part of a student group.   

I'm extremely shy and like being alone, and don't do very well with adults/authority figures/bosses and I get very nervous doing presentations or meetings/interviews. (In school I skipped several presentations in exchange for a lower mark, but still got top marks).   

This past summer I must have sent out over 70 resumes looking for jobs and didn't get a single call back. Over this period, I convinced myself that I don't want an office job because of the stress, the meetings, waking up early every day, etc. I partly feel this resistence to having an office job is what caused the lack of callbacks (as it showed in my cover letters/resumes)

My true dream is to be a writer, although I've been writing for years and haven't really produced anything that I'm willing to let others read (although, now I'm sure with more free time and less grad school, I can put more effort in).  

What I'm scared of is letting my degree go to waste, and not using my brain to help the workforce. I don't want to take a year to write, only to fail and try to join the workforce with an out-of-date degree and no experience.     
Also, I told my sister about my dream of being a writer and she laughed in my face, destroying my confidence.  

There is a perfect job posting for me and the date closes in a week. I know if I applied myself, I could probably get it...but I don't want a job I *may* enjoy, helping me come out of my shell (and getting used to office life), if it means leaving no time for my writing.   

What's scarier? Missing a career opportunity? Or not pursuing your dream?
 
tl;dr: I have a masters degree but thinking about getting an office job kills my soul. I want to be a writer but I'm too afraid of failing to pursue this dream.


Any advice/words of encouragement? Has anyone else resisted good jobs with pay/benefits to pursue a risky dream?"

I worked up the courage to talk ti my boss about my plans who told he would but they are restructuring the org and he has to wait until next year with a new director. I was a little disappointed but moved on to my next point of getting hired outside the org. I asked him for advice since our work is hard to get into, hoping he'd offer to forward my resume to his high level contacts. He urged me to write a rec for myself that he would look over and set up a LinkedIn so that we could connect. It's not what I wanted and now I feel used and cheated. What can I say so he knows what I want without being too presumptuous? I've put in a lot of hours here and if it doesn't become fruitful, ill feel my life was wasted."

14egpg,47,2012-12-06,I just blew an interview for the best opportunity I've had in a while. What are your interview horror stories?,cantaloupes,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14egpg/i_just_blew_an_interview_for_the_best_opportunity/,"I just interviewed for an internship at a very prominent international cyber security and enterprise software firm. My resume includes that I have experience running and terminating Cat 5e cable (which is true). However, this experience is almost all with termination at (color coordinated) patch panels and wall jacks, hardly any at actual RJ-45 heads. So what happens during the interview? They gave me a cable to terminate, and I could not at all remember the Type B pin-out. So yea, I blew it because of my stupidity and lack of foresight to PRACTICE what I said I could do on my resume. I guess the good part is now I'm sure I'll never ever forget the pin-out again.

With that said, what are your shitty interviewing experiences in the sysadmin world? This applies to both interviewees and interviewers.

UPDATE:

I'm unsure if any one will even see this but I finally got word back expressing that I did not get the internship. I feel pretty terrible right now, as so far this was by far the BEST opportunity for learning new stuff I've ever seen offered to potential interns. So with that said, anyone know of any openings in Orlando? :D"
14e1ln,19,2012-12-06,"Apply for desktop team job, or go somewhere else?",KptKrondog,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14e1ln/apply_for_desktop_team_job_or_go_somewhere_else/,"Currently I'm an Intern for a small-ish medical group with the IS department...I was brought in (I thought) to work with the sharepoint team on building the site and learning sharepoint, however that's been a total flop. The sharepoint admin quit within the first month and took a contract way out of state, then the network admin quit about 2 months later. They've hired people for both positions now, but I'm not getting anything to do...I've been stuck with the desktop team helping them do things (99% of it is carrying things or putting new items in inventory). They've got a big job coming up and we were going to have to image a bunch of PC's (like 25-30) and I thought ""great, I'll finally get something to do""...except they won't give me admin access to the program, so I can't even do that. Basically, I sit at my desk all day and open the door (have to have an rfid card to get through the door) for UPS/fedex or random people, and read reddit/do sudoku puzzles. I constantly ask for things to do, and they offer me little 5 minute jobs, but never anything that takes any time. I'm pretty confident I'm losing every bit of knowledge I gained while getting my CS degree (I graduated a year ago).

their head desktop support guy just took another job with a big pay increase, so his position is open...basically, it involves installing equipment for people, getting replacement equipment, imaging PC's, etc...nothing complicated really. They ask for 1 year experience on the job posting...this is my first ""job"", and I've been here 6 months. The advantage I have is that I already know everyone and I know/am familiar with many of the projects they are already working on...so I wouldn't have to learn as much as a completely new guy.

HOWEVER, as it is, I'm bored to tears. I went to school to program/develop software, not to install PC's and monitors and order new stuff. I've read a few posts on reddit saying to avoid desktop teams at all costs, because they are dead-end jobs...I don't know what the pay would be, but I'm sure it would be an increase (12/hr now as intern with no benefits...still on parents insurance, etc).

Would I be better off to stop now and get a couple certifications, or try for the job and do that eventually? I mean, would I have a chance landing a programming job with 6 months experience as an intern with minor sharepoint knowledge, a degree in CS, and knowing java?

the only thing I'm leery about not trying to get it, is that I have so little job experience, I'd have to start fresh again. 


and if I didn't go for the job/didn't get it, what certs would be recommended to get to help?

after reading my post, I think my mind is made up, I just haven't admitted it yet. I'm thinking my best option will be to find a job wherever I can programming and move there, because where I'm at limits me pretty badly."

A bit of background first,you may want to skip it,they are not THAT necessary.

I am a college student.I started in social sciences but found that it was not my path,so I have turned to something else which I had small previous experiences of:Programming.

So,I will be changing programs next year to a 3 year program in computer science,which will basically teach me how to build a computer,a bit of network and programming,which will then become more programming heavy,and at my last term,I will be doing an internship in a company. 

That's my CS program in a nutshell.





Anyway,there's a bit of background if you guys need it.

I cannot start my new program until next year,and I will be getting my math classes to be able to attend it over the next term.Since I will not be having a lot of classes(and a month long break before that!)I will be starting to learn some programming on my own.

NOTE:I have already tried to learn a bit of C++,and I did,but I have not gotten very far with it,since I was struck by my endterm exams and a rough breakup.Instead of learning C++ right away,I have thought of learning C# to grasp the logic of programming since learning C++ as a first language was pretty hard.

I bought the Head First C# book to learn C# as my first language while I am on Winter break and would like some advice about it:

-what should be a decent time to get pretty familiar with the C# language?I think a month should be enough to read all the book,I might be overestimating myself tough.
-Should I hop on C++ when I am done with C#?(gotten familiar with it)

NOTE:I plan to spend 1hour+ a day programming,every day.





Also,I want to eventually get into the gaming industry after going to university.(college CS -&gt; University CS -&gt; gaming insustry)

Any veterans here could be giving me tips on what path to choose?

Thanks in advance for your feedback guys!(should I xpost this to r/gamedev?)

I attended a 2 year community college to just get something under my belt, computer security and forensics associates degree. When I graduated high school I couldn't go away, there was no way in hell, I had so much anxiety I thought my heart was going to fail. Since then I've gotten better. But in addition to SA I've also got regular anxiety issues, and the idea of racking up massive amounts of debt scares the shit out of me. Fuck I'm already in debt from the 2 year degree.  

My resume is not spectacular. All the employers might see is an incompetent kid that is lazy. Meanwhile I've been struggling with this mental problem for most my life, and it's only been recently that I've been able to get better. Not fair, but life isn't fair so I'm not gonna complain about that, I just have to do something. 

I was planning on going into the IT field. I don't love computers, but it's really the only thing I'm good at. I tried learning to program, but either it didn't interest me enough or the depression destroyed my ability to focus. Right now I'm looking for an internship, but I feel like they only want people with a bachelor's degree.

So yeah I'm not sure if I should go back to school. I'm semi-functional at this point, and as far as I've come with SA, going away to college would just send me over the edge. I was talking to my uncle and he said that getting a bachelor degree would pay off in the long term. I just don't know. He likes money, a lot. I just want to live comfortably.

I believe that experience is way more important than just having a degree that says you are qualified. I'm sure it helps, but it's a shitload of money. Obviously someone with a 4 year degree and experience trumps anything. I don't know anymore, I feel like I fucked up over the years and now that I'm getting better I wish I felt this way 4 years ago. Fuck it all.

I'm 23 years old, by the way.

Credit-wise, I'll be a junior after this semester is done. I'm hoping to find any kind of software development related job or internship. I've been in college for a while, changed schools and majors a few times before finally deciding that i want to be a software engineer. My Major is Computer Information Systems, since my school doesn't offer pure Computer Science.

So far, relevant classes I've taken are Intro Programming, OOP, and Data Structures (currently taking) all using C++. Next semester I am taking Programming Languages, Algorithms, Networking, Database Systems in Criminal Justice, Data Communications and the Internet.

I've been using C++ in class for one year and i'm currently learning C# on my own time. I don't have any professional experience, or major projects. Except for my current professor (who is going to get me working on some projects for the school once i know more .Net), my other professors have not been very good and haven't assigned much HW or any projects. I know that is not a good excuse and I should have been working on my own projects, I just have not been able to think of many. All I have are a couple simple console apps in C++ and C#. I took a class that used Java in high school, but I haven't used it since and I don't remember it. I also know some HTML that I learned when I was younger.

In the resume I linked to, it looks like I have an employment gap since 2009, but I've been working part-time as a doorman since the summer of 2009, and I'm still there now. However, I don't have a regular schedule, i'm just a relief guy, so basically whenever someone needs a day off they call me.

Sorry again for the wall of text.

**TL;DR:** I really enjoy programming and solving problems, I just have trouble coming up with project ideas and my school's program is not very good. I pretty much don't have any hobbies either except for browsing reddit and playing video games (I know, find a hobby!), but I'm hoping to get an arduino for christmas to play with. If you could take a look at my [resume](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3Y749kliFS_VURxa2cxeTVEa3M) and give me advice, criticism, tips, anything at all, I would greatly appreciate it!

Thanks for reading!

EDIT: I forgot to mention, my GPA is not good, just north of 2.0, however my GPA in my major is a 4.0 so far.

EDIT #2: Well that escalated quickly. Thanks for the advice, guys. I'll try to just practice coding and finding personal projects to work on in the meantime."

14hxh3,56,2012-12-08,Looking to break into web development industry - advice?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/14hxh3/looking_to_break_into_web_development_industry/,"Hey everyone, 

Thanks for clicking on the link. I graduated with a BA in Political Science this year, and while I was initially considering law school, I've had a change of heart. The market for liberal arts majors is unfriendly at best and instead of being a depressed lawyer with debt, I thought I should at least try to experiment with a skill that is in high demand: programming. It turns out that I love to program and to solve problems, and so I'm keen to enhance this skill while I'm still relatively young (23). 

Specifically, I’m attracted to front-end web development or simply web development in general. I’ve always had a good eye for clean design, though I’ve never had a chance to exercise this with my education. 

I’ve been using many of the available online resources. I’m currently caught-up with CS50x, which is the introductory CS course on edx.org (which teaches C and touches on a few other languages).  I’m about 20% the way through the HTML &amp; CSS, and JavaScript courses on codeacademy.com, and I’ve been learning Python on the side. I’ve heard that Ruby and Ruby on Rails are the go-to languages of the moment, but I’ve yet to look into these.

However, this has only given me a beginner’s acquaintance with a handful languages, and this doesn’t give me nearly enough exposure to begin an entry level position or even an internship in a web development position. How can I accelerate my learning process? I’ve heard of courses such as Dev Bootcamp, which seems great (it’s supposed to land you an entry-level job at the end of 9 weeks), but the cost is prohibitive - $12,000. There are others that exist as well: Starter League in Chicago, Catalyst in San Francisco, and many others. Most of these seem to cost at least $6,000 - $8,000 with varying levels of employment success. If anyone has gone through one of these rapid, exhaustive classes, I’d love to hear from your experience. 

So, my main goal is to gain the necessary skills to be an employable web developer. How can I approach this task in the most logical and efficient way? I’d love to take an internship along the way to get my feet wet. I’m also wondering if web development skills can be exclusively self-taught, or if I should seek some alternative methods (hacker space, etc.)? 

Thanks a lot, /r/webdev, I appreciate it.

tl;dr Graduated with a liberal arts degree, with which finding quality positions is nigh impossible. I love programming, and am looking for good guidance to quickly but carefully gain the necessary web development skills to break into the industry.

However, it's hard to find motivation now. It's currently finals week at my university and I'm sitting here studying and I keep thinking fuck is the point if this. I guess it would be nice to have some degrees (I'm a dual major), but don't I already have what the degrees are supposed to supply.
 |On the other hand I will definitely use what I have learned and will learn.
[Yes, but should anything go wrong with the business, It would be nice to have the degrees to fall back on. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7ctckz?context=5)|Exactly, it's an expensive security blanket.

It's more laid back as the investment is more long-term.
 |Meetings make me nervous.
[How so in the art business? Like you find an artist and are all like ""Muddafucka we want your PAINTINGS!""? How does that work long term? Like a gallery? O.o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cubl1?context=5)|Yes.

[I'm a diamond broker. In the past 4 years, I have seen stones under the 1 carat mark depreciate quite fast with the economy falling (customers selling for cash thus increasing supply and dropping prices\). How have assets in art performed in the last half decade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cttkt?context=5)|Art is a strange strange business.

[What exactly does an art investor do on a day-to-day basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cu0kh?context=5)|Gallery openings on gallery openings on gallery openings.
[Now it all makes sense to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cuehv?context=5)|Not really, it's just we get invited to tons of gallery openings as artists want us to buy their art, because if people see an investment firm buying an artist's work then they buy it thinking that the value will go up over the next few years.
[So you have 10 Million in Art assets, and your Revenue stream comes from booking venues, setting up galleries at different locations, and selling tickets to said venues.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cuehv?context=5)|The way we make money is we see value in a piece or an artist, buy, and then sell later when the market is willing to pay more for such a piece.
[Cool line of work. I am sure you will do great. Just have confidence.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cuehv?context=5)|Hope that explains it better.

 |It's a learning process and the company knows this.
[What is your plan to deal with the existing management in the company?  I'm going to guess there are many older men who have been with your father's company for some time, and they might not be excited about having 20 year old telling them what to do. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7ct1p5?context=5)|Although they may not love the idea, they have been expecting the takeover. 
[Rudy Giuliani spoke at my graduation and something that really stuck with me is when he became mayor (I'm not trying to start any political debates, so please don't take this the wrong way\), he knew how to handle most of what was on his plate, but there was a sizable amount of things that he did not know how to handle, for example, the NYC economy. For the voids of knowledge or for things he didn't know how to handle, he would go to somebody who he could trust and back their advice.  Don't pretend like you're going to know everything about the business and future plans. Nobody expects you to. What they do expect you to do is to carry your father's legacy. How you do that is up to you, and your father obviously believed that you could handle it.  Oh, a question... Is there anything we can do to help you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14gbzu/iama_20_yo_student_that_just_took_over_a_10/c7cttmo?context=5)|As for helping me, do you like contemporary art?

[What bottles are extremely overpriced and underrated?    What drinks should i concoct that would melt the panties offa girl?   Finally, do you have any hobo/hopster stories that you wouldn't mind sharing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddt6a?context=5)|2.). Bourbon.  Don't drink Makers or Bulliet.  Makers is a wheated whiskey, so it's very sweet, soft, and even the distiller says it's a whiskey for beginners(pretentious liquor store guy alert), but it's overpriced.  If you want to try something sweeter try out Four Roses.  Cheaper than both are Buffalo Trace and Elijah Craig 12 year.  Anyone who has ever said they like bourbon, and hasn't tried both of those, is doing themselves a **MAJOR** disservice. For mid-20s they are great options, the Buffalo has a bit more character and the EC is buttery smooth. Also, give the Evan Williams Single Barrel a try, it's a total steal of a price, incredibly smooth, and most people avoid it for the name.  I'd also highly recommend Eagle Rare, for a $30 bourbon they could sell it for a lot more.  I also prefer Woodford over Knob.  The dirty little secret for bourbons is that most of them all come from the same distilleries and even the same mash a lot of times, the differences are where the barrels are aged in the warehouse and the how they are blended to give them a distinct taste.  Dirty little secret part 2.  If you need bottoms shelf whiskey for your party, or two make whiskey sours or gingers, at the very least get Old Crow or Evan Williams. Seagrams 7 and most other bottom shelf stuff is a blended whiskey, they are literally only 25% whiskey, the rest is basically shitty vodka.  They list the ratio on the bottles, blew my mind the first time I saw 20% Straight Whisky 80% Neutral Grain Spirits on a bottle.
[What drinks will impress the snobbiest spirit enthousiast? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddt6a?context=5)|So first off, all drink choices depend on if you're mixing of drinking it straight.  Don't spend over $20 on a fifth EVER if you're mixing with soda or juice.  You can't tell the difference.  Now if you are making a true cocktail, a drink that is meant to show off the wonderful properties of a spirit, like a Martini, or a Manhattan, then it's ok to spend money. Your drinks will only be as good as the cheapest ingredient.  Also, side not.  American made Rye whiskey's!  They are a classic, my actual prefered drink to tell you the truth.  A true Manhattan is made with a rye, the sweet vermouth compliments the extra heat perfectly.  Rye's are spicier and hotter, but some can still be nice and sweet, like Jim Beam Rye.  Old Overholt is a classic and under $20.  Bulliet Rye may be expensive but if it's on sale I'll buy it.  I hear the Wild Turkey Rye used to be much better.  R(1) is expensive and very hot.  The Knob Creek Rye is one of the best spirits I've ever had, if it makes sense, I just feel happy drinking it.  Two of the best bangs for your buck in all the spirit world is Rittenhouse Rye and Sazerac Rye.  They are under $25, but taste so much more expensive.  For this reason they can be hard to find, fancy bars have pretty much snatched up all the current supply, and their distillers like to focus on different whiskys, so the limited amount that does get released to the public usually gets snatched up by the case by the bar or lucky whisky enthusiast.  Definitely worth a shot (pun intended).
[Can you drop some dirty liqour secrets? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddt6a?context=5)|1.). Tequila: The rule of thumb with tequila is always buy 100% agave. The dirty little secret with mixed tequilas like Cuervo is that about half of it are sugars they throw in that ferment with the agave.  In a taste test with a pure agave tequila they will taste like shit, and they increase your odds of a hangover.  Avoid Patron.  Anyone who claims theay are a tequila enthusiast and orders Patron doesn't know shit.  Instead for about half the price, get Milagro, Cazadores, or if it's on sale, Gran Centenario.  The Corralejo's are all underpriced, quite tasty and come in beautiful tall bottles.  If you are willing to spend $50 on a fifth of tequila try out Corzo or El Tesoro. Chinaco Anejo is also fantastic.  My panty melting drink?  A Hawaiin Sea Breeze(also known as a Bay Breeze).  Basically as much vodka as youd prefer over ice(usually in a tall glass you do about 3 oz max, but you dont work at a bar so add as much as youd like,) then equal parts cranberry and pineapple juice. Garnish with a lime wedge for extra class.  It's the easiest going down drink I've ever had, it's scary good. You can even make it with the cheapest vodka and never know the difference, so it's good for parties when you want everyone to get shitfaced.
[Thank you for putting Tequila and Bourbon first. You certainly got my attention. And your responses ring true. People always look at me like I'm an idiot when I pan Patron. But Cazadores is one of my all time favorite anythings. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dx8v3?context=5)|I've done taste tests with Patron, Milagro, and Cazadores, and found that Patron has this chemically aftertaste.  I mean it's smooth and clean, but that's not what you necessarily want from tequila.
[I consider patron to be the single biggest marketing success/scam in the booze industry. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhzs7?context=5)|#2 is Grey Goose.
[Roundish bottle of tequila, Chinaco?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dimkw?context=5)|That's the one!  My god it is amazing stuff.
[Inspired by this, I just went to the liquor store to buy a bottle of Monopolwa, and was told it's been discontinued by the distributor.  Not sure if that's true, but if so, it's too bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7eoo76?context=5)|They spend $0 on ads and marketing, and it's the number one seller in our store.  We still have it, and looking on the google it still looks like its in business.  Give the lukowasa a try if they have that, it's basically Monopolova that's still made in Poland.
[JD *used* to be good years ago, when it was 90-proof.  That's why it's so famous.  Then they dropped it to 86, and then they dropped it to 80-proof.  May as well drink SoCo.  Link to www.petitiononline.com.  Now I drink Beam Black or Evan Williams Single Barrel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dp3ra?context=5)|Ha, most of those big boys used to be 100 proof.  We have a few antique bottles (not for sale) of Jim Beam white 100 proof that are in large, toy car bottles.  Taxes are higher per barrel if the proofage is higher, hence the overall drop in proofage. (Wild Turkey stayed true though!)
[Yes to Gin. Recently found Aviation and think it's great. Looking to try more of the Oregon gins, but any thoughts re. hierarchy of Oregon's best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dl0oy?context=5)|They are all slightly different but I'd say Old Tom Ransom&gt;Aviation&gt;Crater Laker&gt;Merrylegs Genever&gt;New Deal No.1&gt;Desert Juniper&gt;Organic Nation&gt;This new stuff that just came out from the same people that do D.L Franklin vodka&gt;New Deal No. 3(I don't like London dry at all but this is good stuff)
[3 is Absolut.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ed291?context=5)|Another big ripoff for sure.
[As a pole Grey Goose makes my blood boil.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dn2zu?context=5)|You guys do great work.  I love the buffalo grass vodka, I'd love to have an opportunity to try some of your other local herb infused vodkas.
[I'm not really a tequila guy and even I like Chinaco! It's not the cheapest (especially the Anejo\) but it's quality.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7djrf5?context=5)|I've found the best spirits are like that.  The only reason a lot of people don't like a particular spirit is because they've had a bad experience with a bad bottle.  I used to think I hated gin and then I found a particular style that I really dig.
[Yep, if I'm drinking beer at the bar and want a shot, or if I am drinking my whiskey neat, I usually drink Wild Turkey.  (I drink Beam Black or EW when at home, neat\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dsu7x?context=5)|If you like the Wild Turkey, try the Old Grandad Bonded in Bond.  If you haven't had it, give Buffalo Trace a try as well.
[Will do, thanks!  I've seen the Grandad before (I sometimes drink their standard label\) and wondered about it.  Will look for the Buffalo Trace.  Unfortunately, I live in Flint, MI, so most places keep the booze behind the bullet proof glass with the employees which makes it hard to browse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dt39t?context=5)|Oh man, if you haven't tried the Buffalo yet...it's my daily drinker and what really got me into bourbon.
[What if I was buying my old-white-90$ bottle of scotch-buying-grandfather something for christmas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dqqy7?context=5)|Does he like the taste of scottish bog, or is he more into sweet and smooth?  The thing about scotch is it's different regions produce wildly different scotches.
[I agree 100% regarding Johnnie Walker/Chivas. I watch it fly off the shelves because people don't know any better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dgwii?context=5)|That's the overall attitude I do my best to fix.  People stick with the stuff they see advertised and hear about in pop culture, and I'll tell you the more heavily advertised it is the more it's rubbish.
[He drinks a lot of Johnny Walker Blue, tbh I don't really know a ton, except that he likes alcohol. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dugu9?context=5)|Reason #20124 why Richard Nixon is an evil asshole.  His drink of choice was JW blue mixed with ginger ale.  A $200 + bottle of whiskey mixed with a $.50 soda *shudders*
 |It's gonna be really smooth, maybe smokey stuff.  I'd say maybe give the Tallisker a try.  It's pretty unique, a bit dark and smokey, but it's not like you have a mouthful of scottish bog like the Islays.  Though if you ask if he like's Islays and he says yes, any of the Obans, Lagulvins, and Adrbergs are more than acceptable.
 |The nice thing about expensive scotch is that it's pretty much all good.
[Disagree on kaluha. The off versions are bad. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e3btq?context=5)|I see your point, but I'm typically making white and red russians with my coffee liquors and find it hard to tell the difference in mixing, so I prefer to spend half the price.
[As an Eastern European who has been drinking vodka since childhood, Russian Standard? Really? I always thought it tasted like ass straight, and if you want to mix any Smirnoff or stoli will do for that price (we may have different prices in canada\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dr7zn?context=5)|Smirnoff ($15 in Oregon) to me is the very epitome of a mixing vodka.  It's not bad, but you can get stuff of the same quality for $5 less.  That's about the general rule with most big brand names.  And depending on sale, Stoli is $20-25 in Oregon, and there's local stuff for the same price that I heartily endorse.
 |Ha, anytime someone comes in speaking some eastern European language, 9/10 they get Russian Standard.
[In Perth, Western Australia JW Black will be at best on sale price for ~$45, Chivas can regularly be around $60 whereas I'm now finding some single malts to be $35-$40. There's no contest there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnasj?context=5)|It's time for you to take advantage of all the uneducated drinkers that surround you.
[Do you carry Everclear? Is it a big seller? Last question, Has anybody asked you how to make a molotov cocktail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dg484?context=5)|We do, most people purchase it for tinctures, cleaning, or other random things(at least I believe there reasons because most people buying it are perfectly normal.) In Oregon it has to be behind the counter because too many stupid college kids have died drinking it. And no, I havent dispensed any homemade weapon advice sad to say.
 |Related story about stupid college kids:  This young guy comes in, he asks about drinking everclear.  I tell him it's a bad idea, he asks about the next highest proofage thing(everclear btw, is 190 proof). I direct him to the 151 proof rums, and he tries to get me to explain everyone in great detail, when all I can tell him is that they burn like hell for more than few minutes, get you drunk quick, and while they were my drink of choice in my escape from mormonism, I would not recommend it.  He gets the cheapest one and walks out a happy 21 year old.
[As someone that used to kill half to a full bottle of Everclear a day mixed with ice and a packet of lemonade, it is definitely the best bang for your buck.  Advice to the new drinker: don't over drink, detox/recovery sucks ass, believe me.Thanks for the insight on hype vs value OP.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dq36o?context=5)|Your poor liver, but I understand.  Before I worked at a liquor store my drink of choice was a double shot of 151 rum.
[What is your opinion on Everclear? I personally can't even stand the smell of it, but do you think that with proper usage, a tasty cocktail could be made with it? Oh, is there a liquor you sell that you absolutely hate to death? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnbq1?context=5)|Everclear can be used in certain cocktails, but it's mostly for kicks, giggles, and to get you fucked up.  It's kind of the equivalent of painting someones portrait with a paint gun, it's just not the right tool for the job even if it involves the same ingredients in theory.
 |I hate selling Patron, especially when someone brings up shitty margarita mix as well.  I hate selling Grey Goose, especially when someone brings up soda or juice.  And I hate selling Jack Daniels.
[Is it because those drinks are overrated, or because your pallets doesn't agree with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnmjo?context=5)|Edit:  My bad, wrong response.  Those drinks aren't bad, but they are overpriced and a lot of people seem to buy them so they can impress people by dropping some cash.  And Jack Daniels to me says someone isn't willing to venture out of their comfort zone and try some really special bourbons that are cheaper than Jack.
 |Everclear is basically industrial strength alcohol, it is not meant to be dranken in cocktails, it's for medicinal purposes, or infusing and creating liqueurs like Limoncello and Coffee liqueur.
[Have you ever sold to a pregnant woman knowing she was gonna get drunk? Are you able to turn down to people? If so, how do you go about it? Have you ever let an adult (18-20\) get away with a fake id? Whats your personal thoughts on the drinking age at 21?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7df3id?context=5)|Luckily no pregnant women buying for themselves(at least that's what they claimed, and they seemed classy enough.) I have accepted fake id's before, but ive also kicked people out for not having their ID's and looking young as well.
[Seems as though you prefer sweeter mixed drinks. If I were going that way, a French 75 would be my drink of choice. Or maybe a Sidecar. If I'm getting a mixed drink for myself it's almost always a straight Gin Martini (there is no other kind, in my opinion\) or a Death in The Afternoon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhfei?context=5)|My personal drink of choice is bourbon, neat, one rock on the side. If I have to mix it then I like sazeracs, manhattans, and the Boulevadier. But most people like sweet drinks loaded with booze, hence the Hawaiin Sea Breeze recommendation.
 |You have a fine taste in drinks.  This pretentious liquor store guy nods his head in approval.
[Isn't a sazerac a really old school drink? What, if you can say, can you describe the flavors of that drink as? Also, what do you think of bartenders as a profession? It seems that they went from a respected position in the early 20th century, to pretty much anyone who thinks they can mix a few drinks. Also, do you watch ""Drinking made Easy"" or ""Three sheets""? Lastly, can I get a hipster story you haven't told yet? Oh and do you ever get laid by means of working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnawd?context=5)|Kind of, as bourbon has made a comeback, bourbon cocktails have as well.  The sazerac uses a splash absinthe, which taste a lot like black licorice.  Plus it has a bit of citrus zest that combines will nice with some good bitters for a kind of licoricey, refreshing whisky drink.  I can't say I've seen those videos in particular, I mostly just practice stuff from the bar tenders black book and look up more info on the web and talk to bartenders.
 |Only three girls as a direct result of working there.
[Can you offer any suggestions on Oregon made liquors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7devy3?context=5)|One of the best parts about living in Oregon are all its awesome local products.  In terms of whiskey they all are different style, but a dirty little secret is they are distilled outside of the state and bottled in oregon(doesn't make them any less delicious). My personal fav is the Big Bottom Whisky out of Hillboro, a good mix of boldness and flavor. The Burnside Bourbon is also great, spicy and aggressive like a rye.  I'd say the CW Irwin is incredibly smooth and a favorite of everyone and actually distilled in Bend.  The Temperance Traders a sweet alt to Bulliet. Stay away from Rogue.
[Good deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7devy3?context=5)|Crater Lake makes both excellent gin and vodka, both I'd highly recommend for gifts.  Bengeminz is a fun vodka made from corn, very sweet and smooth and meant to be drunk straight.  New Deal makes a great ginger liquor, and their vodkas are nice(I prefer the Portland 88, it's a vodka for people who like vodka).
[Must try?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7devy3?context=5)|Aviation Gin is superb, they have some expensive but amazing rum, vodka, and coffee liquor.
[Cool. Thanks. This beats typical cliche gifts from Made in Oregon for my out of town friends/family.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfa8j?context=5)|I do what I can. I only recommend things I believe in and would buy myself.

For a big name former celebrity owned tequila, it's actually really good. Same with Avion, both surprised me.
[Does Oregon ever see Templeton Rye?  It's a rye whiskey made in my area from a recipe by Al Capone himself.  Great stuff.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfzx6?context=5)|2). I finally convinced my manager to bring it in last month!  It's done pretty well, but I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet, but I hear it's great.
[A few years back I was at a bar and made up a shot and called it ""Santa's Ass""  which consists of 1/2 butter shot, 1/4 cinnamon schnapps, and 1/4 peppermint schnapps.  It is very tasty, and 1 or 2 won't ruin your night.

I can't say that I do, and im going to be an asshole here, but be careful bringing up your drink around r/cocktails and bartenders, because they usually don't respect drinks made entirely out of schnapps and liqueurs :/ 
[Templeton rocks. are rye sales up lately? I've been bulliet green label fan for a while, and I'm beginning to see some of my favorite bars carry more and more ryes. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dwdmc?context=5)|I like Bulliet Rye and always try to snag a bottle when it's on sale.  I will definitley have to try the Templeton.  Ryes are gonna be the next big thing, buy the shares now while they're low!
[3\) No offense taken.  It's a hit at the local bar.  Chicks love it, and the name alone makes it fun.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7di9yy?context=5)|As long as the chicks dig it, that's usually the most important part.
[This is kind of an irrelevant question but, do you watch Grimm? It's filmed in portland I believe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfeqr?context=5)|No, but I do watch Portlandia, and I'll tell you the reason everyone hates it in Portland is because it's so true.
[1\) Are you bored at work? 2\) What are some simple and sweet cocktails that I can make on the cheap (apart from the alcohol price of course\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7de87v?context=5)|Nah, we fill bar orders as well(bars and restaurants in Oregon have to buy through liquor stores), and there are always bottles to stock, so there's always something to do. Plus my managers cool and lets me play on my phone when it's dead slow.
[How often do underaged teenagers come and attempt to purchase booze? Here in Norway its pretty strict when it comes to anything about 20%(due to the monopoly\), i dont know much about Portland...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7ddwpl?context=5)|It's a state controlled but privately owned system in Oregon.  While we are ""supposed"" to ID everyone who looks under 35, but generally we Id people if they look 20ish.  The thing is, the way people look is totally iffy. There's been times when I don't ask for someone's ID becuse I thought they looked 30 only to find out they just turned 21 or 22, and I would Id people who I thought looked young but turned out to be nearly 40.  We do have the occasional ""hey misters"" but we mostly just scare them off when someone lets us know.  I have recieved several New York ID's that list Brooklyn as the city of residence, which means its a fake. I sold it to them anyway.
[Of course no one from Manhattan's seen a Brooklyn license! Heh. Trust me, it's correct. Every borough is listed as a city except Manhattan, which is New York. I'll ask someone from Brooklyn to confirm, however. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7fdi4i?context=5)|Ha, well seeing as you are the person from New York I concede to your judgement.
[Is Bacardi Oakheart worth it or am I just caught up in the hype?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dg883?context=5)|Sorry, all Bacardi products are on my awful list. I think Bacardi is way too sugary, and in Puerto Rico, where it's distilled, you'll only find tourists drinking it. If you like spiced rum, I would highly recommend Kraken, it is exceptionally smooth and vanillaly.  Sailor Jerry's ain't bad either by it's harsher and more of a toffee flavour.  At the very least try Cruzan for your cheaper brand name rum, surprisingly tasty for a big brand name.
[I had this idea, being underage, what would happen if i walk into the store, and as soon as the clerk asks for my ID just drop my cash on the counter and run off with whatever i took? How would you react, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhak9?context=5)|If there was a line of people, I'd probably pussy out and yell for my manager, if a person in line didn't stop you.  If there wasn't, I'd chase you.
[$80?? It's around £20 in the UK for a bottle, which according to Google is just over $30. Ouch.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7do0cy?context=5)|Yup, it's much cheaper in Europe.  I'm jealous about that, but you guys also don't know the wonders of good bourbon.
[What do you do when a drunk comes in to buy more and you know he drove to your store? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7de7s4?context=5)|There's been a few I wondered about, but as long as its not too obvious...it helps that we close at 7 pm on weekdays and 8pm on the weekends.  And yeah it's early, but that's normal for Oregon.
[Why does Tequila affect me differently than all other types of booze? (no memory, terrible hangover.etc.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7deala?context=5)|You might be drinking shitty Tequila, which throws in a bunch of sugars as filler.  Stay the hell away from Cuervo, never ever buy it again.
[If i came in under age. How much could I bride you, to letting me buy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dj7vp?context=5)|Nice try OLCC!
 |That's what I'd say, and I'd probably have a shit-eating grin on my face.
[How do you feel about Hendricks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dgzfm?context=5)|Wonderful stuff.  Really nothing like it in terms of gin. Just make sure to always garnish with a cucumber, never a lime with a Hendricks G&amp;T.
[Why the cucumber?  Never heard that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e3i5i?context=5)|From my understanding, Hendricks unique infusion is cucumber.  And that's just the way things are done.
[What store and can I get a Portland Redditor discount?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7di866?context=5)|The only people in Oregon who can get a discount are bar and restaurant owners, and it's only 5%.
[How many hipsters do you see a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7diir6?context=5)|25% hipsters, 25% normal upper middle class folks, 35% old people, 15% bottom feeding alcoholics( some of them are nice, but they are what they are.)
[Have you ever met anyone from Grimm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfxwf?context=5)|I've helped people from Grimm, commercials and films pick out bottles for shoots actually, but they were just interns I think.
[I'm from Portland. What shop do you work at? You ever sold to a minor knowing they were a minor? (I don't drink but had to ask a question cuz your from here\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhwhm?context=5)|I'm from Utah actually. I have sold to minors knowingly since I appreciate a high quality fake ID.  On the street in SE with all the vintage shops.
[I wouldn't give away my location dude, you never know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnh30?context=5)|What if I told you, I might just be quitting in the next week?
[Well then I don't know! Why is that though? You seem to enjoy your job (read the whole AMA\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dnlvq?context=5)|I'm moving back to Utah for schooling since I didn't get into U of O like I hoped.  And after a year in retail, especially one with demanding bar orders and bottom feeders, you get a little jaded.
[Do you sell much Pinot Noir?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmnur?context=5)|In Oregon we can't sell beer or wine in liquor stores.  I say this to people at least 10 times a day.
[Along with not bring able to pump your own gas, one of the worst things about this great state.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e3l42?context=5)|I love not having to pump my gas anymore, no standing in the rain!
[In Oregon the OLCC just approved beer &amp; wine at liquor stores.  It's a fairly difficult approval process but a store in NE Portland off Sandy just started selling both.  One of 4 or 5 in the state but it is now legal nonetheless.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dqysv?context=5)|[More info here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmymp)
[Oh, my apologies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dn0ji?context=5)|No worries!  Check out the Freddy's down the street, or 7/11.  They have great selections to make up for lack of beer or wine in liquor stores(I also say this about 10 times a day.)
[Great info, but regardless your statement to people should be ""In Oregon we can only sell beer &amp; wine in select liquor store locations"". Not ""we can't"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7du6o5?context=5)|Fair enough.  It's more of a test program for now, but you are correct.
[I'm fairly inexperienced with beer but would love to know more. What can you tell me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhrxu?context=5)|I enjoy beer, but can't say too much about it, in Oregon you can't sell beer or wine in liquor stores.  Our gas stations and grocery stores have excellent selections though.
[Wait, you cannot buy beer/ wine in a liquor store? There is one in the Pearl that has them, or did I just make that up in my head? I thought I saw the ones that are bigger than a 12 ouncer, smaller than a 40...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmkfy?context=5)|The Pearl is an exception to the rule.  The OLCC basically let's them skirt around the law because they cater towards rich yuppies and make a lot of money.  Every single liquor store in the area hates them because they've stolen a lot of bar accounts and they are allowed to break certain rules.
 |There is also a test program that several liquor stores are participating in.  They can add beer and/or wine to their selection, but they can't remove any shelf space for the liquor and they lose a fair amount of their commission (since under the OLCC the private owned stores are basically contractors).  The Hollywood liquor store recently moved locations so they could keep shelf space and have plenty of room for beer and wine.  And they are open til 10 p.m. on the weekends, and open Sunday, unlike most stores.  Guess where I like to shop?
[Have you ever called out a fake ID?  What hobo stories do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dl33o?context=5)|Yup. But she was a pretty enough girl who flirts with me so naturally I have no other options than to sell more liquor to her.  My bad.
[What is your favorite snack food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dfz2l?context=5)|I prefer to eat big hearty meals more than snacking, but I do have a soft spot for thick cut kettle chips.
[Ok so then being of portland that seemingly has a somewhat higher than normal drug usage rate then the rest of the country, what snack foods do you find you sell the most of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dk8rn?context=5)|We don't sell junk food, but stoners drink of choice is Old Crow or Seagram 7.
[Why is the OLCC a bunch of fucking Nazis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dlz4c?context=5)|As for the OLCC being Nazis?  TRADITIONNN!
[What do you think of Crater Lake Vodka?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dlz4c?context=5)|Crater Lake Vodka is as smooth, if not smoother than Grey Goose, for $15 cheaper.  Their gin is a fine example of American style gin as well.
[Thanks bud, I appreciate the response.  Free lunch on me when you come to Bend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dqw82?context=5)|Thanks!  I can't say I've been, but heard nothing but great things about your high-desert city.
[Do you get any discounts/free samples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7du0cl?context=5)|Reps come in almost everyday from all sorts of distributors and local distilleries.  We aren't supposed too, but yes, sampling definetly goes down on the job.  I also take home a ton of mini bottles as sample too.  My favorite was sampling different barrels of Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare in order to choose a specific Single Barrel to bottle and sell in only our store.  That's where you really learn to pick up the differences.  Also since we work with local bars, bartenders will give me a free shot, and I use that to sample a lot too.
[Portland is a cool place except for the nazi liquor license! Lived here for about 3 years and it confuses the fuck out of me each time I can't buy liquor at Safeway. Can you tell a story about the douchey-ist/ coolest/ lamest customer you've seen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dmjpz?context=5)|Coming from Utah, the OLCC is a breeze.
 |Coolest customer would probably be the circus performer/event organizer for this years naked bike ride.  Or the old guy who always dropped gold dollar coins in the take a penny, leave a penny jar.  There are a few more I'm blanking on.
 |Lamest is anyone who buys Cuervo.  Or the people who ask me my opinion on every single bottom shelf vodka, and when I tell them they all taste the same to me and consider them rotgut, and that they should at the very least spend $10 on a fifth or $20 on a half gallon they tell me I'm too rich for their taste.
[What made you become and quit being a Mormon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dokoq?context=5)|Seeing Jesus Camp, going to EFY(a mormon youth summer camp that last a week), seeing a bunch of similarities and being weirded out, and then doing research and finding out that pretty much all the science and historical documentation pretty much proves the church(at least in my mind) is complete and utter bullshit created by a charismatic religious genius who later had sex with 14-year old girls and other mens wives.
[Meet any hot females on the job and get a date or even more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dokoq?context=5)|Went on more than a few dates, but only ever dated and more with 3.
[What's your favorite drink?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7dhvmh?context=5)|Favorites would be Knob Creek Rye one rock, George Dickel Barrel Select neat, a Boulevadier, and Sazeracs.  The last two are mixed drinks.
[As for tequila how do you feel about Espolon? I used to work at a liquor store and it's generally half the price of Patron, better quality imo and 100% blue agave. Love the stuff but would like to know what you think about it since you seem really well informed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14innw/i_work_at_a_liquor_store_in_portland_oregon_ama/c7e6gwz?context=5)|How could I neglect Espolon?  What a deal, another underappreciated gem! This is what happens when I make a list all in my head.

I decided that this is what I ultimately want to devote my life to for two reasons - I devoted my life to drugs and alcohol for 17 years - and now I'll be devoting my remaining years to do everything I can, fighting/kicking/screaming/biting against ever letting anything take over my mind again.  I've been told on many occasions that my insights/thoughts at AA/NA meetings aided some other lost soul in understanding our disease better, if only a little bit.  I guess I just figure that hell, I'm 30 and unemployed, I'm going to all of these meetings/public outreach functions (often times being meeting chairperson, running said meeting for free) and what not - Why not get paid to do it and get my B.A. in Human Outreach specializing in Substance Abuse and Addiction?   

I hate to make it seem like I'm just out to make a buck off others' misfortune - but hey - everyone has to make a living.  As of right now, after a failed and bankrupt landscaping business, I'm forced to stay with my mother (which I don't mind - she's great, but a 30 year old living at home with mommie doesn't exactly scream success.)  This was due to my letting the profits of my company go into this little itty-bitty hole in my arm instead of back into the company, as you probably already figured.  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice or maybe an answer to a question or two:

Am I an ass for potentially living off of my required ""public service"" mandated by the rules of AA?  

If it sounds like an ethical move (and my heart really IS in this - I know that I can be of some help to those in desperate need of a guiding ethos such as is the twelve steps, and I believe in those steps,) then can I use my past/current public service time in being the chairperson of those meetings as experience?  perhaps even go as far as call it an internship?

One last question:  If the B.A. in Human Outreach - Addiction specialty somehow is the wrong choice of degree for a gainfully employed future for me, which one is the right one to go after?

Thanks for reading.  Talk to ya in the comments!"

[What will have I to do if I want to make my crack house, a crack *home*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd9ln?context=5)|Sell all your possessions for a rock but keep the welcome mat.
[How the hell do I buy a home for a dollar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcpz9?context=5)|Contact a realtor that is familiar with Detroit and find one that is available for a dollar. There are plenty out there. Lots of caviats though.
 |You will likely have about 1500 in closing costs (the title company and all those involved with the closing still have to get paid), potentially have to pay back taxes and a water bill, and have huge costs getting it up to code. 
[*huge costs getting it up to code.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7drgjn?context=5)|They dont really fine you for the MOST part. They just say that you cannot occupy the home until the inspection is satisfied. In most scenarios the seller is responsible for making sure all past fines/taxes have been paid but there are times when the buyer willingly agrees to pay for such things.
[Does the city crackdown on fines for that?  Are you responsible for past owner's fines?  If the city ever gets too aggressive about collecting, can you just sell the house to someone else for $100?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7drgjn?context=5)|And I always said.. If there is one person willing to buy a house for some amount, there is another person. you just have to find them. 
[*and have huge costs getting it up to code.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd7ku?context=5)|10 - 15k for a normal person. Most of the investors that do this do a lot of the work themselves or hire reallly cheap labor to get it done for much less though.
[How much are we talking here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd7ku?context=5)|It varies, you get diamonds in the rough sometimes that just need carpet, paint, plumbing.
[Thanks for the response. Whats the craziest thing youve seen goin on in a home youve purchased?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd935?context=5)|Lots of stuff really.. Hard core drug dealers slangin right out in front of the home, squatters, saved a few neglected dogs, etc..
[So is the typical $100 home almost always bank owned?  If it is bank owned, the bank would usually pay past fines, but if its an individual, the buyer is more likely stuck with them?  Will the city tell anyone what code violations or fines exist for any property? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dryjo?context=5)|Yes they are always going to be bank owned. No private investor would be willing to come to the closing table with thousands of dollars to sell a house. The seller is always responsible for past fines and taxes unless buyer willingly and knowlingly agrees to pay them. The city makes all of that info public domain and part of the due diligence of getting a property is going downtown and asking for that info.
[Have you ever been attacked by a squatter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcqlz?context=5)|No. I had one lock themselves in a room and not want to come out though. I had to kick down the door and go in with my gun pulled to get them outta there. Kinda scary tbh but they are mostly harmless.
 |Edit: just want to clear up that I did not have my gun out and pointing.. It was holstered.. In retrospect it was a mistake to break in the door I should have called the police but this is why I'm out of the biz. My apologies on the poor use of terminology.. I was not in the habit of pointing guns at people and sorry if I made that impression.
[Okay, the ninja edit does clear some things up, sorry for what I said earlier...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dz61l?context=5)|It's okay I should have made it more clear to begin with 
[How difficult was it to get a carry permit in Detroit?  I heard it was near impossible to get a permit in Michigan even though out of state permits work there through reciprocity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dhfvu?context=5)|It is as easy as getting your CPL which just a class.
[What's the worst place you've succeeded in selling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcplr?context=5)|I would say the worst is a place that came in a package deal. It was bought by an investor with about 12 other homes for around 40k. When I went upstairs into the attic bedroom there was a space heater running, like 6 buckets of rotten fried chicken, and a piss/shit bucket.. I puked from the smell and ran out.
 |The sad part is someone had been recently sleeping in there.. You could tell it was hours ago probably.
[I've heard the package deals like that are generally not a good deal for the investor for just this reason.  Many of the investors are not in the area and don't really understand what they're getting.  They just see the 12 houses for $40K and jump on it.  Is that a fair assessment of the situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7de3fi?context=5)|Yes a lot of investors dont know what they are doing. A lot of the guys I sold those package deals end up taking advantage of those guys and flipping houses at ""wholesale"" to them.
[Also, which area would you say is in the worst shape?  When I'm in Detroit I'm always just outside of Hamtramck, I drive by the old Packard plant.  It's hard to imagine it could be much worse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7de3fi?context=5)|I would say the area over by Van Dyke and 94ish is probably the roughest I have had to deal with. It is a desert of there. Also pockets of neighborhoods of 6 and Woodward. If I had to buy a house in Detroit it would probably be in the Northwest side.
[Why would anyone buy these homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcsqi?context=5)|There are investors that have a presence down there that can succeed in renting these homes out for huge profits.

[ by ""crew"" you mean? Lol. (Nervous laughter.\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd1c9?context=5)|Haha.. Nothing too menacing. But you have to show that you mean business or you would never get your rent. Just a couple guys that would knock on doors at the beginning of the month for rent. I never heard of them having to do anything more than just ask for it.
[Lots of HUD housing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dpwwl?context=5)|Some HUD but mostly traditional bank owned.

[Born and raised in Detroit here, I live in Canada now. How are IT jobs in metro Detroit? I heard they're in high demand. What's the pay scale? What cities are booming in IT in Metro Detroit. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7do3bw?context=5)|They are good. Quicken loans is hiring hundreds of people right now for example right in downtown. Pay scall ranges from 40k - 120k for engineering type jobs. There is no central IT area they are spread throughout.
[What kind of IT jobs might I find in Detroit? I currently live in Toledo and would like very much to leave.

[Why is rent so hard to collect? Is everyone jobless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7degt7?context=5)|People are shady and jobless. Makes for a difficult rent collection.
[ I assume that frequently their number one priority when they get money is not paying the rent.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7deuh6?context=5)|That would be a fairly accurate assumption :)
[Has anyone done the financial analysis of destroying whole swaths of the desolation and returning it to farm land or just reverting it to a natural landscape and excising it from the city?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddcct?context=5)|Yes.. There actually is a program that has been approved by the mayor and city council to tear down entire neighborhoods to shrink the cost of city services. The difficult part of this is evicting people that own their home and have lived their for years. They don;t want to leave believe it or not. 
[Wait- if they own it why should they be forced to leave?  Is the city offering to relocate them or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7deyo3?context=5)|The plan is to relocate them close to the city. They would be given x amount of dollars as an allowance to do so or something. I dont know all the details.
 |Yes.. but someone mentioned to me that there is not anything in the budget for relocation at the moment so the project is at a standstill.
[Is it really as bad in Detroit as people say it is? The way I've seen Reddit describe it seems ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dejdz?context=5)|Like any big city there are parts of it that are very rough. More of those parts exist in Detroit than other big cities though. The suburbs and downtown provide a fantastic lifestyle for the money. I myself live in a safe neighborhood 3 bed brick home tree lined street that I bought for 20k. Wouldnt be possible anywhere else.
[Ever found a meth lab/stockpile of guns/dead body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7ddaun?context=5)|What was a former meth lab, yes.

Just leave well enough alone.  I really dont want to get into the business of selling drugs anyways and I would never be able to smoke that much haha.
[It was most likely reggo's man you don't want that shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7di75y?context=5)|Tru that.
[How the heck does commission work on a house being sold for $100? Is there a base commission per sale, or is it a straight percentage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dfi5v?context=5)|The banks are eager to get rid of the liability. Co missions are generally 1500 plus bonuses up to 3k per realtor.
[Are there some properties that are too gross for you to sell with a clean conscious?  To put this in perspective for us, where would properties that had black mold OR bed bugs be in the spectrum of properties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7de6wl?context=5)|This is a great question. It is a big part of why I got out of the business. I found it was very easy to sucker people into buying these homes and as the foreclosure market dried up a bit I found that if I wanted to continue making good money I would have to spin the truth to sell.
 |In my opinion there are to many liabilities and gotchas involved with buying these homes to make it worth it.
 |I have sold houses with insects and/or covered with black mold. The investors are aware of this up front and take it into consideration when making an offer. If I knew about any of this stuff or thought there might be a chance of it, I would always make sure my better knew exactly what they were getting into.
 |There are realtors that make 400k a year doing this and tbh the only reason I did not is because I am too honest.
[This is a great AMA. So lets say I buy this house for $5000 - would I need to get it up to code if it were for myself? And the back taxes would be included on this house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7defee?context=5)|The city is going to do an inspection on the home and tell you what needs to be done. The inspectors are generally less rigorous on owner occupants than investors but there is no guarantee. You would have to fix plumbing, leaky roofs, broken gutters, big cracks in drive ways. Think anyhting that would make the house unsafe. 
[Are there any good schools that are zoned for these houses? Which zip codes do they fall under?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dea5i?context=5)|No. The Detroit Public Schools are probably the worst in the country. There are some VERY nice neighborhoods in these school districts though, but everyone sends their kids to private schools. 
[Do you make a lot of money doing what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcwvb?context=5)|I no longer do that because the job really wears on you and I wanted to do something more rewarding (I am in IT now). When I did though I made 80k in my last year and had to take a huge pay cut to make a career change.
[Is this your own business or are you working for a company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcwvb?context=5)|I worked for a real estate company. The broker had good relationships with a lot of the banks that own most of these homes so we got a ton of listings. I acted mostly as a buyers agent, working for investors to find homes worth buying.
[Have you ever considered buying a house at this price and just fixing it up and keeping it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dcwvb?context=5)|I did this for the house that I currently live in. It is just outside of Detroit but I picked it up for 20k. I have a family and the school districts in Detroit would deter me from wanting to do it down there. I would stay away from renting out homes down there because it is difficult to collect rent unless you know what you are doing. 
[What is the average deal like? Are most homes $1? Or do the usually go for more? Do people buy houses and just scrap them for the copper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd2si?context=5)|The average deal is around 5k.. The homes for $1 would be in some really bad areas or make the buyers pay taxes for the most part.
 |The copper is always gone by the time the house is sold. There were a lot of investors that bought up these houses and didnt appear to do anything with them, though I have no idea why.
[Do you think these neighbourhoods could be turned around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dctqn?context=5)|There are homeless shelters available but many of them do not want to use them because they dont want to get preached at or whatever. I am sure they fill up from time to time as well but I have never really thought about it much.
[Also, if they are that cheap, have you considered encouraging a setup homeless shelter to HELP the squatters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dctqn?context=5)|The neighborhood probably cannot be turned around to be honest. MAYBE if the city would institute some program that waived back taxes so some of these vacancies could be filled. But it wont happen because they look at that as lost revenue.
[When we sold our last house, our realtor decided to just leave me a cell phone message, which I didn't return within a few hours, and she decided that was okay before bringing clients into my home. The husband and I were doing some business over a few bottles of booze.  Chaos ensued. There was much frantic blanket grabbing and shouting before we got things sorted out. In our defense, we did undercut her normal percentage, but still... it was at the cost of our dignity.  So, have you ever shamelessly marched unsuspecting home buyers through a property that you weren't 100% sure was ready to be seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dh35n?context=5)|No that is just stupid. Up front you agree on when and how you are allowed to show the house. If the clients say that they must confirm. You make sure they confirm.
[Is it legal to evict squatters without a court order?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dggcy?context=5)|There are gray areas between ""evicting"" and asking someone to leave.
[Who owns the abaondoned homes? Why do you get to kick people out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dh475?context=5)|Banks for the most part. And its not like I ""got"" to kick people out. It was more of, go to the house and change the locks etc and in the process I would be like gtfo here.
[Do you ever sell to anyone other than investors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dddke?context=5)|Yes I did actually sell to a lot of people that planned to occupy the homes. These were definitely my favorite deals. Some of the neighborhoods are not all that bad to be honest!
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7dd5oh?context=5)|Not sure what I could provide.. Maybe I have some digital copies of a purchase agreement or something laying around here.

[Has your job made you racist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ijb8/iama_realtor_that_specialized_in_selling/c7draj5?context=5)|No actually it has improved my view of black people in Detroit because I have a better understanding of the blight that some of them grow up with. If I had come from such conditions who knows what type of person I would be. I am much more tolerant than I used to be.
 |Also when you are a white person driving a decent car in these areas you expect to be accosted, robbed, etc.. However, I found that I was left alone and people were actually friendly. It really changed my view.

14it11,1,2012-12-08,Facing anxiety about confrontations and turning down a job,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14it11/facing_anxiety_about_confrontations_and_turning/,"This isn't the most interesting story, but it's causing me a lot of anxiety so I figure I would post here and see if anyone has any advice anyway:

This past summer I took an internship at a software dev company. The work was alright, but I didn't really like the atmosphere of the place, or the people, and toward the end one of my coworkers/mentor started to act kind of creepy towards me. The last day of the internship, they offered me a job, knowing that I am graduating in December. I was surprised and really taken off guard because I had explicitly told them I wasn't looking for a career with their company, and was only there for the learning experience. However, I agreed to the offer. 

I felt lucky that I had a job lined up before I had finished college. Even though at that moment I knew that I didn't really *want* the job, they told me they wanted an answer within a few days, so I felt pressured into saying yes. I found this to be a little ridiculous.. considering this was the middle of summer, which is not a time when a lot of companies are recruiting, I wasn't even thinking about jobs, and three days would in no way give me enough time to see what other kind of opportunities were out there. I still can't believe I agreed to the job, and as stupid as it sounds, part of me just didn't want to be rude by refusing.

A few weeks later, they send me a job contract. Meanwhile, I'm attending a career fair every week, talking to companies, and setting up interviews. I still haven't returned the contract. I interviewed with several companies that were definitely more interesting and seemed to be more invested in their employees. I got an offer to move across the country, to start a new job in January, and I accepted. I signed their contract and everything. 

However, I still have the other contract sitting in my room, unsigned. I wrote out an email draft to send to HR saying that I wouldn't be joining them in January, but after talking to my dad, he insists that I have to call them. I am absolutely terrified of this, but I know he's right. Although they put me in the shitty situation of making a decision right off the bat, I stupidly agreed, and now I at least owe them a personal phone call to let them know why I won't be joining them.

I'm afraid they will insist that I explain why I'm not working with them. I'm afraid that I will not be able to come up with the words. I'm afraid that I won't be able to sound sincere on the phone.

If anyone has any advice that will make me feel better about this whole situation, I'd really appreciate it. Both my parents are making me feel like shit for having agreed to work there and backing out of it, although they were the ones who pressured me into agreeing to the job when they knew I didn't really want it. Obviously it was my decision and not theirs in the end, but I just want to hear a general consensus about how badly I fucked this up. I know when I start working at my other job in a month none of this will matter, but right now I can't focus on anything else (when I really do need to focus on exams).

Thank you, anyone and everyone."

Simplified, I send files to the printer and hope that the output is correct. Sometimes I will test the interface that the printer uses as well.

My internship is supposed to end at the end of this month, but my boss has dropped hints that they would like me to continue to work with them (like ""give me your spring semester schedule"").

Since I have six months left until I graduate, I was thinking of leaving the company. I would rather spend those six months improving my skills, developing my resume even further, and researching other companies and positions that pertain to my interests.

Printers are not where I want to be. There is a strong chance that if I remain with this company, I'll continue to be in testing until I graduate. Even then, there is no guarantee that I'll be hired. I would like to work in operating systems or embedded systems (I've begun to learn how the Linux kernel and how drivers work in that architecture). 

So here's my question: would future employers dislike that I left after ~ one year of employment? I could always tell them that one year was the length of the internship, but that route of dishonesty is not something I want to lay foundation upon."

I come to you once more with a problem.

So, as you have gathered from the title, I presently reside in South Africa. I finished my MCITP course, and realized with a shock that there are only a handful of jobs available in this field, and even then they require me to either have so much experience, be black, or both. No, I'm not being racist or anything. We have this thing called Black Economic Empowerment.

Case in point, my only chance at getting work in the IT industry is getting out of this country. I'm quite fond of getting an internship or co-op in the United States so I can gather some work experience, but I'm not even sure where to start. Which companies and/or corporations to I contact? What do I even ask them?

Thanks again in advance for all of your help. You guys have really helped me get my life together the past few days. :D"

So I graduated last May from a small liberal arts with a B.A. double major in computer science and electronic arts(= combo of mass comm, art and cs). Ive been searching for a job ever since i graduated and have had luck. Ive applied to all the big companies around me and alot of small ones too. Im mostly applying for entry level software engineer positions but have still had no luck. I didn't have any internships during college and had a 3.3 gpa. Now its freaking december and Im just about broke (by new years for sure). Ive been throwing around the idea of maybe taking OSU's (oregon state) accelerated online cs degree program because all I ever hear back from places I apply is that Im 'not what they are looking for' or 'lack the skills needed'. I cant help but feel i learned nothing at my school. I also feel like im forgetting anything i may have learned. Im losing hope at finding a job and im wondering if its worth dumping more money into school....for the same degree....again or to just keep on trucking. Any advice?"
14labg,2,2012-12-10,How were you able to stay motivated and have a positive outlook on your future when you feel like a failure?,facingfailureta,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14labg/how_were_you_able_to_stay_motivated_and_have_a/,"I'm not really sure how to word my question but I just want to hear from people that have experienced some of the same things I'm going through or from people in a similar situation. I am currently a junior at a pretty good engineering school and I am rethinking my choice of being here.

I have always thought science was pretty cool and math is fine by me.  I have always been pretty good at them too, which made engineering a clear choice for a major. However, its gotten to the point where the classes I have to take are not very interesting and really difficult and I don't know if its worth it anymore. All of the joy from learning is gone and I don't look forward to going to class. I'm not even sure if studying engineering was really my choice or just to make my parents happy. I feel like I should change majors but then the past 3 years would be a huge waste of time and money. Also, I have no idea what I would switch too because I don't know what I want to do with my life.

It feels like I am not retaining anything I'm learning despite having a decent GPA. I haven't been able to get any sort of internship, or even an interview for one, which makes me feel like getting a job after graduation is going to be extremely difficult. It feels like everyone around me is pretty set for the future while I'm not. I can't help but think if I make it through all this struggle for a degree I will still end up working in a shitty low wage job.

Who knows, maybe all this is just the stress from finals week talking.

Anyway, how were you able to get your shit together when it seemed like your future was pretty bleak?

I had already been thinking about doing this before. My mother had passed away last Christmas, and I had moved back home to grieve with my dad. After her death we lost the house, and I began to resent my job and felt trapped. All of my friends had found someone and I was stuck at home, alone, with a shit job and a wasted undergrad experience

Then at the end of June I had met her. We hit it off immediately. In no time we were skyping into the wee hours of the morning and falling asleep in front of the computer together. We spent every day together, just hanging out… for the first time in my life things felt right

But there was one catch. She is still in school, and at the end of the summer she was going to go to the Middle East for a year abroad. 

Before she left, I went with her to DC(where she goes to school) and spent the most wonderful week of my life. It was nothing but her and exploring the beautiful capital.
We tried to make it work while she was abroad, but she became lost in her school and internship and I became needy. Skyping was hard due to limited internet and the timezones were the complete opposites. It was painful.

After trying for a month, she told me she couldn’t be a good girlfriend while abroad. I told her no, she was the best girlfriend any man could ever hope for, but she said she still felt awful that she couldn’t be there, and that she was planning on staying the summer, and returning abroad after graduation. She broke it off. 

We tried to talk again when we were calmer to get closure, but I lost it and said that I could move on, I could see other people, but that it would be hollow and a sham compared to how I feel about her. She began to tear up and said I had given her a lot to process. If there was one thing I am certain of in this world, it is that she still likes me

I can’t keep going like this. Friends are moving on with their lives and in love, yet I am stuck here. Therapy, medication, and meditation still don’t make things feel right. Life is not worth living without her. I can’t stop thinking about her, and I can’t go back to the way things were without her.

Of course, if you're a dedicated stoner and weed has changed your life, please share! I'd love to hear psychonautical experiences brought about by marijuana. But other stuff is great too. Be as specific as possible! Trip/high stories can be great, but not if they're just ""I got high and laughed at shit for a while.""

I'll go first. Until Spring '12, I hadn't tried any drugs at all besides pot, and I wasn't sure I wanted to. One of my friends goes to Sarah Lawrence College, a very hipster/artsy school, and told me one day that he had managed to get his hands on something called ""2C-E"" and that he would be honored if I would try it with him.

At first I was totally unwilling to do this. *I like my brain just fine,* I thought. *No need to mess with it more than I already do.* But I started doing some research, and besides a few overdose horror stories on Erowid, everything looked good. The drug seemed to be pretty amazing, actually, with users describing profound self-realizations and beautiful visuals. 

So, I figured, fuck it. I've just finished my Senior year (as Seniors finished school a month early to do internships at my high school), so I might as well have an adventure.

The friend came and stayed over at my father's apartment in NYC. The next day at around noon we went into Times Square, and dropped the pills there just for the hell of it. Then we hiked up to Lincoln Square to catch *Moonrise Kingdom*. Fantastic decision.

It started kicking in about an hour into the movie. Colors got slightly more vivid, there were some slight distortions, and the whole movie--which is resonant enough as it is--seemed to strike a deep chord within me, like it contained a message far deeper than the love story it seemed to be. I have yet to watch it sober to ascertain whether or not that's still the case.

Then we spent the whole day wandering around the city. We sat in Central Park to peoplewatch, went to the Met, then walked all the way down to Chelsea Market and bought a couple of books to read for a while. The whole trip lasted around 11 hours. I can't really explain it to people who haven't experienced the drug's effects, but here's my best try:

Everything was very bright and silvery. Borders and edges seemed much sharper and more distinct. Movement left traces, and when I watched birds fly I felt like I could see their future trajectory as well as where they'd just come from. At first I was almost speechless, unable to put into words the extreme beauty I was feeling, but eventually I loosened up and my friend and I had a lot of long, fascinating conversations about our lives, our perceptions of others, and how humans work as a species. The whole trip was accompanied by a feeling of removal from myself--I could control my body perfectly, but my mind was operating all on its own and didn't really need my body around to help it out. 

The second time I did 2C-E was on a beautiful island in Lake Saranac. The same friend and I lounged there for the whole day, reading books (*Lempriere's Dictionary,* for any who have heard of it) and talking. This time we made a point of looking at clouds for a while, as the sky is probably the most beautiful thing you can look at under the influence of this drug. We could see the clouds shifting and dispersing in the air, layers of them fading in gorgeous fractal patterns and moving around and through one another. To this day, I have never seen clouds behave like that, but my friend assures me that it was real and not a hallucination (as 2C-E doesn't produce new things, just enhances the ones that are there). 

So that's me! Let's hear what Reddit has to say. 

TL;DR I did a drug and it was awesome. Your turn.

14n7ie,6,2012-12-10,"[Custody] Child with Autism, Relocating to a different state, and Remarriage",fortiercrenshaw,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/14n7ie/custody_child_with_autism_relocating_to_a/,"Hello /r/legaladvice,

This is a throwaway... I have a custody issue that I am hoping to get your help, feedback and advice. I have done a lot of legal research on the topic, but am not an attorney, so I’m hoping that with my research and your expertise, I can get some answers.

**Background:** My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and have been talking about marriage. She has been divorced for almost 3 years, but she share joint custody with her ex of their son, who has autism. I have since moved to another state, which makes getting married even more difficult as need to adjust the custody arrangement to allow her and her son to leave the state. The ex is completely against this. 

My girlfriend and her son live in a very rural part of KY where services for children with autism are scant. Additionally, she in not from the area and would like to move back to where I live, which is near her hometown. To make matters more interesting, I am a licensed Master’s-level therapist (LPC and LMFT) and am finishing my Ph.D. in clinical psychology and work at a non-profit that provides services to children and families with autism and have worked within my network to secure my girlfriend’s son enrollment in a school for children with autism and free speech/language and psychotherapy at a community clinic where I completed my internship. My specialty is in working with children and families with autism. Additionally, my girlfriend is finishing her M.Ed in Special Education, emphasizing Autism Education through ASU’s online degree program. In other words, we are both qualified and trained people who love the child and want to provide the best possible situation for him. Conversely, the child’s father hold a PT low-wage job and is subsidized by his parents in order to make ends meet.

My girlfriend and her ex have a horrible relationship and do not communicate with each other, at the detriment to their child’s needs. They are unable to come to a consensus on how to help their child, with the ex often stonewalling my girlfriend’s idea out of spite. Additionally, because both parents work FT jobs, and the shared custody agreement, the child is shuttled between three homes over the week—my girlfriend’s home, the child’s father, and the child’s paternal grandparents. 

**Our Argument:** Children with autism need approximately 40 hours of therapy or specialized care per week, which I have arranged for here in my state. Conversely, her son receives minimal school and therapeutic support in order for him to develop cognitively. Additionally, children with autism, indeed any child, require stability and security in their living arrangement. Our augment is that granting my girlfriend sole custody, in order to move out of state, where we can later marry, will benefit the child in that we provide him: 1) a stable home environment, 2) appropriate educational and therapeutic services, and 3) we are more than willing to have the child’s father be in his life for summers and alternating holidays. We would like to have the child the entire school year.
 
**Legal Research:** My understanding is that the burden of proof falls upon us to show how relocation is in the best interest of the child. Here is a contrast of where the child lives and where we propose he live:

1. There are more than 30 specialized treatment facilities within my county that work with individuals with autism over the lifespan. Compared to one facility where the child presently resides, which requires a hefty annual tuition and was disregarded by the special education specialist of the child’s school district.
2. I have obtained enrollment for the child in a specialized primary and secondary school for individuals with autism. This school has trained teachers with degrees in Special Education and licensed mental health professionals (i.e. Masters in Social Work, Licensed Professional Counseling, and Marriage and Family Therapists) who specialize in working with ASD. Whereas his current school has no such specialty trained staff. Free tuition (a $45,000 a year scholarship has been extended to him).
3. Child and family therapy, including structured and child-centered therapy, has been offered by my former employer for the child which includes speech therapy, social skills training, and job training.
4. My insurance and benefits cover therapy and medication related to ASD. Presently, my girlfriend and her son are on Medicaid and other government programs which have been found to be insufficient in both medication and specialty trained services the child needs.
5. My income is sufficient to provide my girlfriend and her son without the need to have my girlfriend work. Presently, she must work in order to provide for herself and her son. Notwithstanding, due to my girlfriend’s personal and educational background in autism, there are a variety of positions available to her for employment, should she choose to do so.
6. Within a 30 minute driving distance, my girlfriend has ample social support with her parents and siblings to offer individual and familial support. Additionally, my siblings live in nearby and can provide additional support. In contrast, my girlfriend has no support system where she lives; however, her son’s father and grandparents do reside in the county.

**LEGAL CONSULTATION &amp; MY QUESTIONS:** After all this my girfriend's attorney says that me being involved in the picture looks poorly on her/our case as the attorney says that the court will say that she is seeking sole custody for her own benefit so we can marry and not for the child's best interest. So, I'm taking a back seat in the custody case. **Now, would our case be easier if we were to marry and present that as evidence stating that I have gainful employment and that my wife and her child should be with me so we can be a family?**

**Applicable Kentucky Case Law** 

I have found the following cases that apply to our case:

1. **Fenwick v. Fenwick (2003) and Carpenter-Moore v. Carpenter (2010).** If a parent is designated as “primary residential parent” s/he could move with the children over the objection of the other parent unless that parent proves the relocation would seriously endanger the children.

2. **Robards v. Giddings (2006):** Found that in the event where there is no clear evidence as to who the primary physical custodian—as in our case, where the child is shared between three homes—“the really relevant factor to the Court is (e), the mental and physical health of all individuals involved” (p. 3). This includes, adherence to medication or potential abuse (p. 5).

3. **Squire v. Squire (1993):** Found that in cases where parents enjoin joint legal custody but were not “sufficiently cooperative to accommodate joint custody” (p. 766) is still case for joint custody is warranted. However, the Appeals Court stated that when the positive aspects of joint custody, such as “shared decision-making, parental involvement in child rearing and encouragement of parental cooperation” (p. 767) are non-existent or unworkable, which we believe is within our case, moreover, that both parties would be able to “possess sufficient maturity to suppress their enmity toward one another and avoid having their personal animosity destabilize the upbringing of the child” (p. 767), a reexamination of sole legal custody is warranted. We believe that just as in this case, our case represents an “overwhelming evidence of discord and lack of cooperation between parties” (p. 767).  Thus, cooperation and communication between the parties is required for an award of joint custody. In this case, it is obvious that the parties cannot agree or cooperate to the extent necessary to accommodate a joint custody award.”

4. **Chalupa v. Chalupa (1992):** Noted that even when joint custody is awarded, the court may designate where the child shall usually reside; it recognized that joint custody envisions shared decision-making and extensive parental involvement in the child's upbringing, and in general serves the child's best interest; and that joint custody may have the effect of encouraging parents to cooperate and stay on their best behavior. However, in cases where this does not happen, sole custody is an option.

5. **Wilson v. Wilson (1992).** The court stated “a custodial parent cannot, in today’s mobile society, be forced to remain in one location in order to retain custody.”

6. **N.B. v. C.H. (2010) and Pennington v. Marcum (2008).** Between joint custodians, and absent the non-primary residential parent’s motion to modify timesharing, the relocating parent always bears the burden of providing relocation is in the best interests of the child.

7. Social science data amassed since the advent of the joint custody experiment some 20 plus years ago studying the effects of joint custody awards demonstrates overwhelmingly that except for ""those few, exceptionally mature adults who are able to set aside animosities in cooperating for the benefit of their children,"" joint custody is not a problem solver, but a pernicious problem causer. J. Rainer Twiford, J.D., Ph.D., Joint Custody: A Blind Leap of Faith?, Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law, Vol. 4, No. 2, p. 157-68 (1986).
 


**TL;DR:** I want to marry my girlfriend who shares joint custody with her ex of their autistic child. I am a therapist who works with children and families with autism and am finishing my Ph.D. in clinical psychology in this field. We want to marry but now live in different states because of my work and are not filing so that she can have full custody of the child to relocate and live with me. Would marrying now help out case? Am I too much of a liability in being involved and mentioned in the case?"

[Top 3 things an owner can do to prolong the life of the car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2mxz?context=5)|Always change your oil when your service manual says to whether it be 3, 5, or 7,000 miles.  Use the oil they recommend and skip the expensive additives unless you want to use ZINC to help ease breakin of a new engine or a turbo engine.  Don't be late on it.  Your car doesn't have kidneys so it relies on this dialysis.  You'll notice a small increase in gas mileage and a decrease in noise.  There is no real benefit of changing it earlier unless you drive it really hard.  That being said I drive the shit out of both the Subie and the Lotus and I change it at 3,000 miles every time.  I know people who change it at 2,000 and 2,500, but it's a waste of money and bad for the environment.
 |Never, never, NEVER drive your car with the oil level even slightly low.  Less oil means the oil is broken down quicker and your engine will run hotter (you won't notice, because your engine temp on your dash is likely the coolant temp which will not change.
 |Fix things before they break, because when they go, they break other things too.  This especially applies to your timing belt.  Replace that sucker on the mile or earlier than what it says in you service schedule.  You can get this schedule from the dealer who makes your car, even if you bought it used. If the timing belt goes you will hate your life.  If it goes, you can expect to pay for it to be replaced, to pay for the shop to retime your car, and in some engines you can need new valves and possibly even pistons or cylinder sleeves.  Just don't go there.
[My wife drives a RAV4 and parked with the air dam thing on top of one of those concrete tire bumper things.   Are those things expensive? Is it a do-it-yourself fix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3eo3?context=5)|If the air dam clears the obstacle she can park it anywhere she wants.  This is America.  Anything can be a DIY fix.  I started out changing my oil and once I realized how much money I save and how therapeutic and manly it is to fix things yourself I graduated to crazier things.  The only thing I avoid is transmissions.  Those things work on black magic.  They're dark sided and only weird ass Dexter mother fuckers work on them.

Any clever way to prevent this nonsense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3eo3?context=5)|Sorry, it's just a challenge trying to picture this with all the generic terms like ""thing"" but I think I got it, haha.  The most clever way I can think of is to put a lift kit on your rav 4.  that'll show her.  But seriously, she just has to be more careful.  Once she sees the bill she'll stop doing it.  Also, check out brush guards that wrap under the front bumper and mount to the frame.
[Hi! my low coolant light comes on constantly.  I fill it up, but it comes back rather quickly.  I don't think it is leaking antifreeze cause I put cardboard under my car and didn't see anything.  My dad thinks my head gasket is going.  Is that true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2ieu?context=5)|If you are losing coolant, but it is not leaking out of your vehicle this is very bad.  It is likely going into your engine.  Your dad may be right.  The head gasket keeps oil separated from coolant.  If the gasket goes over time it can lead to coolant seeping into your engine oil.  Coolant doesn't make a good lubricant at all.
 |Check your oil to see if you can smell coolant. Keep an eye out for white smoke.  Remember: White smoke is coolant and smells sweet.  Blue Smoke is oil and black smoke is unburnt fuel.
 |If you are close to your oil change interval, you should drain your oil to see if there is coolant in it.
 |IF COOLANT IS IN YOUR OIL CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY AND FIX THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK OR YOUR ENGINE WILL DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.

It depends on the individual location.  It's hard to tell, even for me if a place is trustworthy.
 |That being said, if it's a bigger place and you catch them slacking, you usually get a refund at the very least.  They will do about anything to stop the word from getting out, because in this business your reputation is EVERYTHING.
 |Don't be a soft target.  Let them know you would do it yourself, you just don't have time.  Don't be a jerk, just make them think that you will know if they decide to screw you.  They will do a good job on your car and save the shenanigans for the next schmoe that comes in.  This goes double for women.  A lot of places look at women as being gullible and often they're right.  Women, keep your guard up.
 |Put some identifying mark on your oil filter.  It's very common for bigger chains like Sears or Jiffy Lube to drain your oil and just wipe off the filter so it looks new.  This $6-$10 that they save greatly reduces the overhead on a job that they otherwise don't make much money off of.
[It was a VW, and even if it is a thing, how would a window on the outside allow the mechanic to see a shredded clutch plate?  EDIT: never mind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7fsu75?context=5)|&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
[2005 Nissan frontier,, my engine light came on a couple months ago,, apparently the o2 sensors are out or going out,, and the truck still drives fine,, no drop in mpg, should i rush to get these replaced? dealer told me its a bad cat, but the cats are fine,, dont want to pay the 2k bill if i dont have to,, am i hurting the truck by driving on bad sensors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3qw3?context=5)|If it is the front O2 sensor (upstream) than you should replace it right away since this controls your mixture.  The rear one won't affect your mileage much, but it will cause you to fail an inspection.  You can look online for a ""falsie"" that will trick your car into thinking the rear O2 sensor is there when it is not.  This would still involve some wiring (2-3 wires) and a plug for the hole in your exhaust.
 |Again, I stress that you never ignore cries for help from the Front O2 sensor closest to the exhaust. It is very important.
 |Yes, I know falsie is a term for a fake penis.
 |How do you know the cats are fine?  If they are not fine they can possibly light on fire.  So I'd make absolutely sure that it's fine.
[What is the coolest car that you have worked on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2zm8?context=5)|Probably my Lotus or my Subaru.  I built a 400 HP Subaru and modified it to run on E85, which is basically poor man's race gas.  It has the equivalent of 115 octane give or take.  I say equivalent, because octans are only in hydrocarbons like petroleum, Ethanol doesn't have them.
 |The Lotus was built and supercharged to about 280 HP and weighed only 1850 lbs.  I sold it though and I'm going to buy a nicer one and swap the Evora engine into it.  I may have somebody else do the swap though, because I don't have the tools to do the fabrication myself.
 |I love working on Subarus, I have had the pleasure of seeing some kickass Subies, but also the misfortune of having to clean up a few messes and telling people that there car is not economically feasible to fix.  I see a lot of GTOs, Corvettes, and some sweet mustangs as well as some basic maintenance on a few Porsche Panameras and a GT3RS.
[Speaking of Subarus, what's your opinion on the BRZ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f5pqz?context=5)|Oh, you mean the Toyota BRZ?  Verily, I kid.  I think it's a cool car, but it's not really a typical Subaru.  I like that they made a roadster finally, but I wish it were still AWD.  I'm glad that they made a relatively light car and I don't even mind that it's rear wheel drive, but then they made the engine 2.0 L NA.  2.0 L is a soft drink, not an engine.
 |It's a nice car, but get the FRS as it's much cheaper and is very similar.
[I agree, it isn't the typical Subaru and the engine is so what lacking. Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f5vyt?context=5)|I don't mean to jump on the BRZ hating bandwagon, but meh.

Or Subaru fanboys.
[My Toyota's check engine light came on, again.  Last two times, I went to a mechanic, they looked and said one of my valves got momentarily stuck, and it was now fine.  Is there any way I can check whether that's the issue now too, or do I have to go down to the mechanic each time?  Is there anything I can do to make sure it doesn't happen again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f3yvb?context=5)|If you go to any auto store they will read and print out your codes for free.  Never ignore a CEL (check engine light), because it may be something else this time and also, it could hide another code as well.
 |So go to Auto Zone and have them read it and research the code number on the forums.  Take any advice you get there with a grain of salt.  This will save you a lot of money on diagnostics.
[We don't get free code reads here :( It costs 25€+](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7g2dbo?context=5)|That's a terrible ripoff.
[The price is, yes, but paying for code reading isn't a ripoff imo. The code reading device costs and he is using his time on your car, which he could've spent on actually fixing one and making profit (if code reading didn't cost\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7g48uv?context=5)|It takes less than a minute.  That's no way to do business.  The guy probably makes less than that for an hour.
[I can assure you that little to no mechanics in Finland do anything for free... Even if it was checking if the car has a paint job or not...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7g5jnb?context=5)|That's unfortunate.  I figured they would be good, friendly people.  I don't work for free either, but for little things I don't charge.  I like to help people and surprisingly people offer to tip more than I'd normally ask for on a few jobs.
[I have a 2002 Camaro z28, 5.7L V8, 100k mi. It starts and runs just fine. When I really give it gas, something rattles, like its pinging. It will only do it under load, not in neutral or park. If it were a timing issue, would it only do it under load? The timing is controlled by the PCM, so do I need to get it tuned? It sounds like it is under the hood, not the floorboard (cats\). I have sea-foamed in the TB (deep creep\), brake booster line, and gas tank. The pinging got really bad after that, such that it would do it with the slightest bit of acceleration. That lasted for about 5 miles of driving. Now it is back to only pinging when I really give it some gas. Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f4mau?context=5)|It could be knock and it certainly could be your timing.  Under load you are more likely to knock, especially if your timing has advanced for one reason or another.  You are running a respectable amount of power and the timing chain can be stretched and weakened over time.  You have a single cam and overhead valves if I'm not mistaken so the ECU does not control your timing.
[I really would like to learn to work on cars. Do you think I should invest in those schools? Probably part-time evening classes, really can't afford taking time off from my current job. If so what do you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f5w6p?context=5)|The classes for ASE certification will teach you about a lot of boring shit and in my opinion they suck.  I took a few classes to get my ASE cert and the classes were a joke so I dropped them.  These classes are practical and focus on boring shit like EGR systems, AC systems, Brakes, stuff that Jiffy Lube techs do.  You can go that route, but that's not how I went.
 |I think the best way to learn is self learning.  Get a Craftsman 182 Piece tool set from Sears.  They're on sale for $160 right now and it comes in a neat tool chest.  It will have most everything you need to start doing your own work.  I recommend starting with saving money on fixing your own car.  Learn as you go by fixing issues that pop up with your car.  Change your own oil.  Fix some little things that are wrong with it.  Soon you will have paid for your toolkit by doing your own maintenance.  Go on youtube and watch videos on 4 stroke engines.  Join forums.  Get with your buddies and figure out their cars too.  All the information is out there.
 |**Make a friend with a garage and study under him.  Pay attention to everything he does.**
 |I never went to school for this and I have Subaru master techs who consult me still when they get modified Subies in their shops.
 |I got into this because my asshole friend got a 2005 Subaru STi when he got back from Iraq.  It was a sick car and he was very proud of it.  For 2 days.  It blew up and he met a dude who was into those things who offered to fix it for the cost of a new engine.  My buddy bought the engine from a wrecked car and helped them put it in.  He became friends with this guy and I met him too.  I wanted a sweet car also and I had saved up a lot of money from Iraq and from trading precious metals so I bought a Lotus.  I learned by helping my buddy work on his car and by fixing up this Lotus.  It was a constant chain of long nights in the garage figuring things out and trial and error.  I made a lot of friends and learned a lot.  Working on cars has enriched my life and it helps me deal with the war inside my own head.  I love going fast and I love seeing my hands do something constructive.  
[I have a 99 v6 Mustang. Recently it's been having trouble starting but starts up right away when I tap the gas. Any thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f2ixs?context=5)|You may need to adjust your idle.  I'm not sure how to do it on a mustang, but I believe it may be an adjustment on the throttle body.  There is a lot of support available from forums, but take their advice with a grain of salt and be prepared for them to mae fun of you for having a V6.  You may have to wade through some BS, but you will get a good answer.

[My 08 Cobalt's computer will not connect to any auto mechanic's computer. The power at the fuse and also the connector seem OK. What could possibly be causing this?

Be sure to wear a static bracelet and ground yourself so you don't harm the ECU with any discharge.  It sounds like a pricey fix if you don't do it yourself.  It's almost certainly either a faulty ECU or bad wiring between the ECU and the OBD-2 port.
 |This will cause you to fail an inspection.

When I drain oil and 2 quarts comes out instead of 5 I know there is some nasty shit caked on their motor's guts.
 |If your car stinks, it is usually very easy and not too pricey to get a new cabin air filter and replace it.  Your car will smell like new again and no more mildewy vents.
 |Air filters can be a huge issue with fuel economy as well.  Just replace them (or clean them if you have a reusable one) when you're suppose to.
[Okay, what's the thumping sound I hear coming from around the front wheels when I turn sharply at low speeds in a parking lot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53n4?context=5)|I have heard of a clicking sound turning sharply at low speeds.  That would be your CV joint.  A thumping noise could also be a CV joint, I'd have to hear the noise to be sure.
[On a 97 Ford Taurus, there's a really bad gas smell after driving in hot weather.

It becomes a problem if you notice that your power steering isn't working and if your voltage is low.  If it interferes with safe handling, or if the voltage is low (your lights will flicker at idle) than you should see a mechanic to isolate the problem.  It may be the belt or it may be that an accessory is offering resistance and may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
[Is this wise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f9bu7?context=5)|Get me the code number and description and that'll help me help you.

Don't bother to get a degree in it, it won't help.  I recommend getting your ASE certification, but more than anything call XXX-xxx-xxx and ask for Tim.  Jeff is a total asshole, but ignore him and insist that it's very important that you speak with him.  Ask Tim what he recommends for someone who wants to work on performance cars.  Tell him you never want to change a set of drum brakes and that you are interested in doing an internship or job shadow.  If you can get in with Cobb you'll have a good foot in the door.

A timing belt stretches before it snaps which will throw your timing off resulting in a shitty idle and rough ride.  It's probably time to replace it anyhow.
[Sell any blinker fluid or muffler bearings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f88uf?context=5)|That's a common misconception.

Check your oil and if you need to, change it.  Oil starvation will kill your engine.
[Any thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53jv?context=5)|The squeaking is porobably something to do with your wheel bearings, but I don't have enough info.  Does it do it on flat roads from 0-5 or just when you are going over bumps or turning?
[Also... whats your dream car (mechanically speaking\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f53jv?context=5)|My dream car to work on is the Subaru.  They are so mechanically friendly.  To drive I'd want either the Hennessy Venom GT or the R35 Nissan GT-R.  I also like the Porsche GT3RS and the 458 Italia. Lamborghinis aren't bad, I like the AWD, but they are  a bit gaudy and they don't have the pedigree of Ferarri.
[Recently changed the oil; noise is still around. I'm thinking something to do with the belts. Thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f59av?context=5)|Belts wouldn't cause a click.  It is almost certainly valvetrain noise though.  If it was ever abused it is damaged permanently.  Cars don't heal any damage they incur which is why preventative maintenance is so important.
[ I thought it was the wheel bearing as well; but i had one replaced last year and it was fine for a while. Could it have gone bad so soon? It happens in all conditions though. Usually I hear it in parking structures or traffic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f59av?context=5)|The fact that it stopped when the wheel bearing was replaced should show that the problem is in that area.  If you only got one replaced the others were probably close to the same amount of wear.  Maybe another one is going out.
[My corolla has the same clicking noise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14owt4/i_am_an_auto_mechanic_ask_me_anything_especially/c7f8fuc?context=5)|The valvetrain is almost never the cause of death in these cars except for when people let their timing belts break, and even then the valves are often untouched.  Usually it's a blown head gasket that people let develop into a spun rod bearing.

Your catalytic converter converts Hydrocarbons and CO into H20 and that water condenses and drips out of your exhaust.

You probably need to replace them.  It may be possible to lathe them, but I recommend a replacement, those rotors are cheaper than a car accident.

I would have a mechanic equalize the pressure and make sure your fuel pump is okay.
 |On the other car the belt squealing could be due to the condition of the belt or it could be an accessory such as the power steering, ac, fan, or alternator offering excess resistance.

Black wouldn't be bad, it'd just be excess fuel.  My first reaction is to say that it's oil from the PCV system.  If your crank case breather valve recirculates air it can also recirculate oil, but you're running carbs so that's probably not it.
[Hi, thanks for doing the AMA. I hope I'm not too late to the party.

If the oil or transmission level is not on the dip stick don't buy it.  If the clutch is slippy, pass it up.  If there is any suspection of water damage, don't do it.  Look at the little things to see how they took care of the vehicle i.e. brakes, fluids, how clean the engine and underbody is (is it full of oil and grease?)

14ph37,3,2012-12-11,Choosing internships,glasswright,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14ph37/choosing_internships/,"ok, So I need advice on what action I should take on choosing a summer internship. I got invited to the 2nd round interviews in mid january for company A that is my first choice, but I just got an offer for an internship with my 2nd choice company B that I have to accept or decline by Friday. I'm having panic attacks over here trying to figure out what to do. 

Company A:

*  Location: in a Great city in the region of the US I want to end up 
* Industry: Financial services, so I have a lot of room for growth in the future
* Salary: internship pay is that same as B, but the full time position the internship leads into pays a good bit higher than Company B

Company B:

* Location: In a big city as well,but not the region I have been targeting
* Industry: Headquarters for Retail, so I feel that if I don't like it, it will be harder to break into something else

I really wanted to Work at company A because I already know someone who works there from my school &amp; major, and he loves it, so I feel like I would fit there too.   But I am really scared that I will turn down company B, not get an offer at Company A, and then I'll end up with nothing.

So what do you guys think? Should I bite the bullet and accept Company B's offer, or reject it and hope I get an offer from Company A?

I know it was kind of confusing, so if you need anymore clarification please ask."

14p2l1,1,2012-12-11,Physical sciences undergrad with CS concentration- Master's first or straight to tech industry?,no_more_physics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14p2l1/physical_sciences_undergrad_with_cs_concentration/,"Lucky enough to go to a great school (top 10 in both physics and CS). I have a 3.3 GPA in my CS classes which is probably a teensy bit above average. I've taken the majority of the core classes for the CS major (several data structures courses, OOP and functional, discrete structures, some more specialized stuff like ML and NLP and other various language or other CS classes), but I am missing some important ones (computer architecture comes to mind, and operating systems). I should have switched majors a year and a half ago, but I wasn't entirely sure that I wanted a career in CS. Now I am. 

I have a small amount of web development experience (a local internship that wasn't super technical, a class that focused on other things but for the final, I developed a web application for apartment searching). I prefer back end stuff to front end, but I don't have a ton of experience in either. I really like my machine learning class, and I have the general itch to make stuff. I've also used programming in a few other internships, but none of them were in the tech industry or in entirely technical roles. It was more like general engineering and scientific research.

My question is, should I stay and complete a Master's of Engineering at my alma mater or should I really focus on finding a job now? The M.Eng will cost me around $30,000 and I have $15,000 in loans now, so it's expensive but pretty manageable, especially if I can get a job with the kind of salaries my friends are commanding. I'll have contacts at all the tech giants, and a lot of the tech mediums, mostly people who will be starting in June. 

With the M.Eng, I'll be able to take some of the classes I missed out on before. If I do that, I think I would angle it towards working with data and do some kind of machine learning related Master's project. It would give me an extra summer for an internship, and it would give me a degree with CS in the title. I know that's not required, but it is probably looked on favorably, and it would be an advanced degree. This would also give me another six months for the job search. Also, I know objectively that I am good at CS projects. I usually do really well on projects in my classes and I really enjoy them, even if they come at the expense of sleep. But I still feel like a little bit of an outsider, because I'm coming from an outside field and I was born with a different set of chromosomes than 80% of the CS community. I think having the M.Eng would give me a confidence boost in that arena, which is not something to underestimate either.

On the other hand, if I can get a job in industry now, it will save me a serious amount of money. My parents have a business that isn't doing super well, and I would be out-earning them probably immediately, and could help them if shit ever seriously hit the fan, as opposed to being a drain on their resources. I really think I would love working, and there would probably be some benefits for me health-wise and stress-wise to have a change of scene, and weekends off.

Do you guys think that the Master's would be worth it in my case? "
14rkl0,10,2012-12-12,Graduating with a CS degree in December. Should I accept an internship offer?,HomeNucleonics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/14rkl0/graduating_with_a_cs_degree_in_december_should_i/,"Hey guys,

Here's my scenario. 

I'm graduating in about a week. Long story short, I didn't declare CS until the beginning of my junior year, but was able to fit all requirements of the major in with one extra semester tacked on to the end of my time as an undergrad. It was a lot of work, but it turned out nicely and was well worth it. So now I'm getting my diploma in December.

Anyhow, I haven't done much job hunting as of yet. I did have an interview yesterday for an internship with a smaller company. They liked me, and gave me an offer on the spot. It's basically for a web development position in a start-up like environment at a new branch of a moderately sized company. It would be from January 2nd to June 28th, 40 hours a week, $20/hour. Not so bad for an internship, I guess. But technically, since I'll no longer be a student, I'll be hired as a 1099, an independent contractor.

I have until January 2nd to accept this offer.

On the other hand, I have a few larger companies, like Epic, that have reached me through the university recruitment process and want to set up phone interviews. I've also got a handful of other companies that I'd like to apply to for full time positions, and have a few friends in the industry that have graduated before me and referred my resume, etc. I'm already on the path to some more interviews, for salaried positions.

My question is this: Would taking this internship now be detrimental at all to my long term career? Should I turn down this offer and spend these next few months on a full time job hunt?

Or should I take the ""no experience is bad experience"" mentality, and accept this internship in the meantime? I'll get more industry experience, more time to work on personal projects, and more time to prepare and apply for permanent positions. There's also the possibility that this company may offer me a full time position when my time as an intern comes to a end.

I spent this past summer interning at a smallish software company a short drive from my university, so I have some internship experience under my belt already. It was also mainly web application oriented work. 

Anyway, I guess I'm a bit reluctant to pass up this sort of short term stability of landing a paid position immediately after graduating, however temporary that position is. I feel like it could be used a stepping stone of sorts.

Is taking the January to June internship now while also using that time to apply for full time positions with a start date in July a wise move? Unfeasible?"

I came home from the Christmas party unwillingly. I would’ve stayed at Anna’s, but her parents were in town. My little apartment was not nearly as welcoming as it used to be, in the days before this Stitch creature came around. I keep thinking I’m hearing thumping, or windows opening, and it’s freaking me out. But I came home anyway. Maybe I just needed a break from the case. Yeah. For Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday I didn’t touch those boxes once. The Boss handed me a couple cases of convenience store robberies that were easier to solve than a game of Clue. It was a nice distraction from all the gruesome imagery I’d been forced to see those past few days. But unfortunately Wednesday had to come and Anna wanted to work on the case. “The sooner we start working again, the sooner it’ll be over,” she said trying to convince me to work with her. I sighed and put the coffee I was drinking down on my desk. Anna had put all the second victim related evidence on a table in a conference room. It was the first victim’s cousin, the man who’d stayed with her the night she was murdered, Bill.

I looked at the pictures of the crime scene first. He’d been killed in his room at the mental hospital we’d been holding him at. The scene was just as bloody as that of his cousins, if not more. The walls were covered in bloody hand prints and the bars on the windows weren’t bent, meaning Stitch must’ve found another way into the building. There were two beds in the room, one for Bill and one for his roommate; both were messy and blood stained. The red stood out vividly on the pristine white sheets. When I got to the pictures of his body, there was only half. His legs were lying on the floor, bones sticking out and sitting in a pool of his blood. His white hospital clothing was no longer white, but blood red, like Snow White’s lips. My hands began shaking as I looked at more and more pictures of his mangled and missing body and the blood soaked room. I felt my heart beating faster, like I was panicking. I didn’t know why though. Why should I panic? Stitch couldn’t find me…

“So what do you think we should do? We don’t really have any leads on who this guy is,” Anna said, bringing me out of my terrified state. I pulled myself together so I wouldn’t scare my partner.

“I don’t know,” I replied. Honestly, I didn’t want to keep working on this case. But what choice did I have? I couldn’t just leave Anna to handle it by herself. I couldn’t convince the Boss to let us do something else. When a case got to us, it was because no one else could handle it and solve it. We were the top… I guess that’s what comes with being the best detectives in the office. Some detective I am though can’t even look at the pictures without shaking. I’ve been having nightmares too…

“I was thinking maybe we could go interview the mental hospital staff who worked with Bill. We should probably go over the security tape footage and journal entries first though. Didn’t they diagnose him as PTSD?” Anna said.

“Yeah. I only took two psychology classes in college, but I remember that with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder a lot of the times therapists will tell their patients to relive the event a lot of times, so it won’t cause them that overbearing stress… So I imagine that’s what his journal will be full of. Just retellings of the story to help ease his anxiety, but I dunno. We probably should look through it,” I said. I secretly hoped she’d watch the videos on her own and let me deal with the journals. But knowing her, knowing our jobs, that wasn’t likely.

“Do you want to look at videos or journals first?” she asked. I shrugged and took a gulp of my now cold coffee.

“Let’s do this then,” I said. God damn it, I thought to myself as she put the four discs into four DVD players. They were all different cameras from the same period of time. For a while we just fast forwarded. Bill stayed in his room, writing feverishly, while his fellow hospital patients wandered from room to room to common room. He only left when a nurse came to bring him to his therapy session with the leading psychiatrist of the hospital. As it started to get dark, the patients made their way to their rooms. Bills roommate walked into their room. Bill was still writing in his journal with a painful expression on his face. His roommate looked at him concerned. There was no sound, but we saw him say something along the lines of “Are you okay?” Bill looked over at him and told him to “Shut up before that thing found him too” or something. His roommate looked away and leaned against the wall his bed was against. He played with his thumbs for a while. Meanwhile, the nurses wandered the halls, locking the doors for the night, making sure everything was okay.

After about twenty minutes of that, Bill and his roommate laid down for the night and fell asleep. It was dark and we couldn’t see much. The camera started turning to static and the images on the screens kept becoming distorted. The screens all blacked out and we were waiting for anything to happen. When the image returned, Stitch was standing in the middle of the hallway. He trudged down the hallway, looking through every room’s door window to see if Bill was there. While he systematically wandered the hall, Bill sprang to life and rushed from window to door and back again, looking for what woke him.

Stitch stopped looking for Bill and appeared to sniff the air. He took a couple big sniffs then turned his head. His face was looking towards the camera. You could see his teeth. His mouth wasn’t fully closed. His teeth were vile. Black and yellow and green and every color that teeth shouldn’t be. He opened his mouth and a little bit of blood fell out. He kept moving his head back and forth. As if he was listening for something.

He walked straight to Bills room with determination in his steps and opened the door without touching it. Bill screamed, waking up his roommate. Bill flipped over on his side springing off of his bed. He grabbed what turned out to be his writing pencil. The cameras began to turn to static and cut out again. We could see bits and pieces of what was happening – both of the roommates running around, Bills roommate eventually ran out of the room and Bill had stabbed Stitch in his back. We’re not sure how, but Bills hand and the weapon just went straight through, pushing out darkened blood and random chunks onto the floor. It looked like he was struggling to get his arm back. As if his arm got stuck inside Stitch’s body. Stitch grabbed him by the hair and whipped him with his rusty shackles, breaking his skin. 


After that, Stitch just stood there. Standing over Bill. Maybe it made him feel powerful? Well, could he even feel emotion? I don’t know. He stood above him while Bill screamed. I thought Stitch was raising his hand to strike or rip Bill’s flesh, but he didn’t. He rubbed his hands together, and then rubbed from his neck up to his face. And as fast as you could see a light turn on, his hand was on Bills face. He started rubbing it. Running his hand through his hair. Stitch started laughing at that point, and blood dripped on Bills face and clothes. It was then Stitch decided to attack. He tore bits of skin off his poor body and ate them like he’d never eaten before. He broke his body in half, just tore it in half, with inhuman strength. The blood started to really poor then. As all of Bills blood and guts spilled onto the floor, Stitch squatted down and started running his fingers along the edge of Bills skin where he ripped him in half. Stitch began eating his insides all the while it appeared he was laughing - just as he did in the first murder.

Stitch stood up and, well, just stood there. He stood there facing the corner until the morning sun started to peak in through the bars on the windows. He was mumbling to himself but since there was no audio in the security cameras, we couldn’t make out what he was saying without bringing in someone who could read lips.

I didn’t hear Anna making any sounds. I wondered if I was the only one having a hard time with this case. I looked over and she was crying silently. I moved my chair and put my arm around her and rubbed her shoulder while we watched. I tried to hold myself together for her. The door to the conference room slammed open, nearly giving both of us heart attacks.

“Johnson, Reynolds. Have an intern,” the Boss said, pushing a young man into the room. He left as soon as he’d come. We stood up. Anna wiped her eyes hastily and paused the videos.

“I’m Anna,” she said. “This is Ryan. I’m sorry you had to come at this time. We’re working on a pretty nasty case.”

“Oh, I don’t mind,” he said. “It’s bound to happen eventually, so I may as well get myself acquainted with murder. I’m John Freeman.” He held his hand out to us and shook both our hands.

“I think we’ve looked at enough evidence for now, Ryan. Want to go to the mental hospital now?” I said.

“Sure,” Anna said. We headed out the door, with our new intern at our heels. With his slightly unkempt blond hair and puppy-like blue eyes, he reminded me of a golden retriever. I felt bad ruining his innocence with this horrifying case. But that’s just what happens when you get involved with Police work…

~~

We made our way to West Seattle Psychiatric Hospital. It looked less welcoming than a medical hospital, just because of what lied within its walls. John looked at it with hesitation. I pushed him forward. If he wanted to be a cop, he’d have to learn to deal with situations he didn’t want to be in. And this case was about as bad as it gets, so if he could handle this, he could handle anything. We went into the building and found the nurses who were involved with Bill and his treatment. They wore white uniforms, like you saw in the movies and were as kind as you would expect nurses to be.

“Hi, Miss, I’m Ryan Johnson, this is my partner Anna Reynolds and our intern John Freeman. We’re working on Bill and his cousin’s case. We just have a few questions.”

“Of course,” the first nurse said, nodding with a smile.

“Did you notice anything out of the ordinary with Bills behavior before the attack? In the videos we saw him panicking moments before the killer came, but not before then. We don’t know what was normal or abnormal in his condition,” Anna asked.

“Well, he was always very agitated, always writing in his journal. The Doctor told him to write his story down at least once a day, but he did it almost constantly. We think maybe he was desperate to get better. Or get out. He kept saying he needed to keep moving or else ‘that thing’ as he called it would find him,” the second nurse said. Anna wrote some notes down.

“But you didn’t notice anything abnormal?” I asked again.

“No, sir, nothing. Just his usual behavior.”

“Did you see anyone lurking around the building at all? Like before the attack or in the days preceding it?” I asked.

“No, sir. Or if the killer was here he was very good at hiding,” the first nurse said.

“Did you see which way the killer went after the attack?” I asked. The nurses both became quiet and turned a little pale.

“No, sir,” the first nurse said quietly. “We saw him throw part of Bill out the window and follow, but we didn’t see which way he went once he was on the ground outside.”

“Thank you for your help,” I said, even though they really hadn’t given us anything useful. They nodded.

“Of course, any time,” the second nurse said. They turned around and continued with their work. We left in silence. Once we got into the car, I was irritated. How were we ever going to find this guy and put him behind bars (if that would even help…) if we couldn’t find a single lead?

“This is just great,” Anna said, sounding equally as frustrated. She sighed loudly.

“Let’s just work on this some more tomorrow,” I said. We drove back to the station. I got into my own car and drove back to my apartment reluctantly. Weird things had been happening ever since I first opened the boxes to this case. I kept hearing thumping at night and creaking like my windows were opening. But I wasn’t sure if I was just hearing things or not. I could never find the sources of the sounds. I opened my apartment door half expecting Stitch to be waiting for me. I’d been becoming paranoid, scared. Just fact that I was becoming paranoid and scared was scaring me.


 I walked into my apartment, finding no one inside. It was colder than I expected it to be. I wandered through all the rooms, only to find what I hoped I wouldn’t. My bedroom window was opened. I swear I locked it before I left. My hands shook as I closed it and my heart started to race. The panic was setting in again. I turned on all the lights in my apartment on my way to the kitchen to make some comfort food. I made a giant sandwich, grabbed a can of soda and some chips, and walked into the living room. Desperate to take my mind of that god awful case, I turned on the TV and put on a funny movie – Anchorman to be exact. I always loved Will Ferrell. I ate my food and soon my mind was far from the case. Until I heard the thumping. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. It rang in my ears, echoed in my mind, until I couldn’t take it. I ran to my bedroom and grabbed the ear plugs out of my bed side table. I shoved them into my ears to stop that thumping. My window was open again. I still heard the thumping. That god damn thumping. My heart was racing, my palms were sweating, and my hands were shaking so hard I could barely grab the phone. I dialed Anna’s number as quickly as I could.

“He-” she started.

“Anna! Can I stay over tonight?” I asked, cutting her off.

“Sure, what’s wrong, Ryan?” she asked.

“Please don’t tell me I’m not the only one having problems with this case,” I said, nearly begging.

“Are you freaking out too? I swear, I keep closing my windows, but they’re always open…” she said, trailing off.

“I’ll be over in ten minutes.” I hung up the phone and packed a bag as quickly as I could.

~~

We both actually got sleep that night. We drove to work in our separate cars in case I decided to sleep at my own house that night. Neither of us wanted to dive back into the case, but instead of Anna making me, it was John making us. He reiterated almost exactly what Anna had said. “Come on, guys, the sooner we start working the sooner it’ll be over!” He was annoyingly chipper all the time. But I was friendly, so was Anna. He put the tapes back in and pushed play. They started where we’d left off. John looked at them intently, taking notes about all the gruesome things Stitch was doing. I could hardly watch.

Stitch picked up Bills upper half like a bowling ball, sticking his fingers in Bills eyes and mouth. His hand was still embedded in Stitch’s disgusting naked body as he dragged him out into the hall. A trail of blood followed the poor dead man’s body. When Stitch reached the window, he tore Bills arm off and threw the rest of his body out the broken window. From the other angle, we could see Bills roommate still cowering in horror. Stitch ignored him and tore the arm from his chest. Dark goo-like blood came out with the arm, leaving a gaping hole where there should be something…anything… He didn’t even seem to care. He put Bills hand in his repulsive mouth and ate three of his fingers. I imagined the sound of crunching bones and shuddered. He smiles at the camera as he eats Bills remains. His teeth were rotten, his lips were still bleeding, his eyes still covered in sewn on flesh… The video cut out again and when the image returned, Stitch was gone and Bills arm was on the floor. His roommate was crying. I looked at Anna who looked back at me.

“Maybe you should just live with me for a while. I’m too scared to live alone,” she said quietly. I was glad to know I wasn’t the only one scared out of my wits. Maybe the two of us together would be enough to keep Stitch away. We’d start looking at victim number three soon. After we’d had some time to regain our sanity.

In October I signed for an internship in audit at a Big 4 company for October - March period. Now, I knew that it was going to be a challenge to reconcile that job with studies, but with limited number of subjects this semester I thought I could cope. Actually, I've managed to do this quite well for 2 months, but now, with finals coming up in January and the busy season beginning, I'm becoming sure that I can't make it.

As an intern, I now have a holiday break that will last until January 6th and I'm analysing my options, but I'm leaning towards resigning from the internship (I have no period of notice). That's because for me, studies still have priority over working, and I rather wasn't going to stay at the job after the internship anyway. I'd really like to finish this internship, because I feel I've been doing quite well at the job, but I'm trying to keep it real.

I need advice, because I suppose this situation won't do any good for my CV. It might prove that I can't work under time and stress pressure (which is not quite true, because I've done quite well in these two months, and it was far from easy for me). Furthermore, it's been my first proper work experience (until now it was mainly less serious internships and student associations). At the moment I'm looking around for another job with a more flexible schedule, as switching jobs would be better that merely resigning (well, I'm going to need money anyway...), but the outcome is not certain.

So, how bad is it? Will this put employers off? What's worst is that I'm really not bad at the job and I feel I've learned and developed really much. I just have to choose between my two responsibilities. "

150oru,6,2012-12-17,Colorado Unemployment Question,zoethezoologist,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/150oru/colorado_unemployment_question/,"I was fired last month, and I recently received notice that my claim for unemployment benefits was approved.

In the meantime, while job searching, I found two unpaid internship positions that I would love to take.  For background, I have a biology degree, but I was not using it at my last job as a sales associate.  I actually liked that job, and I worked there for over a year.  I didn't feel motivated to find another job more relevant to my degree (while I was working at my sales job) probably because I was afraid of failure, and my husband makes enough money for me not to worry about it.  Getting fired (though no fault of my own) really was a kick in the ass in the right direction.

Anyways, now I have two internship opportunities that I am very excited about.  Both are relevant to my degree and life goals.  I'd like to take both, but that would amount to working unpaid full time.

I have two questions:

1. I have no interest in scamming unemployment.  I plan on taking both of these internships whether I can continue claiming it or not.  These internships will both start in January.  Is it okay to continue to claim benefits even though I know what I am doing, but they won't start for awhile?  I can't reasonably start another job for just a couple weeks without lying to potential employers about my time frame.

2. Is there any way to continue to claim unemployment benefits while I try out these internships for a couple months?  Like I said, I have no interest in scamming the system, I just want to know what is available for me.  It is very likely I will get a much better job after completing either of these internships, so I would think the state would want to encourage me to do them, but I don't know.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!"

Basically the offer is for $46k (negotiated from $42k), with a $10k end of year bonus. 50% paid health/dental/vision (being my first job I thought your company paid the whole thing, is this wrong?), and three weeks paid vacation. Is this a competitive offer for San Francisco? I have a rent controlled apartment so I can survive on it, but I will still be living pay check to paycheck which is what I wanted to avoid being an engineer. 

Glassdoor says the average for a product engineer is near $90k, while mechanical engineer I is $70k. 

So what was your offers like when you first graduated and also please list where you are from and your GPA/prior experience if you are comfortable. Am I being taken advantage of? Or should I be happy I got anything with such a low GPA and no experience? Also how long should I work here before I have enough experience to get a really good well paying job?"

14z49w,3,2012-12-16,My girlfriend has 0 motivation to get a job after she graduates. We've been together for 3 years and we both graduate in May. HELP ME,WhatTheActualFuckWom,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/14z49w/my_girlfriend_has_0_motivation_to_get_a_job_after/,"So, this is a throwaway because my friends know my real account username. 

My girlfriend and I are both graduating this May. She is an accounting major, I am an engineering major. 

My girlfriend hasn't had an internship or even sought to get any workplace applicable experience. She is seemingly content with being a waitress. That's not what I'm mad about, if she wants to wait tables for the rest of her life because it makes her happy then I am all for it. What I hate is that she was fired from the last one because she has no understanding of the word punctuality.

She has yet to apply for a single job for when she graduates. 

Now, I fully intend to be with her for a very long time. I feel like with social norms, the man is supposed to be the head of the house and be the main provider and all that stuff. That's fine. But, I have 3 younger siblings, all of whom will be going to college. My sister is a freshman currently, then my brother starts as soon as she is done, and then my youngest sister starts a year after that. So, in all, my parents are helping to pay for 3 years of 1 kid at college, 1 year of double, 3 years of 1, 1 year of 1, 3 years of double, 1 year of 1. That is 16 separate years of college. I fully intend to pay my parents back for how much they have helped me, so I feel like I won't have much money for the forseeable future. However, I also have to start paying back my loans to my parents so that my other siblings can also go to college ASAP. So my money would  be going to that first. 

I feel that if me and my girlfriend end up married, I am going to have to pay for a house, car, kids, their school, my school, among everything else. The fact that she apparently has no motivation scares the shit out of me. I don't have any idea how I would support all of us.

Here's the kicker. I have talked to her about this before. Multiple times. Our current argument is the fifth time about this subject, and her response has always been ""I dont know why I havent, I just haven't"". I find this completely unacceptable. 

So, what do you suggest I do?"

When client systems started to fill up, operations would let us know and it was our duty to clean it up, due to it being client data. It made sense, and it was normally a pretty easy task.

One night, the boards lit up with alerts from our biggest, most important platform. Huge, high volume clients on this one, and it was completely down. We had no clue why; a call was started and the problem escalated. After an hour, it was uncovered what happened...

An intern was performing filesystem cleanup. He was unaware that the enormous .db file he zipped was a live database. 

Aside from losing the task of filesystem cleanup (which we really aren't sad about), we come into work the following Monday with a lot of our normally used commands now locked down. 

Way to go, intern."

They know I am graduating in May, but the topic never came up that I am **not** graduating with a computer science degree, I am graduating with a general studies bachelor's degree because I changed my major from technology education and couldn't afford an extra semester (only need four more classes, already took sixteen in Comp Sci department). I am still getting a minor in Comp Sci.

It will absolutely come up at some point (whether on my resume or in the interview), and I feel my explanation for why is very valid, but do you think this will be a roadblock?

Worked for company all summer as intern.

TL:DR; over.

Now, what are some good tips for CASUAL interviews? I assume they believe I am technically proficient, as I worked for them for 15 weeks and they are not asking to do a formal interview, which I did to get the internship and they are known for doing--the most recent manager was hired after a three-hour technical interview.

They obviously picked a casual place and specifically told me not to dress up. So what can I do to help make a good impression, considering there will be little to no technical questions for an interview for a very technical job?"

[What is the most interesting patient that you have had (good or bad\)?  What is the biggest misconception about your profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i2p4n?context=5)|Most interesting patient was a young girl with borderline personality disorder. She was abused at home, lots of self-harm and suicide attempts. These patients carry a huge stigma with them, they are seen as needy, attention seeking and downright destructive. But she was the sweetest girl, with some of the biggest issues I've ever seen. We could be playing cards, having a good time, she'd excuse herself to go to the bathroom. 5 minutes later I'd find her with bleeding arms, holding a razor, in her room. She spent weeks in our ward, because of the suicide risk, where most people are discharged in a few days. We managed to find her an apartment, so she could get away from her abusive family. She now does outpatient councelling and is doing quite well. She taught me a lot, especially about seeing behind peoples diagnosis.
 |The biggest misconception is that we're these prison guards watching over a bunch of lunatics. There is a lot of caring involved with what we do, and everyone I know is in this profession because they want to help some of the weakest patients in healthcare.
[I'm bipolar, but I don't have the resources to get professional help. Yay America.  My question is, what behavior changes could I make to become more stable?  Anything I can do myself, really.  I'm not dangerous, but it's hard to live like this sometimes =\](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i3cpe?context=5)|For bipolar patients, what we recommend is a strict regime. Go to bed at the same time every night, maintain a healthy diet, excercise 3-4 times a week and no alchohol. Try to live as stress-free of a life that you can. Lack of sleep and alcohol use are the most common triggers for mania that I've seen.
[Have you ever been in physical danger at work? What steps must you take to be safe at work? Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i2f5a?context=5)|I have been assaulted on multiple occasions. Worst injury was a busted lip. I was in the intensive care unit of the acute ward, and we were two nurses watching a psychotic patient with a known history for violence. He spent an abnormal amount of time in the bathroom so I knocked and asked what was up. His answer was to kick open the door and hit me in the face. I was kind of stunned, but me and my coworker managed to subdue him. Pushed the alarm, 5 others rushed in and we had to put him in manual restraints because he wouldn't calm down.  We all wear alarms, and you are required to go through a safety course where you learn various defensive maneuvers as well as techniques for subduing patients. We do risk assesments of all unknown patients and those who have a history of violence, but sometimes you do get surprised. 
[If your worst injury was a a busted lip, what was the umm, ""least worst"" injury? A paper cut? Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7idjsn?context=5)|I've been lucky. I've had coworkers who have been stabbed, and gotten cracked skulls. 90 % of nurses in acute psych report experiencing violence in the last year, and it is a real issue.
[Also, I didn't see if you answered this elsewhere, but which European country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7idjsn?context=5)|""Least worst"" is probably the days where I manage to deescalate a situation so no one gets hurt.
[What is the most interesting/fun dance you've seen done by a patient? And did you ever feel like joining them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i34c3?context=5)|Whenever we have a bipolar patient in a manic episode we see a lot of... creative means of expression. Funniest was a lady who used to take off her pants, tie the legs together and put them on her head. She'd dance like some kind of elephant. She had a lot of ""tribal"" delusions. I join in whenever I can. If you want to build good relations, you have to be willing to make a fool of yourself.
[Do you get drug tested?  Are the patients' medications pretty well secured?  Have there been issues with staff abusing prescription meds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i3de0?context=5)|In my country, drug testing employees is regarded as an invasion of privacy and is illegal. Patients medications are in a locked room which only nurses have access to. When you go in you swipe a card, so it registrers that you've entered. All class A and B drugs(like opiates and benzos) are counted over once a day, and if anything is missing there is an investigation. Haven't seen anyone abuse it in psych. When I did my clinicals in a med/surg unit there was a staff member fired for stealing narcotics, but that's the only time I've ever seen it.
[What made you want to do this for a living?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i2ube?context=5)|I've always been curious about our mind, and I experimented a lot of hallucinogens in my youth.  Then two of my friends had psychotic breaks, whereupon one of them got a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, and what he tells me he is experiencing is heartbreaking. So both curiousity and a desire to help people who need it. I got a temp job in a assisted living house for schizoprhenics and found out that I'm damn good helping people in crisis, so I went for my nursing degree. Haven't regretted it a second.
[Was the paranoid schizophrenia a result of takinf hallucinogens or was there a trace of it already in your friends family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i9whv?context=5)|Family history of mental illness, and in retrospect he was displaying some prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. But the first psychotic break was triggered by drugs.
[I wore one of those for my student internship, and I have never felt so conscious of being attacked in my life! Anyway, what is you opinion on ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy\)? Would your hospital advocate the use of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i3pe5?context=5)|I'm a huge fan of ECT. I've seen it work miracles on suicidally depressed patients where nothing else has done anything. It's nothing like the movies portray. Patients are sedated, given muscle relaxants and the whole thing is over in half an hour. 8-12 treatments and they are like a new person. Worst side effects are memory loss and headaches, and who wants to remember being so depressed that all they want to do is kill themself?
[Wow.  I've had ECT.  It ruined my writing career completely (had it against my will\), and they left me with nothing.  I would suggest going and having ECT yourself if you think it's so great.  Go ahead, have 12 sessions (I had 10, monopolar\).  And then come back and do an AMA.  **EDIT:  OH IM SORRY, DID I SUGGEST HE TAKE HIS OWN MEDICINE BEFORE RECOMMENDING IT?**  Fucking idiots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i4dsk?context=5)|It pains me to hear that, especially that it was done against your will. In my country you cannot be treated with ECT involuntarily. While I cannot speak for myself, the patients I've seen treated with ECT have reported back that it's been a life saver, but you provide an important perspective. It is a treatment that is not without it's risk, but most of the time, the benefit does outweigh the risk.
[I'm curious about the staff structure/dynamic in your hospital. Is there one Psychiatrist working there or multiple? What kind of contact do you have with him/her, do you take meeting to discuss patients? Who are others besides Psychiatrist and Nurses who work at the hospital, what kind of contact do you have with them? Anything else interesting about the staff there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i32t9?context=5)|Acute ward has one psychiatrist, and two residents who are in training to becoming psychiatrists as well as medical doctors who are doing required rotations in psych. Every day we have a meeting, nurses and pdocs where we go over the patients. We share our observations, since we're the ones acually spending time with the patients, and they evalute treatment plans, medications and so on. All councelling sessions have both a nurse and a pdoc present. The most interesting thing is that unlike most other areas in healthcare the nurses and doctors actually feel like a team. We are seen as much more equal than a nurse in a med/surg unit for example. Our opinions hold a lot more weight.
[A few questions for you here: i\) Do you truly believe in personality disorders? ii\) What's the difference between in sociopath, and a psychopath? And one last question, if someone is diagnosed with schizophrenia, or any other disorder what are the symptoms that help define that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i46i2?context=5)|1) I think personality disorders are a convenient way of classifying a cluster of symptoms, which is necessary for both research and treatment. I disagree with the terminology, because it implies that somehow your personality is broken, when most of the times it's a combination of both biological as well as psychological factors. I think borderline personality disorder is just as much of a disease as schizophrenia. Newer research implies that people with BPD have an overactive emotional system, and that it's not just a matter of personality.
 |2)We don't use either of those terms anymore. It's either dyssocial personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder depending on if you're subscribing to ICD-10 or DSM IV.
 |3) You are looking for both positive symptoms and negative ones. Positive symptoms are things that are not normally present, like auditory hallucinations and delusions.  Negative symptoms are things like being socially withdrawn, loss of motivation and depression. You can look up a convenient list of symptoms for the different psychiatric disorders if you google ICD-10 or DSM IV.
[What do you feel are the best ways to educate the general public about mental illness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i4lve?context=5)|I think we as mental health professionals have to be more open about what we do. Use social media and try to reach out. Be open to your friends and family. Stress the fact that bipolar disorder is no different than diabetes type 1, in that they are both diseases that the person can't help that they have.
 |I also think that kids in elementary school should have mandatory classes about mental health, and especially about things they should look out for. A lot of mental disorders manifest at a young age, and if we were better as a society in catching them early, we could prevent a lot of suffering.
 |A lot of the stigma mental illness carries with it is because of the way it's portrayed in movies and tv-series. People see Shutter Island or One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest and think that's the reality in todays psychiatric institutions. While I do get that it wouldn't be a very good movie following me at work for a day(it would be a lot of coffee drinking, talking and cardplaying), I wish we could somehow have a more balanced representation in the media, but I think the change starts with us as individuals.
[Bipolar person here, thanks for doing what you do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i8bvb?context=5)|You are very much welcome. I hope that you are having a great day!
[What is the saddest thing you have ever seen? What did you learn the most from? Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i8ila?context=5)|I think some of the saddest things I ever see are the young people who have been abused throughout their childhood, now struggling just to stay alive. They have so much pain inside that the only way they can cope is by cutting themselves, because the physical pain is easier to handle.
 |I also struggle a lot when we discharge some of our chronic schizophrenic patients, because I know that we are sending them to a lonely home were they'll probably only watch TV and smoke cigarettes until they decide to go off their medicine, whereupon they end up in the psych ward again.
 |I learn from almost everyone I meet, but there is a special place in my heart for patients with borderline personality disorder. They've taught me to be non-judgemental and open about my own feelings, which is useful everywhere you go in life.
[As a schizophrenic who has only left the house today to buy some milk, I can relate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i902i?context=5)|I'd put it in another way. Patients with borderline personality disorder often have an intense need to be liked and validated, because they often feel very insecure about themselves. They also have a lot of intense negative emotions about themselves, that they project onto others as a defensive mechanism.
[With borderline PD patients, isn't one of their traits that they are very manipulative and thrive off getting people to like them?  Two of my former girlfriends had borderline PD and I know what a rollercoaster ride it can be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i902i?context=5)|It can be very difficult for the people around them, but I try to remember that it is symptomatic for the disease, not the person.
[What is the craziest thing a patient has done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i78s0?context=5)|Funny crazy: A manic patient put his pillows and clothes in a bundle in a chair so it kinda looked like a person. Put an orange on the ""head"" in his hoodie sweater and drew a smiley face on it. We heard frenzied knocking from his room, so naturally I went to investigate. I open the door and see mr. orange in a chair, and hear giggling from inside a closet. I just responded with, ""I don't care what the hell you two are doing, just keep the noise down."" The patient spent the next two hours admiring his work.
 |Sad crazy: A young woman had her first psychotic break. She spent two months isolated in her apartment, only eating rice and performing a whole bunch of rituals because God was telling her to through the radio. Some of those rituals involved rolling around in her own excrement. After two months she threw the radio out the window, where it landed on a car and broke a window, which is how she was discovered and brought to us. The reason why she did it: ""I realized God wouldn't be telling me to do all these nasty things, so it had to be the devil""."" She spent around 2 weeks in our ward, thinking that there was poison in the food and water, before she finally agreed to try some antipsychotics, which luckily worked very well.
[Do you use any therapies with them other than sedatives? Are any effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i31ga?context=5)|Depending on diagnoses we use a wide variety of therapies. In everyday life, we use a concept called milieu therapy, where we try to create an environment for learning in the institution. We try to play games like chess and cards, encourage painting or other creative endeavours. Cognitive therapy is used a lot, and we've just started using mentalization based therapy with our borderline patients which has a very good documented effect against suicide attempts and self harm. I'd say treatment is about 50/50 when it comes to therapy and medication, and none of them are effective without the other.
[If a patient says something inappropriate, are you allowed to react? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i38ak?context=5)|Yes. If it's just me and the patient, I'll let it slide most of the time. If it's in a common area with other patients, we have to correct inappropriate comments and behavoiur. If the patient doesn't comply, we have to remove them from the common areas. Situations where you have to correct patients are coincidentally the situations where you are most likely to encounter violent behaviour, so we are very wary when doing so.
[As a former psychadelic user and a person in the mental health field. Do you think the use of paychadelics on certain patients could yield a positive outcome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i49bb?context=5)|There were some interesting trials in the 60's where people with schizophrenia were given LSD with good results. I think it is a direction that could be worth looking into, but I am hesitant to recommend it to anyone. Having seen a lot of people come in with drug-related psychosis, mostly amphetamines, but sometimes hallucinogens I think it is a big risk to take.
 |While not strictly a psychedelic, the current research into giving MDMA to people with PTSD, combined with therapy, is looking very promising and I do hope it gains more momentum in psychiatry.
[X to people with PTSD? I don't know if I should be excited or confused. How would that work, with the risk of serotonin dipping, paranoia/anxiety, and depression? IIRC the effects last approximately 4 hours, and popping it 3-4 times a day just sounds incredibly dangerous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7iegsy?context=5)|It is not supposed to be a regular thing.  In the studies MDMA is taken in a couple of sessions with a therapist, and the patient revisits the trauma while in a positive state of mind, in attempt to lessen the guilt and shame which is often felt. So you are not trying to correct a chemical imbalance, but instead, trying to change the patients thought processes about themself.
[Would the sessions be long, like, long enough to make sure they don't try to off themselves after a couple hours? I may be in the minority, but I've never felt guilt from the abuse that caused my PTSD, nor have I really felt shame. I can't really imagine successfully processing the events/triggers/shit that comes up in flashbacks or gives me panic attacks/etc while on a high, either. That sounds a bit counter productive. Are there any limitations to it/scenarios that seem to be more successful than others? (Example, rape victim vs Iraq vet, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ifh6i?context=5)|I can't really comment as I've only read about the studies. I recommend that you google MDMA+PTSD, and you should find a lot of information. 
[Have you ever thrown a patient into a bath tub?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i558j?context=5)|Haha, no I haven't. But there are times I wish that I could. Sometimes patients have delusions about showering/bathing, like ""If I go in there, the water will fill me up and I will drown in myself."" or ""Those are gas chambers, not showers."" Which causes them to refuse washing themself for weeks and weeks. While I do understand their refusal, I wouldn't shower if I thought it would kill me, we have to think of the other patients as well. The smell can be very, very bad. While we can't physically force patients to bathe, we nurses can get quite insistent and sometimes I feel like we are just bothering them untill they can't resist anymore.
[I'm strongly considering pursuing psychiatric nursing- I'm drawn to the amount of interaction between patient and nurse. What advice could you give me about deciding on the profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i75da?context=5)|There is nothing better than hands-on experience. So I'd approach the section leader of your closest psychiatric hospital and ask if you can shadow someone, or even better, if you can pick up some shifts as an assistant. In my experience, those who work in psych appreiciate people who are straightforward so just be honest and say you are considering becoming a psych nurse.
 |The patient/nurse interaction is what I enjoy the most as well, so I think you've got a good starting point there. In my clinicals in a med/surg unit I felt like a replacable procedure-doing cog in a wheel, while in psychiatry I feel like I can actually make a difference in peoples lives by being who I am. 
[What do you think about the heavy use of sedatives in mental health?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i63oa?context=5)|Most of the time it's necessary, and clearly the best thing for the patient.  Sometimes I think we are too quick to reach for them. There are situations where I'd rather not have given sedatives, if we'd have the resources to take care of the patient without them. But we don't have enough nurses/assistants on staff to be able tie up 4-5 people on one patient for an extended amount of time, and calming someone can take hours.
 |Understand that it is very rarely that we forcibly administrate sedatives, we have to have permission from a doctor to do it. Most of the time the patients come to us and ask for something to help calm them down. Often we have to limit their intake, to prevent them from becoming addicted.
[Hi! Thanks for doing this! Do you think that there are patients being held there who shouldn't be there? In other words, are there people in mental hospitals who are mentally sound? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i30ut?context=5)|Not really. In the 50's-70's there were a lot of abuse within the psychiatric institutions. People being held against their will, and being treated horribly. After some really that powerful laws have come into effect which make it very difficult to actually commit people against their will. Too difficult many will say. I think the pendulum has swung from one extreme to the other, and now there are a lot of times where we have to discharge patients that really should be in the ward, because we can't hold them against their will. Then we get phone calls from distressed relatives who thought their son/daughterwould finally get some help, only to hear that we can't treat them since they don't want to be there. And these are patients with psychosis and delusions, but if they aren't a ""clear danger against themselves or others"" we can't hold them.
[Do you know anyone who uses EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\) in their therapy? It's very intriguing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i7lu4?context=5)|I don't have any personal experience with it, but we sometimes refer patients to trauma-clinics that specialize in treating PTSD, where EMDR can be a part of the treatment protocols.
[Can you say more about what the maximum security ward is like? How is it different/dangerous? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i93rj?context=5)|While the acute ward is focused on treating the patients, the main focus in the maximum security ward is keeping society safe. While of course trying to help the patients as much as we can, but safety takes top priority and trumps rehabilitation. The patients there are either sentenced to treatment after serious crimes(murder, arson, pedophilia), on a judicial observation in a trial, or deemed too dangerous to treat in regular security wards. But there is possibility for schooling in the ward, learning things like woodworking or fixing cars, but the patients have to move through a system of risk clearances before they are allowed to participate.
 |The patients there have a history of violence, and are often very psychotic. This means that at any given time there has to be more personell then there are patients, even at nights, and it is required to have a 70/30 male/female split among the staff to ensure the safety of everyone. It's a very different vibe to any other psychiatric unit. On calm days we even get an hour off to work out and lift weights.
 |Most of these patients will never be discharged on their own, most of them are discharged to specialized assisted homes, with staff 24/7.
[What would you say qualifies as 'too dangerous to treat in regular security wards'? Is there any way to end up in one of those wards without committing a crime like arson/murder/rape/etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ieah1?context=5)|There are patients who have delusions of the nature that ""everyone is out to get me, I have to defend myself."" who regularly attack staff and other patients. So in a regular ward they will probably spend a lot of time in manual restraint, or heavily sedated. In a specialized security ward, they are much better at taking care of patients like this, with staff that are trained in how to avoid violence. We had a patient who had been manually restrained 1/3 of the days in a year, in a regular ward. After he was transferred to the security ward, this changed to about once or twice a month.
[What do you think about shutter island?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i6v23?context=5)|Very entertaining movie. 
[Is it true what they say about patients with Borderline personality disorder?Are they really as manipulative and hostile as they're made out to be? Have you met one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7iauvk?context=5)|I have met a lot of patients with BPD, and they are people like everybody else. I find that if you treat them without the suspicion and judgement that comes with thoughts like ""She has BPD, she's probably very manipulative."" you'll find that it's largely a misconception. We try to hide our prejudice, but I find that it translates to our behaviour no matter what, and people pick up on that and act accordingly.
[Thank you for doing this AMA.  People need to be more understanding of mental health issues...it's not like people choose to have this disease, and it is a disease.  Question, I have a adolscent neighbor who I have always been a ""second mom"" to...(I am female as is she\) I was the one she talked to when she felt there was noone else.  Many things happened that began to scare me very much (she is diagnosed borderline or BPD, they haven't made a definite decision yet\) I was scared enough to stop the relationship...can borderlines or bpds be violent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ia0c0?context=5)|In my experience, people with borderline personality disorder are only violent against themself. I hope that you keep in touch with her. Patients with this disorder have a tendency to burn out their support network, which leaves them feeling terribly alone. I've heard countless times of that ""One person that kept me from committing suicide, since s/he didn't give me up."" 
[I have a friend that was admitted to the psych ward due to suicide tendencies and major depression. I would like to find out how long would my friend be in there? What is the average length of stay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7imaaz?context=5)|It varies. If it's a deep depression it might be for a while, especially if it's your friends first time committed. It will probably take some time to find medication that works. Your friend will probably have to stay until they are sure that s/he won't try to harm themself, which can take weeks.   What you can do as a friend is to be there, and show that you are not afraid. Being suicidal is one of the loneliest feelings in the world, and you can help alleviate that by showing that you care. It doesn't take much, a visit, a phonecall or some kind words in an SMS. It sounds like a cliché, but just be there for your friend. 
[I knew that my friend denied close family members to visit but not friends. Is it legal for the hospital to deny family members? It is really possible to deny visitation from someone? What can I do as a friend to help my friend cope? Any advice on what my friend can do by their own to get better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7imaaz?context=5)|You can't force people to accept visitors, but I can assure you that the staff there is most likely trying to get your friend to allow their family to visit.
[Thanks for the reply. It's my friend's first admission. And I try to be there everyday. What causes the loneliness feeling? Is it the chemical imbalance or a variety of factors? Also, I noticed during medication time, all the patients are given meds one at a time, so that the nurses can monitor and ensure that all the patients swallow their meds. Is this normal? Or is because most patients won't take their meds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7immo5?context=5)|It's hard to say since we don't actually know exactly what causes depression, but my guess is that it's a combination. When you are suicidal it feels like the world would be better off without you, and you can just imagine lonely and isolating that must be like.
 |Medication: Two main reasons for observing, some patients don't want to take the medications. Often these are psychotic patients. Others try to hide away enough medication so that they can overdose later.
[Huh. I didn't know that patients would hide meds to OD. My friend is now in a locked ward. Meaning to say the entire floor has only  1 main entrance and only the nurses can buzz visitors in. As you mention in other posts, some patients are in the acute ward for a few days before being moved to another ward. Does that mean that if my friend moves to a more lax security ward, it means that her condition is better? Or is it that my friend no longer poses a threat to his/herself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7imxd6?context=5)|If she is moved into a more lax ward, she will at least have been found to not be dangerously suicidal anymore. But she might still be very depressed. Often we are wary with deeply depressed patients when they are starting to get a bit better. Depression can steal the energy needed to perform suicide, and it can be a long climb up. So sometimes we see patients mood improve just enough that they find the energy to attempt suicide again.
[Thanks so much for the insight. My friend also told me she was having weird dreams after she's been on this new antidepressant. At first, I was not very concern because I read on the BNF that those are some of the common side effects and that she seems to able to tell if it was a dream or if it's real. However, these few days she does not seem to be able to tell which is which. I'm worried that she might hallucinate or have a psychotic episode. Should I inform the nurse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7inb4l?context=5)|As you have discovered, vivid dreams is a very normal side effect from anti-depressants. I think it's a good idea is to encourage your friend to talk about the side effects to her nurse, but I wouldn't worry about psychosis. The vivid dreams usually go away after a week or two.
[Have you ever been scared by some of the patients in maximum security? (Or minimum for that matter\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i9095?context=5)|I get scared more often in the acute ward to be honest. The settings in maximum security are so geared towards safety that it's very rare that I actually get nervous.
 |In the acute ward, it can be very stressful to sit in the intensive care unit alone with patients that you don't know very well. While the alarm means that help is only 1 minute away, it's possible to do quite a lot of damage in that time. 
[What are some characteristics you believe an individual should have to work in a psychiatric field such as yours? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7iale7?context=5)|Being able to keep calm, or at least appear calm, in all circumstances, and having the ability to transfer this to your patients. You have to have a lot of patience, be interested in the people you meet and it helps if you like talking, and hearing peoples stories. It's also important to be secure in yourself. You'll hear a lot of derogatory comments, might be attacked, and you'll have to endure a lot of painful transference, but you can't allow this to effect how you treat your patients.
[From one mental health worker to another - thank you for the AMA! Education for the population may help reduce the stigma of mental illness, and people may feel less insecure about getting treatment. You are doing good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ig7sq?context=5)|That is a very interesting question. My opinion is that if the person sees their condition as a problem, we should do our best to help them, regardless if there is a diagnosis involved. However I do think that many primary care doctors are way to quick to prescribe SSRI's for what is in most cases a temporary low mood, and not a pathological depression. If we had enough resources in mental health, these people could be referred to a talk with a psychologist or psychiatric nurse and it would have just as much of an effect as medication, without the side effects.
[I've always wondered this. Do you think that we over diagnose mental illness? For example: cyclothymia. How much of what is diagnosed is just part of the human experience, and how much of it do you think is 'mental illness'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ig7sq?context=5)|However, most of the patients I interact with are severely ill. It would be interesting to pose the same question to a community mental health nurse.
[What is your opinion on the stigma generally associated with people having mental illnesses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7ia3z8?context=5)|I hate it. People could be spared a lot of suffering if there was more acceptance in society for mental illnesses. For some reason we've decided to treat diseases in the brain differently than diseases in the heart or lungs, and to be honest at times it enfuriates me.
[I'm getting ready to start a 2 year masters program and I'm curious how much you make? Not exactly a tactful question but I'd like to get an idea of income in the different fields. Feel free to PM if you'd like this info to remain private. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15091y/iama_male_psychiatric_nurse_who_works_in_both_an/c7i85fa?context=5)|I make enough for a comfortable living. It's a lot less then an engineer with the same amount of education, but I do okay. A lot of shift work, overtime, weekends and holidays.
 |In some years when I grow tired of working shifts I'll move into teaching which pays a lot better and has nicer hours.

What should I expect as a Business Analyst? Any noob tips or is this baptism by fire?

No stress, very easy.  


I have the opportunity to go back to school and be guaranteed a job making $40-50/hr after an internship.  (ask via PM I won't answer questions about it in public)

It's going to be super long hours, and super high stress, and I am 99.9% sure I'll hate it. 

That being said all the jobs in its income bracket are ones I would hate to be honest. 

I am not aware of any jobs in my area that I would enjoy that pay better, I'll have to move to the city for better paying jobs, and then because of the increased cost of living and added expenses I'll need a minimum of $25 an hour to make it barely worth my time. 

What are your thoughts on the matter?"

Checked Google for quicker ways to do this and stumbled upon digital toner and probe kits such as [this](http://www.amazon.com/Fluke-Networks-MT-8200-60A-IntelliTone-Pro/dp/B0001FSCVI/ref=pd_sim_hi_3).

I discovered weed and slowly but surely made one poor decision after another and ended up failing 3 of my classes (D's), which I now have to retake next semester.

My GPA was above a 3 before, I was valedictorian of my high school, and got an AA when I graduated. Now I also cannot apply for a scholarship which would have paid off my last 2 years and I was sure I would have gotten, if not for my idiocy. This might also prevent me from going abroad with my friends, which I've been planning for a year. Let's not even think about internships.

I am the definition of fail, and have only myself to blame.On the bright side, I am with my family for the holidays and will not let this be ruined by that. I accept the consequences of my actions, and will truly be an idiot if I do not learn from my mistakes.

I expect this to be lost among the other submissions but I just wanted somebody to know. I feel shame for the first time in several years. In retrospect though, this is the worst my life has gotten in several years and I understand that many, many, many others have it way worse. So in a way I'm glad for the life/opportunities I have. It's people like me that give the herb a bad name, and I never thought I'd be one of them.

But there's hope. A fresh semester, and a goal to get all A's. I'll try my damnedest to make you guys proud.

TL;DR I discovered &amp; abused weed, fail my classes, so a good amount of my plans were set back/destroyed, making my future that much dimmer.

I'm a recent graduate with a BA in Animation and I've been looking for a job in my field (or anything related) for over 7 months now. All my dreams of finding a job out of college have been slowly destroyed by each rejection email that I have gotten over these months. 


I have applied to close to a hundred jobs now, and the only thing I have going for me at the moment is an unpaid internship at a media firm with no promise of full-time hire when the internship is over.


I have lived by myself, without any income for 5 months now. My boyfriend has been supporting me financially by paying for my rent and buying my food. I don't feel like myself anymore because of this. It's not right to me that he should pay for my rent/ expenses, and it makes me feel 'kept'. I feel like I am immensely in his debt, and that the relationship is not even anymore.


My boyfriend has always supported and encouraged me, but throughout this time he has been saying things that aren't realistic for me (""Oh, don't worry! Somebody will find your art and hire you right away."" or ""You can just open your own animation studio!""). He has never had to look for a job because his family owns food businesses. I feel like he doesn't know the severity of my situation. When I accepted the offer for my current internship position, he didn't take it seriously, joking about how he could just come to work with me and hang out. I understand his view on this unpaid internship (that I feel like I might be overqualified for), but it beats sitting at home every day and doing nothing with my life.


In the end, I feel like I have the right skills and passion to work in my field, but nobody seems to want to give me a chance to prove that.


So to conclude my rambling, this depression is really kicking my butt. I really hope that I am not the only one here who feels this way, and I hope that some of you nice people could give me some advice on how to deal with all of this...

154q1j,2,2012-12-19,Psych Grad: Wants to get back into CS,poSer_programmer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/154q1j/psych_grad_wants_to_get_back_into_cs/,"Been doing some research here and elsewhere. Here's my dilemma:
I graduated 5 years ago with a B.S. in Psychology. I've been working with adolescents who are sometimes violent. I'm at a point where compassion fatigue has set in and I've also had an average of one serious injury per year working with this population. Instead of doing grad school in Psychology to become a therapist, I want to return to my roots of programming. Low pay and health risks have showed me that I just can't keep doing this long-term.

My past experience: In the 4th grade I wrote a text adventure in BASIC. In high school I worked on a few small websites when PHP Nuke was big for forums, and Played with C++ on a popular MMO emulator. In the early 2000s I wrote some small apps in C for Palm Pilots/Handsprings. My point is that programming is familiar to me. 

My Recent experience: I took a few courses in SQL and Database Design at the local CC, wasn't able to finish the finals due to work issues. I've been playing with Android programming, Learning Java (just about ready for the 1ZO-803). I've also written a website in PHP white I'm re-writing in OOP(I never learned OOP when I was younger). In addition, I've built an Ubuntu Server box which will eventually host my portfolio, including small web-apps and downloadables for Android or other small Java programs. 

So my question is this: Should I go back and get a second B.S. In a CS major, try to get into a Master's program, or just keep building my portfolio for now and start applying to internships or Jr. level positions? Whatever you guys advise, I will continue doing my self-directed learning. For reference, I live in the Salt Lake area. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses so far."

154k52,18,2012-12-19,"Gave 2 week notice...since have heard bosses talking very negatively about me, very openly. Need advice please (apologize in advance for length).",msmack,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/154k52/gave_2_week_noticesince_have_heard_bosses_talking/,"To preface: I work in the entertainment industry. Namely I do a variety of jobs relating to the production of television. I am currently working as an Associate Producer for a small network that does most of its production in-house (For anyone with any interest it should be fairly simple to figure out who based on some of my history, but the info is pretty irrelevant to my current situation). I just gave my notice and will be leaving this job to get back into freelancing, starting right away working as a Jr. Shooter/Producer on an adventure show. I have been here 2 &amp; 1/2 months. Prior to this I was a Freelancer who got work of all different lengths doing all different things.

My need for advice comes from the job I am leaving rather than the one I am going to. Since giving my notice last week (well ahead of the expected in my industry) it has become quite clear they weren't terribly happy with my performance. At no point did they ever bring anything up with me. Throughout my brief employment here I have never received any feedback, never told that I needed to do more or less, or anything else. I have felt pretty on my own throughout my time. My responsibilities are minimal and after 2 weeks of really hunting for more to do I kind of gave up trying to do more and since just sit around waiting for stuff to come to me. I for the most part sit around and watch TV while waiting, or read blogs. They have never brought this up as a problem. I always get my work done in a timely fashion and thought that must have been all they were looking for. I never really was given the opportunity to prove myself or show what I have and bring to the table. The job they advertised turned out to not be what they actually wanted filled (hence my jumping ship), and as such I still have no idea what they are looking for out of my position.

Today while I had headphones on (normal), but nothing playing through them I overheard my two direct supervisors talking derisively of me with one of the hosts I regularly work with. Particularly about someone he had suggested to fill my position and comparing them with me. They speak of me as though I was the worst employee ever. Someone who didn't get the job. Someone who would rather sit idly than do their work. Someone who didn't bring anything to the team. It was an open conversation with no pretense of being something everyone shouldn't hear. In the middle of the office with all my coworkers around.

I am insanely full of emotions of all sorts. I want to have a private conversation with them. I want to throw a camera at the wall. I want to write a damning email that no one will read. I want to not show up tomorrow or storm out right now. I want to get into an argument via email with one or both of them. I want to stand up and start yelling at them. I want to do nothing at all. I...I don't know what to do. I just don't know.

I have two more weeks here. I don't do much so it isn't very taxing, and I could really use the easy money (paid days for the holidays). I want the money but I also don't know if I can just sit here and take it.

To clarify, I am good at working. What I lack in almost every facet of my life I excel at in the work place. I have always been the person to start any job in any field at a relatively low level and move up quickly. From sales floor to manager in a couple of months, from intern to 3 levels beyond entry in a year, etc. Accordingly I am my job, and always throw myself into work. I identify as my job and whatever I am doing at the time. I don't have much outside of work. When you regularly work 12-18 hours a day 5-7 days a week you don't get much of a chance at other things in life. When not working I have a very limited number of mostly solo activities I do. When out of work I tend to get pretty depressed. By commenting on my job they are commenting on me. By telling me I am not good at my job they are telling me I am not good.

My job is me. I work. That is what I do. And I am damn good at it, I think. 

This is bothering me so insanely much I cannot explain it. This isn't something I am used to or really experienced before. I know it fairly irrelevant because I am leaving this job in two weeks anyway, but I still feel this insane urge to do something.

I guess I want to know what I should do. Should I have any response, do anything at all? Should I fully swallow my pride and just suck it up and be miserable but get paid for 2 more weeks?

I know this was all over the place, and long as hell, but I have so much going on in my head right now I don't even know. So, ummm, thanks.

TLDR I was openly talked about in a very negative fashion by two of my soon to be former bosses in front of my entire 20 person team. Should I respond and if so how?"

(IT Trolling)",Haybuck_Pony,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/154iuh/a_short_one_but_a_good_one_it_trolling/,"So, I used to work as a Security Administrator Intern up at a relatively small telecom company. The security administrator was responsible for securing our internal and external networks, firewall management (including blocked sites and requests for unblocking them), etc, etc. I was responsible for making firewall and security reports to a specific format, and forwarding them up to his boss, which was the Head of the IS team. Just a little background on the people in my department.

So, when I started, I was given the oldest of the old for PCs, which is fair. I needed to use the Firewall web interface, PowerPoint, and Excel, plus I was a 7 month temp. I wasn't surprised. However, the CD Drive on this particular PC was broken, and I was informed of this when it was given to me. One particularly slow day, I decided to muck with it and see if I couldn't get it working. Well, I got it working for about 30 seconds, long enough for the tray to eject, and get stuck.

So, the CD Tray sat stuck on this machine for about 2 weeks. Now, keep in mind, I was a 19 year old intern, so I was a bit of a slob; my cubical was a mess. Came back from lunch one day a little early, and there was no where to put down my soda. So I glanced around for about 10 seconds, and then plunked the cardboard cup right into the CD tray, and left it there.

The way my cubical was positioned, all of my co-workers had to walk right by me, and the physical PC was positioned on my desk so they could see it as they walked by. (Keeping an eye on the intern easily, again fair.) However, the looks of horror I got from all 8 of my team members, who stopped dead as they glanced into my cube, was absolutely priceless. There were even a few gasps, and my manager exclaimed ""What the fuck are you doing?!"", the shock of seeing the trope come to life shorting his frontal cortex long enough for him to forget that he's the one that told me the thing didn't work in the first place.

I then proceeded to laugh, hysterically, as realization slowly dawned on all of their faces, and some shuffled off embarrassed.

I got a written warning from the CIO about a week later, something about ""Defacing company property"". Apparently one of them didn't take too kindly to the joke, even after I took the time to explain it later that day.

1. I was unemployed for about 2.5 years after I graduated (2010). Had some internships during these 2.5 years. I'm currently residing in NYC. My goal is to have a career in insurance/finance. 
2. I **accepted** a full time offer from a global Fortune 500. The location is Washington DC. The pay and benefits are good, but it's a consulting firm in an area that I don't particularly want to do. My start date is late January.
3. I received interviews from 2 firms in the insurance industry (A, B) and 1 finance firm (C). Firm A is a US F500 in Nebraska. Firm B is a smaller firm in Florida. Both A &amp; B are in the insurance industry. Firm C is a global F500 in NYC in the finance industry. 
4. Firm A will make me an offer competitive of what I will be getting with the firm in DC, probably next week or early January. I have confirmation of that. I have an on-site final round with firm B in January, and will most likely get an offer if my interview goes well. I am waiting for my confirmation into the final round of firm C, and if I pass that final round I will get an offer. 
5. I much prefer to work in a metro area, but I also want to pursue a career in insurance/finance. So I will probably renege my offer from the consulting firm. My top choice would be the F500 in NYC because then I get to do what I want and stay in the city, but it's a little bit uncertain if I will get an offer. This is pretty much 1 step down from my dream job. 
6. If I take the offer from firm A, my plan is to work for 2 years there and then reapply for a position back in New York at a F500. It would prevent me from taking any other offers. Firm B is in a nice location but it requires a lot of driving. I don't have a car and I am a terrible driver, but I can learn. 
7. The main problem I'm having is the timeline of offers and interviews. Firm C that I want to work at is taking its time with the interview and responses. Firm A is pretty much set in stone but I really need to hear back from firm C before deciding. Firm B is in Florida, near Miami, but like I mentioned it's a lot of driving so it might be tough at first. The final interview for them is mid January. 
8. Everything comes down to when I need to decide on the offers from A, when I will get the offer from B, and when I will get to the final round with C. 

My problem is that I have a feeling an offer from firm A will come before I get a final round with firm C. If I get an offer from firm C but it's after my offer deadline from firm A, what should I do? Should I simply ask them for more time to consider and tell firm C to hurry up ?

Is it better to do a an internship during your summer or travel? 

After my first year of College I traveled around Europe during the summer, however after my second year of college I began my 9  month work placement, which began during the summer(Which was an awful experience, and probably not the greatest internship I could have gotten).

So here's my thought, should I travel or work? 

The next summer I have a fantastic opportunity to move to another nearing country to work for a Intergovernmental organisation that would look hugely impressive for any CV. However as of my recent internship(Which I know will not be the same experience as most other places) I'm left with the need and want to travel again! I was speaking to a member of my universities staff recently about my internship and said go for it, and travel when I'm graduated. 

So Reddit, I'm looking for advice from my Robot Elders, travel or work? "

So, I'm fresh out of school with no experience, and an average - below average GPA.

I'm wondering if reddit has some tips on resume writing for an entry level programmer with my background. Or possibly some tips on where I can get some experience to fill out my résumé. "

Long story short. I exited a failing business about 3 months ago. Issues with my business partner.

Since then, as I hadn't been in a proper job for over 8 years, I put together my CV/Resume and applied for a whole load of jobs in IT consulting/project management and digital marketing (junior roles) with no luck. 

On the side I managed to get the odd freelance jobs for digital marketing and web development work (i outsourced the actual work) but i wasnt able to make the work regular. I severely lack in lead generation/sales experience and was running out of money fast so didnt have time to ""figure it out"" although its something i am forcing myself to do more and more and realise the importance of it.

I then met a founder of a digital marketing company, and explained my situation to him, and he offered me an internship at his company as someone in a junior digital marketing role. I accepted because i dont have that much digital marketing experience behind me and I think that's why i was struggling to find a job.

Since then, I've gotten further feedback on my CV and am improving it, and I've been working with this guy.

However, this guy has really poor management skills, and jobs that should take a day or two are taking around a week, sometimes 2 weeks. I know full well it's just poor management having made all the same mistakes myself when running my own business.

While that's frustrating, what making things worse is that, i haven't done **any** digital marketing work the 4 weeks that i have been here, which was why i agreed to be paid at a low rate since i thought i'd be learning and accepted i needed to start in a junior position.

I also agreed because he promised me that after 3 months, i'd get a base pay/salary and commission for each completed project atop.

I've been doing nothing but editing html for the past 4 weeks, something i *really* dont need to ""learn"", since i know it pretty well, and this guy doesnt know his tech so well, but keeps trying to teach me in places. Seriously under rating and estimating my talent.

I'm not being paid alot at all and what I earn in a week, had i managed to get one of the contracts i applied for, I'd earn in a day. Furthermore he's placing a lot of pressure on me to compensate for the fact that the projects keep slipping, like expecting me to work overtime and so on.

He's acknowledged that the management needs improvement, but i dont think he knows how to solve it and really isnt taking my lead much on things. He's promised me there will be digital marketing work in the new year, but as with all commitments he's made so far, he keeps slipping further and further behind. He's kept his word on payments though and not delayed. But I'm just very frustrated with the whole situation.


Not sure if i should just leave, or if i should say something and if i do, how i should frame it, or if i just suck it up.

Any advice appreciated."

[Honestly, what's the matter with getting some new DLC for the PC version? Also, what about having just more than 2 players? The console versions got more episodes and players. We're begging here! We've stuck with you for the past fifteen years!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/154hsq/iam_cookie_masterson_completely_fictitious_host/c7j7fvk?context=5)|Sadly, the PC version of the 2011 You Don't Know Jack console game was not and is not entirely under our control. We had the Sophie's Choice of no PC version, or a version with no DLC and only two players. Some people thought that made the game ""worthless"" or ""broken."" We don't agree but we do agree that it's a crappy situation. The reason it's two players is, since we went to an all-play version (everyone can buzz in on every question), versus the original lock-out version (only one person buzzes in to answer) - and we think that was a huge improvement - it made it necessary to give each player a set of five keys on a keyboard. And it's pretty much impossible to give three (not even mentioning four) players that much space around one, say, laptop keyboard. We would have had to create an entirely different version of the game, and we didn't have the funding for that, sadly. Hope that explains it a bit. (JG Team)

Things like coming back every day, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/154hsq/iam_cookie_masterson_completely_fictitious_host/c7j894h?context=5)|Well, there are a couple of ways. For one, you gain Booty for each game you play, and that helps you move up levels, which gets you free games at each new level. Also, if you invite/challenge friends, you could show up as a competitor in their game. When that happens, you get the Bonus Booty based on where you finish (out of the six players) in that game. You collect it if you come back to the game each day. That also helps get you closer to winning more free games.
 |BUT.. Without sounding crassly capitalistic, we think spending money to play more episodes is a great option. Because, you know, that's how we keep being able to do this. Money.

155gl7,5,2012-12-19,Special Request: Can Somebody Please Review and Suggest Improvements to My Resume?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/155gl7/special_request_can_somebody_please_review_and/,"Hello. I recently graduated with a B.S in CS.

I've been offered an extension on my interning job and for the meantime (until something better comes along) I wil stay there. 

Unfortunately I'm not really being paid very much more than I used to as an intern and I'd like to move on to something better at some point.

For now I wanted to have a resume that I could submit to places from time to time.

Here is the link:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CMSaa8z5wFszej24NwQwAqs3JyshfWCm0-UGRb681-I/edit

Any suggestions for improvements would be greatly appreciated. I changed the names of places and myself, just to keep myself anonymous.

I know these threads pop up a lot, so thank you all!

1554iu,1,2012-12-19,Tired of technical interviews and jumping through hoops. (rant),[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1554iu/tired_of_technical_interviews_and_jumping_through/,"This is mostly just a rant, but I figured some others might have experienced this stuff. I'm a CS student looking for summer internships, and even though I've only interviewed at a few companies so far, I'm already tired of these technical interviews. Or, more specifically, I'm tired of all the ones that go wrong for reasons outside of my control.

I won't name the companies, but they're major well-known ones. These are pretty good internships so I understand they're competitive, but the situation is ridiculous sometimes.

I was supposed to have two phone interviews yesterday. It already took months of coordinating just to get to this point. The first interview was great, the guy was nice, I solved all his problems no problem. 

The second interviewer never even called. My recruiting coordinator is in Asia and hence on a completely different time schedule; I was however able to get into contact with their phone screen support, and I was very lucky in that they were able to reschedule the interview for this morning. Otherwise this might have drawn out into next year.

Okay, so finally the second interviewer actually calls. No apology for, you know, not calling at all last night. I can already tell he's not particularly friendly, and this becomes more apparent throughout the 45 minute interview which I can tell he wants to get over with in half that time.

To make matters worse, he made numerous mistakes explaining his problem he wanted me to solve. First, we had a list of tasks, but after I apparently wasted 5 minutes talking about how certain tasks are independent of the rest and could be moved forward in the queue, he decided only then to clarify it's actually a stream of incoming requests, and we only know the current request. Hey, that's cool, but he seemed to blame this misunderstanding on me, as if I was supposed to psychically know that he didn't explain things the way he intended. Okay... In another instance, after suggesting one optimization, he asked me how to also optimize another part as well. Well, it turns out that he wanted me to *only* optimize the other part and forget about keeping the first optimization we already came up with, but he never bothered to be clear about this at all. Again, he didn't seem to acknowledge his own role in this misunderstanding.

He was in such a rush that at one point, when I made just a very initial suggestion for an approach to one question, he immediately asked me what the running time was. I hadn't even *described an algorithm*. How can I possibly tell you what the running time is? He was looking for a canned response, and he wanted it fast, so he just jumped right to the end even though we were at the beginning. God forbid I haven't actually seen the problem before and just memorized the end result... This wasn't binary search or some classic algorithm; it was just his pet problem for interviews.

In the end, I bet I won't get this internship because of some disgruntled interviewer who didn't have the time to even call the first time and didn't have the time to explain his problems clearly the second time.

1552a5,6,2012-12-19,Question about what to include on resume,shippo-kun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1552a5/question_about_what_to_include_on_resume/,"In 1998, at the age of 19, I joined the Navy. I was accepted into the Nuclear Power program, and quickly passed through Electrician's Mate A-School, receiving the certificate. It was in Nuclear Power training that I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, so I never finished. I was medically discharged shortly after that.

I haven't worked in about twelve years, but in 2011 decided to go back to school for a Computer Science degree. My grades are decent (about a 3.8), but I'm worried about what to put on my resume for an internship, and ultimately full time employment.

Should I leave off everything before college, and try to explain in person when employers inquire (There is no way I can pass for my early twenties). How much should I tell them when the do ultimately ask?

Thanks for reading, hopefully someone has some answers for me."
1596w0,2,2012-12-21,Will doing research and not getting an internship hurt my job prospects?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1596w0/will_doing_research_and_not_getting_an_internship/,"I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Engineering. I've been interested in going to graduate school and getting a PhD in computer science, or getting a PhD in computational neuroscience. Obviously, if I want to enter a PhD program, I need to get as much research experience as possible. Right now, my top choice is graduate school by a long shot, but there's no way of knowing what I will want to do 2.5 years from now, or if I will even be accepted to graduate school (right now I have a 3.5 GPA, but who knows what will happen).

So, my question is this: if I spend all of my time doing research and don't get an internship, and later I decide later that I want to enter industry right after graduation will I be unable to find a job? What if the research that I do is respectable and I can get great letters of recommendation? I need to make my choice because I have the opportunity to start research this coming semester, and if I don't I'll need to start applying for summer internships."

I'm a recent college grad and I wanted to start grooming myself to be a successful sysadmin, so I just wanted some input from pros like yourselves.

I got my degree in IT at FSU, and I have a few internships from college and just started a new job at a callcenter for central helpdesk.

I hate my callcenter job, mainly because I'm not that great at it just yet, and it's a lot of information to juggle, while simultaneously talking to someone on the phone, making the ticket, staying under a certain time, not breaking any policies on information, and deciphering what 70 y/o instructors mean by they can't open their yahoo. 

Sooo that got me thinking ahead after the 2 month contract is done.. What do I want to shoot for next.. and I think sysadmin sounds interesting.

1.What I would like from you guys is..

2. Your starter story if you just busted into the scene recently.

3. Certifications? Which and Why?

4. Things to avoid.

5. Traits of people successful in the position.

What I'm afraid of is..

Royally fucking up. So I want to be prepared for the position.

Thanks for the advice in advance! and thanks for reading.

About Me:

*IT Degree from a top instate school.

*1 year of IT experience

*Relevant Experience: Aided in switching all of individual servers to one box utilizing virtualization at one of my internships.

*Very interested in Virtualization.

*Lots of experience building desktops.

*Half way through my A+ Cert (Taking the 1st test of two very soon)

*I live in Central FL so if someone has a spot for an internship I'm very open to that!"

I have noticed that it is essentially guaranteed that the interviewer will ask one or both of the following questions:

1) How do you go about learning a new (programming) language?

2) When you run into a problem with your code, how do you go about fixing it? (aka how do you debug a program)

So my question to all you interviewers out there is: why are these questions so darn popular?  What information are you trying to glean from the candidate's response?  What is the best way for an interviewee to answer them?

Notably - The Weeknd and Conor Maynard (although that was only mixing and mastering some records).
 |Babysit. Oh God. I've been waiting awhile to tell this story.
 |One of my jobs in high school was a studio technician at a local studio in my home town. As a studio technician I was basically there to work all the cable running and mic set-ups within the studio. One rainy night (gotta set the mood ;) ) I get a call from the studio manager telling me the normal studio engineer is out of town and they need me to take over for him for this 13 year old girl whose daddy was paying good money to record her demo. So, I raced to the studio, set-up the session and began the recording process. The records were all demo'd and done for her before hand, she literally just had to go in and lay vocals. Now even in my youth I had a good ear of what sounded good and what was terrible (I'm blessed with perfect pitch to top it off). Every take, this girls father would be bouncing around in the studio shouting ""THATS THE TAKE! THIS IS THE ONE!"". To the point of it becoming incredibly irritating. Now anyone who works in a studio will tell you, singers will rarely ever get it on the first take. After 5 hours of dealing with this, I eventually kicked them out of the studio for the night because I simply couldn't deal with her father.
 |TL;DR - Father was a Prima Donna - got his ass kicked out of the studio.
[Was her name Rebecca Black?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kkq9r?context=5)|Hahahaha. Nope!

[What is it like working for such a large label? Would you rather work for someone else? How did this come about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k7drc?context=5)|First, thanks for the first question! I was getting weary that this would get buried!
 |This is my second label I've worked with directly (through a contract). The first one I was young, naive and signed a stupid contract that did more harm to my career than good. Working for Atlantic is exciting in all honesty. I've never been more comfortable with a major label! I really can't say enough good things about how they've treated me.
 |Would I rather work for someone else? By ""someone else"" I'm assuming you mean ""another label"". That being the case, if the terms of the contract were better than what I currently have with Atlantic, I would not hesitate!
 |The gist of how this came about is I've been producing music for just over 10 years, and their A&amp;R department eventually contacted me after hearing an earlier placement of mine. They liked my ideas and my sound and offered me a contract to produce in-house. Luck mixed with a lot of handwork!
 |Hope these are clear and concise enough to answer your questions!

[I'm so familiar and fast with PT now, that I probably won't ever switch. What about any tips? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k7y9r?context=5)|I always tell people, stick with what works best for you and you're most comfortable with.
 |As for tips. Stockpile as many effects, presets, and VST's as you can. You'll never know when you need that one sound to make a record hot.
 |Also, spend a good amount of time creating your own Compression, Reverb and EQ presets. This will help create your signature sound.
 |And just as a general tip for production, have a mobile set-up. ALWAYS. You'll never know when you need to work or have the urge to create!
[Good tip, man. I actually have the Waves bundle, and a bunch more other plugins, but simply enjoy the simplicity of stock plugins that I rarely use anything else. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k84rs?context=5)|I've honestly never used 80% of my effects and VST's but it's good to know they are there if something comes up or styles change!
[Where's the future of music producing heading? Is your job threatenetend by the likes of Spotify and other companies similar to it? What's changed since it (Spotify\) has come around? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k7t43?context=5)|The future of Music is bleak and exciting all at the same time. It depends on what perspective you look at it from.
 |Bleak: Everybody and their Mama is a music producer now. Which has really watered down the quality of music out there. Labels can now by exclusive licenses to records for 19$-35$ then turn around and make a $1,000,000 profit off that song. Not to mention, you can see in a lot of songs out there, mixing, mastering and general creativity is almost stagnant. A prime example of this is the recent song ""Pop That"" by French Montana. Listening to that song actually hurts my soul if you listen to it with good headphones. The mixing is absolutely horrendous.
 |Exciting: EVERYBODY CAN BE A PRODUCER. The thing about technology becoming so readily available to everyone to create music, is it gives the people who generally didn't have an avenue to create to put their music out and show the world. I personally benefitted a lot from this aspect. Furthermore the need for a label is slowly diminishing. Meaning, artists can now make a sustainable living off being independent. See Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.
 |I don't think Spotify or similar companies threaten MY job. Because no matter what there will always need to be people who make the music that will be listened to.

 |Honestly. A lot of what he says in that song is 100% accurate. I feel bad for artists nowadays :(
[If the need for a label is slowly diminishing, do you think they will try to have more control over artist tours? I don't know how much they have, I've just always been told that artists only ever make their money from merch. So feel free to prove me wrong if that is not the case. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7k85mm?context=5)|Go look up what a 360 deal is.
 |But essentially yes. Unless you're a high name artist (Drake, Kanye, Lady Gaga, etc.) who owns most of their publishing and a large chunk of their royalties.  I can tell you first hand, the industry is panicking with the internet and piracy (See RIAA suing EVERYBODY). As a knee jerk reaction, yes labels are moving towards controlling more and more of what an artist does.

 |Producers are a dime a dozen these days. Just like artists. It takes a special person to stand out and leave their mark.

[What do you think about ""trap"" producers such as Southside, Lex Luger, Sonny Digital, etc.  I know they are successful (plaques on the wall, radio hits, Grammy nominations\) and I personally like the sound.

You can make interesting drum patterns! Other than that, MIDI it up! Which is essentially the same thing, but with hardware. 
[Hell yea, love my midi. Creativity just flows so much better with the hardware. Thanks for all the input man. If you ever find yourself in Nashville TN hit me up. I won't kill you.

I think you'll see Hip-Hop transform into the one genre that transcends race, gender, orientation, etc etc.

Basically. If theres something you can do that you think a record label would have to pay money to have done, do it before the come looking. You'll be more attractive to them. Build an image, brand, fan base, personality, sound etc.
 |TL;DR - Labels are lazy.

However. I'll tell you Nexus is a great tool. One of my favourite despite its commonality.
 |2) I originally just used it in the infancy of my career to help myself feel more professional. When it comes down to it, I honestly believe FL has the same power as Pro Tools if you know how to use it properly. At this point it's more habit and familiarity.
 |3) FINALLY. 100 Duck sized Trinidad James. When I was a kid, my parents always had a problem when we went to ponds where I'd chase and try and kick and punch ducks. I'm a seasoned pro.

[Thanks for the response.  I'm a musician myself, though have never (and likely will never\) get to the point where a producer becomes involved, so thanks for the clarification.  1\) Since you're making the sounds/instrumentation, does that have any effecgt on songwriting credits? If so, what sort of litmus test exists for this (kind of hinting at the screenwriters' type deal\)?  2\) How does the role of a producer with a real band (think Mumford &amp; Sons\) contrast with that of a producer in your position (sorry if i'm assuming too much, but it seems you're a pop/hiphop/electronic leaning producer\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/158ktb/i_am_a_music_producer_who_works_for_atlantic/c7kd3zy?context=5)|In modern music, you can get a song writing credit for simply being in the studio and saying ""yeah that sounds good"". It's all really messed up. Unless I'm asked, I never really delve into song writing duties. There's no real ""test"" that I'm aware of.   A producer for a band, someone like Mutt Lange, kind of gives the band direction and ideas for the entire record. Where as I make individual tracks.

Me being in school, it makes it a lot harder. Word travels fast. I do have a great core of friends who have been with me since the beginning, they definitely keep me grounded and humble.
 |In particular, I find it hard to trust new women (I'm currently single because of this...ladies ;) ) as soon as a lot of them find out what I do, who I've worked with, my bank account, etc etc, it's like the crazy gene kicks in and they see me as a piggy bank.

[update on FBI, John and my charges: Case File No.56 update - part 8](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16ppsy/update_on_fbi_john_and_my_charges_case_file_no56/)



“The third victim was a paranormal type. You know, the sort of person who decided to make her own ghost hunting team after watching any of those shows out now,” Anna said as we walked into the office. She hadn’t been able to sleep last night so I guess she’d started going through victim threes files.

“So what’s your point?” I asked. Sleeping on her couch every night was making me cranky but thankfully all the weird things had all but stopped happening and the paranoia and fear was dying down too. I could probably move back into my place soon.



“So, I don’t know. Hey, where’s John?” We walked into our office, boxes and coffee in hand. We sat down at our desks and sipped our coffee for a few minutes before diving into this God awful case once more. Before we could get too into our missing intern, one of the forensic scientists came into the room with an envelope.


“Here’s the DNA sample back, guys,” he said. We’d sent him the sample when we were working on the first victim. The CSI team grabbed blood samples from the candles he’d blown out in the first murder.


“And? Get a match?” I asked.

“Not even close. It’s not even human. I did every test I could think of a million times. It’s just not human. Humans have 46 chromosomes, right; this had 58. I have no idea what it could be.” Anna and I looked at each other.



“Weird,” she said. “Thanks Max.” He put the envelope with the DNA test results on my desk and left.

“Anyways,” I said. “I don’t know. I think someone said he called in sick or something. John did look a little under the weather yesterday.” Anna nodded in agreement.



“Hopefully he gets back soon,” she said. Anna and I went back to the pictures of the third crime scene. It was all the same. Blood, guts, unbelievable gore. I still wasn’t used to it though. It was all more grotesque and inhumane than I thought even possible. I got to a picture of her head. There was a slim white stick-looking item sticking out of her skull. Her hair had dried blood all over it and her eyes sat there open and unseeing, well, one of them at least, like that of a porcelain doll watching you as you sleep. From her mouth, blood ran down her cheek onto the ground. Her head sat in a pool of her own blood. But the bone-appearing item stuck into her head was pristine. A pure unsettling white. I showed it to Anna. 



“I think that’s in the box,” she said, pointing to the stick. “Forensics determined it to be a bone.” I shuddered. Anna dug through the box and took the bone out. I took the bag from her and looked at it. Forensics is always careful to not disturb the way the evidence was found. And even with that care, it was disturbingly white.

“Let’s just watch the video and get it over with,” I said.

“It can’t be that bad”, Anna said. “We’ve seen two of the most brutal and horrifying murders already and this victim has most of her body parts still intact, unlike the first two”.



“I guess so. I just don’t want to have to look at pictures of dead people anymore. I’ve had enough for one year.” I said, exhausted. Before she pushed play on the video player, we just sat there. I guess we were preparing ourselves for it, even if we’d already seen it all.



It was then our boss came in, urging us to finish this case. We sucked up and got him out of the room. Anna pushed play.



The video started off in what looks like a bedroom. The camera was handheld. The victim sounded excited. She had a chipper light voice and the camera was moving around rapidly. We heard a bunch of clicks and snaps and sounds of clothes rustling. We figured she was getting something together or putting something on. All of a sudden the camera swung up and we could see her hands grabbing different electronic devices.

“Ok! I’m all set up. I have my camera on my shoulder mount; I have my EVP recorder, my infrared scanner and many other pieces of equipment for my line of work.” She said while looking into a smaller camera. We would watch that tape but it this was the only tape in the evidence box.

“It is 9:14 pm here in Seattle, Washington. This is an unofficial SPA investigation. I say unofficial because nobody else in my team is here and I am off the clock. I am in my house all by myself with my little corgi puppy Samson.”



She was still getting herself ready and giving us other useless information about her house and her equipment she was using. SPA stood for “Seattle Paranormal Association” and it turns out she was the cofounder of it. We decided to fast forward a little bit until we saw her go to the door of her bedroom and open it.

“Okay all you ghost hunt fans out there, just a few minutes ago, I was hearing strange thumps and what sounded like someone talking. I could hear the voice, but I just couldn’t make out what the person or thing was saying. I hope to capture something on my equipment and share it with you guys.”



She walked down the hall until she came to her living room. Right upon entering the living room, to her right was a recliner chair and straight ahead was a couch. She stopped in her tracks.

“It just got really cold. Perhaps this is a good place to do an EVP recording. I’ll just take a walk around the rest of my house first so I know where to go after this, unless this is the only cold room.”

She walked throughout her house. Only the living room seemed cold to her. She also mentioned that the living room was where the thumps sounded like they were coming from.

“I checked the rest of the house and it all checked out fine.” she said. “Whoa… what is that? My window curtain just moved.” She walked over the window and used some weird device towards it. Turns out it was some sort of EMF detector. It has something to do with shifts in the magnetic fields. A shift is supposed to mean there’s a paranormal presence nearby. She moved the curtains. All three of her windows were open.



“Okay? I didn’t leave any of these open earlier.” she proclaimed. “Weird.”



She shut them and turned off the light to her patio. She started walking towards the hallway, but just as she reached the hall, there was a very loud crash coming from behind her near the kitchen. She turned around and just stood there. She then pulled out a flash light and shined it across the room.



“Damn it! That was the plate my mother got me for Christmas. I am now going to pull out my EVP recorder and see if we can get anything on tape.”



The little device started to beep loudly. Like something was there. She pointed her camera in all different directions and started to breath heavier.



“It just got colder. Even colder than before. I’m going to do an EVP now.” She takes out another device and sits down on the ground. “Is anybody there?” it was quiet for a couple minutes. “Are there any spirits here who want to make contact?” she said louder.



“No,” a voice replied.



“No?” she replied. “My arm itches. It just started getting all tingly with a slight burning feeling.” she said, directing it towards the camera, most likely for her viewers. “Did someone just touch my arm?”



“I’m very pleased you can feel that.” A booming menacing voice said from somewhere in the room.



The victim turned around as fast as she could. The room was dark, adding to the spooky effect for her ghost hunt archives so we could barely make out what was talking. But Anna and I both knew exactly who was there. The odd thing was… we were not listening to the EVP recording while watching this video. We could hear Stitch talk through the video camera. At least now we know more about this thing. We now know he is very real. Not a ghost or demon or anything else supernatural.

“Were you the entity that opened my windows and made the thumping sounds?” she asked in a worried voice.

“That itch that you feel… It’s rather interesting you would feel an itch.” Stitch said.

“Why?” she asked.

“That is the part of your body I was looking at. I wish to eat it.” And all of a sudden, as loud as I have ever heard someone yell in my life, loud enough to knock the victim back on her heels, Stitch said “And I intend to.”

“Who are you?” the woman asked, her voice shaking.

“I am known as Buel in the Netherlands. Carnifex in Latin. Pyöveli in Finland. Bøddel in Norway. I have many names. I have killed many people. At least ten per country. You will be my third here. I am your worst nightmare, ma’am. I would run.” As he was talking, the woman took something out of her pocket. It was later found to be Holy Water. She opened the bottle slowly and tossed some of it in the direction of Stitch. Stitch laughed. The woman got up off the ground, turned the light on and started backing up to the front door.  We saw that the Holy Water had melted some of Stitch’s skin into the shape of a cross. It was burned into his skin, like he’d been freshly branded. It was red like you’d expect a burn to me, and crusting. Other than the melting flesh, it didn’t seem to affect him. While the woman was backing away, we saw Stitch swinging his chains at her. They wrapped around her arm and tore into her skin. The crunching sound was disgusting as her arm was torn out of her socket and the skin was torn off. The camera landed on the ground. We heard chains clanging and the woman screaming and then we saw her. Her arm was gone. Blood was pouring everywhere and we could see her shoulder blade sticking out of her broken bloody flesh. The woman screamed and screamed while Stitch laughed and laughed, getting slowly louder like he always did. While she was lying on the ground, Stitch towered over her. She tried to crawl away but grabbed a piece of the previously broken dish and tried to use it as a weapon. She stabbed it into the first place she could get it, his arm. But it just went through him. Chunks of blood and guts came out the other side of his arm, dripping and plopping onto the ground. it was gorier than I thought possible. His blood was dark and crusty. Rotten. As it oozed out of his arm, he laughed. He got some of the blood on his fingers, with those awful dirty nails, and shoved the blood into the woman’s mouth.

“You cannot hurt me,” he chuckled. As if to prove his invincibility, he shoved his hand into his chest and ripped out one of his ribs. The bone we’d found in the evidence box we assumed. The woman screamed in terror.

“Why are you haunting me?” she said.

“I'm not haunting you. I'm going to kill you. Chew you to bits and use your flesh to complete mine,” Stitch responded.

“Are you a ghost or a demon?” she said. Her voice was shaking.

“No. I am real. I am the one who makes people scared,” Stitch started to say. “I don’t hide under beds or in closets. I watch you. I like to see my victim’s faces while I study them.” He paused and looked at her. He smiled. “You’re scared. I can smell it. I can taste it so clearly.” He stroked the spot her arm used to be and licked the blood off his fingers.

She tried to escape again but Stitch shoved his fingers into her eyes and held her head like a bowling ball. She kept screaming. Stitch laughed louder than she screamed. He took his fingers out of her eye sockets and took his torn out rib and stabbed it into her skull. Her head fell to the ground. Adding insult to injury, Stitch shoved his hand into her chest now and ripped her heart out and ate it. Then he stood up and grabbed her torn off arm. He sticks her fingers into his mouth and bites them off. The sound of bones crunching rang through our ears. I could hear Anna shuddering next to me. But Stitch wasn’t done. He took the fingers out of his mouth and stuck them into the woman’s mouth. He left, leaving the woman on the floor. Her head was rolled to the side and what was left of her eyes drooped to the ground. There was blood everywhere soaking into her carpet, drying into her hair and onto her skin. Her fingers were sticking out her mouth. Her nails were broken from the struggle.

I looked over at Anna. She looked like she had been crying. She acted like she could handle all this, but I didn’t think she could.

“I’m going home,” she said. She stood up and left the room quickly. I couldn’t blame her. If I could escape this case, I would.

“I guess I will too,” I said. I thought she needed some time alone, so I decided to go back to my house. Before I could leave though, John ran into the office, disheveled.

“I’m sorry I’m late,” he said.

“Late?” I said. “It’s three o’ clock, John. You may as well have just not come in.”

“I know, I know,” he said. “But I found something and I thought you should know. Where’s Anna?” He was talking quickly like he was panicking.

“She went home early. Well? Spit it out, kid,” I said. I didn’t really want to hear what he was about to say. But the information could help us stop this guy, so I listened.

“He’s killed more than just three people. He’s killed like…a hundred…at least. Probably more. He’s known all over the world. Like in old folk lore. You know how Hansel and Gretel is supposed to scare children into being good? I think that’s what Stitch was supposed to be. He’s got different names all over the place, but they all translate to Executioner. Buel means butcher in Dutch, but same difference. I thought this guy sounded familiar. In college I took a class in mythology and folklore and we talked about this guy,” he said. He kept moving his hands all over the place and could hardly stand still in the doorway of my office. He’d graduated top of his class at Harvard. I figured I could trust the things he was saying. I took feverish notes so I could call Anna later and tell her everything.

“I don’t know if this is something we can stop, Ryan,” John said distraught.

“Why?” I asked.

“He’s been at this for who knows how many years. If they have stories about him all over the world, and he’s killed all over the world, what makes you think we can stop him?”

“We have to try,” I said. “It’s our job as detectives. We have to stop him from killing anymore people. I don’t give a damn if he’s been at this for however many years; his reign ends now,” I said.

“Okay,” John said. He took the beanie he was wearing off his head and twisted it in his hands. “How though?”

“I don’t know. Do you want to stay over at my place tonight? Maybe we could try to bait him somehow. There’s got to be something we can do,” I said. John sat down next to me and we started researching more. I tried calling Anna while he worked but she didn’t answer. She didn’t come to work the next day either."
15bysp,8,2012-12-23,Is this a good deal?,franklink1829,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15bysp/is_this_a_good_deal/,"So I contacted this guy that own a small startup about a remote internship, I sent him an email with my resume. He said he was interested in having me as an intern in his company. I did a small coding challenge and he approved of me. The next day he gives me a small assignment and I finish it and then I ask him if I have to fill out any paperwork or contracts, etc. He gets back at me telling me that I'm his first US employee ( I assume he hires all over the world) and that US laws are complicated and it will be a huge pain in the ass to pay me as an intern. So he offers me a deal. If I help him on his open source project he will give me a recommendation ( he is one of the top 25 contributors to this huge open source language)  and if he likes me he will then consider hiring me for one of his company's project on late January. 

Is this a good deal? Is his recommendation going to help me out alot with a company that works heavily on the language he contributes or is it really not that big of a deal?

PS. I am a college senior and I need the experience to apply for jobs next semester."

I have basic knowledge of all these but I'd like some good tips from you seasoned admins! I plan on getting a server setup with VMWare ESXi and running a buncha virtualized Linux operating systems with different services installed and just figuring out how they work.

Even though I was an intern, I was worked like a full time employee 10+ hours every day.

I was helping an unreasonable user with some sort of storage issue.  After letting him know that there was nothing I could do right now and I will have to escalate this to the server guys, he was persistent and kept pressuring me to fix the issue immediately.  So right there and then, I yelled out, ""I'm not a magician"". 

Of course I never expected to work in IT again and I didn't.  I switched to marketing.  I did get in trouble from my boss but we eventually chuckled at it.

I thought it was an epic line at that time because company employees never respect the IT support team and I was only an intern.

So next time you have to deal with an extremely unreasonable user, I give you permission to say ""I'm not a magician""."
15d0b2,2,2012-12-24,[build help] Was mid build and found out I have a few SCSI drives laying around... worth it? Advice? (4x 146.8 Gb 10k RPM),Flammy,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/15d0b2/build_help_was_mid_build_and_found_out_i_have_a/,"Building [my new gaming and video processing rig](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/tRxE) and everything is going well. (well, except for the fact Microcenter decided to not ship my GPU for a week after ordering, and the fact my Western Digital 2TB HDD didn't work straight out of the box...). My real question (as you might have gathered from the title) is that I've found I've got 4 SCSI drives and am wondering if I should incorporate them. 


Back story for how I 'found' these drives: Over the summer I was an intern at a startup, an intern at a nearby startup in the same building (lots of em) was tasked with cleaning out a storage area behind a presentation space and instructed to try to give away as much as possible and bin the rest of the stuff. There was all sorts of stuff and I snagged a few flash drives and earbuds and such. (there was everything from building materials to random electronics). There were 4 HDDs wrapped in bubble wrap. I opened one and saw it was a HDD, I assumed from a server because I didn't recognize the tray holding it or the port on back so I grabbed em to possibly re-purpose later. Well, fast forward to now, and I took one over to a friend's who was giving me a few SATA cables I was missing and he identified them as belonging to a SCSI raid array. He happened to have a SCSI controller laying around he was going to chuck so the gave it to me...

Now I've got the following:

* Adaptec SCSI Raid 1 channel (2130 SPL) PCI-X controller (from friend) [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/2130SLP-U320-64BIT-133MHZ-128MB/dp/B000FDU31S) Price: ~$90

* 4x HP Model: MAT3147NC 146.8 GB 10,000 RPM Wide Ultra 320 SCSI (+12V 1.20A, +5 V, 1.00 A) -  Date: February 2005 [Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.com/MAT3147NC-147gb-80-pin-Fujitsu-Warranty/dp/B001PQ3UIC) Price: $37.50 each. I don't even know if they work, but at least several appeared to be in original bubble wrap packaging. 

Therefore... My questions/concerns are: 

1) Is it worth it? I've got plenty of HDD storage already, so it would be for the read/write speed which I imagine would be helpful when recording and rendering. I do have a small SSD, which is obviously similar in some ways to an SCSI at least in function if not operation. 

2) Can my PSU handle it? (linked above to current build)

3) I only have 3 HDD slots open on my case still (well after the broken one gets replaced) - Can I mount the fourth in one of the 3 spare 5.25"" slots (one is taken by CD drive) 

4) Heat concerns? I currently have just the 2 default fans from the case. I did a good job with the cabling but still...

Thanks all! "

15fqub,8,2012-12-25,Where to look for software dev. internships?,NonCasualGamer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15fqub/where_to_look_for_software_dev_internships/,"I know it sounds like a stupid question, but I have been trying to find a decent internship for more than a year now and haven't had much luck. I'm in 2nd year of Soft Eng and I've already done a 4-month internship in a startup (which sucked) so I want to try a bigger (and more professional) company. I come from a modest family so I would like to find an internship not far from home since I probably won't have the means to relocate to a different place. 

This is what I've tried:
1. I've looked at my school's (McGill uni) jobboard and it's mostly garbage posts, irrelevant or too specific. I've tried applying for several positions but without much luck.
2. I tried websites like jobboom (couldn't find any internships) and glassdoor (same problem as #1) and couple others.
3. The best luck I had so far was going to my school's job fair and giving my CV's or applying directly on some big companies' websites. I've managed to get interviews with google, MS, morgan stanley and few others but wasn't well prepared so they didn't take me. I don't really know of any other decent companies in my area so I had to stop at those and now I'm stuck.

I think my biggest problem is that I do not have any super specific programming knowledge. I program well in Java, C, have done a bit of web development in php, ruby on rails, and am pretty familiar with linux/gnu tools but I am not super knowledgeable in anything in particular, since I've only been programming for 2 years. My grades are good and my CV is well polished (according to my advisors) but I am not a genius so I can never manage to get past interviews at big companies and the mid-size companies just don't contact me at all when I apply.

TL;DR advise me on how to find a soft. dev. internship at some mid to large size company (in Canada preferably) or at least a good website to find them?"

It's a PC he had one of his interns build for him a few years ago.  A light on the mobo shines green as long as it's plugged in.  First I checked to make sure all the cords were correctly plugged in, which they appear to be.  I assume the single lit LED indicates the PSU is operating?  Then I unplugged the case power plug and tried manually shorting the power pins, but the computer still doesn't power up, no fans spinning, no nothing except for the single mobo light which only glows steadily. 

Any ideas?  Tomorrow I plan on trying to find a speaker to help with troubleshooting, but I'm not sure there will be one available.  Then the plan was taking everything out and starting with a breadboard build, troubleshooting once piece at a time.  That will take me many hours even if it does end up working.  So... any ideas?

15ehsv,1,2012-12-24,I'm about to graduate from Mechanical Engineering. Did I make a mistake?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/15ehsv/im_about_to_graduate_from_mechanical_engineering/,"This is a lot of text but I felt it necessary to paint a good picture of why I am frustrated.

I am a 23 year old mechanical engineering student that will be graduating from a state university this May and I have no idea what I am going to do after. I am beginning to think I have made a mistake in choosing mechanical engineering. I have been doing a lot of things to try to make up my mind but haven’t been able to decide what I should do.

**School Info:**

I obsess with knowing how to do things perfectly. I read all my textbooks for fear of missing information, even though I could get good grades without knowing all that info. When I find the answer to a homework problem I redo it using all the methods I’ve learned. I see this as a disadvantage because (in my experience) supervisors want their engineers to solve the problem as quickly as possible, even if there might be a better method out there.

I really enjoy school. I am good at school; I have a 3.7 (92.5% avg). That being said, I don’t know if I enjoy the engineering part of school or just school in general. I like to sit down with a problem, solve it, give it to the teacher, and they tell me how well I did. I like having the feedback of grades. E.g. if you get an A, you did well.  This doesn’t necessarily mean I want to continue school. I want to know what it means to enjoy school; what would I be good at if I like school?

I thought about going to graduate school because I enjoy school. I got a job working for a professor to see if grad school would be for me. It has only been one semester and I haven’t decided. Plus, it might be too late to sign up to go to grad school in the fall.

I have also thought about switching majors. I liked my math, chem, and phys classes and it bothers me that we only use the very basics of the stuff from those classes in my current classes. Also, I really liked the general programming class I took and thought software or computer engineering might be for me. I talked to the advisors in that department and sat in on a few classes. Still, I could not make up my mind.

**Internship Info:**

I have had two internships. The first one was eight months long in quality engineering at a furnace manufacturer. The second one was 3 months long in a medical device company as a manufacturing engineer. The first thing I noticed was that things were not as concrete as they were in school. It is hard to explain why I didn’t enjoy it much. It had something to do with not having solid solutions and feedback. I did enjoy the second internship more. Not just because I liked the place more, but because I had more experience and felt more comfortable.

I tried to get an internship as a design or research engineering but was unable to. I did talk to some of the design and research engineers in my company and it seemed like just another department within the company.

**Summary:**

I believe I could get an engineering job before I graduate but I want to find something that I really like doing. Things that I am considering are:

* Grad school in mechanical engineering
* Undergrad school in software/comp engineering
* Engineering job right after I get my BS in ME
* Anything

I feel like I am being picky. Most people would be happy just to get a job but I want to be happy/excited/content with going to work every day. I would really appreciate anyone who could give me insight on what I should do. I want a goal to shoot for before I head back to school from winter break.

Besides the obvious reason of stupid users here's why I'll never work IT support again:

1. Even if your IT department is in-house, other departments still treat you as if you are just the help desk.  They won't yell at members of any other department, marketing, finance, engineering, etc. but they won't feel bad for yelling at you.

2. You don't get the respect from customers or other company employees.  To the other departments, you're just there to serve them.

3. If you are part of an in-house IT department, you never feel like you're making a big difference at your company. You're supporting those who make all the important decisions, IE. marketing &amp; engineering.

4. IT departments are usually situated at the worst areas of the company building.  I was situated in a large closet. 

5. Policies help govern the way we work but IT support have too many policies that don't apply to the real world.  You'll end up having to break the policy or you can't help the user.

6. You have to be the first one in the office because teams have meetings and conference room equipment routinely malfunction.  You have to be the last to leave the office because there's always a user who insist you fix his/her problem by end of day.

7. There are no hot girls in IT.  You pretty much hang out with all your nerdy/weird/fat co-workers everyday."

I am not really interested in working there once I graduate so I want to find a good Web Development internship this summer, but am having trouble finding companies to try to apply to.  Maybe I am just looking in the wrong places.  Is anyone recently (or currently) in the same boat as me and could let me know where to look?

In a year and a half I will be doing an internship, working 3 days a week, then college courses the last 2 days in the week.

I hear many things about what it will actually be like, but never any specifics, ya know? I guess you just get used to it, and when explaining it, it doesn't seem as complicated as it may be, or something, yeh?

I've been curious about how big a team usually is, of course depending on the company and what the primary function of the company is.

A few questions to help understand:

* How big is a team, usually, and how many teams are there, would you say?

* Is there a lot of original coding, or is there a lot of, as this one guy explained in a different subreddit, ""putting glue between existing frames?""

* I like a challenge... are there many challenges? projects? What are these projects like? What is an assignment, or ""quota"" like?

* I do greatly feel like this is for me, but do you think, with the way the world is going, that aspiring to pursue a career in CS will become a difficult endeavor, or is it not as competitive as I believe (which is **quite** competitive)?

* (Personal question) Have you ever hated your job for whatever reason? Why?

Specifically, questions for them during the interview.",arumberg,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15i7mt/i_need_some_help_prepping_for_an_interview_next/,"I have an interview next week at a nonprofit social services agency in a city about an hour from where I am currently living. The job is for a 'run-away and homeless youth' caseworker, and I found the job posting on craigslist.

Before I submitted my resume, I had done a quick search to find out the name of the agency I was applying to, as it wasn't listed. I easily found it after a Google search and after giving the website a quick glance, I decided to go ahead and apply.

Now that I have an interview, I went back to read over the website more carefully, and I found something that concerns me a bit, and I need help figuring out how to raise the subject during the interview. I found out that the agency is headed by the Catholic Social Services which is headed by the local Diocese. 

My issue with this is that I consider myself to be atheist. I want to know about how they implement their services. I have experience working with a faith-based organization through a school internship, whose Board of Directors was made up of head members of each of the local churches, and I preferred the way they ran their organization. Any religious services (prayer groups, free bibles, etc) were optional, and religion was never brought up in discussion unless initiated by the client. Weeks would go by sometimes before I heard any mention of God outside the occasional morning prayer circle which I did not involve myself with, with respect from the other volunteers there.

I want to find out from my interview whether the same type of hands-off religious approach will be utilized in my position. I won't feel comfortable preaching to young, impressionable, and vulnerable youth about something I don't believe in, if it were part of my job, and I wouldn't feel all that comfortable pushing a more conservative set of morals, either (for example, another part of their programs aside from runaway youth is SmartChoices, which 'guide students to make proper choices in areas of sexual abstinence [...] etc'. It makes no mention of other forms of safe sex, which I find troubling. Would I be forbidden to mention condoms or birth control if the situation arises?) But I don't know how to bring up the subject during the interview without making myself look like I'm uncomfortable with it or questioning their policies, or possibly outing myself as an atheist altogether. I mean, I know it would technically be discrimination and all if they would refuse to hire me based on my religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and all, but let's be honest. The Catholic Diocese hiring an atheist? It's easily dismiss-able by stating they would rather someone that more fits the agency's goals and mission. I.e., a potentially conservative, religious goal and mission.

But I don't even know any of this for sure. The agency's website doesn't mention anything about religion aside from ""A program of Catholic Social Services"". I mean, if they have a hands-off approach in terms of religion, then sign me up. I really want to work with this population subset. I nearly fell off my chair when I found the job ad, I was so excited. And I'm totally comfortable only making the $24,500 they quoted me on the phone while making the appointment if I get to do something I've been wanting to do for so long. I just need to find out how they handle religion in their agency as delicately and inconspicuously as possible for fear of jeopardizing my chances at getting the job.

I was promoted to associate software developer a few months ago and I'm doing most of the development for their new project. For the fall semester, I took 15 credit hours in conjunction with 25 hours of work a week.

On the plus side, I've definitely learned a lot, I have a lot of autonomy and the pay has been good, allowing me to lessen the amount of loans I've had to take out for school.

On the down side, as a result of taking 15 credit hours while working most of the week, my semester grades for this fall have been pretty mediocre and I haven't had the time to work on any personal projects. I also get really stressed out by work because some of the project management and leadership surrounding my project have been very poor. Sometimes all the office politics gets in the way of my ability to just program.

I'm thinking about quitting my job for the Spring semester and focusing on school and maybe some personal projects (although who knows how motivated I'll be to actually do that once the semester starts) and resuming work or an internship somewhere in the summer. 

Is there any value in this? On one hand, my GPA could be better but on the other hand,  my job looks good on my resume, especially since I'm given a lot of responsibility and crucial work. What do you think?"

Must be currently enrolled in a full time degree program and returning to the program after the completion of the internship.


Experience in systems software or algorithms.


Excellent implementation skills (C++, Java, Python).


Knowledge of UNIX/Linux or Windows environments and APIs.


Familiarity with TCP/IP and network programming


Now, about me. I am a freshman in college, and will be taking my first csci class this spring (intro to csci). I never took any programming classes in high school because I only recently became interested in computer science and decided on this major. My entire programming knowledge consists of what I read from a ""Intro to programming with java, for dummies"" book, so basically I know nothing. I am dedicated, and am willing to put in as much time as I have available to me to learn and progress. Since this internship is a summer internship, I doubt I'll be able to learn all of that by this summer. Summer 2014 gives me a lot of time, or at least I hope. Now for my questions


1. Do you honestly think I can be a viable candidate by then?

2. What resources/websites/books do you recommend?

3. What order should I learn in? Python -&gt; Java -&gt; C++ ? How will I know if I am proficient enough? 

5. What do they mean by ""implementation skills"" and ""Systems software (seems very broad)""


Thanks. Also I am not here to learn only for this internship, as it's obvious it's unlikely that I will get it. I'm just trying to become an overall good candidate for any csci internship and to eventually gain the skills I need for the real world. Do you have any tips or ideas on what I should be learning on my own/spending my time on?

15jvp1,4,2012-12-27,I'm a math major with a beginner's Java course under my belt. What should I do in order to get a programming job after college?,cshelpplease,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15jvp1/im_a_math_major_with_a_beginners_java_course/,"I'm a senior math major and I really screwed up my college career. I started college in 2009 as a history major and I had a lot of trouble deciding on what to major in. I started down the path to a CS major last year, but decided on majoring in math instead because 1) I liked my math classes better than my CS classes and 2) it would take at least an additional 2 years to be a CS major, meaning I'd be in college 6 years for a BS.

So right now I'm set to graduate next spring. The CS-related courses I have taken are: Computer Science I (Java programming), Foundations of Computer Science (which was basically discrete math applied to CS), Discrete Mathematics, Combinatorics and Statistics/Probability. I'm taking Computer Science II (database structures with Java/C++) in the Spring. It is the prerequisite for all the other CS courses, so hopefully I'll be able to take more CS courses in the summer, fall and next spring. 

As of right now, I've been studying Java on my own, but I'm kind of lost about where I need to go from here. The [CS major](http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/undergrad/CSEMajorRequirements.html) at my university is huge and requires a ton of different classes. **What should I be teaching myself in order to land a programming job?** What are the essential topics I need to study? I can find textbooks and free online classes myself, I just need to know what you guys consider the essential topics that every programmer should know.

I'm also considering just biting the bullet and switching my major to CS and taking the extra 2-2.5 years to graduate. That was my original plan before this past semester, but I decided in the first week before classes that I'd rather major in math so I dropped Computer Science II and took only math courses. 

This whole thing is pretty disheartening. I've always been an overachiever and here I am as a senior and I still don't have a concrete major. I'm a very hard worker, I am just so confused about what I want to do. I know it isn't relevant in the real world, but I have a 3.78 GPA. I'd really like to know from people actually in the industry what the best course of action seems to be. I don't doubt my ability to learn things on my own, I'm just not sure I'll be able to get a job if I go that route. How bad will it look if I'm a math major with no relevant internships while in college? Is it possible to get an internship after college?

There are a lot of details I left out so if you have any questions please ask. Thank you all very much for any help or advice you can give me."

15n3uw,13,2012-12-29,"Recently I posted about the frustrations of going for a ""Game Design"" degree and you were all helpful. Thought I'd share my findings for anyone in my situation, or thinking of pursuing something similar. ",NotyoWookie,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/15n3uw/recently_i_posted_about_the_frustrations_of_going/,"So, a little back story about my previous post. I posted with a concern about being currently enrolled in a program (very expensive, mind you) that is focused around getting a degree in Game Design. This was a, what I guess you would consider, for-profit, arts, university that is widely publicized, that I thought would really help me drive home my dream of creating video games, both on my own, and for a AAA company. I'm not going to put the name of the school on blast (I very well could have done that already in my last post, too lazy to check), but some of you probably know what I'm talking about. This particular school runs a new course each month. For example, month number one is English with teacher A, month number 2 is Game Design with teacher B. Each course totals about 4 weeks of instruction, typically with one major assignment each week.

Anyway, I know when I was starting out with all of this, I had trouble finding experience from a truly beginner level. I know there are a lot of us who are inspired to do the work, but lack the means to see it to fruition. I just wanted to give my personal experience so far, and my decisions from this moment on, to maybe give a little insight to those who are, or soon will be, in my position. I'll go ahead and let you all know I've only done freelance game design work so far on indie games, and have no first hand experience into the inner workings of working for a company.

**The Bad**

* My experience at my university has been a frustrating one. I guess after a few years of being out of formal schooling, I had my expectations of what college would be like. Even online school, with it's own mix of good and bad, I thought would have a certain structure. Instead I found myself hardly ever, sometimes never, interacting with my teachers. New class would start, receive email about syllabus and course overview, and then we were on our own. I felt like I was purely self-teaching. We would get reading assignments in the syllabus for the whole month, the assignments were all explained, often poorly, and that would be it. The only time I'd ever hear from my instructor was when I received a brief tidbit of feedback on an assignment. I wasn't being taught, the thing I am paying this school to do, instead I am essentially doing my own self-teaching. A vast majority of the assignments I run into require me to go out, search the internet, and bring back my findings to share with fellow students. None of this involves the teacher. I'm all for self-teaching, but when that is 100% of the class, then what am I paying for? I consider education to be very important, and I want to get more out of my money, and time, than a piece of paper.

* Some classes had the once a week live chat sessions, some of these were wastes of time, others were helpful. I thought this was great at first, live chat with all your classmates and your instructor, be able to voice your opinion or issues, who didn't want that? Here's the problem I ran into. I'm in an online classroom for whatever reason that may be. My course, Game Design, is *only* online, meaning everyone in that course in an online student. The instructor for that month, as to be expected, scheduled the live-chat during school hours. I have a family, a newborn, a full-time job, etc. This made attending these chats impossible for me. Now, I could figure out a way to work around this, but that would last all of four weeks. Then I'm off to a new class, a new instructor, new hours. Repeat each month.  This is extremely difficult to work around. 

* ""There is no such thing as an idea guy"". That is something I heard all the time. I didn't realize how true it was until I began looking into internships, entry-level jobs (for reference), etc. I realized through my own attempts at game creations, and research, that having, at least, a good familiarity with programming will open the flood gates for you. Game Design will very rarely touch on this. You'll usually get a brief run through of a language or two, but the focus will be on how programming, art, and design, all mesh. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but you will not be in a position to leave that school ready to break into the gaming world. I began having to self-teach more than I was learning from the school. I have spent *hours* complaining and bothering my Comp Sci friends on the best programming languages to go after, how they work, where I should start learning. I realized very quickly that self-teaching programming isn't impossible, but damn if it isn't difficult to jump into with no experience and no education. 

* I will also never be taught a strong familiarity with game engines, which I really kick myself for not looking into more before ever getting into this degree plan. I understand there is a difference between development in design, especially when referring to school programs, but damn if I didn't think I would at least be doing something along those lines. I've been dicking around with Unity, some Unreal Editor, and a couple others, just to get my head around what it all entails. This is also where the help in programming comes in handy, especially as an indie-developer, when you don't have a mess of programmers to do the heavy lifting for you. Now those of you who are familiar and are reading this can correct me if I'm wrong by all means. But I haven't really come across a job posting or internship where 'Game Designer' didn't mean 'Game Developer', at least to some degree. 

* You are extremely limited on what you can do after school. The amount of jobs open to a Game Designer opposed to someone with a Comp Sci degree is ridiculously limited. Obviously that's to be expected. I thought, ""hey, I want to be a game designer, so I'll do this, get into a job, and go from there."" I realize that it is extremely beneficial to have something to fall back on. I would rather have a job while I pursue my dream, rather than pray something happens and I'm not jobless for months+.

* Last, since this is what sparked this post mostly, I'll talk about the technical issues with online school by giving a little example of what happened to me. I won't get into details as to what the assignment was, but it required a decent amount of work involving designing a game. By the end of it, I had to submit about 5 documents to my instructor, each demonstrating, with pictures, the various things I did, noticed, played, etc. A week later I get my grade back, and I get a 15/100 and a little snip-it saying something along the lines of them not receiving any of the images in the document. Not a big deal, I did all the work, I spent a lot of time on it, so I emailed my instructor apologizing within 15 minutes of it being posted. I explained I didn't know what happened, but I promise it was a genuine mistake, I had thought everything submitted properly, and if I thought there was something that went wrong I would have brought it to his attention. 2 weeks later, a couple more emails, and I don't hear back. I'm doing my final project, and same damn thing happens. Same thing as before, I email, I wait, and a week later I get an email saying I'm shit out of luck since grades are almost closed. I'm not computer illiterate by any means, I worked my ass off to get those assignments done, and now I am practically failing the class.  I get it, shit happens sometimes, but I feel like I was blown off. Every month has headaches like this, where I can barely get in touch with instructors for small reasons to large reasons. This is the issue with online school, I feel, and not necessarily just this school. 

**The Good** 

* Though it has it's headaches, I have learned a lot at a *purely* design level. I know how to better implement ideas, how things fit together ""big picture"" wise, how to document and portray my issues and ideas to other designers, programmers, artists, etc. I understand how to look at a game from a position as a designer, rather than a player, which is a bit harder than it sounds. I have worked with programmers that don't have a design bone in their body, artists that couldn't tell you what *draws* a player to a game, instead of what's fun about a game they played. I understand the give and take relationship between difficulty, fun, and replayability. At the end of the day I guess that's exactly what I should have expected to get out of it, but with less upsets with the school itself.  

* For someone who works full-time, as I did before, I was able to do classes at my pace for the most part. I didn't have to be sitting in a classroom in order to do the work needed for my class. If I needed to take a 15 minute break to feed my son, I could do that. If I had to work late, no big deal, I did my homework ahead of time.

* Working with some noted designers isn't something I thought I'd be doing. Opposed to a Comp Sci degree, whose professor worked in the IT world, a lot of the instructors have worked in the industry, some are still in. They understand the plights, and, if you have one that is reachable, let you pick their brain. 

**Conclusion** I just want to make sure I express why I am personally leaving, and not to let it affect someone who is tossing up this decision as I did. For myself, I think I'm done with the Game Design path. I've weighed the options, and after this last incident, I'm kind of done with it. I have other factors playing into my decision instead of just what's above that works for me. I get paid a monthly housing allowance to attend school. Online I only receive half of the national average, 700,  opposed to about 1,300 if I go to a classroom. This means I don't have to settle for some mediocre job, making minimum wage, until school is over. I think going to school for programming not only costs less, but will pay off more. A lot of what I can learn about game design I can self-teach easier than I can self-teach programming. I would also like to have a job to fall back on, until I can break into the industry. I'll be able to jump onto making my own indie games a bit faster than I would if I were to purely stay on the design path.  I haven't yet made the jump out of the school yet, and I'm not sure when I will for various personal reasons, mostly financially speaking. Plus I have to talk to the university I want to attend when they are back from winter break.

I apologize if this is long, doesn't belong here, doesn't apply to you, whatever. I know this information would have been nice to have before I made my decision, and hopefully it might help someone out there. Please feel free to give your own constructive feedback with this, or personal experience, or just general thoughts on the subject. I know there are positive stories out there where this worked out for someone, but for me that just doesn't seem to be the case. I am merely just a small, insignificant speck on the otherwise booming industry and have not, by any means, experienced a lot of it. 

**TL;DR** A Game Design degree has it's up's and downs, don't think it's for me as a path to being an employed game designer. 

Edit: Grammar and spelling I'm sure. "

Help with an internship in Europe?,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/15m6pt/need_your_help_in_order_to_take_the_first_step_to/,"My previous question http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12kqhy/polymer_engineer_from_india_willing_to_relocate/ got a lot of helpful answers. I have decided to try for an internship in polymer/chemical companies of Germany/Sweden/Norway/Holland. Here's my pitch:
I am a pre-final year student of masters program in polymer engineering at IIT (India). I have previously interned at the R&amp;D center of the worlds largest chemical company working on a project on the development of polymer composites. I am interested in working in xxxxxx(country) in one of the leading chemical companies such as xxxxxx(company name) after my graduation. I believe this internship will be a compatibility test for both the parties where I will be able to learn a lot from the best minds in industry while also adding value to the company (What I actually want to say is that if the company finds my work satisfactory, they will be able to and hopefully will hire me as a full-time employee). My guide at the previous internship (a scientist in the xxxx division) can provide a reference for my work if required.

I will supplement this with some more content but this is what the basic format will look like.
I have the following questions:-

1) Is such a plan of interning in a company in Germany/Sweden, etc. and expecting a full-time position in return for good work reasonable? AFAIK, in India and US, summer internees in pre-final year are usually hired for permanent positions based on their performance. Does this work in Europe as well. Also, more importantly, is it possible to get internships in these countries for Indian students?

2) My skillset includes the following:- Ability to work on projects in both industry and academia, experience in working with extruder, injection molding equipment and characterization instruments like DSC, TGA, capillary rheometer, UTM, FESEM, etc.,good knowledge of core subjects (core GPA:- 8.5/10), elementary knowledge of French(which will be useless I suppose), proficiency  in C++, MATLAB, Python and good knowledge of computational fluid dynamics. Are these ok to get me an entry level job?

3) My cover letter will be following similar structure as what I have mentioned here. Should I add or delete anything? Is it too condescending or too modest?
Will be extremely grateful for your help. Appreciate your time and consideration."

Advice?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/15m1fp/i_am_a_senior_in_college_chemical_engineering_and/,"So I don't want to get too specific but I am an overqualified college senior graduating from a top engineering University. 5 years internship experience, great GPA, tons of leadership experience, and to be frank...I am one of the more social and overall well liked people that I know. Still, I can't seem to find a job....I think that it has almost everything to do with the fact that I can't find a job that appeals to me.

All of my friends are going into the workforce as process engineers (like plant management) and making oodles of money but that sounds horrible to me. On the other hand, a traveling technical salesman sounds horrible to a guy who just wants to have a family and provide for them. I know some of you will say that it might be time to look outside of my major's norms for jobs but I love the technical side, it's why I chose to study it.

I am looking for advice from someone who studied a technical major and found themselves not liking the prospects that the job market pigeon-holed them into. (I hope this isn
t too specific to get off the ground and get some advice)"

Freshman CS student with 0 background in CS, only got interested after reading a little on what programming is about, etc. Taught myself a little java from thenewboston with the vision of creating an app, but since then multiple people have told me it's not a good idea to learn java first for whatever reason. The underlying question I have is: Can I become a good candidate for a software development (paid) internship this summer if I can't program anything now? I'm willing to put in about 15 hours a week of self-teaching. Should I just skip out on this summer and try next summer?


Lastly, if you answered ""Yes,"" what should I be learning in these five months? I take it that the ""technical"" interviews can be a bit difficult, and whenever I read the Q&amp;A's some interviewers give I end up with [this](http://fakeplus.com/pictures/jpg/i-know-some-of-these-words_20120529130516.jpg) expression on my face, feeling overwhelmed by the very broad and vast amount of knowledge I have so little time to learn.

I read over a lot of the ones on the first couple pages, so hopefully my questions won't be redundant.  

I just recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I have been in school full time.  I have done some on the side stuff including: accounting/bookkeeping, tutoring, and retail work, but have focused mostly on school for the last few years.  I have the basic computer experience most computer savvy CS grads would be expected to have.  I don't have any on paper programming/CS type experience.  I didn't take advantage of internships while in school.  I have the academics and the theory, but not so much real world experience.  Hopefully this will all fall into place quickly.  I know that many jobs look for recent CS grads with a theoretical background who need to be ""baby-stepped"" into the industry; but I know not every job is like that.  That is not to say I don't have other talents.  I have experience in: academic programming, IT, bookkeeping/accounting, education, project management, event organization/coordination, writing (promotional, advertising, etc.), photoshop, and digital audio engineering/mixing.

* I have applied for a few jobs, and potential employers/recruiters have asked me what my expected salary is.  I don't want to low ball myself here.  I did put in the work for a B.S., however I am aware that as a new grad with little experience I can't ask for a top end salary.  What range would be fair (in southern and northern California) for myself AND the company?

* Any specific tips in how to land beginning CS/programming type jobs that will give me a good start?

* I have also looked into analytical/testing/modeling type jobs that involve more math and less programming...  But I haven't found a great deal of info about this field.  Any tips?

* Anything else?  :)"

It's important that I make enough to live comfortably in the city (most likely Queens or Brooklyn). I would really love a job as a software developer for a smallish company or startup (ideally doing mobile development, but I'm open to anything really). I have experience with Java, C++, SQL, a little Python and Javascript. While I may have limited experience I'm am open and excited to learn new platforms and feel that I can learn new languages quickly. I'm also going for a business minor.

I feel like I don't have enough experience at the moment however, I've done *alright* in school, I have a 2.8 GPA and am trying hard to get it above a 3 in my last semester.  My low GPA is really only due to two classes (Multivariable calculus and Signals Processing, an electrical course). I know a lot of what companies are looking for is experience and I don't think my education has really given me that, I've learned a lot about the theory of computer science and such and have coded a lot of different algorithms and a couple different small, simple programs. I know a lot of what software development is is what I've been doing on the side, on my own time, and to be honest its not really much of anything. I don't really know where to start with that.

I'm wondering what you guys think my outlook may be. I know the need for software developers is sky high right now but I'm still very worried about my chances of finding a good job in NYC.

I know this isn't a software developer specific subreddit or anything but I thought it wouldn't hurt to put it out there.

To be honest I don't really want to work there, SQL is pretty boring and I do not like the big corporation atmosphere. If it is my only choice it wouldn't be so bad, I know I'm lucky to have any options. Do you think it would look bad if I accepted a job there but continued to look for other jobs and possibly leave Travelers after working there for only a short period of time?

15ogms,4,2012-12-30,I'm about to graduate from mechanical engineering. Did I make a mistake?,IdeaOfHappiness,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/15ogms/im_about_to_graduate_from_mechanical_engineering/,"I am a 23 year old mechanical engineering student that will be graduating from a state university this May and I have no idea what I am going to do after. I am beginning to think I have made a mistake in choosing mechanical engineering. I have been doing a lot of things to try to make up my mind but haven’t been able to decide what I should do.

**School Info:**

I obsess with knowing how to do things perfectly. I read all my textbooks for fear of missing information, even though I could get good grades without knowing all that info. When I find the answer to a homework problem I redo it using all the methods I’ve learned. I see this as a disadvantage because (in my experience) supervisors want their engineers to solve the problem as quickly as possible, even if there might be a better method out there.

I really enjoy school. I am good at school; I have a 3.7 (92.5% avg). That being said, I don’t know if I enjoy the engineering part of school or just school in general. I like to sit down with a problem, solve it, give it to the teacher, and they tell me how well I did. I like having the feedback of grades. E.g. if you get an A, you did well.  This doesn’t necessarily mean I want to continue school. I want to know what it means to enjoy school; what would I be good at if I like school?

I thought about going to graduate school because I enjoy school. I got a job working for a professor to see if grad school would be for me. It has only been one semester and I haven’t decided. Plus, it might be too late to sign up to go to grad school in the fall.

I have also thought about switching majors. I liked my math, chem, and phys classes and it bothers me that we only use the very basics of the stuff from those classes in my current classes. Also, I really liked the general programming class I took and thought software or computer engineering might be for me. I talked to the advisors in that department and sat in on a few classes. Still, I could not make up my mind.

**Internship Info:**

I have had two internships. The first one was eight months long in quality engineering at a furnace manufacturer. The second one was 3 months long in a medical device company as a manufacturing engineer. The first thing I noticed was that things were not as concrete as they were in school. It is hard to explain why I didn’t enjoy it much. It had something to do with not having solid solutions and feedback. I did enjoy the second internship more. Not just because I liked the place more, but because I had more experience and felt more comfortable.

I tried to get an internship as a design or research engineering but was unable to. I did talk to some of the design and research engineers in my company and it seemed like just another department within the company.

**Summary:**

I believe I could get an engineering job before I graduate but I want to find something that I really like doing. Things that I am considering are:

* Grad school in mechanical engineering
* Undergrad school in software/comp engineering
* Engineering job right after I get my BS in ME
* Anything

I feel like I am being picky. Most people would be happy just to get a job but I want to be happy/excited/content with going to work every day. I would really appreciate anyone who could give me insight on what I should do. I want a goal to shoot for before I head back to school from winter break.

Sci. grad, going back to college for BA in CS?",TeaStainsAndTobacco,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/15nij8/23_yo_pol_sci_grad_going_back_to_college_for_ba/,"Hello, like the title says I am 23 and looking to go back to school for a bachelors in computer science, and just had a few questions, would really appreciate any tips.

1) If the school I'm going to is lesser known state school and not widely prestigious by any means, will this significantly decrease my chances of getting a solid job out of the state?

2) Will it be hard to find a good entry-level CS job at 26-27 years old if I have had very little work experience?

3) Do you think it is more important to rush through getting my degree and then getting a job, or should I try to fit in a couple of internships along the way?

4) Do you think that my bachelors in Political Science could combine with a future CS degree for a job?

5) How important is it to try and learn coding languages outside of classes?

Thanks so much!"

I am confused as to what my next step should be. Honestly, the only programming experience I have is what I've done in school, and the stuff that I taught myself. I graduated with the decent GPA of 3.2. Although I don't know EVERYTHING, I'd say I have a pretty decent knowledge of programming, but I guess that doesn't mean anything, since I have no work or payed experience in the field, right?. Should I be more focused towards getting an internship, or a straight up career? I'm assuming that it's easier to get an internship, especially since I'm willing to start off with no pay, JUST to get my foot in the door and have something more impressive to put on my resume. (I have a crappy part time job at a supermarket that I can get small money from in the mean time). Is my assumption right that it is easier to go for an internship instead of a career at this point in my life? Since my GPA was above 3.0, one of my professors said that if I E-Mailed her my resume, she would look for an internship for me. Then again, I could also check out the career center at my college. Or perhaps one of you have a completely different method altogether?? I really wanna start getting on the ball ASAP, it's bad enough that I didn't do an internship during college and that I'm 24 already. I don't wanna let too much time pass between graduating, and start applying, because that won't impress anyone! Please give me some advice. Thanks!

TOO LONG TO READ: I'm 24, just graduated with BS in programming and no work experience in the field whatsoever, what do I do?"

15qgxu,8,2012-12-31,Recent grad feeling lost,tnuocsid,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/15qgxu/recent_grad_feeling_lost/,"I'm a recent engineering grad looking to focus more on the software side of things and hoping to eventually find a career in that field but I am feeling a bit lost. I stupidly did not do any internships while I was in school, so now I am a graduate with no experience.

I've taken a handful of CS courses as required by my program, and I am somewhat comfortable in C and Java (enough to do my assignments and school projects).

I feel like I'm at a point where taking more classes won't have made a difference, that the only way to move forward is to use what I've learned and make something out of it. I've constantly been told a good way to demonstrate what I know and to continue learning is to start some sort of a personal project and to continually build on it. This seems especially important to me now that I'm looking for a career but have no prior experience.

The problem is, I'm not sure where or how to start. I've tried looking through open source projects for inspiration, but a lot of the times I'm still left feeling lost. 

Has anyone else ever felt this way before? How did you overcome it?"

I lost a girl I had amazing feelings about and all the while I felt led on. Buying her dinner, taking her out places and then we were friends, which is fine, but then she started getting shitty with me.
other problems I've had this year involve me getting a fairly good internship at a magazine, but my dad thinks its a waste of my time and doesn't even recognize what I want to do with my life. (That being writing/editing etc etc)

I also haven't even been kissed in a year (Or anything else) and I know thats not the end of the world but I really feel jaded by people in general. I just want to feel normal and have what other people have, but I also don't feel like I can talk to anyone else. 

I had an awful shift at my fastfood job tonight as well, where everyone else invited people out for new years and then left early leaving me to clean the entire store, and not being invited out. (They wont get fired because the boss just wont fire them)
I'm just kind of done with life you know?

So I'm probably not going to kill myself, but I feel like doing it, and kind of wanted to tell someone how I felt, because I really dont have anyone in my life to approach about this.

Thank you.

Also any errors in spelling etc is due to drinking a fuck ton of whiskey."
15prdm,15,2012-12-31,I'm a biology major and I want to go into the computer science field,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15prdm/im_a_biology_major_and_i_want_to_go_into_the/,"I realize this is probably a fairly common situation brought up on here, but I would appreciate any advice anyone could give.

Relevant details:
-I'm a fourth-year molecular and cell biology student with one (or potentially two) semesters left until I graduate.

-I'm no longer interested in any of the career options related directly to my major (I worked in a biology lab for a little over a year, and can't imagine myself working in a lab for the rest of my life.)

-Over last summer I began to teach myself programming in Java, which is how I initially became interested in computer science as a career.

-By the time I graduate, I'll have taken (at least) two introductory computer science courses, discrete mathematics, statistics, and two semesters of calculus. I also have the option of graduating one semester late, in which case I could take additional CS classes and potentially complete a minor (depending on my luck in getting into classes, which can be quite difficult due to the growing demand for/lack of space in CS classes at my university).


Specific questions:
1. Would it be worth it to obtain a minor in computer science, assuming I could in fact manage to take all the necessary classes? How much of a difference would a minor make to getting into a CS masters program? 

2. Supposing I don't obtain the minor and graduate on time in the spring... Would it be worth it to pursue a second bachelor's in computer science, or should I try to apply directly to graduate programs? What is the likelihood of getting into a graduate program without a CS degree?

3. How can I go about building up experience outside of my academic work? I realize it's probably pretty unlikely that I'll be able to land an internship given my lack of experience/classes, so what would be the most productive ways of gaining experience on my own?

**LT;DR**: I'm graduating with a degree in biology, I have one or two semesters left, and I want to go into CS. I may possibly be able to obtain a minor if I stay at university for an extra semester. Any advice welcomed.

Thanks in advance."
