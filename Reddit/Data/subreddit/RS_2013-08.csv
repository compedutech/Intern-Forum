I'm a rising 3rd year CS major at Georgia Tech. We have two career fairs, one in the fall and one in the spring. My goal is to get an internship with one of the big ones (Google, Microsoft, etc.), but I haven't decided whether I want to do it next summer or next fall. I've never had a technical interview, and I'm worried that I'll mess up any interviews I get from the fall career fair. I've taken a data structures and algorithms class (got an A), but I'll be taking another algorithms class this fall, and I feel that if I wait until the spring, I'd have an extra semester to program more and practice technical questions. I'll know by December whether I want to do a summer or fall internship.

Thanks for any advice and help!"

I have been looking for jobs all last year and this summer but with little luck. I want to get into wall street and financial services type career in New York but don't know exactly how.

It seems like bulge bracket banks hire from their internship base is this the same for the boutique banks? 

When is on cycle versus off cycle hiring?

Should I expect there to be lots of hiring this fall with the current outlook in  the US economy?

I am use Linkedin, career builder and monster to find jobs what else can I do?

I just got an offer from a firm in Philly for a position I am not really that into and seems low paying 30k. Should I take it or strive for what I really want to do in New York. 

I will be my computer and can respond if you have specific questions.

TL;DR
I'm looking for a job on wall street and want to know if hiring is going to pick up this fall for entry level position.

1ji4b1,11,2013-08-01,Prop Trading: Torn between Systems Engineering and Software Engineering - where should I focus my first real job?,brobi-wan-kendoebi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ji4b1/prop_trading_torn_between_systems_engineering_and/,"A bit of background: I am completing my BS in Computer Science this fall, and am in the process of pursuing a MS in Computer Science (or software engineering; I have enough pull either way to settle into a specialty). I have had PHP web development internships in the past, and this summer, I got a really nice internship at a financial company in downtown Chicago as a Systems Engineer Intern. I'm talkin' $60k salary as an intern, catered lunches, super casual work environment - it's pretty much the perfect atmosphere for me. I'm able to start working full time come January, and they have heavily alluded to me that they'd like to pull me on full time at that time - if that's what I want.

The catch: I really, really would like to have a development or programming role versus this ""Systems Engineer"" role. Object Oriented programming is just more interesting to me. The Systems Engineering role is a lot of software configuration, deployment, Linux administration, and scripting. It's interesting, and requires a very high level understanding of how our software and hardware systems work as a whole, but I'm not utilizing the programming skills I've built up in the past. I thought it might feature more programming on a lower level, such as driver implementation or messaging systems, but that's a role I've learned that's encompassed by our Software Developers and Software Engineers.

I go to DePaul university. I thought it was an excellent program, especially the masters classes I've taken so far, but I've realized that the people at my company who are Developers are students from MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon. I'm competing with the big leagues. If I want to try and apply for a more developer focused position, there's going to be a LOT of heavy competition, and I'm not prepared right now. I really need to review a lot of stuff from the past couple years of schoolwork that I've done, and I need to step up my game and develop more personal projects with any free time I have.

My question is this: I really, really want to stick with trading firms. I love the work, I love the atmosphere, I love the industry, and I love the google-like benefits that they all provide. It's top-tier work, and I want a bite of the action. I could always apply to some web dev or application dev job around here and probably succeed, but I'm hungry for that foot into the door to the financial industry. Should I stick with this ""Systems Engineer"" role right out of school? Or should I try and apply for the Development/Software Engineering role, and if I don't get it, apply at every other prop firm in Chicago that has that kind of role? Any advice from people who are older and more experienced than me, especially if you work in finance, is greatly appreciated!"

Before I get to the main point, I think it would help if I said something about myself. Currently, I am a 3rd year mechanical eng. student studying at a Canadian University. My future career related goals are to start at the bottom and work my way to the top (I want to learn and experience the most I can). I hope to get into designing, and from there work my way to a  Project Manager and eventually, a Professor.  
Currently, I am still learning SolidWorks and just started AutoCAD.  I have also taken then initiative to learn C++ by myself, and I plan to keep learning as much as I can throughout my school life and career. 
  
This being said, the company I would like to work for at the moment is at Bombardier, they manufacture trains and aeroplans and such and would love to be managing projects there. 

On the other hand, I've also been told I have bad communication skills (got an A- in a communicatons course though), is there a way I can improve this situation ? 

I'm also a very shy person, but I plan to get out of my shell this year and start networking with representatives from companies through events; are there any tips on how I'd make an impression on companies that are there ? 

My concern is, what steps should I take to achieve my future goals, are there any design related companies that hire engineering students as interns? (willing to move for the period). What other skills should I learn and perfect ?  MATLAB etc .. ?

Any advice would be much appreciated !"

I have an internship in wealth management at a big financial institution and looking for a career in finance(Ex: Analyst of some sort, Unsure atm).




I've been taking a few economics classes which should be more geared the mathematical economics (ex: econometrics), but I find it was a bunch of memorizing and regurgitation. I am feeling unchallenged and unmotivated to receive great grades(great= Solid A, Currently B+/A- student). I love the options and derivative mathematics, but those classes are all at graduate levels. 

Which option do you think I will have a best job prospects once I graduate and remain flexible for future jobs such as management positions?"

I’m trying to get a job in New York City. I just graduated with an EE degree in May 2013 with 2 research internships under my belt. I have a few questions that noone else could help me with as well as this community:

•	If offered a job where do I go from there? How would I buy myself some time to see if another place wants me or something?

•	What is a typical interview at an engineering firm like? A startup?

•	As I stated, both my internships revolved around research at other universities. To my dismay, I’ve heard that the industry doesn’t respect this stuff as experience. Your opinion?

•	I’ve been sending my cover letter and resume in the same .pdf file. Should I keep them separated or is this okay?

•	Any advice on trying to get a job in a totally different city with no connections (obviously NYC). I’ve heard how impossible this is and that companies usually just hire employees’ relatives and friends, but I don’t care. NYC is where I must be!

•	Any other fields outside of engineering in NYC that an electrical engineer can get a job in? How would I go about doing that (making myself desirable, etc.)

•	When do I follow up on an application/resume submission? Do I call or email?

•	How do I do salary negotiations? I’ve read different things on reddit; some say it looks assertive and direct to ask about salary on first interview, others say this is a big mistake.

•	Are startups generally more lenient than huge companies when it comes to hiring entry-level people? I know the hours may be more strenuous but I’m willing! I would really like to be a part of a great idea blossoming.

•	Any job search sites that I should be using? I already know about indeed, monster, engineerjobs.

Thanks for your help and patience with this guys. As you can see, I’m quite the noob when it comes to industry work. I know my chances are slim so I came to the only people I know to do the impossible on a regular basis.

About 3 years ago, I bought a Sony Vaio laptop with a Radeon HD5470. I've always played WoW just fine, but after this years expansion, I'm having a hard time. I think I pushed my laptop too hard, now he keeps his 90ºC when browsing the web and often shutsdown when playing videos. 

Since I'm starting college next year (and with internships help) I'm planning to buy a new laptop til the end of this year, but I don't wanna make the same mistake again. I'm looking for a powerful laptop that can handle more than 3 years of light gaming without frying.

Country:

* Brazil. We don't have many laptop models around so I'm going to import from US.

Price:

* $2,000 tops

Purpose:

* I'm starting college next year so I'll be doing a lot of coding (Computer Science). I'm looking for a portable desktop replacement since my college is ~1,5h from where I live.

Looking for:

* Haswell i5 or i7
* HDMI port
* 8GB of RAM minimum
* At least 256 GB SSD
* Long battery life
* Smaller than 14""
* Lighter than 2kg and thin (I'm small)

Gaming requirements:

* WoW, Dota2, LoL, etc.

Any particular style that you like:

* I really like the XPS 14 syle.

Which of the following qualities would you prefer?

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Both

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance

Would you pay a premium for something that has:

* High resolution screen: Yup

* A great keyboard: Yup

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yup

* Great audio: Don't care



I thinking about the Razer Blade 14"" and Haswell MBP. The point is, the MBP is unlikely to have a dGPU, so I'm afraid that after 3 years I'll have to buy a new laptop. The Razer has a terrible screen, so I don't know if it's worth.

Thanks!

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[, I just want to say that NaughtyDog is my favorite game company of all time, I think you guys do an amazing job. Jak and Daxter is my childhood game and The Last of Us just topped it for my all time favorite game. I still want to get the Crash Bandicoots, and the Uncharteds are awesome. You guys can make a game about reading a phonebook and I will pre-order and platinum that game.  Ok, now for the questions. I understand if you choose not to answer some of them.  Do you see yourselves ever making games for all platforms, or are you guys sticking with Playstation?  What was the biggest challenge NaughtyDog as a team had to go through?  I've read that during the development of Uncharted 3 you split into two teams, the second began working on The Last of Us. Are there still two separate teams? If so, does this mean you work on two different games simultaneously?  On /r/thelastofus I've seen some debate on whether or not Bill is gay and if David intended to rape Ellie. So, just to put the questions to rest, are those true?  In The Last of Us campaign, why weren't there any 3 way fights between Joel, hunters, and infected? Was it a technical issue?  In the Last of Us, when and how does an infected become a bloater? I know the four stages (runner -&gt; stalker -&gt; clicker -&gt; bloater\), but it was said that when an infected feels like it's about to die it finds a corner to release more spores. So does the bloater happen before of after the spore release stage?  I have a friend whom I regularly play The Last of Us with. He's currently attending DeVry University and is currently working toward a degree in graphic design, It's his dream to work with you guys at NaughtyDog. What are his chances?  Do you guys plan on making a big entrance into next-gen with your next game?  Is it likely you will ever return to Jak and Daxter? And do you consider The Lost Frontier canon? Basically (this is the big one\), **will there be a Jak 4?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecogt?context=5)|4) There are still two separate teams working on two different projects. 5) Open to interpretation.  I will say Bill was written to be a gay character, but W. Earl Brown has said his performance is open to interpretation. \ 6) Both. 7) Don't know yet.  Entertaining some ideas, though. 8) What do you think?  :) 9) A lot.  10) Not a technical issue.  We actually had the tech to do it, it just never fit with the story. 11) No plans 12) Bloater happens if the body is strong enough to survive for longer than a clicker.  It's a rare occurrence. 13) Relative to his skill &amp; passion. 14) Don't know yet. 15) We always make a big entrance.  :) 16) No plans.  We gave it a shot at the beginning of the project and couldn't make it work for ourselves.
[(Spoilers\) Can you clear up whether or not Ellie ""knew"" at the end? Or is that supposed to be left unknown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed78e?context=5)|It's open to interpretation.
[Spoilers: The toy that Sam grabs in the store is a transformer. Was that done purposely to show his eventual turn or is it just coincidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqzq?context=5)|Lol... we're not that clever. 
[1\) How difficult was it bringing a new IP to the table with Sony this late on in the PS3's life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecr5y?context=5)|1) It was surprisingly much easier than we thought It'd be.  Sony has a lot of trust with us.
[Thanks for the AMA. I loved the ending of TLOU, I felt that it was so selfish, but so human at the same time. The world took something from Joel, so he took something from the world.  What other thoughts were there on the table for the ending for The Last of Us? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecq6v?context=5)|We had a happier ending at one point... where Ellie &amp; Joel were driving completely contented &amp; satisfied with their adventures off into a glorious sunset... but that didn't feel right. It just wasn't honest to the world or the characters we created. This ending felt right for us.
[The last shot of Ellie saying ""okay"" has to be one of the most powerful shots in gaming history.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed7v3?context=5)|Just an aside... it's nice that our opening image is Sarah, and our closing image is Ellie... I think it's nice at least. Good job us! haha :P.
[I have loads of questions, so I'll try the number I ask brief.  One of my favorite moments in the game (alongside the giraffes and David's death\) was the truck ambush in Pittsburgh, and one of  the reasons for that was the music. Was Hank Williams always your choice to complement the scene, or would you have used something else in hindsight?  As female Hunters/cannibals/Fireflies/military exist in concept art and in the multiplayer mode, why do we only fight male humans in the game? (There are female soldiers but Joel doesn't fight them in-game\) Is there any story based explanation, like keeping all the women and kids at the home base? Or was it for creative reasons, given the brutality of the combat?  What were some infected concepts and stages that you cut from the game? Looking at the artbook, there are a lot of concepts that seems pretty far-fetched for the universe you created, like the infected wielding tools.  Why are there no pictures of Sarah's mother in Joel's house? Is it because even before he lost Sarah, Joel wasn't one for holding onto the past?  Does Joel's last name start with an M or an N? I'm asking this because one of the ND forumers found the certificate in Joel's house with Sarah's (obscured\) full name on it, and we were wondering if you had any last name for Joel in mind.  Regarding David: How long do you suppose it took for a man like him to lose grasp on his morals, accept the new world order as it is, and turn to cannibalism with his buddies? Furthermore given the rather hebephilic overtones of his interactions with Ellie, was this an intentional character trait or just part of Nolan North's performance? If intentional, did David always have such tastes or was that just a byproduct of post-pandemic lawless living conditions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed4cn?context=5)|1) Hank wasn't the original choice, but he did turn out to be the best choice. 2) Development time &amp; memory prevented us from seeing the female hunters to completion. 3) Fungus growing on the environments that shot poison darts at the player were at one point in the game. 4) The backstory was that she left Joel after Sarah was born.  Not someone he looked up to to keep a picture around. 5) We didn't reveal the last name. 6) David's cannibalism came after the outbreak.  His other traits (both good &amp; bad) were always there.
[If you'd made the game for PS4, what would you have done differently?  Thanks for helping to make such an awesome game! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqcf?context=5)|Memory wouldn't be as much of an issue. we had to jump through so many hoops to get this game streaming (no load screens in our games still. YAY!)
[Hey guys, congrats on the huge success on TLOU! I actually have several questions for you to avoid a repetitive question.   What game was better to work on, TLOU or Uncharted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecu84?context=5)|Shit. both have their ups and downs (in production terms). For me U2 was my first time stepping into the game director role, so that was a fresh &amp; exciting (maybe naive but super open) time, but TLOU was something special, and challenging. I saw a video of U2 the other day and had some pleasant feelings of nostalgia bubble up, and seeing the fan art and people's reactions to TLOU has been extremely exhilarating. They both win! :)

 |And regarding the choice - 1. it's just the story we wanted to tell and 2. it's not a story-choice-based game, so to cram a major choice in at the last, final, epic set-up would've felt forced (to us)

We give those scenarios to the concept artists (in this case Hyoung Nam) to help us find the characters. So in stead of just doing flat orthographics or guesses at poses to sketch the characters in, we found that if you put them in a situation, it tells us way more about their design. 
[Awesome AMA, guys!  So I've heard, that according to the Japanese *The Last of Us* instruction manual, Joel and Ellie's last names are *Miller* and *Williams*.  Is that really true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecr5b?context=5)|Those were names that were used in early docs, but we decided to remove all last names for main characters pretty early in development -- no sure how they made it to any released manuals.

It's a very impactful story. yeah, it was one of many influences. mainly the lengths the father is willing to go for his son, and the darkness of the world that surrounds them. it really shines a light on the things humans are willing to give up (morally) to in order to survive. we also read City of Thieves, the movie No Country for Old Men, the movie Children of Men, and the Walking Dead comic... among some more non-fiction reads about how the world falls apart in ""World without Us"" and ""The Last Town on Earth""... check 'em out. 
[Amy Henning mentioned in several interviews that the create process for Uncharted (specifically 3\) involved deciding what would be challenge them on a technical level, and what kind of levels would be interesting to go to. To a certain degree, they built the story around those levels.  Was your philosophy the same with The Last of Us, or did story come before gameplay? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecu7d?context=5)|The concept of structuring an entire game around a relationship between two characters came first and was always at the heart of development.  
[Hey guys! Love the game! Thanks for doing this!  Neil tweeted the other day that his interpretation of the ending of TLOU was the minority opinion. What is that interpretation?  How does one become a creative director? What advice do you have for breaking into the gaming industry in any way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqcq?context=5)|1) Not fair to give our interpretation -- want to leave it open for people to discuss. 2) Advice for breaking into gaming -- make games!  Don't wait for someone to hire you.
[Were there any scenes that you guys wrote that later on that you decided were too brutal or intense and had them removed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecv7o?context=5)|No.  We were shocked no one ever asked us to tone down or censor any scenes.
[Will there be official The Last of Us merchandises sold at Naughty Dog's website soon?  I really want to buy the official ""The Last of Us"" t-shirt logo, and Ellie's t-shirt.  To people who wants to know how it looks like: Link to imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecrf4?context=5)|We REALLY want to do that... hopefully we'll be able to set that up. 
[When can we expect DLC for The Last Of Us, and what will it be based around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecrb0?context=5)|News is on the way about the first DLC drop.  Should hear about it this month.
[How in the hell DID Ellie know how to pop a clutch? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbectg9?context=5)|She learned quite a bit while sneaking out of her school in the quarantine zone.
[With the time/resources we had... I truly believe we made the best game possible.  Are there things we could've iterated on with more time/budget?  Of course. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbedm84?context=5)|Yeah ditto with Neil. We (Naughty Dog) did pretty good with what we had.
[Now that the game has been out for awhile now you have no doubt heard some criticisms made about the game. Some of these hold water and some are in my opinion just people nitpicking in order to get attention.  After hearing these criticisms is there anything you would change about the game if you could or do you still believe it is as good as it can be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecvoe?context=5)|With the time/resources we had... I truly believe we made the best game possible.  Are there things we could've iterated on with more time/budget?  Of course. 
[So uh that being said, may we pleeease have some more?  You can get away with the upcoming DLCs for now, but after that, will it be years before I see you again? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecq9r?context=5)|But hold your horses about all the future shit... ;)  DLC is going to amazing! Just wait! We're happy with what we've come up with.
[I would like to start out by letting you guys know that my friend and I are intense fans of TLoU, and we have a couple of questions to follow, but we also wanted to share with you guys that the both of us were representin' this past weekend at Metrocon in Tampa, FL.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbedcjf?context=5)|First of all... you guys are awesome. Thanks for sharing.  1) Don't know.  Still trying to figure it out ourselves. 2) Ending is open to interpretation.  
[Seeing as you've been looking over the game from the very beginning and through the development, was there anything that took you by surprise or anything you noticed when finally playing through the finished result that you were not aware of during the development? Or is it difficult to fully immerse yourself and enjoy the game after you've spent years making it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecq50?context=5)|Well, it's always hard playing a game that we've been so 'attached at the hip' to for so long without seeing the flaws. I mean, ""art is never finished, just abandoned"", right? And with video game development it's even worse. But I can say when playing through the game more strung together, I teared up at moments that I KNEW were actually going to happen. That was cool! I think some of it was the relief of 3+ years and a lot of blood, sweat &amp; tears manifest on the joystick. What a relief! 
[Internally, was the ending of The Last Of Us controversial??  I liked it but personally would have written it differently, how many possible ideas did you have for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqtk?context=5)|Initially, yeah... ending we ultimately went with didn't sit well with some members of the team.  Once it was more fleshed out, it became an easier sell.  We went through about 3 or 4 ideas before finding the ending that worked best for the story we wanted to tell.
[Can you elaborate on the alternate endings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed4m5?context=5)|We'll share some of them at a panel Bruce and I are doing at PAX.  More info to come.
[Are some of the team still not satisfied??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbedfve?context=5)|If they are, they haven't told me.  :)
[Was it easier to create a completely fictional world like Jak and Daxter or was it easier to create a world based on real life like in The Last of Us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecpgp?context=5)|AREYOUKIDDINGME?!?! haha. Jak and Daxter would be a luxury to design in that world again. Story would be hard to have depth though. Those characters are who they are now - it's hard to infuse them with the motivations &amp; choices we'd need them to have to make a compelling story (we tried early before we decided to make TLOU). A grounded world is a difficult solution space to design in though. But nothing good comes for free...
[What sort of programming jobs are there at Naughty Dog? What programming languages and other technologies are used to create your games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecv8c?context=5)|We're hiring all the time.  Check our website for details.
[How does one become a creative director or writer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbeek3l?context=5)|Become a writer is pretty simple.  Write!  Spend time honing your craft.
[Do you sit down and come up with a story or does it come naturally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbedc81?context=5)|Sometimes we stand when we brainstorm. :)
[Did you shape the world around Joel and Ellie as characters or was it the world you created that formed the characters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed57p?context=5)|Ellie and Joel were first.  Then came story genre and world.
[Also please give us a Joel Ellie sing along.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed57p?context=5)|We started with the idea of building a bond between two characters over the course of an entire game - and then a confluence of events happened that just fell into place for us that made the survival world a perfect backdrop to create the tension we needed for those characters to make interesting choices... so characters, then world I guess.
[So, brick or bottle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecoxs?context=5)|Brock the brick all the way.
[Hey guys, first off I want to say thank you for making **amazing** games for so many years. The last of us is a perfect 10/10 in my book and is one of my favorite games. My question is what is your guys favorite games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecpxu?context=5)|Ico, Resident Evil 4, and Monkey Island 2 (best ending for a videogame).
 |In no order: ICO RE4 Yoshi's Island hmmm... Fatal Frame II (only because no game has scared me like that ever before) what else... why are all these old japanese games? I just played Hotline Miami. That was some good fun! Not on the all-time list, but on a 2013 best of for sure OH! Limbo was awesome...  'nuff... 
[It would be awesome to see a Ico/Shadow of the colossus type game from Naughty Dog seeing as we'll probably never get to play The Last Guardian :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbedhw7?context=5)|Don't say that.  The Last Guardian is my most anticipated game.  
[I'm an author, and one of the most difficult things I find myself doing at the start of writing a novel is naming my characters something that is appropriate to their personality. I also share my name with Joel, and when The Last of Us was first announced, I flipped shit because Joel isn't a very common name. What made you want to use Joel for the main character of a post-apocalyptic tale, as opposed to more 'rugged' names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecvux?context=5)|His original name was Ethan, but we felt it was too close to Nathan.  I'm sure that can lead you to find out where the name Joel came from.  :)
[Hello Bruce and Neil. Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. As a programmer with an interest in AI, I enjoyed the ""Balance of Power"" system in TLoU. Can you talk about some of the hurdles and/or compromises the team had to make in order for the AI to help or challenge the player?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbeco8b?context=5)|All sorts of trials &amp; tribulations with our adventure in making great AI. maybe too many to get into here - but a couple things... having an Ally with the player in stealth encounters is probably the most difficult problem we could have tried to solve, and ""we"" (the royal industry we) need time to implement, iterate, and find solutions to the problems that will only come up by having actual set-ups in the game to help steer the tech direction... dunno if I'm answering this well... another early goal for the enemies what we had to create a ""dynamic front"" due to the flexibility we wanted the players to be able to take with our more wide-linear layouts. it meant the AI had to be able to recognize a new ""front"" where they'd be safe - and analyze the environment &amp; collision to create new dynamic flanks based on wherever the player was... ok I'm rambling. Max Dyckhoff did an AMA earlier, maybe he said something smart about the AI! haha.
[Hey you two. Your company has made some of the most memorable games ever. So I was wondering if you ever got the chance would you guys make another Crash Bandicoot? Another question. TLOU actually inspired me to write book, it's about zombies. Do I have your permission to use the quarantine zone idea? That's all I'm using from TLOU.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbecqem?context=5)|That would be awesome to do another Crash - but that property is owned by Activision now... or someone that's not us. sorry.
[I just wanted to let you guys know that you're awesome. I loved crash bandicoot as a kid and uncharted 2 was my favorite game until I played the Last of Us and was completely blown away by how amazing it is. Looking forward to your next project as I'm sure you guys will continue to produce fantastic games. My question is: What made you guys decide to switch from the more upbeat tone of Uncharted to the gritty, realistic and emotionally draining Last of Us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed92c?context=5)|We're fans of the genre and felt we could create a good character driven experience in that tackled more mature themes.
[You guys made in my opinion the best game ever made. my question is, Do you think your team can make a game of this quality again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed5cp?context=5)|We always try to top our last game.  So that's the plan.
 |Funny thing, is we really just make games that we think would be fun to us. Sure, there's a gap we saw in the industry, that there hasn't been a really good character-driven story in the survival genre done yet, but when kicking around the ideas for the game with Neil, it just sounded awesome. so we made that. :) 
[Thanks for doing the AMA Naughty Dog and for the amazing adventures you have provided with The Last of Us and your previous works...here are a few questions. :\)  What phases of development did the Naughty Dog team have to go through when creating The Last of Us? Was any code reusable from the Uncharted Series?  Any plans for the lab to be introduced in The Last of Us multiplayer…? If not, will you guys still be updating it in Uncharted 3?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed6et?context=5)|It's somehow become an unspoken naughty dog tradition to put a precursor orb in all of our games. so no.. nothing is being said with that  The lab was a fun concept for us too. who knows if it works with TLOU. we're working on our DLC stuff now, we'll have to see what the future brings... 
[Any plans for a stats page for The Last of Us similar to what you guys have on for Uncharted 2 &amp; 3 multiplayer? On that note, how does the rank system work for The Last of Us multiplayer?

And yeah, the foundation we started with was the Uncharted engine. we ended up rewriting the AI system from scratch and added some features to our rendering engine (along with misc other stuff), but most of the core tech was the Uncharted engine.
[Hi Bruce and Neil. Excellent job on TLoU, this game actually made me buy a PS3. It just had to be played.  As a computer science student in the United Kingdom passionate by the gaming industry, I ask how would a student go about learning in a studio such as Naughty Dogs? It seems that most studios all look for previous experience, which I do not have and is completely understandable.  Does Naughty Dog ever plan to run any internship schemes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed4x4?context=5)|Naughty Dog doesn't hire interns.  Although, I started here as an intern by bugging Jason Rubin and Evan Wells.  
[Hey Neil and Bruce, big fan here of Naughty Dog and looking forward to play future releases.  The only question is was there anything you wanted to put into The Last of Us that was too dark or morbid for the game?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg952/hi_were_neil_druckmann_creative_director_and/cbed9id?context=5)|Nope.  We got a lot of morbid out of our systems.  We did tone down some of Ellie's deaths during the David boss fight as they felt like too much to us.

1jleu6,19,2013-08-02,[UPDATE] Other intern stole from me and I'm so pissed off but have to have patience,WolfBro,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1jleu6/update_other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so/,"Original Post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i64ny/other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so_pissed_off/

So I'd gotten tired of telling everyone the same long story over and over again so I hadn't updated here, but I'm finally getting around to it.

So on the Friday that I posted the original post, the police came by and I gave them everything I had. However, most of what I had was not solid enough for the police. The officer told me that the case would be passed along to an ""investigator"" and he'd be calling me at some point.

After that I'm thinking, if I were a police detective who is kept moderately busy, how much am I going to care about a $300 theft? My answer was not at all, and I knew my case would require some digging to be 100% solid. So I became very upset. I'd felt that I'd lost and the bitch had bested me. 

I drove to my dad's house because my room mates idea of calming me down was to try and convince me via devil's advocate that I should assume she's innocent and look at that from her perspective. This absolutely infuriated me as I knew I was right.

So I drove to my dad's house so I could rant and calm down. My parents raised me to have a strong belief in what is right and wrong as well as honesty. And it wasn't so much that I was upset about the money. Honestly, I didn't give a shit about the money. Yes, I wanted the money back, it was $300 and I'm not rich, but $300 isn't going to make or break me. Instead I couldn't stand that someone would do this. It didn't even compute in my head how someone could do this. Especially since I'd thought we were friends. We sat next to each other at work, were constantly interacting and I thought it was a good relationship. 

And then there was the whole fact that someone who should be smart to be going to UCSD and able to get an internship at Sony. When I first learned that someone else had used my cash card, I was terrified because I knew that if I had committed this crime, I wouldn't have gotten caught. It really wouldn't be that hard and I assumed that the person would be at least as smart.

So before I'd calmed down talking to my dad, I was literally shaking with rage. And I wanted justice, not just my money back. Not necessarily justice for me, just for someone who is so stupid and wrong to be held accountable for what they did. And that's another reason the police felt worthless to me. The officer made it clear that their only concern was to get my money back, to retrieve what had been lost. It wasn't important to catch the person and hold them accountable. I didn't say this, but my thought was, ""But wait, I'm not reporting a loss, I'm reporting a CRIME!""

While I was talking to my dad in the kitchen, my older sister comes through and I let her know about the whole thing and everything I have. She's a lawyer who just took the bar this week. She told me that I could file a law suit against the person and after filing I could get subpoenas to get the security footage from Staples and my company, which is conjunction is very solid evidence. This surprised me because I didn't realize subpoenas were something that I alone could get.

I turned to my dad and said, ""I've won."" I felt immeasurably better. I had felt for sure that even though the evidence existed, I'd need the police in order to get it, and at that point I'd felt they would be worthless (understandably, I get that my evidence was purely circumstantial from their standpoint and they need to be impartial in the way they pursue justice, but it still pissed me off). 

So I knew I'd won and now I turned my attention to enjoying giving the bitch exactly what she deserved. At that point I'd been so pissed that I wanted my money back, I wanted her fired and I wanted her arrested. 

So on Monday I got all the paperwork from the court's website and began filling it out. My sister gave me instructions on how to write a declaration with everything I knew and then she made it all pretty and legalized for me. I printed off the subpoena forms as well and contacted my company to figure out who I needed to name in it. I had been nervous about that part. I was scared they might resent me for subpoenaing them, but after I got a response they seemed cool with it and told me who to name. 

My plan at this point wasn't to actually file the lawsuit. I wanted to get it all ready so that it just needed to be filed at the courthouse. I was going to take the stack of paper and confront her about it and I felt that if I made it clear that this wasn't just a typical ""I'm going to sue your ass"" kind of threat, and I was actually ready to do it, that it would carry more weight and scare her into just taking the easy way out.

I met with the HR manager again on Monday and updated her that I felt the police wouldn't be of help and told her my intentions of filing a law suit. At this point I told her she could go ahead and talk to the suspect. I'd asked her to hold off until I spoke with the police because I'd felt that the only way to definitely prove her guilt was if the police could find the purchased items in her apartment. And I didn't want to clue her in that I knew she'd done it so she could get rid of the evidence. The talk revealed nothing because all the HR Manager could do was tell her that someone had stolen it from me and ask her if she knew anything about it. Obviously she responded that she didn't.

But now I didn't care because I knew I'd get the video evidence I needed and it didn't matter what she did with the merchandise.  I also stopped being nice to her. Up until that point I'd been reigning everything in so I was still acting perfectly normal with her. Now I just flat out ignored her and it was kind of fun watching her reaction to it. Obviously I'd respond to anything purely work related, but that was the extent of it.

The HR Manager had also told me that I needed to handle this outside of work and asked me not to talk to her about it at work. This was a bit of a problem because we worked different schedules so I didn't know how to get to her in person. I also didn't have her number or personal email. My room mate was facebook friends with her, so I just messaged her on there which was also nice because it could show me that she'd read it.

My dad had been strongly advising me that I can't just flat out accuse her of it so I chose the words carefully. I just said that on Wednesday night I'd found out that my warranty card had been used and that Staples managed to bring up the security footage of the person who used it. Then I said that the footage showed her using my card to buy the stuff. I said that I'd already drafted all the paperwork to file a lawsuit against her and if we hadn't resolved this by lunch time the following day, I would be taking the paperwork to the court house. I asked her to please pay me back my money.

So the next day I went into work. I was feeling really anxious because I don't like confrontation. I just didn't want to deal with it. But I walked past her cube and sat at my desk like normal. After a minute she pinged me on microsoft communicator, asking for me to help her with something. It felt vague compared to how she'd normally ask that, so I assumed it was related to the money.

With that inkling I went all spy-mode and I brough up the voice recording app on my phone and tucked it into the breast pocket of my shirt. When I entered her cube, she pulled the receipt from the purchase out folded up to just show the giftcard number used to pay for it. She asked me if that was the number for my card. I looked at her sceptically and said yeah. She then started the worst acting I've ever seen, like seroiusly, Hayden Christensen's performance in Star Wars felt like an academy award performance compared to this. She pretended to freak out like she couldn't believe it.

She asked me to follow her and we went outside. And this is the best part. Are you guys ready for this? It's awesome.

Her story... was that on Wednesday a friend of her's that she's in business with called her up and gave her a Staples giftcard code and pin number to use to buy some business supplies. She said that he'd gotten it off craigslist and she couldn't believe that it was mine.

For a minute I just stared at her. I could not believe that this was the best story she could come up with. It was so fucking ridiculous. I honestly couldn't believe for a second that she could honestly ever expect me to believe it. She wants me to believe that someone else at work, a full-timer who was an adult and been working at the company for years, stole the cash card and put it on craigslist. Even though the ONLY PERSON I told at work was her. And that somehow, by astronomical odds, it just happen to be her fucking friend who bought it and just happened to give it to her, the only person at work who knew and that sat ... right... next... to.... me....

But I went along with it, tried to play it cool. I said that if this in fact true, that she'd need to show me the craigslist ad. She said but what if it isn't there. I said a big site like craigslist wouldn't delete any of the post data. It may not be visible to us, but they'd definitely have it and I would be surprised if they didn't make tape backups of everything and such.

**TL DR: Bitch who stole money from me at work got fired and paid me back.**

1jlakt,3,2013-08-02,My Internship Ends Soon - What Should I Ask My Bosses Before Leaving?,CharlieTango92,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1jlakt/my_internship_ends_soon_what_should_i_ask_my/,"Hello SysAdmins, and happy Read-Only Friday.

I have been serving as an IT intern for a small-ish firm for the summer doing tech support and jr sysadmin type work.

I have blocked out a time with my direct report and his boss both of whom I interact with daily, to have a bit of discussion before leaving.
Aside from performance (what i've done well and what i could use to improve upon) - what would be prudent to ask them?

A little background if it helps - Currently an IT student, about to enter last year. Hoping to get a sysadmin job, after graduation (Linux would be preferable, but i know i have quite a bit of learning to do before I reach any kind of RHCSA level)

Our environment is Windows, and most of my work aside from vanilla tech support has been doing O365 Admin work (pretty basic stuff.)

So, knowing what you know know, what do you wish you'd asked earlier in your career?
Or if you had an intern, what would he do well to ask from you?

I don't want to be a nag, it just seems it would be remiss if I did not have some kind of definitive take-away advice upon leaving (my boss has echoed the same sentiment.)

Thanks in advance, and you all enjoy your weekend! "
1jkza8,2,2013-08-02,Take an offer or continue searching?,FallenCopter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jkza8/take_an_offer_or_continue_searching/,"I've had the opportunity to intern this summer as a sophomore in the bay area working for a good ecommerce site. Now that summer is coming to an end, I've gotten an offer to continue part time work over the semester and then take another summer's internship. The problem is I feel like I didn't learn that much in this internship and it's not something I can see myself doing in the longterm. To be honest, I'm more interested in hardware or low level computer engineering stuff, but I have no industry experience so I could be completely off. On the flip side, if I took the offer, I could graduate debt-free (pretty important for my family)

So my question is should I be financially responsible and take the offer, and hope to transition later? Or should I try to get another job with another company and experiment to see if I like something else better?"

I started my first software development internship this summer.  I really enjoy it and have learned greatly from this opportunity.  This is the best position I have had in my life, and I'm doing what I love to do.  The summer is coming to a close, but my college is close to this place so I could continue this internship into the fall.  What are the best ways to communicate this to my manager?  Also, is it impolite or improper to ask for an extension?

1jkfvy,0,2013-08-02,A false complaint was made that screwed up everything [NH],[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jkfvy/a_false_complaint_was_made_that_screwed_up/,"Hey guys and gals,

I've been having an ongoing issue that recently led to my severance as an intern at a Police station. It's caused other problems as well. I'll do my best to bullet point it. It was a false complaint made about me. 

* I was class VP at my school and they students were unhappy with the administration (specifically the dean of students and the head of campus security) so I did what I was supposed to and spoke up for the students. After confronting the admins, nothing changed, I tried a second time, nothing again. I then pursued attempting to have them dismissed. They both were.

* Early the next year, I was visited by 2 Nashua PD units and 1 ATF agent for ""a tip made to them that I was a danger to the school"" they likened it to someone concerned about a ""columbine incident"". They also stated that I violently approached the Pres. of the school (which the President said was false) I allowed them into my rental house, showed them my guns and all of my safety course certificates (not required) and they left. I was able to get info that the head of campus security put in the report the last year.

* Talked to my Dads company attorney, he said don't worry about it right now.

* I applied for the job of a lifetime in May and was hired then fired the next day ""because they were too disorganized"". My advisor was able to get out that the investigation had a part in the dismissal too.

* In June the Nashua PD came for a follow up to basically say there was no issue/case

* I was then hired by the Goffstown PD as an intern. Along my first ride along they asked if I wanted to work for the feds (because I study Intelligence) I said no. They asked why, I said because I do not agree with the Federal Government and their policies. Apparently me talking about being a libertarian sparked a red flag where they looked deeper into me and discovered the case. They sent 2 detectives to my house, I was dismissed.

Here I stand today with a complaint and an investigation into me that was completely unfounded. I do not know how to proceed. I feel like my entire college career was just tossed down the drain. If I can't even work at a small PD, how will I ever get a higher clearance? I feel so stuck, I just don't know how to proceed. Please help."
1jk8jq,4,2013-08-02,Choices after Associates,Andvaried,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1jk8jq/choices_after_associates/,"So I am graduating after this Spring with an associates of Technical Services, Software Development, and E-Commerce. 

I plan on getting a Bach sometime, I'm not satisfied with just stopping after Associates.

The thing is, right now, I'll be graduating debt-free, all I've had to pay is for books so far.

Is going for a Bach worth it if I then have to incur debt? Because how my tuition is working for my Associates will not work for my Bachelors too.

If it is worth it to go for a Bach, then what would be a good choice? Continuing with Computer Science? Or going for Business?

If it makes a difference, I am also in an IT Internship, so i will also have experience in the field as well, so I'm not sure what my next valid option should be. Incur debt and go for a Bach, and go for ComSci or Buss. Or not?"
1jjpbf,1,2013-08-02,"Soon to be Homeless, Hoarder, Too Depressed To Figure Out How To Avoid It.",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1jjpbf/soon_to_be_homeless_hoarder_too_depressed_to/,"My family is dysfunctional. They have all done things to me that I can not forgive, or even come to terms with. (Verbal, physical abuse, sexual abuse, endangerment.)

I moved back in because I could not survive on my own. (Boyfriend would not work, could not work and go to school, did both on different sides of the city every day.)

Because of what has happened to me, I am anxious, and depressed. I also believe I have become a hoarder. Having once been a neat and tidy person I now have a bunch of useless possessions that I can't seem to get rid of. I know I need to clean my room, but I can't. I cleaned one box of hair products yesterday and was so proud of myself. Otherwise, I have not cleaned anything in almost a year. You can imagine how this could look. I use a wall freshener to keep it smelling natural, at least. 

My real problem is I got in a fight with my grandmother, and now she wants me gone. To make a long story short, she respects my loud, rude, mooch of a sister who lied about her children and herself being abused by her husband, and all her many other lies, but not me. This isn't a sister, she molested me relentlessly throughout our childhood, exposing me to things I was uncomfortable with and then would beat me into submission, if I refused.

I have no where to go, I have almost no money. (I get paid tomorrow, maybe $300 or less, just started this job.) I have never been in a shelter, I have never been homeless.

My brain can't make this into a reality. I can't rationalize how/why and I am not sure what to do. I have no friends, I have no supporting family members. 

I have sought help. They told other psychiatrists what I said, and they talked to me about it. They didn't tell me that this was happening but because I thought they were there to help, I let them. Then I heard someone who's an intern for the clinic, not a doctor, has no reason to know anything about me, crack a joke about something very personal that happened to me that I confided with my therapist. Now i don't know how to seek help, or who to trust. The medicine helped for a while, but once this happened I got anxious about the clinic and just stopped going. 

I don't need help with my family issues, I know they are toxic and I must leave them someway, but has anyone been in this situation before? How was being homeless? Any aids that helped? Anything, all I hear is static and then, silence.

[How are graduate engineers/new guys treated upon arrival to these rigs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg507i?context=5)|I've never been treated with hostility or anything like upon arriving to a rig. Typically if you're nice, and treat everyone equally, noone is gonna give you shit for being a 'new guy'. That being said, I've been given shit in a joking way since I had a degree and I look pretty young for my age especially when I'm clean shaven. On more than one occasion I've been asked if I had a note from my mom with permission to be out here.
[Do you feel safe/ are there ever instances where you see safety compromised for the sake of say, uptime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg507i?context=5)|I've never felt unsafe out here. Never seen safety been compromised for the sake of reducing NPT. I have seen stupid things done, that could ruin equipment, and things thrown together that probably shouldn't have for the sake of reducing NPT, but never endangering anyone.
[What are the amenities like on the rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg507i?context=5)|I typically work on shitty 'Shelf' aka not deepwater rigs. This rig is a 10 man room, bunk beds. A TV room that is terrible. And a prison yard gym, outside etc... 
[I am also currently on a rig, in the North Sea though, your accommodation doesn't sound great, I share a room with my back to back so there's only ever one person sleeping in there. We get a telly with sky+ in the room too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg6gjo?context=5)|Im on a pretty crummy rig right now that was built in the early 80s. Some of our deepwater rigs sound a lot like yours though. And have great gyms, even saunas and what not.
 |What do you do out there?
[What is your degree/background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg55mh?context=5)|I studied Mechanical Engineering... wish i had studied petroleum though.
[Are you on a formal graduate training programme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg55mh?context=5)|No formal graduate program or anything like that, but typically they want engineering graduates in the field for a while so that they can eventually become managers.
[How often, in your experience, do people in the industry ""job-hop"" around different companies? I hear it's quite common for people to jump ship for better salaries. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg55mh?context=5)|There's a super high attrition rate, not necessarily for salary, but more they don't like the field lifestyle. I've contemplated it a few times, but there are peaks an valleys like with every job. J.
[So no one asking you where the keys for the V door are then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbhqmu4?context=5)|Nah man, go to the driller, i think he has them.
[Did Crazy Willie put you up to this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbggxyo?context=5)|If you knew what was good for you, you wouldn't mention his name in public.
[What is the quickest way to advance in the industry? Are you company or service? Background before getting on rig? Is the money worth the lifestyle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg4ygy?context=5)|Quickest way to advance: Know people and make a name for yourself. If you make people depend on you, that's a great way to get ahead. Become indispensable.
 |I work for a service company: MWD side of things.
 |I got an engineering degree from a large state school in the south.
 |I think they money is worth the lifestyle for now (i'm unmarried and no kids, in my 20's etc...) and, I end up getting more time off than if i had an office job. Although i overall probably work more hours total. There's few sweeter things in life than sitting by the pool on a weekday and getting drunk.
[Eric?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbga2ew?context=5)|Billy?
[Auburn or Mississippi State?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgbf0s?context=5)|Neither.
[There are a lot of things sweeter in life than getting drunk on a weekday sitting by a pool. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg61ut?context=5)|Oh yea? Name 12?
[""Full throttle on the open road.""  I would go crazy on an oil rig because I could never do this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg87ru?context=5)|People who work on land drive to the site, and can go into town everyday if they like.
[Do you think you are safe from the zombie apocalypse out on a rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5ra5?context=5)|At first it seems like an ideal place to be really, but then I start thinking about food water etc. Food maybe not such a big deal if you can effectively fish off the rig. There's always some sort of sea life you can see swimming below you. I think the main issue would be fresh water. They ship in all food water and fuel to the rig, there are some filter systems on board, but nothing to desalinate water, and after the fuel stops showing up, we have no power for the filters. So, no I don't think i'm completely safe out here from that.
 |But as far as starting a meth lab...
[Have you been in any bad storms? Are they completely terrifying? How much money would you say your rig churns out in a day (not sure if that's even remotely possible to estimate lol\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg58aw?context=5)|For the Record: I FUCKING LOVE HURRICANE SEASON. I'm considered ""non-essential personnel"" so any sign of a bad storm, I'm flown out of there.
 |I work on the drilling side of things, and money isn't made until after a well is drilled and it starts actually producing the oil. Currently the rig i'm on is just sitting on top of a production platform, which currently is producing about 10,000 bbls of oil a day. So 10,000bbls * $100/bbl = 1,000,000 dollars a day not including expenses in operating the rig/platform etc...
[Does the rig float up and down with waves like a boat or is it wired to the sea floor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgmshs?context=5)|There are different kinds of rigs depending on how deep the water is. The deep water rigs float. Shallower rigs are resting on the sea floor.
[Time to be upfront... How much do you get paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg9vvz?context=5)|Close to 100k a year right now.
[What's the craziest thing you've seen while on a rig? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5hwj?context=5)|I've seen sharks,  water spouts, alligators, some sea turtles, a fight cause one roughneck spit on another. Not necessarily something i've seen, but there was a derrickhand on a rig I was on who left the rig on a wednesday, and strangely hugged everyone goodbye saying he'd miss them, and then that Friday homeboy committed a murder suicide with this wife.
[Curious what your schedule is like. I've heard people going 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. Do you get to leave the rig or are you there for a while? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg8hrt?context=5)|I wish i had a schedule, but I do not. Most jobs do though. I've been out here for almost 4 weeks now with no end in sight. Im usually ready to jump overboard by day 21, i'm just surviving day to day right now. Using this to deal with boredom.
[Whats the food like while working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg65xg?context=5)|Well, this is one of the things I found most interesting coming out here. There's a lot of tradition in the food for lack of a better word. For instance, every Saturday and Tuesday is Steak Night. Every Friday dinner is seafood night, and there is usually one Junk food lunch or dinner a week. This has been true on every rig i've been on.
 |The food is often fried, and unhealthy, but usually tastes pretty good.
[Follow up...do you live close to helipad? I know some guys that live in GA and work in Dakota, they lose days just traveling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5617?context=5)|Longest drive to helipad or dock is about 5 hours, but we hire a driving company, so I can sleep off my hangover on the way there. Pretty dope.
[You might not want to do that. bp houma actually does ""random"" drug testing, as in every third person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg8o4o?context=5)|If i've still got alcohol in my system after a full nights rest and a 5 hour carride, i think i'd be close to dead. I never drink if i know i have an early morning carride coming. It's mostly those 9/10am calls telling me to be ready to leave in a couple hours.
[So what exactly does your job require out on the rigs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgbnt3?context=5)|Drinking others milkshake.
[What colour is your toothbrush?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbg5iey?context=5)|Clear, with green on it. But you bet your ass that the case i keep it in is hot pink.
[I am fascinated by oil platforms, how they are built, moved, installed and removed. I always look for articles to read about them online etc. I thought the tv series ""oil, sweat and rigs"" was cool. I saw a show about the ""troll a"" and Hibernia Platforms. Just massive cities at sea. I couldn't hack that kind of work though. You have a cool workplace and a hard job. thanks for the a.m.a.  Edit for question. What is the purpose of that cargo net on a helipad? I see it gets landed on but what does it do? Seems silly to ask but...asking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgcfwp?context=5)|Just in case someone were to accidentally walk off the helipad that little 'net' is there as an extra safety precaution. Often people will run, jump rope, or walk around on the helipad for exercise.
[Ok, I get the safety thing but I'd see video of helicopters landing on the pad where the net was stretched over the whole pad so maybe it's all connected together. Just wondering. thanks for reply.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgdvyd?context=5)|Hmm i've never seen that before. My guess would be for footing maybe?
[What do you actually do on the rig? what's your job description in general? And how do you pass the free time? Video games, computers, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmi8o/i_ama_oilfield_worker_currently_on_a_rig_in_the/cbgd57f?context=5)|I'm MWD/LWD. We survey to know where the well is and can take readings from the formation to help identify what kind of formation we're in and if there's oil, among a host of other things.

The first is unpaid at a local off-campus company for public relations. The second is a paid internship for professional development. I'm still a full-time student but I'm only taking 12 credit hours.

I was considering doing both, since my schedule allows it. Are there benefits for doing two separate internships in one semester? Or should I tell the unpaid internship hiring manager that I got a better offer elsewhere? Any direction would be much appreciated."
1jn7ns,46,2013-08-03,Social Anxiety...Irrational fears of being judged. Advice anyone?,acescracked7,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jn7ns/social_anxietyirrational_fears_of_being_judged/,"I'm a 20 year old, male, college student. I'm an introvert. I'm proud of that, I don't think there's anything wrong with being one, and I have no desire to change.

However, I also have social anxiety. And I think there's a difference between the two. It's starting to get worse now and I don't know how to deal with it.

Whenever l go to the mall with a friend, I get so much anxiety whenever I go into stores. I don't feel comfortable looking at clothes for myself, or trying anything on. I went into Sunglass Hut to look at some sunglasses, but I was too nervous to try anything on. And I hate when sales clerks bother and stalk me.

Most of this fear extends from the ""they're judging me"" mentality. I found that to be my issue. I'm not scared of people. I don't mind speaking with other people. Do I like to? No, not really. I usually avoid socializing with people I don't know or don't care to know. That's just the introverted side of me.

The social anxiety side is the irrational fear of judgement and rejection. I'm afraid people are going to think I look stupid trying certain things on. They're going to think I'm an idiot for even trying.

Also, the fact that I have applied for so many jobs and the only ones I've gotten hired for are office/phone customer service positions doesn't help. You know how that makes me feel? Shitty. Am I not 'attractive' enough for a customer-facing job? Am I too short? Fat? Ugly?

I never wear new clothes because I don't want people to notice the change, or bring attention to myself. I always wear jeans, t-shirt, and a hoodie or jacket. I would never feel comfortable wearing shorts, different colored jeans, flip flops or a button up shirt or anything. I feel vulnerable and exposed when I do. 

I applied for this healthcare internship at the hospital since I want to be an RN. The interview is in a month. But they offer a free workshop that gives you more information, helps with interview skills, and gives you preparation on the scenario-based questions they use during the interview.

This workshop was today.

Well, I drove all the way there and decided not to go to the workshop. I was getting a lot of anxiety and doubting myself. Basically, I was extremely vulnerable since I was wearing business attire (not my usual) and going to meet a bunch of people whom I've never seen. 

I saw a couple people walking to the building when I was driving buy. One was a guy around my age, and he looked so much more put together than me. He was up to date with the current style and everything, whereas I was just wearing plain black slacks, belt, shoes, and a nice shirt. 

People would have judged the living hell out of me. Thought I was weird. No one would have wanted to engage in conversation with me since I was the 'weird' one.

That was my logic. I know it's irrational. But I can't convince myself otherwise when I'm in the moment. 

I don't need acceptance. I don't fear rejection. I just want respect; no weird long stares or dirty looks people often give me. I'm just imagining it, but I feel that everyone I come across, whether it's a coworker, classmate, the girl at the cash register, etc...I feel that they form this opinion of me that I'm a creep and just weird as hell.

I am a little different. I'm only 5' 6"". Like I said, I'm quiet and mellow and speak softly but have a voice on the deeper side. I don't wear a false smile on my face, and my facial expression is not something I think about, so usually I'm expressionless. And making eye contact with an expressionless gesture is just creepy! 

I feel like I come across as 'that guy who would go somewhere and shoot up a bunch of people'. 

But I'm totally not. I'm a super 'soft' guy; I'm a really nice person if people actually gave me a chance.

On my drive home I was feeling so lost and upset knowing I have to remove myself from the applicant list for the interview since I won't be prepared for it now. I was thinking that I need to find a different career aspiration, because I obviously can't be an RN and have these fears. I do feel that if I could get over these issues, though, that I could be a good nurse. I genuinely care about people and love helping others.  

I smoke weed, and it does actually help with this. I feel a bit more confident in my abilities to engage in social situations and meet new people.

But I obviously can't be high all the time, haha. This is only good for social outings and stuff.

Anyways, if you read all this, thank you. I appreciate the help and advice. :)

1jmssq,24,2013-08-03,"I'm secretly preparing to move out of my parents' house, but I'm experiencing a lot of guilt, sadness, and anxiety. I'm starting to feel indecisive.",[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1jmssq/im_secretly_preparing_to_move_out_of_my_parents/,"My parents and I did not have a good relationship when I was growing up. I was a pretty good kid in high school who studied hard, never partied, obedient and was in a bunch of extracurriculars, but they always screamed at me about how stupid and useless I was and beat me for trivial things. I remember being savagely beaten with a baseball bat, punched repeatedly in the face, choked, and kicked while I was curled up on the ground for being shy and thus embarrassing them. However, when I went away to college, our relationship got better.

In college, although my parents pushed me to be premed, I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I tried a bunch of different jobs and internships and did not commit to the premed track. I ended up graduating early and decided to continue working at the job I held while in my last semester to figure out my career aspirations. To my dismay, I eventually realized that I wanted to go into medicine, so I made plans to work part-time and take the pre-requisites one by one. My parents, however, encouraged me to come home again, telling me that they missed me, that in Korea, kids live at home until they are married, and that they needed my help at their business. I believed them and made the stupidest, most regretful decision of my life and moved home.

Immediately, my parents started screaming at me and hitting me again. Now that I was financially dependent on them, their favorite threat was kicking me out and telling me good luck with being homeless and without a job. I had already spent my meager savings on tuition and had a significant amount of student loans, so I didn't want to take on more to move out, so I just applied desperately to any job available. I eventually and thankfully got a low-paying, part-time, entry level medical job and things got better, but now my parents are giving me an ultimatum to quit my job and focus on the MCAT in August or kicking me out immediately. I felt trapped, depressed and suicidal.

I would love to study full-time for the MCAT, however I will not make the same mistake again. I could keep my job and take the MCAT in January instead and still apply early, but my parents refuse to compromise. I feel like my parents want me to be in a vulnerable position, because it is easier to control me. As a result, starting next week I am working full-time and am looking for housing with my friend. 

I no longer feel suicidal, but I've been emotionally distraught. Fearing further violence and being homeless, I've been lying to my parents that I will quit my job, but as a normally honest and sincere person, the guilt is eating away at me. After I started lying, my mom has started being nice to me again (the abuse/nice treatment is cyclical), and it kills me to think of hurting her feelings and disappointing her even if I apply to med school a few years down the line, because her dream is for me to marry a doctor pff and I'll be too old then. Now that she's being relatively nice again, I'm starting to feel crazy, that my perception of reality is warped, that I'm overreacting, that they aren't abusive like they keep telling me and that the problem is me. If I were a better ""child,"" I would be treated better, that they will keep being nice. These thoughts and emotions keep battering away at me and my fears of ending up homeless are almost making me change my mind. It makes me anxious that in my budget estimations, I will only have approximately $250 left over per month to put into savings. But, I keep reminding myself that this ""nice"" period never lasts and all it takes is setting the table ""wrong"" or not cleaning something adequately enough to trigger the abuse again. I'm just so scared.

tl;dr parents are abusive, so I'm preparing to move out, but I feel guilty, depressed, and scared. My perceptions of reality feel warped and now I'm indecisive."

New year, new me. At least that's what everyones been talking about lately. It's funny how half of the nation thinks that a clock striking midnight on the last of the year will somehow substantially turn their lives around. New flash, your diet won't last and come mid april you'll have decided to blow off your resolutions until the next year rolls around anyway.


I'm glad to have a loving family and all, but here I was again sitting in the living room with my mom and dad watching an extremely scripted overadvertised new year's countdown. I sat there on my phone head rolled back on the couch cushion generously liking all of the pictures of parties and fun nights out to celebrate the end of the year. 11:52 At least it was down to the final minutes before the fireworks went off and the neighbors yelled and we all went to bed to wake up to another routine day of pretending to be productive. Everyone will be too hungover to do anything tomorrow anyways so there's another day of sitting in my room aimlessly browsing the internet. 11:55. I mean going away to college in August was fanastic. Sheer freedom. I maintained my grades and enjoyed flourishing social interaction and didn't have rules. It was nice, but being home for the holidays feels like lockdown. Oh, well two more weeks and I'm back on plane to a different state to resume a more enjoyable day to day living. 


11:59. Here comes the countdown. All the way from sixty. I swear time moves slower when people watch it. I know it's just saying, but seriously there has to be some phenomenon in the universe that slows time. I'm calling it now, they will discover something years from now that explains how the more intent someone is on observing time the more it changes. Actually, I think all this time back home has just driven me insane. 


Thirty seconds to go. Ryan Seacrest's voice echoes through the living room. My mom is on the edge of the couch as if she's about to win the lottery. I set down my phone and put my attention on the giant ball dropping in NYC. Man I'd love to go to New York, maybe someday. Fifteen seconds to go. You can hear the younger kids gathering by the front door ready to run outside and bang pots and pants and scream and cheer. I miss the days of childhood. The sheer innocence and love for the world. Times when nothing wasn't solved by a good night of sleep. I know I'm going back to my wild time theories again but I swear time was slower as a child. I'm not talking about those five minute timeouts that seemed to last forever, just genuine second by second 
was different. 


Ten seconds. The countdown is across the screen in huge font. Nine. Here we go, another calender year about to start. Eight. Maybe I will make a last minute resolution. Seven. Who am I kidding? Six. I guess I'll miss them when I go back to school. Five. The freedom is just too addictive. 

Five.

Wait. I swear the time didn't change. Four. Okay now it changed but it hovered there for a second, someone had to have seen that. Time froze. Not like a permanent outage of time, but it stalled. It was almost like life lagged in real time. Like a youtube video buffers, life just buffered.

The fireworks went off. Mom yelped. Kids ran outside. The confetti poured down in NYC.

But I just sat there. I swear on my grave time froze for a second. Everything just stopped. 

""Dad give me the remote""

""Why?""

""Just real quick""

I rewind. Play again, maybe the program stuttered. Six. Five. Four.
Nope. It didn't happen that time. Am I losing my mind? No I promise it was like the universe for a second just timed out and ceased to exist. I'm tripping out. Maybe my minds just out of it. It had to have just been me.

""Mom did you feel that, during the countdown?""

""Feel what?""

""Like did you feel like everything stop for a second, like time freeze?""

""I'm telling you Jake, you need to get sleep at night, you always stay up""

""I'm not joking Mom, it happened""

""I never know when to believe you""

I ran to my room. Nineteen years old and I ran through the house like a child. This is too weird to even be a coincidence.

Did anyone feel time freeze tonight Dec 31st 2014

No results pertaining. 

Okay maybe I'm just overthinking this. I do it all the time I just psych myself out. I'm going to put myself in a mental hospital one day. Okay here I have an idea. I'll just start my phones stopwatch and count with it to one minute and if it goes off without a glitch I'll disregard it as my mind messing with me.

Start.

One. Actually, another good thing about being home is all the food. Man, I haven't had a homecooked dinner in months and a fully stocked fridge feels like heaven. I just hope I can land a solid internship and get a job straight out of college. I can't be that guy who moves back in after my parents already stretched their paychecks to cover my tuition. I'm so lucky my parents do well, I mean the cost stresses them but its still doable. I have friends taking out loans worth more than their organs on the black market. 


Fifteen seconds in and we're good. I had to have just been freaking out. Maybe mom is right. I do stay up until sunrise, I bet my REM cycle or whatever they call it is all thrown off. Okay, I'm making a resolution. I'm going to start sleeping during the night like I'm supposed to. 


Sudden Darkness.

""What the hell!?""

""Honey are you okay?""

""Mom?!""

""He's fine, he has his phone""

""Jake are you okay?""

""Yeah I'm fine""

""Power's out""

""Yeah, good work sherlock""

""I don't need attitude""

""Oh my god, calm down""

""Don't talk to your mother like that""

""Use your phone and come help me find the flashlights""

I look back to my phone. 

Not possible.

I'm losing my mind right now.

The power went out and my phone was on thirty six seconds. I know that for sure. I was so focused. And when I looked back down it was at thirty four. There is no way time went backwards. The stopwatch doesn't even have a feature to do that. I'm losing it.

""Jake hurry up!""

""WAIT.""

""Hurry!""

""Okay, jesus I'm coming""


I disregard the stopwatch app and go to find my flashlight app instead. I know it's in one of these folders. Damn I'm unorganized.

The lights come back. Not even a flicker just a sudden return to full up and running power.

""Hurry Jake""

""Why?! The lights are back on""

""What?""

""Huh..?""

""Just come out here it's almost time""

""Time for wha-"" I start as I round the corner back into the living room with my mom and dad.


I turn and look at the TV. 

What is happening?

There on the screen is the picture of times square with the countdown at nine seconds.

""It's already new years, why are you watching this again?""

""Shhh, we wait all night for this""

""Mom you're joking?!""

The ball drops at times square, the crowd erupts, the new year lights flash. 

""Seriously Jake?! You couldn't not screw around for five seconds for New Years? Unbelievable""

""Mom, bu-""

""Stop it, I'm going to bed.""

I look down at my phone so confused. And then it hits me. The air is sucked out of my gut and my hands feel heavy. My phone time says 12:00. I look up the clock on the wall says 12:00.

""Dad what time is it?""

""12:00""

I've already lived this. I seriously am reliving time. It's freezing and skipping forward and backward and no one is going to believe me, I don't know how to stop it, and my nose is bleeding. My nose never bleeds. I'm going to bed now and I hope when I wake up this was a dream, but something tells me it isn't. 

Maybe it's the fact that as I'm typing this I can faintly hear in the background Ryan Seacrest starting the countdown from ten for the third time tonight.

&lt;/endtext&gt;

I look back to my phone. 

Not possible.

I'm losing my mind right now.

The power went out and my phone was on thirty six seconds. I know that for sure. I was so focused. And when I looked back down it was at thirty four. There is no way time went backwards. The stopwatch doesn't even have a feature to do that. I'm losing it.

""Jake hurry up!""

""WAIT.""

""Hurry!""

""Okay, jesus I'm coming""

I disregard the stopwatch app and go to find my flashlight app instead. I know it's in one of these folders. Damn I'm unorganized.
The lights come back. Not even a flicker just a sudden return to full up and running power.

""Hurry Jake""

""Why?! The lights are back on""

""What?""

""Huh..?""

""Just come out here it's almost time""

""Time for wha-"" I start as I round the corner back into the living room with my mom and dad. I turn and look at the TV. 

What is happening?

There on the screen is the picture of times square with the countdown at nine seconds.

""It's already new years, why are you watching this again?""

""Shhh, we wait all night for this""

""Mom you're joking?!""

The ball drops at times square, the crowd erupts, the new year lights flash. 

""Seriously Jake?! You couldn't not screw around for five seconds for New Years? Unbelievable""

""Mom, bu-""

""Stop it, I'm going to bed.""

I look down at my phone so confused. And then it hits me. The air is sucked out of my gut and my hands feel heavy. My phone time says 12:00. I look up the clock on the wall says 12:00.

""Dad what time is it?""

""12:00""

I've already lived this. I seriously am reliving time. It's freezing and skipping forward and backward and no one is going to believe me, I don't know how to stop it, and my nose is bleeding. My nose never bleeds. I'm going to bed now and I hope when I wake up this was a dream, but something tells me it isn't. Maybe it's the fact that as I'm typing this I can faintly hear in the background Ryan Seacrest starting the countdown from ten for the third time tonight...

&lt;/endtext&gt;

r/NoSleep,

This is my writing style.

My name is Jake.

This describes my New Years perfectly.

I don't remember any of this that apparently happens 16 months from now.

And a drop of blood just landed on my keyboard.

(versus trained),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jlx3r/web_dev_how_much_is_expected_on_day_one_versus/,"I have a pretty basic understanding/working knowledge of XHTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL (in order of most knowledge to ""I can write a couple lines of code, depending"").

I'm trying to find a job or internship as a junior web developer, and I have found some that sounds like something I could do (and am mostly qualified for), but I'm concerned how much I would be expected to know on the first day. As of right now, I still need to look up things while I code. 

I am aware that I'm nowhere near intermediate or expert proficiency, but I really just want to get my foot-in-the-door, so to speak, and hope to learn most on the job (or at least have something to put on my resume), but I don't feel confident as I have only had one paid job before where I worked as a *very basic* help desk. (I'm also currently unemployed, btw). I've spoken to my former programming TA about this and he insists that I really do have the knowledge to get a job in the field, but I don't know... 

So can anyone tell me what's it's like? Things that you're expected to know? (I know this varies by employer, but could you share your experience?) What were things that you got trained for? How bad is it if I have to rely on notes? (As in, I code with them by me and/or have my ""cheatsheet"" in a background tab of Notepad++). Also, what would your advice be to someone like me? (both in the short-term and long-term wise)

EDIT: I'm a recent college grad in psych, if that makes any difference in the advice. (But feel free to throw out other advice for posterity, if you like.)"

I was asked recently at an interview my expected salary for a Junior Software Engineer position. I said I expected a comparable rate something to other grads in similar positions in the area, but he insisted I give him a range so I said 60-70K, including the 10% bonus he mentioned. For some background I graduated this May from CUNY, here in the city, with a modest 3.35 gpa and one summer SE internship at a biggish startup. I also had a part time position as tech support at school, which I'm guessing is worthless. I have some personal github projects but no contributions to open source. The salary websites show a huge range so I'm not really sure... What is a good range to ask at interviews? Thanks!"

I'm taking a python class next semester and an object oriented class centered around Java in the spring. I already have been chewing away at learning Python this summer and when I showed up to my internship they wanted me to basically be their low pay software engineer (despite not being told ahead of time this was going to be my task). Because of this I've been spending 40+ hours a week programming and  made them some stuff in python and then launched a private android app written in Java with Eclipse.

Besides the real programming experience I have I've completed Multivariable  (3D+) Calc, Differential Equations and will be taking Linear Algebra next semester. I also have an obvious background in Physics (I'll be starting Quantum this year, hooray!). 

With that said what skills can I pick up? I need to dive deeper into more programming concepts, but are there any in particular that I should be tackling? Should I start learning a new language after my Python course? Is there anything else that I can learn to become a better software developer? 

Despite my major I won't necessarily be diving into Physics R&amp;D, but I will be doing some research while I'm still in school. Thank you!"

The following is a redacted document originally submitted to the U.N. council by their diplomat for Global Climate Research. It has since been discovered by an American intern at a foreign consulate and spread virally through Wikileaks by an internet group known as The Midnight Society:

To the U.N. Council:

My research into aqua-parasitic growth in small water bodies has turned up significant evidence of a looming global pandemic. The continuing change of the Earth’s climate has led to a slight but highly problematic change of 0.017 degrees Celsius in an [redacted]. Though the research is far from complete, the evidence gathered thus far calls for greater man-power, more intense studies worldwide, and a global plan to prevent the growth and spread of a specific pathogenic parasite known as structure 2321 Alpha, or what we call the Adam Parasite.

Two research teams were sanctioned by the council: my team is the Adam and we’ve been stationed between [redacted] and [redacted] in the [redacted]; the second team, the Eve, is stationed in [redacted] in [redacted]. Our positions were determined by local population and distance from the equator. The Eve has not yet reported a similar finding; we have also contacted many foreign preservationists and found no sign of the parasite in Europe, Australia, and some of Asia, though large parts of Asia, Africa, and the warming Antarctic, as well as many other locations, have yet to be verified and pose a serious risk of hosting a similar intracellular parasitoid.

I would like to reiterate a case study from seven weeks ago, as it has also been the most public. On May 26, a man in Florida was found eating the face of another man. When confronted by police, the man was incommunicable and highly violent which ultimately led to a fatal shooting. This man’s name was [redacted] and we had, until a week previous to this incident, been in constant communication with him as he had been contracted to work as our lead bacterial consultant. His lab was located in Miami and, until he disappeared, we had been sending him samples of our findings. His disappearance occurred two days after he received our initial samplings of the Adam Parasite.

Not one week later, we tragically, inadvertently found a host to composite the Adam Parasite’s effect on the peripheral nervous system when our lab technician, [redacted], also became infected. As I thoroughly detailed those events in my previous case study to the council when asking permission to section off portions of [redacted], I will skip the harrowing events and merely re-explain the results: it entered [redacted] bloodstream through nasal inhalation; attacked the sub-cortex of the brain, overheating the skull and outer brain tissue; [redacted] temperature raised to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, wherein [redacted] began violent hallucinations much like a fever dream; then, in the final stage, there was a liquefaction of the brain stem, causing the death of the host.

We have been in communication with the [redacted] on these proceedings. They have done a good job preventing mass hysteria thus far and their [redacted] have helped us section off the southernmost area of [redacted], the only area we have found to contain the Adam Parasite. As of now the parasite continues to exist in an incubational stage though a time will come in the near future, as temperatures continue to rise, where the parasite will surface like mosquito larvae to be carried on the wind and spread with the weather front.

This communication is to state further emphasis on a global plan to handle this inevitable situation when it begins, as it is far too late to prevent it entirely. Unless climate change can be halted 100% right now – it can’t – this parasite will grow in size and spread exponentially, likely to occur in the second half of 2013. There needs to be a plan in place for the exodus of country dignitaries and top political figures to the southern- and northernmost portions of Earth, where this parasite will be unable to infect. The rest of the population will have to prepare for the spread as if it were a flu pandemic. A vaccine may be possible if work begins now, in large numbers, across the world; this needs to be a global effort. We cannot make predictions on population effects or R-naught unless we were able to conduct more case studies.

We must begin to alert foreign dignitaries on a global scale to prepare for what could amount to the extinction of the human race. The ice on which we currently stand melts more each day and it will take but a short time before it cracks and we fall under.

As always, thank you for your time and I await further orders.

At the moment, I'm ready to buy four WQHD monitors from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BUI44US/ref=gno_cart_title_3?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2UP5XAILMISJE). Constraint: each one requires a dual link DVI connection.

To satisfy this constraint, I'm thinking about getting a pair of 770's from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CU9GOAO/ref=gno_cart_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), but I have a few concerns. 

First off, will each of these cards support two WQHD monitors (Again, each running at 2560x1440)? The [Gigabyte spec page](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4647#sp) claims the max digital resolution is ""4096 X 2160(via a single HDMI connector and not supported with two DVI connectors)"". Please translate &gt;_&lt;

Second, my [current motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128378)'s 2 PCIE slots have 2 slots between them. Does this mean I can't run these cards in SLI (time to get a new mobo)?

Finally, what kind of PSU am I going to need for these cards? The Gigabyte page and Amazon page both read ""600W (with one 6-pin and one 8-pin external power connectors)"". Will [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139015&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=) suit my needs?

Hoping I don't have to dump my existing parts, but if that's what it takes, my internship work-ethic is ready. Thank in advance, Reddit!"

[I have a lot of respect for everyone who choses a job with a lot of value to society. unfortunately i think that teachers, doctors etc. somewhere along the way forget what used to motivate them. whats your experience with other teachers at your school? what do u think is the reason for the drop of motivation to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg91vo?context=5)|Wow. Big question. I agree that some teachers do forget the reason they began teaching. I attribute it to several factors: Internal pressure to reach goals that are neither conducive to true learning or attainable. Growing class sizes, sometimes 35+ students per class, which relegates you to the roll of a baby sitter. Sadly, money. In SC we've had a pay freeze since I've been teaching. Burnout. Last I checked, a huge % of teachers will leave within 7 years. Also, many teachers who are miserable don't leave and bring everyone down.  
[Anyone ever tell you, you look kinda like Gaius Baltar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9bmj?context=5)|No. I have no idea who that is. I will look it up and probably be sadder for it. I have been told by a student that I look like a short, beardless Abraham Lincoln. That too saddened me.
 |I just looked him up. I'll take that as a compliment. 
[Link to en.wikipedia.org.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9gbu?context=5)|Did anyone ever tell you that you look like the person that you find to be utterly attractive? Because you do.
[A friend of mine's dad had a similar job, except it was middle school. I know he sometimes had to physically restrain students and received threats pretty regularly. Have you ever experienced anything like that? If so, how did you handle it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbga0hh?context=5)|Luckily, I've never needed to restrain a student. I've been threatened a few times, but not lately. Normally, threats are the result of putting a kid in a compromising position wherein he is made to feel disrespected in front of his peers. I don't do that. Two years ago I asked and was given a student's cellphone as he wouldn't put it away. A few minutes passed and the kid started walking towards me with his fist closed. I happened to be behind my desk and had no way of removing myself from the situation. As such, I stood up, took off my ID and told the kid to put it in his pocket so he would remember who knocked him out. Another one of my kids stepped in between us and class continued on. He was cool the next day.
[Wow, thanks for answering my question. I feel like teaching is already one of the hardest jobs around, when you throw in students who are at risk for whatever reason I can only imagine that it makes it that much harder. Good on you for doing something most people would never think of doing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgb46x?context=5)|Really, like most jobs, if you enjoy what you're doing, it isn't that hard.
[*I stood up, took off my ID and told the kid to put it in his pocket so he would remember who knocked him out.*  That is amazing and you are amazing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi85e?context=5)|Well, in retrospect, it probably wasn't the best thing to say but that's what came out. It's funny how the brain works in those situations.
[Why did you decide to teach high school? high schoolers, to me, are the worst human beings to teach because that's the age when they don't give a shit about anything and are very anti-authority. that's also when drugs and sex become ""cool"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9abr?context=5)|I decided to go HS because I didn't want to teach middle schoolers. Also, I was a God awful HS student and was only passed because they didn't want me to stick around. I felt like I could help out students who were like myself.
[Also, in your years of teaching, have you ever had students so attractive it was hard for you to not have dirty, sexual thoughts about them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9abr?context=5)|Attractive? No. They are children to me. I view them in the same way I would view young children, as in ""What a cute little girl."" Although, a teacher in a nearby HS got caught banging several of her male students last year. 
[I appreciate your response to this. It bothers me when grown people find teenagers sexually attractive. Unfortunately, it seems acceptable in main stream society. I wish there was more discussion about this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgeci5?context=5)|In my opinion an adult having sex with a teen is sexual abuse. The age of consent in SC is 16 years of age. However, any adult wishing to sleep with a sixteen year old should be taken into the public square and beaten mightily. It is reprehensible for a teacher to engage in sex with a student. We are entrusted to educate and care for our students. Sentences for teachers who sleep with students should be far, far harsher than they are. 
[If you weren't a teacher, what would you be doing now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8wud?context=5)|Probably construction as I didn't begin Univ. until I was 21 and had worked in construction prior to that.
[Why did you become a teacher? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8vb7?context=5)|I was in a Philosophy  program with an eye to becoming a Phd.  I was working within the Phil. dept. We had a job opening and received 100's CV's. I read one of a Prof. who'd been at Notre Dame for 10 years. It then occurred to me that the job market was slim. As I still desired to teach and always enjoyed English, it seemed to make sense.
[What is the best part about teaching English? I've never seen the appeal in the subject myself but the English teachers I've had always seem to be some of the most enthusiastic teachers I've had.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg91bt?context=5)|The best part of teaching English for me, given that I work with extremely academically weak students,is watching the look come over their faces when the finally grasp something as minor as the difference between there, their and they're. I love watching as their confidence grows over the course of a year.
[ what area of philosophy did you focus on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg91bt?context=5)|I focused on Existentialism and Medical Ethics.
[That ""eureka!"" moment is awesome to experience and witness :\) best of luck with your teaching! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg95ey?context=5)|Thank you. Another high point is gaining enough trust so that they feel comfortable enough to seek me out when something serious is about to go down. Too many of my students are involved in gangs. Last year I was able to intervene in a planned drive by. I convinced several of my guys to lay low. While the rival gang did drive by and shoot, no one was hurt. The following Monday one of my guys gave me the name of the shooter.
[I'm curious, what specifically in medical ethics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbghvlm?context=5)|I was mostly concerned with ethics regarding decisions made by medical staff. For example, at what point is it ethically permissible to begin discussing organ donation with the family of a patient who is near death? Furthermore, are there any ethical guidelines in place to guide such a discussion?  Is there a line that shouldn't be crossed as to how hard a Doctor should push a family to donate? Is it ethically permissible to cross that line say if it would save the life of a child, or multiple people if multiple organs could be harvested? Stuff like that.
[Yo, teach, you may want to consider deleting this specific comment since snitches tend to catch stitches. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbghk3k?context=5)|As I tell my students, I'm an adult who cares about them, I'm not a ""snitch."" If I knew that they could possibly be harmed or endangered in any way and didn't do everything in my power to intervene I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I'd also be a poor excuse of a man.
[Interesting.   I am a doctor.   Often the ethical decisions paper and spoken about, don't happen that way in the real world. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgigzs?context=5)|If you don't mind me asking, and if you're in a hospital setting, is there an ethicist on staff? Would you even find such a person useful? Or would it be viewed as another layer of red tape?
[I'm in a hospital.   I don't believe we have a full time ethicist.   All decisions are left up to the physicians.   If there is an issue we will have a committee meaning full of hospital staff.  Such a person would be red tape and impede our ability to practice medicine. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgioxp?context=5)|Ah! I was right not to go into medical ethics! Well, that's good to know.
[I am in a teacher preparation program right now, and in a couple weeks I will start my student teaching.  Was there anything you wish you had known before you started teaching?  Any advice or helpful tips on improving as a teacher?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgamzu?context=5)|What would I've liked to know? Definitely more tips on classroom management. Unfortunately it's a skill that only develops with practice and experience. Tips...always meet your students where they are at the time and not the place you expect them to be academically. Remember that pass rates on standardized test are in no way a measurement of your ability. They are but a snapshot of a student on that given day. Never ever let them see you lose your temper. I've never raised my voice or yelled. Also, never take work home with you. Too many teachers spend countless hours outside of the classroom grading papers. I'm at my desk every morning at 6:30. I've never needed to take any work home.
[Is your school in an urban setting or suburban, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8xx3?context=5)|The school is in a fairly wealthy suburban setting. However, several housing projects feed into the school. These housing projects are home to the vast majority of my students.
[What kind of wine is that on top of your fridge in the pic? edit: you kind of remind me of beavis and buttheads high school teacher.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg8nun?context=5)|Ha! Actually, it's a small fire extinguisher. Beavis and Butthead? That's a damn shame. 
[What vintage is that fire extinguisher then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9kqb?context=5)|Sadly, probably 10 years old as it was in the home when I purchased it. We're a big proponent of the stop drop and roll method. 
[What is your opinion of online education at the HS level?  I ask because of the free courses being offered by universities.  What do you think of Khan Acacadmy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9d7s?context=5)|I've never heard of Khan, sorry. I think online courses which allow you to acquire a full HS diploma are excellent if you are driven and self-motivated. Sadly, many students who are pushed in this direction are usually failing, are old for their grade level or big discipline issues. The majority of those students end up dropping out all together. 
[If it is the school I'm thinking of, in a place named after trees...then how does the social economic status play out?  Are the poor vs rich kids treated differently?  I know that place has tons of rich folks in it.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgezkp?context=5)|Oddly enough, the school was named after a man who happens to have that last name. While the poor aren't expressly treated differently from the rich, they have, as a general rule, not had the vast resources afforded the wealthy. It is easy to focus on academics when you come from a home nestled in a safe neighborhood. School is easy when you don't have to worry about food or the power and water being cut. Working in school isn't a big deal when you don't have to go straight home and care for your younger siblings so your parent can go to their 2nd job. The biggest difference between the wealthy and the poor seems to be the simplicity of life. While I know wealthy kids have their own struggles, they are not on par with the struggles faced by the vast majority of my kids. 
[Have you ever had a moment so discouraging that you had to think about why you wanted to be a teacher in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbg9elv?context=5)|At least twice a week. My guys will begin to turn it around academically and get expelled for some dumb shit. Or my girls will get pregnant. Some go to jail. My discouragement almost always comes in the form of some aspect of their lives not wholly related to academics.
 |Just ran the numbers from last year and I lost nearly 25 percent of my total students to either, expulsion, jail, pregnancy or drop-outs. It's stunning when you put it into perspective.
[I finally made the decision that I want to become a HS teacher. I just finished my degree in economics this last semester. Completing the teaching credential seems daunting. How did you do it? How long should i expect the credential to take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgaapn?context=5)|I'm sure it differs from state to state and country to country. As I was not an Education major, I attended a graduate program which took two years. Within those two years I completed three unpaid internships referred to as student teaching. There were two national tests that had to be passed. One of which is based on content knowledge while the other is based on pedagogy. I wasn't considered a full teacher until I completed my first two years of teaching and passed all of my evaluations. If you know your content and learn how to manage your class, it is a breeze. Although I've seen some would be teachers get hung up on the pedagogy exam. However, like most exams, it's based wholly on rote memorization and is of no real value.
[Damn, that sucks. How do you feel towards the students that weren't expelled, arrested, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgazle?context=5)|I mostly feel sad for them. Most of them have led lives that I wouldn't wish on anyone. While they certainly share some of the blame, most of the events that shaped them as people were totally beyond their control. Sadly, many are victims of circumstance.
[Do you notice any bullying? Have you ever encountered kids that seemed ""dangerous""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgawuo?context=5)|I do indeed see bullying far too often. It is something I talk about on the 1st day of class. I'm fairly lenient. However, if I see you bullying someone I'm going to do my best to get you the harshest punishment I can. Dangerous students...I've only had one student that truly concerned me. He was 15 and was slipping into paranoid schizophrenia. He didn't come from a loving, safe environment and the higher ups didn't think that me and another teacher knew what we were talking about regarding his delusions. After about a month and some disturbing events, he finally began to receive the help he needed.
[I noticed on your badge that is says AC Flora. I'm from Columbia myself, and I was under the impression that they kept the schools in good neighborhoods (like Forest Acres\) separated from the bad neighborhoods. Which areas of the city do the majority of your students come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgagwn?context=5)|Small world...uncomfortably small perhaps. Here's hoping you don't rat me out to the man...
 |Indeed the school is located in Forest Acres. However, each school's population is pulled from the school zone it is located in. The majority of my students, given the population I work with, come from Gonzales Gardens Plaza, the Starlite neighborhood and parts of Leesburg Rd.
[I would never rat you out but if I did then you'd have just as much dirt on me. I can't believe they bus kids in all the way from Leesburg Road. Is it because the school you work at has specially-trained educators like yourself to do with at-risk type students that closer schools like South Richland don't have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgba2n?context=5)|The lines for the district are very odd. Kids that you think would go to Dreher come to us. In fact, there is a street near Lower Richland HS wherein kids on one side of the street come to us and the other side goes to LR. It has nothing to do with specialized training.
[How comfortable is that sofa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbga026?context=5)|Not as comfortable as my bed but infinitely more comfortable than my chair at school. 
[Which would you rather be, a Pirate or a Ninja?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgggvn?context=5)|I grew up on the coast and lived minutes from the ocean. It is the place I love being the most. As such, I would lean toward Pirate. However, I'm prone to motion sickness and would be made to walk the plank for incessant puking. I must therefore select Ninja.
[Do you take the individual student into account when you grade something?  For instance a kid you know is smart that gives you a shitty paper, and a kid that obviously struggles with the material, but you can tell he's really trying... would you grade them equally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgh5mv?context=5)|Given that I work with at risk students, I grade them based on their current abilities. That is to say that I would not grade someone who is reading and writing on a 4th grade level in the same way I would grade someone reading and writing on a 9th grade level. In fact, they wouldn't even be given the same assignment.
[I performed the same work as another student at one time, and was given an F when he was given an A. When I confronted the teacher about it, he said it was because he expected so much more from me. I was furious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi600?context=5)|If you completed the same assignment at the same level as another student you should have been given a similar grade.
[As an aside, the reason I wanted to reply to this thread was to ask what you feel your role is with at risk students for depression and mental issues. Do you feel like you know of students with major depression or possible suicidal thoughts, and how do you deal with such things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi600?context=5)|I have no advanced training as it regards mental health issues. It is my hope that my students trust me enough to approach me and let me know if issues arise. Certainly, as the year progresses and I get to know my students I can usually tell when something is up. It's like Spidey sense. If the Spidey sense tingles I know it's time for me to let someone know.
[I've heard that a lot of kids in that situation (being at-risk, or whatever their case may be\) can be more eager learners, since I had a co-worker who taught at a halfway house once. He said it was one of the best classes he'd ever taught. Is that true in this instance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgb13n?context=5)|While I've had some eager learners, they are not the norm. Most of these kids have been bombing in school all of their lives. Many of them have had teachers who simply placed them in a back corner and largely ignored them as long as they weren't causing a disturbance. They act out because, to them, being thrown out of a class is better than being in a class that only serves to reinforce their own belief that they are failures. Personally, I love these students and wouldn't want to teach anything else. Once you've convinced them that you care about them and only want them to succeed, most of them will bend over backwards for you. So, eager? No.  Pretty motivated by the middle of the year? Mostly.
[How often do you notice students that are stoned or otherwise intoxicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgg45f?context=5)|I see and smell stoned students a fair amount. However, the school really has their hands tied. Unless the student has drugs in their possession, little can be done.
[Recently my states governor decided to deunionize the teacher, which i fully supported.  People dont understand that our schools were filled with lazy old battle axes who didnt teach, just assigned homework.  Do you see this often in your school?  Whats your thoughts on teacher unions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgh69o?context=5)|Unions aren't a part of South Carolina's landscape. While I can see the benefits of having a collective voice, I can't really make a claim for or against unions as I've had no experience with them. I personally don't assign homework. The vast majority of my students wouldn't do it if given, and I see no reason to make academics anymore difficult than it already is for them. Furthermore, if can't teach you something over the course of a class period I find it highly unlikely that you'll somehow magically catch on once you get home. 
[What literature do you teach?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgc7ze?context=5)|I will use any text that works with the lesson I have in mind. I don't care if it's a comic book, newspaper, magazine or a children's book. If the students can connect with the text and learn in the process I'll use it.
[Do you have any curriculum-required reading? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgi6gn?context=5)|Because I have such a wide variety of learners with vastly different abilities my situation is rather unique. So, in short, no, I do not. 
[What's the most awkward hookup/sext/high school hormonal shenanigans you've come across and/or interrupted, and how did you handle it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgaqpu?context=5)|Just answered above.
 |My answer seemed to vanish. I'll try again. Hookup? Two freshman trying to sneak into a bathroom during lunch to engage in probable unprotected sex. Luckily we got in there just as they were locking the stall door. They were taken to the principal.
 |I also had a troubled soul who once shouted out in class, ""Hey! Ya'll wanna see somthin?"" He then proceeded to show everyone a Polaroid of a very fat, very naked woman. Sad really, he got expelled the 1st week of school. 
[Ive been in 20 fights in middle school and 8 in hs.  I didn't start any of em.  What would you say about me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgh15a?context=5)|Knowing only that you've been in many fights, there's not much I can say about you. My hope is that you don't run across someone that would just as soon shoot you as fight you. What do you think could be the reason that you find yourself in so many fights?
[Were kids in high school when you first started teaching different than the kids you're teaching now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgio0z?context=5)|Nope. Nor do they seem to be much different than they were when I was a student way back in the '90's.
[Holy shit AC Flora. I know a ton of people that went to that school. I went to Dutch Fork myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgf6qv?context=5)|Sweet Jesus. The world of reddit is far too small. I never imagined that two people from Columbia would read this thread. 
[Went to Spring Valley, now we're up to 3!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbggz1j?context=5)|Why do I have the nagging feeling that when I return on the 12th the Principal is going to want to see me?
[Yeah but I did sociology/accounting in university, and there really wasn't an easy shortcut for either of them. I did the exact same shit in the one university English course that I took and I did well. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgfpsi?context=5)|Indeed, one can't really fake numbers and data. Still, your ability to play other subjects is proof of your keen mind. Kudos to you pixelthug.
[In an earlier comment, one of the people mentioned working with kids that just don't give a shit about life... how do you motivate a kid who just plain doesn't give a shit about anything. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgap1q?context=5)|That is an extremely difficult task. I try to show them that they don't give a shit about the life they are currently leading. I need them to recognize the life they can have if the stick with it. I also make it clear that I understand that their current life is hard given that they live in an environment that is rife with crime, drug abuse and violence. It would be hard to give a shit about school when the place you live in is so violent that your mother won't let you walk to the mailboxes without remaining on the phone in case something bad happens.
[I just wanted to tell you thanks.  I didn't have a lot of good teachers, at least I think, but the ones I really connected with made a huge impact on my life that I didn't realize at the time.  I still think about them years later, and I'm glad they were there and I could tell they cared.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbggz19?context=5)|Thank you. I'm glad you did have some that you connected with. I can assure you that those same teachers think of you from time to time as well.
[90% of the teachers I ever had were completely useless. A lot of people I know are also just starting teaching careers and most of these are people who I personally think have no business teaching.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jmvi0/iama_another_hs_teacher_with_proof_ask_me/cbgcgbf?context=5)|I would disagree, based on time spent with teachers over the years, that  90% are useless. I have indeed seen and been taught by my fair share of useless teachers. The schools I've been a part of make a genuine attempt to rid themselves of said teachers.  I also disagree with the notion that ""those that can't teach."" I have found it to be the case that the vast majority of the teachers I know most indeed ""can"" and are simply driven to show others how to do the same. Those teachers that seem to aimlessly drift into the profession soon realize that it is infinitely harder to do than one would think. Most of these types leave the profession within a couple of years.

1jnmfl,10,2013-08-03,My summer internship offered part-time work during the school year; should I take it?,collegestudent51,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jnmfl/my_summer_internship_offered_parttime_work_during/,"I'm now going to be a sophomore in CS. I got a summer internship with a medium-size software company that has an office near my college. After working with them this summer, they want me to work with them part-time during the school year.

How much would working for them part-time help my career? While the money would be nice, I don't really need it, so the only reason I would do this would be for the career benefits.

I'm worried about how this will affect my schooling. I had a lot of trouble last year. I was even on academic probation after my first semester. I'm no longer on it, but my last semester still wasn't great, and I'm worried that this part-time job would be a big distraction, especially since I want to do more with clubs and hackathons and making friends this semester.

However, they're very flexible with hours, so I could not work at all during finals and midterms, and I could even work from home. And I don't need to make a commitment, so I can just quit if I think it's taking too much of my time.

I'm not really sure what decision to make here. How much would a part-time job help my resume? Has anyone else balanced work with school that can give me some advice?"

1jrt9r,10,2013-08-05,United States to Europe (Possibly France if not elsewhere) with a CS Degree,avizzv92,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1jrt9r/united_states_to_europe_possibly_france_if_not/,"I'll be graduating next spring with a B.S. Degree in Computer Science. I've had a fair number of internships, some major ones in the Defense industry, as well as working for smaller companies and projects. My desire is to focus on software development but I can be flexible in the IT field depending on the job. 

For some further background, I've spent about 8 months staying in a small village in the southwest of France for educational purposes and traveled around France and other EU countries. I've completely fell in love with the culture, people and the way of life in France, especially that area of France. There's not a day I do not miss being there. 

My best case scenario would be finding employment in southern France, but I realize unemployment is a problem in France. I'd be happy to find work in other countries such as Germany, UK, etc... Keeping in mind though the only language other then English that I know to any extent is French. Currently it's basic/broken French but I'm continuing with classes to improve upon it. 

I'm wondering about how feasible it is finding employment in my field of study in France/Europe/UK. Is it promising for someone in my situation? And, are there places that are better then others for looking for jobs and researching online? I assume the easiest solution would be to find a US company with foreign offices.

I'm worried about my 2.6 GPA (yea know, its pretty bad). After a directionless and poor first two years of college and a 2.1 GPA I took a CS class and realized that I loved it. I switched my major and have been able to raise my GPA slightly. However, I've got a lot of anxiety about my GPA and not being able to find a job out there. Its not because I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to programming, I'm just not the type of person that is well adapted to formal education. I'm much more of a hands-on/social-learner/learn-by-doing type of person (in fact I think this is what drew me to programing in the first place). 

Anyways, should I be as worried as I am about this? I want to apply to internships but so many of the ones I've looked through say ""3.0 GPA minimum"" that I'm feel pretty nervous about this. Any advice on what I should do. Will I be forced to work at a miserable job and work my way up?

I am going to be a senior ChE this coming fall. I have been concerned about getting a job after graduation. I have 3.2 GPA which will probably be the same when I graduate. I have no work experience and have been doing research with fuels this summer. I will have taken a variety of engineering topic classes when I graduate (besides CHE).
I was wondering if you guys have any advice for my senior year to help get hired. I didn't really have any luck with interviews last year. I was thinking on asking a graduate student and my professor to review my resume for the fall and perhaps ask them for advice or if they can get me in touch with someone. I don't know if that would be appropriate though. I do plan to do some research in my spring semester if I can. I also am unsure if I should apply to internships as a senior but I am open to internships after graduation.

I have had no luck with my university's online career postings. And if someone is willing to review my resume for the fall, that would be great.

Any advice, resources, or help is appreciated. I am also open to oversea job opportunities if someone has worked overseas.
Thanks,

Bottom line is, I am transferring from a community college after next year and I don't have any money for college and will have no financial aid (parents combined income &gt; 250k, so I'm fucked)

Chico is looking really good in terms of smoothly transferred classes and very affordable cost of living. 

The three concerns I have are 

1. The value of their CS program. I can't find very much info online about it.

2. How good the school will look on my résumé. Im not a snob, but the school obviously has a reputation for partying and I do not want that to hinder me in the future.

3. The difficulty of getting internships. I do not know that many people will be hiring interns out of that area?

Waiting to hear back on #1... this is my first choice because of pay. My direct manager said ""hopefully we'll hear something this week, but I can't do anything about it.""

Waiting to hear back on #2... old boss said they are ""balancing the budget"", but I know this is just him biding his time and dragging his feet. He said he would get back to me ""before the semester starts""... very vague timeline on this one.

Got an offer on #3... they need an answer TOMORROW... but this is my last resort job. 

I am waiting on a response about extending my internship through the school year. My direct manager has sent the request through, but apparently it is now up to management, and they seem to be taking their sweet time. My manager does not seem to understand the timeline I am working with, and he gets frustrated any time I bring it up. I told him I need to start making employment plans for the school year a while ago. His manager is speaking with management about it. When is it okay to sidestep my boss and go to his boss to attempt to convey urgency and tell her that I need to know ASAP so I can nail down employment for the school year? Is this going to be just an annoyance? Is it never okay to jump over my boss' head on an issue like this? 

What do I say to my old boss about #2? Can I push him in a nice way to hurry on an answer? 

On #3... do I just accept their offer on Wednesday if I haven't heard back from any of the others? Then I can just tell them, ""Sorry, this position isn't for me"" when/if another offer settles? Others have urged me to do this, but it's highly unprofessional to do.

Any help is appreciated. "

I've never done salary negotiation before and I'm not sure how having a second offer that the company knows all the details about would affect the salary negotiation.

Company A wants to give me a base salary of $90,000 with a company bonus that they say is usually around 20% but not guaranteed so they say this is basically like getting $108,000 (but it could be as low as 0%)

Company B wants to give me a base salary of $105,000.

I'd rather work for Company A. Company A already knows about the salary from Company B and they used that knowledge to decide on their own offer. They also use the average salary of new grads (but I have a lot of internship experience), the value of the company, and other salaries in that area to make this decision.

I feel uncomfortable choosing Company A with such a big difference in base salary but they seem like they'd be open to negotiation. What's a reasonable amount I should ask for from Company A so I can get the highest base salary that they're willing to give?"

How serious can they be when they say ""You'll never work again!""?",mintdilly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jt6ka/terrible_experience_with_a_recruiter_how_serious/,"So, long story short, was on a contract to hire, company came in very low on salary, got a call from a recruiting firm I've never heard of talking about a position that paid a significant amount more. Had one phone interview with their client and they loved me, wanted to bring me on board. Went in at met them, seemed decent enough, told them I'd like to start. 


So, they insist that I start in EXACTLY two weeks, no more. I'm working on a BRAND new project in my current role, and I have two interns until the 16th, so I told them I'd like to stay here until the 16th, which would have been three weeks. Absolutely not. ""The client doesn't want to push the project back another week"". I end up having this back and forth three times with three different people at the recruiting firm. So, I'm in a moral quandary; do I not accept this position and just stay at the current employer until I can find something else or do I screw my current employer (which honestly has been GREAT, close to perfect) and just take the job with the new place on the date they insist on?

I actually choose option C: get on the phone with a buddy of mine and get hired at a THIRD job the same day.

So, anyway, I emailed the recruiters yesterday, told them ""hey thanks, but I can't start on that day, and I don't want to work anywhere where they won't allow me to gracefully leave a current employer. Good luck with the search.""

My phone instantly started ringing off the hook.

Long and the short of it: talked to some director this morning, he told me that he never asked the client about the start date, and if they knew it was a big deal, they would have made it happen. I told them that I don't like being lied to, and I'm not coming to work there.

He lays into me: you're lazy, you're a child, you're not acting professional, you'll never work again.

I mean...I'll clearly work again, I can get a job almost at will. But can this unstable fellow actually DO anything? I mean, outside his scumbag company?

tl;dr:
Didn't start new position; couldn't agree on start date. Butthurt recruiter tells me I'm a child that will never work again. 

UPDATE:

So, this morning, another recruiter from another company contacted me about the SAME position. HA!"

I moved solely to maintain residency in order to save money when I transfer to the University of Missouri next Fall, and also to experience a new chapter in my life which involves basically resetting everything. Unfortunately, this means I had no job before moving here. I tried, and I tried, but nothing came up, and nothing has yet. 

I spent two years in customer service, working in fast food and got to experience a heap of knowledge from that. While finishing up my first year of college in May 2012, I worked as a Copy Editor on my college's newspaper. Shortly after the semester ended, I started an internship at my local NBC affiliate, to which I was hired as an editor before the internship finished. As editor, I was responsible for editing any local and national video that went to air. An easy job, but very fun. 

I work well the public, with my co-workers, carry a heavy knowledge in computer programs, am respectable and *very* ready to work. I'm really looking for anything that can pay more than minimum wage and work around a full-time college student.

1jskzf,21,2013-08-06,I'm aiming for a summer 2014 internship in Seattle or the SF Bay area. I don't have a lot of programming experience. Is it doable?,criticalhit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jskzf/im_aiming_for_a_summer_2014_internship_in_seattle/,"You might have seen me before. I'm Canadian, headed to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in January. At my local CC I hope to be taking an introduction to CS class suitable for engineers (which is two semesters in one). I have taken programming courses in the past but my programming experience is very low.

I'm a few semesters out of co-op, and the pay around here is a pittance. So, I'm strongly considering going south next summer for an internship.

Starting this month, I want to do some intensive programming on my own. I hope to get some small! independent projects up on a Github within the next 5-6 months.

Which language? Well, the course will use C++, so this a short list of my considerations:

* One webdev language-Python sounds right, plus HTML/CSS.
* One ""traditional"" language-I've programmed in Java before so it's easy to pick up. I can code stand-alone projects (Tic-tac-toe?). Or, I can stick with C++ and go beyond what is in the coursework.
* One backend language-probably Django, Drupal or both.

Other considerations include JS and jQuery. I also want to try my hand at Wordpress sites. This whole thing will be in a 9-10 month period.

To ensure I don't put too much on my plate, I will try a piecemeal approach. For example, one day, I'll do some programming in C++, and the next in Python.

My goal is to get lots of projects in my portfolio by May, maybe April if that's too late, and start applying for internships. What do you think-is this doable?

I'm currently 16 years old, entering into my Junior year of high school, with the classes necessary to get the credits required for graduation an entire year early. I'm currently set on going to DeVry University for a bachelor's degree in Game Simulation Programming which, with the schedule I am going to be on, I will be getting when I am 19/20. I have a year left of high school, and I need to know what I should be focusing on.

My current abilities are: seemingly good with C++, I can write code, debug, have good syntax recognition, practice good programming techniques including encapsulation, polymorphism, avoiding the ""deadly diamond inheritance tree"", a solid understanding of finite state machine prototype, and the openness to study and learn more and more every day. I currently am working on reading through the MaNGOS script files, learning everything I can along the way. With higher level scripting languages, I am fairly decent with Python and Lua, however I haven't used many others. I am currently working on a game based off of the Löve 2D framework, and have made some simple text based games with Python, but nothing too complex. I have looked into C#, but syntactically need improvement. I have worked in vJass, the programming language extension for JASS, the script language for Blizzard Entertainent's ""Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne"". I have a strong, natural understanding of basic to adept OOP concepts and apply them to my work, however higher end subjects are not known to me, I have tried to find resources for them but it is difficult. I have used some HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as PHP, but will still need to get myself comfortable with the styling.

My current questions are really basic but somewhat difficult at the same time. 

I feel confident in my school choice, as it was either DeVry or Community college, but is it a good school? Does anyone know a lot about it? I've been trying to gather as much information as possible and already am in contact with a counselor at the school.  

What should I be doing to prepare myself for college/ computer classes like this? Should I be brushing up on my skills in C++? Learning more languages? Learning Java? Making simple applications and polishing them to hell?

How do I go about portfolio building? Should I be starting now? What would be an acceptable project to put on my portfolio and what is the best medium for it (website, PDF, docs other).

As I will be commuting going to campus, should my home setup be somewhat more modern? My current computer is 4 years old and I am currently working on making 2 external monitors. 

As a game developer, what types of internships should I be looking at if any? Is working at a technology store going to be beneficial to my resume or does it not matter where/if I have a part-time job? Would making games/apps for sale to make some revenue be hurtful to my chances of being hired in the future or beneficial? Would it be worth doing? Would it be better to release freeware and open source projects? 

TL;DR What do I really need to do to prepare myself for college, I have a year so I'm not pressuring myself, but I want to be ready, and I am still programming for many projects in my spare time for fun. I enjoy programming in any language and I am always willing to change what I'm doing or learn more if it will end up helping me in the long run."

Today my team moved into a new office location, and I was helping to get everything set up.  Included in this effort was a middle age manager, an early 20 something female intern, and two people from the IT move team.  It's a very large company so I had never met either of the move team folks before, but these two happened to be a middle age Hispanic man and a young Hispanic woman.

We had all been working for an hour or two at getting things unpacked - manager and I were mainly running about pointing where things go, and the move team was doing most of the lifting and plugging in cables.  When it we got to a lull in the work, the intern and I took our leave to go check on some work going on elsewhere, and the following conversation ensued:

Intern - I can't believe they had her doing all that lifting.

Me - Hunh?

Intern - The move girl, she was having to lift all those monitors and workstations onto tables - she's so tiny! (she was small - perhaps 5'2"" and 120 lbs? - 157 cm, 54.5 kg)

Me - So?  That's her job - setting up IT equipment.

Intern - But there were some big monitors in there that had to have been kind of heavy, why do they make her do all of that!

Me - ... because it's her job - she signed up for it, she seemed perfectly capable of doing it, if she needed help there was another person there to help.

Intern - Well, why didn't you help?

Me - I was helping, I was coordinating where things went.

Intern - But she's so tiny, and looked so young.

Me - I'm not about to tell someone to not do the job they were hired to do.  If she was treating my equipment badly or acting unsafely I'd stop her, but until that point in time, I'm going to assume she's a competent worker and perfectly capable of lifting a 25 lb monitor and a 30 lb workstation.  The fact that she's small and female doesn't matter to me in the slightest.  We got the heavy lifting guys with carts in to move the big tables.  Other than that, leave her to do her job.

Intern - ... ok.

And there you have it folks.  I made my stand for my female colleagues out there because frankly I don't give a damn what's in your underwear (or the color of your skin, or what's in the underwear of your preferred partners, or really anything else, with only a preference that I can understand your English, otherwise it's difficult to work with you) - if you do your job well, I'll continue to do my job well, and we'll all go home respected and happy."

I am about to finish my double major in CS and CE at a state University. I have worked as a professional web developer and I am currently finishing up an internship at Intel as a Software Engineering Intern. Though, I am in no way confident I could pass a Google coding interview. I know it's grueling. I have done similarly hard interviews with Microsoft and Amazon got fair but no cake. (it was a lie). This is the source of much turmoil in my life right now. I don't want to feel subpar at what I do for a living.

 I have tried to prepare, honestly. I pick up my copy of Cracking the Code (which you should get a copy of if you don't have one) but I just can't sit and study like that. It's dismal. I feel no excitement in just reading solutions. I want to build cool shit, fun shit, not reimplement  data structures then analyze it's BigOh complexity. That's been done millions of times.

&lt;I think what I mean here is I see little incentive to redo a problem from a book when I can look it up. I would like a more interesting approach that allows me to see the value. Or possibly an approach with feed back where creating a custom solution makes sense because people can inform me what I am doing wrong and why. I think they have a training package on Cracking the Code website but I am not willing to spend all that money for that.&gt; 

 I was wondering if anybody had a fun way to prepare for this type of interview. I guess I am looking for some type of challenge or community where I can solve interview style questions and have people tell me how stupid or awesome I am.....probably stupid at least at first. Sort of like a Sudoku a day type thing. Anybody have any resources? If you want to see some of what I have done in the past check out my GitHub (follow me plz...) https://github.com/SeanDunford

TLDR: I am an alright programmer. Are there any fun resources to become good enough to pass a Google coding interview. 


&lt;EDIT&gt;: People were misunderstanding me. I know that Big-Oh is good, cool, awesome, need to know it. I know data structures are the toolbelt to every great programmer. I want to gain knowledge of this but I can't really read and regurgitate. So what are some more interesting ways to learn them. 

&lt;Edit&gt;: /r/dailyprogrammer seems to be a great resource for what I am trying to achieve. I think exercism.io might have something similar as well. Thanks for all the responses please keep them going.  

&lt;Edit&gt; TIL: No matter what my approach is it's probably not going to be fun. So I should suck it up and stop being a baby. There are some challenge websites namely USACO, Euler, and more that can help. My Git profile is a steaming pile of shit. Thanks.

Do you get to travel to Japan to see various methods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv9a7?context=5)|What you see in the sushi bar may only take a few minutes to prepare in front of you, but what you don't see is that it can take all day to prep.  That's one bite that takes 4 hours to make in the back.  That's why it's expensive.  
[Is it true that some sushi apprentices in Japan spent a year plus just making the rice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv9a7?context=5)|Reflecting on the movie, I felt very sad.  The man spends spends his entire life trying to attain perfection, but perfection is not static.  But it can't be done.  Secondly, on a more selfish level, the movie made me sad because I wish my customers were more like his customers.  With all due respect, my California Roll customers pay my rent.  With all these sushi bars that are opening, I am afraid that the art of sushi is dying.  There are so many rolls covered in sauce.  True Itamaes don't do that.  Of the 100+ sushi bars in Dallas, there are less than 10 true sushi bars.  Everything advances and changes, at a natural pace, but this new fast-food, mass-produced sushi covered in 3 different sauces defeats the purpose of sushi.
[Since there are so many sushi bars, how can you tell the good from the bad? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiw9bt?context=5)|A lot of people tend to think that if a sushi bar is really busy, it's good.  That's not always true.
 |For me, if I were to walk into a sushi bar, I would immediately sit at the sushi bar and not a table.  I would engage the Itamae.  You need to develop a connection or relationship to the Itamae.  In one trip, you can tell if it's good or not.  It boils down to one thing.  Is the chef putting his/her name on the line?  If a restaurant is promoting their rolls more than they are promoting their chef, you should be hesitant.  Of the less than 10 real sushi bars in Dallas, all of them are connected to a real Itamae, not just an assembly line of sushi makers.
 |It's not different from walking into a chain restaurant or a mediocre restaurant vs dining at a restaurant with an actual named chef.
 |EDIT:  I agree, just because your name is on it does not mean it's going to be good.  But once you do put your name on your food, you are subject to judgement, and I would hope that a named chef would put forth his/her best effort. I do and so do the sushi chefs I referenced.
[I see on your menu you use cream cheese and salmon which are not traditional Edomae sushi ingredients.  As someone who prides themself by using the term Itamae.  What does your restaurant do, that sets you apart from other typical sushi bars in the US?  What gives your customers a real Japanese sushi experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbix7x1?context=5)|My restaurant is a modern Japanese restaurant.  As I mentioned earlier in a previous comment, I have to pay the rent.  I try to offer something for everyone, for varying levels and preferences.  I personally don't like it, but it is a best-selling roll.  There is place for the Philly Roll.  I met the Master Itamae that invented this roll, and he is the much more traditional than I am.  But he understood his audience and it took me a while to understand my audience.  I do not have many Japanese customers.  ZEN is located in a very diverse, transitional neighborhood in Dallas.
 |What sets me apart is my own biography and culinary profile.  I'm not trying to offer the Japanese experience.  I consider my food New American with strong Japanese influences.  My personal creations reflect my style.  I was born in on Tokyo.  My mother is Japanese and my father is Cajun.  I grew up in South and Southwest.  I have a distinct flavor profile.
[For the most part, I enjoy the experience of Omakase (for those who don't know, it literally translates ""I'll leave it to you"" and means you leave the meal choices in the hands of your chef\).  I have been at restaurants where stern instructions were given with each offering, with the tone of ""you eat it this way or don't come back"".  What is your opinion of this attitude? Do you think it belongs in modern sushi?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbivxa2?context=5)|Chefs should probably change the word ""instructions"" to ""suggestions.""  This goes back to the egomania of any chef.  I can see that artists have a vision, but you cannot dictate to your customer/viewer/consumer how to experience what you produce.  People's tastes changes every day.  Based on your body chemistry which is always fluctuating, you may need a bit more salt.  It's okay if my customer wants a bit more soy sauce than normal.
 |Any chef, in any cuisine, needs to understand that they are making food for **you.**  Food with instructions is like masturbation.  Your purpose is to make food for **someone else.**   
[Well now that we kind of breached the subject I'll go ahead and drop the question: traditional Japanese do not approve of female sushi chefs. To the point where most sushi chefs would refuse to train a woman. How have you surmounted this problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbixa28?context=5)|I think I was in the right place at the right time.  They were desperate and I was willing to work for free... and be abused.  I didn't know about the abuse.  The abuse came later.
 |Everyone gets treated like crap, but some went out of their way to make my experience miserable.
 |I never in my wildest dreams imagined what would happen last year:  A chauvinist chef that I once with, who hit me twice, actually applied for a job at ZEN.  My revenge fantasy from 20+ years ago came true, but I didn't feel good.  I felt sorry for him.   
[How did you get into making Sushi?  What was the training process for you like?  Are there any aspects of your restaurant you would like to better? Anything you want to change?  If you could meet one person, alive or dead, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv5ln?context=5)|I started making sushi in San Antonio.  I was just a sushi maker, but I wanted formal training so I could be a real Itamae.  I knew I had to move to California to learn the very best.  I was lucky enough to find a company in San Diego that operated 3 different sushi bars that allowed me to train.  Because it was a large restaurant group, there were at 10 Master Itamaes.  None of of them acknowledged my existence except for one.  Thank you to Mino-San.  I learned mostly by watching and mimicking and that actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I learned so many styles from 10 different Masters.  I took what I thought was best of each of their styles and I developed my own style.  Most of the chefs at this restaurant group were from Tokyo.  I learned Edo-style.
[Are there any problems you face being a female sushi chef?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv5ln?context=5)|When I started 25 years ago, there were no schools for sushi.  The only way to become a sushi chef was to apply for an apprenticeship.  Back then, Itamaes were all Japanese men.  They were very against training non-Japanese and women.  I was both.
[San Diegan here.  What was the restaurant group please?

[Are you bad tempered like the sushi chef on the Simpsons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiv761?context=5)|Itamaes are naturally ego-maniacs.  In Japans, being an Itamae is the best chef you can possibly be.  It has ranking and draws a lot of respect.  It is because the training process is so rigorous and takes 8 years.  That's 8 years of very bad treatment.  Once you make it, you have a (false?) sense of superiority.  So you get grumpy at stupid people, stupid questions or stupid requests.
 |Although I'm not like that anymore because I am older, I do remember my ill-tempered days.  You eventually learn that you don't know sh*t.
 |So, yes, the Simpsons depiction is quite true.  I can attest to that stereotype.
 |And BTW, The Simpsons constantly gets referenced by my customers and my staff here loves the Simpsons.  We even have our own Sherri-Terri, here.
[Is toro worth the extra cost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwz0v?context=5)|I don't determine if its worth it.  You decide.
 |Honestly, I pay over $50 per pound at wholesale prices.  To me, it is the best part of the best fish.   
[People say the freshest fish is best, but from reading online it seems fish should be frozen for a period before being served raw. Can you talk about the timing and process of getting fish ready for consumption? Does it really make a difference if my fav restaurant isn't on the coast? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiyrxt?context=5)|No, it does not make a difference.  The supply chain for the food and shipping industry is unbelievable now.   A day fisherman in California can catch a fish, have it on the dock, and have it sold to a distributor by 10am.  I can be preparing this same fish the same evening in Dallas for dinner service.
 |If you catch fresh fish, you should ice it for at least 6 hrs, so that the adrenaline and hormones in the fish works it way out.  Those hormones are detectable, and you want it to taste natural.   
[I know this one's probably obvious but...  Does the temperature of your hands really affect the taste of sushi, or is that some sort of myth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbivy1o?context=5)|Myth.
[Wouldn't it have been easier to just become a carpenter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiylrh?context=5)|Yea, it would have been.
 |It would have been just as rewarding.  There is an art and honor to being a carpenter.
[There are some kinds of sushi that I absolutely love, and others that I'm not a fan of. The best sushi I have gotten is by doing ""omakase"", even though I'm always a little nervous about what I'll get.  My question is, is it poor form to request omakase but put some restrictions on it (e.g., no uni, or no maki, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiw5o6?context=5)|I can only speak for myself:  I appreciate some direction if I have never made food for you before.  It gives me information about you so that I can make your best meal.
[What makes sushi so damn addicting at a level well above other foods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwguw?context=5)|Some people say there's an addictive agent in wasabi.  But most sushi bars don't use real wasabi because it's so expensive.  People like wasabi because it probably released low-level endorphins from the burn.  With anything that does that, whether its a video games or exercising, you are more likely to be addicted.
[What can we do to attract more women into the sushi chef profession? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwbyb?context=5)|I regularly have interns from culinary schools who are female.  I think things are changing.   Honestly, there doesn't seem to be that much interest from females.  I really don't know.  There's more opportunity so let's work on building interest.   
[I love the Bishop Arts District, but I have yet to go to Zen (hopefully I will soon\). Before I leave for culinary school, I want to try and go to most of the restaurants on the D best 100. Which restaurants are your favorite, whether it be pizza, steak, french, and are there any Sushi restaurants other than Zen that you think people should definitely try out in the Dallas area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiykxi?context=5)|If you are going to go to my competitor, at least go to a place I would eat at:  Tei An, Sushi Sake, and Yutaka (when he's there)
[My dad's been a sushi chef for over 28 years and we just recently opened up another restaurant in BC, making a grand total of 6. After a couple of our employees left, we're stuck looking for Itamae, but all the ones we hire end up being sloppy with their rolls, and since my dad's super strict about quality, they always just quit. In my opinion, my dad's reasonable about what he says and how he trains people, there's just a lack of responsibility and perseverance. So my question is, is there a way to know if someone will meet your standards, maybe a certain question that will help my dad understand who will meet his requirements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbizhhh?context=5)|During the interview, I make them perform a few tests including cutting vegetables and making sushi and a roll.  The more detail-oriented some is, the better their sushi is going to look.  This means they will be slower.  You have to find a balance between someone who is meticulous but also quick.  This is a very hard combination.  You can teach neatness.  You cannot teach a sense of urgency.
[Any tips for women trying to get into the business? recommended courses, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbixl5k?context=5)|I really believe that the best way to learn is to beg for an apprenticeship with a respected chef.  I have been quite disappointed in the skill level of the graduates from some culinary programs.  You learn by repetition.  You have to make a California Roll at least 1000 times before it looks half-way decent.  You get this practice on the line, not in school.  
[Have you ever eaten Fugu or had an experience with it in your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbixdxq?context=5)|I have served Fugu at a [SSS](http://zensushidallas.com/zs/secret-sushi-society.html) dinner.  Honestly, the taste of fugu is over-rated.  It is a firm white meat fish, similar to halibut.  It is also very vein-y.
 |I think people want the thrill of it.  It's very expensive.  
[As a Sushi connoisseur, I normally ask the sushi chef to ""surprise me"" with whatever they enjoy making (under a set price, of course\)  I have to ask, do you enjoy it when people as you to ""surprise them""? Or do you just consider them assholes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbj527g?context=5)|This is the best way to expand your palate.  I think that somebody who is a serious and respected chef is going to give you their very best stuff.  
[How drunk have you gotten from a customer treating you to Saki?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbj2voo?context=5)|I'm one of the lucky(?) Asians that has an allergic reaction to alcohol.  So, to answer you question, never.
[Myth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwu7l?context=5)|Some studies have shown that women's hands are colder.  Male-dominated Japanese society perpetuated that.  It makes no difference.
[You can get the caterpillar roll in Japan now. lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jw5sf/iama_sushi_chef_with_over_25_years_of_experience/cbiwe0z?context=5)|Wow.  I didn't know that.

The one with the most Facebook likes by 4pm (PST) today, 8/7 will be recognized at the symposium tomorrow and in NASA social media.

To help out the Education Office here at Ames, I built a quick web app to show the top  posters by Facebook like count. Even though I am CS, I'm a systems programmer, so this project was hard! It is basically facebook api calls then static html bootstrap page generation, all in Python (with an abandoned effort in Perl). I had to build it quickly in response to the contest, but now that I've finished a presentable page, I plan to clean up the code.

1jw2lb,3,2013-08-07,Are staffing agencies for me? (Web Developer),TFenrir,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jw2lb/are_staffing_agencies_for_me_web_developer/,"I'm a relatively recent grad looking for some work, and my trade is web development. My experience is minimal, but I do have at least some experience working in the field - unfortunately the last place a worked was an unpaid internship that was just... not good. I got some experience, and they even offered to start paying me when I told them I was leaving, but the environment was really amateur and my confidence in getting paid was basically null.

Since then I've been looking for work, entry level, junior level, paid internships - whatever really, just anything in the field. But it's been really hard, and honestly I haven't even gotten an interview since that last position, which was nearly 2 months ago. As far as I can tell my resume is fine. I've had employment coaches (and others) look at it and they don't see anything wrong with it, and I always customize it a bit for each job application as well as provide a cover letter. But basically, it might just be my city (Toronto) but there is sooo much competition, I'm guessing my resume is just getting tossed aside.

I've been considering just getting in contact with as many IT recruiters as possible and hoping for the best at this point. I just need to get my feet in some doors, because I know I interview really well - but I can't seem to get that far. I recently got in contact with a second IT recruiter (the first one fell off the map) and she thinks she has positions that will fit my criteria, but who knows. Regardless, just talking to someone has been such a change of pace, it really got me thinking that maybe I should get in contact with every IT staffing agency in the city I can find, and just ask for their help - essentially.

Short of that, I could start cold calling, but I have no idea how to cold call to be honest. I don't know what sort of companies to even call! It's pretty frustrating getting leads, but not have them ever turn into interviews, and the only interview offers I seem to get are for completely amateur 'unpaid internships'.

I guess that came off a bit more ranty than I intended, but the short of it is... having trouble finding entry level web development work, the most luck I've had so far is talking to recruiters. Should I just start focusing on recruiters/staffing agencies or should I try my hand at cold calling? If I should cold call, how should I go about it?"
1jvywu,0,2013-08-07,Help me decide my academic future,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jvywu/help_me_decide_my_academic_future/,I'm torn of what I should do in September.

1jvr6y,5,2013-08-07,"A few college-related questions regarding where I should place my focus, and GPAs",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jvr6y/a_few_collegerelated_questions_regarding_where_i/,"So I've almost finished the first year of my CS degree - I've done reasonably well so far, pulling Ds, HDs and the occasional C for most of my assessments, and maintaing an unofficial GPA of 3.0 (with 4.0 being the highest GPA at my university).

However, I feel like perhaps I might be working *too* hard at university. I would estimate 70% of time is dedicated to studying (weekly readings, making study guides, attending lectures/classes, and assignments/quizzes), with perhaps only 10% of my time spent on personal projects and actual coding, and the other 20% spent on my part-time job and going out for the occasional drink. At the risk of sounding whiny, I am frankly feeling a little exhausted from it all, and I'm starting to feel like I'm putting too much stock in my GPA.

From everything I've read on this sub, and others, it would seem that getting an internship/experience is more important than my GPA, and that getting said experience is largely contingent on personal projects and actual, tangible coding skills (which I feel are still below par, despite any academic success I've had thus far).

So should I perhaps pull focus away from my studies, possibly forfeiting the chance to score a high GPA, and instead concentrate on building my actual coding skills and working on personal projects that I can parlay into experience/an internship?

Any response would be super appreciated!"
1jvk2g,4,2013-08-07,I have ADHD and I have some problems that I'm not sure is related to ADHD.,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jvk2g/i_have_adhd_and_i_have_some_problems_that_im_not/,"The following happened a lot when I was around 8-12 years old

Some days, I would just sit still in class, completely quiet while listening to everything that was going on around me. I would often start staring at any random spot and my thoughts would be completely empty. After a while, the noise from the other kids would seem louder and louder. A feeling of unease would start growing and my heart  would start beating faster. I would panic and rush out of class, often all the way home.
When I got home I still felt uneasy. I would often turn on my computer and play some game, which calmed me down and I would quickly forget about the unease feelings.

The same thing would happen at soccer practice and family activities (such as birthdays etc). But most of this stopped around the time I was 12.

A similar thing happened when I was 17 and had an internship at a rest-home. On my first day, after about 1 hour I started feeling very uneasy and I just could not resist running home, so that's what I did, without saying a word to anyone. The day after I called them and said I just couldn't do it.

I'm now 20 years old and I'm struggling to find a job, I'm afraid that I will just panic and quit, if I managed to get a job that is.

So my question is; Has something similar happened to people with ADHD? Is it / could it be related to ADHD?"

[What was your scariest shark encounter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi87pa?context=5)|Well it wasnt my scariest (however i am desensitized)  but when I tell people the story they certainly think it is.
 |I was working off the back of the boat on a day with lots of swell. We went over a swell, the anchor caught and I was thrown off backwards and landed on the head of a 13 foot great white shark. It spooked the shark and as it bolted away i rolled over it and got one hell of a hit from its dorsal fin to the side of the face...bitch slapped by a great white :(
[What if you wore a bright orange or yellow suit to look less seal like.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbikfee?context=5)|They've done studies on color. I am pretty sure color makes little difference. There is a joke/saying where yellow is referred to as ""yum yum yellow"".
 |Im not to sold on color, I think you could be whatever color you want I think sharks tend to focus more on shapes- if that makes sense.
[Is it possible to become ""friends"" with shark? They remember you in some way? As you go swim/dive with them they come and say ""hi""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9jx9?context=5)|I wish! we have been having the same shark return to seal island for 11 seasons now. while we love and get really excited to see him I dont think he shares the same emotion.
[Do Sharks like to ride Tornados for fun? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8ewc?context=5)|Absolutely! however, this usually happens far out to sea where we cannot witness this spectacular event. It was only recently that director Anthony C. Ferrante was able to capture this rare event occurring over los angeles. 
[Are sharks in South Africa protected? What is the state of the Shark population in your country and in Africa in general?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9h49?context=5)|The great white sharks are protected in south africa however there is very little government infrastructure to enforce protection. Shark long lining is a very serious problem off all of Africa's coastline. Other countries such as china take full advantage of these countries being unable to enforce.
 |It is really tragic and difficult to watch.
[That is terribly sad. Sharks are truly amazing animals, they deserve better. What activities do you participate in to help sharks in your country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9txh?context=5)|If I see people fishing out great whites I usually try to photograph the people, their boat, car etc and send it off to the authority. unfortunately, a lot of these efforts have been in vain but we have gotten one person prosecuted.
 |I also try to do whatever I can to get them to stop. I have taken by boat overtop their fishing lines every time they cast.
[You grew up on the ocean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi93r8?context=5)|Well my mom was a mermaid and my dad was just a young city guy who fell in love. Needless to say I spent a lot of time on the ocean.
 |Splash movie reference... anyone... anyone?
[What makes a Shark turn rogue? (I think of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbia1m2?context=5)|There's no scientific conclusion to this answer but I can give you my educated guess.
 |For lack of better words I believe it is a ""hungry"" shark. Potentially this animal has been unable to successfully hunt wild animals out to sea so it moves in shore to scavenge or forage. Humans are pathetic in the water- even Michael phelps looks like a dweeb in the water to a shark. So we appear as easy pickings. Im sure that if one were to follow a rouge shark they would see this shark eating whatever it comes across- not just humans.
 |Here's an attempt at an analogy- imagine putting a piece of stale or moldy bread in front of two people. One person regularly eats and just finished a massive meal. The other has only eaten sporadically and hasnt eaten in the past couple days. It is no doubt that the hungry person is going to be far more aggressive in securing that bread as well as less picky about the state of the bread. In this case the people are the sharks and the moldy bread is the human.
[Is there a way to minimize a shark attack if you are by sharks? Maybe a quick jab to the nose..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9d69?context=5)|There are things you can and cannot do however if you encounter a shark, not on your terms, or by accident, I honestly believe the ball is in their court.
 |Typically if you see the shark that is the first indicator that you have a chance. They are ambush predators if they want you they are going to hit you before you even know what is up. Anyway, at this point you need to show the shark that you are the more dominant animal in the water. This means you need to make movements towards it, poke it with a spear (if you have) or hit it as hard as you can while maintaining accuracy and control. Make yourself look as big as possible, I put arms above my head and point my feet straight down with toes pointed.
 |While doing this you want to make your way out of the water as quick as possible. Do not ever start splashing and swim away from the shark (in panic) when it is circling you or swimming at you. This is like a dinner bell to them.
 |It is the ultimate game of chicken!
[I heard that attacking the eyes would be the number one priority.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9so8?context=5)|Great whites are pretty big. It would think it would be difficult to reach back and hit their eye as you are in their mouth. plus their eyes roll back to protect when they are biting.
 |With that said, it sure wouldnt hurt to try.
 |Also, sharks cant look backwards so if you can somehow get behind them and grab down on them somewhere this will usually elicit a flight response and send them on their way. 
[At what point do you stop swimming towards it and start getting out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiqdco?context=5)|I think at the point you feel that your are close enough to an exit that you can book it before the shark comes back and investigate you.
[How many different species of shark exist around Seal Island? Do they like to co-mingle with each other or do they stick to their own kind? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbibcjx?context=5)|The great white shark is king around the island. you do get some small bottom dwelling sharks that live around the island but any species that swims in the water column would likely be view as a meal for a great white as well.
[Have you seen individual sharks display individual personalities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiaipq?context=5)|Absolutely! we first identify them by characteristics on their bodies (such as birthmarks). WHen they stick around and come to the boat day after day you start to see these amazing personalities come out. You get very attached to them and feel very close. Eventually the sharks move on and when they stop showing up you get sad but hope to see them next season and when they show up that next season, a little bigger, you are over the moon! 
[That's so cool - can you give an example of the personalities you might see? It's so hard for me to imagine something like a shark exhibiting one (shows how limited my knowledge is\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbibs92?context=5)|Sure, last year I named a shark Deux Rossee. which is broken french for two roses. This is for two reasons: first, she has two rose shaped birthmarks on either side of her dorsal fin. Second, she has two personalities. She can be so calm and circle the boat for hours or she can be a wild child and fly out of the water on you. Here are two pictures of my little girl.
 |The first is her being calm, notice the white pigment rose on her dorsal fin [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/8YZQKv) The second picture is her wild side [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/SkiVv2G)
 |There was anothe shark names Rasta because he was sooo chilled. He could come up to the boat and rest his head on the back of the dive step (I dont have a picture)
 |There are soo many more but I will leave it at that for now.
[How dangerous are these sharks to humans?  For example if your dive boat sank and everyone had to swim to shore, would you be confident that nobody would be bitten in half by a shark?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8e5q?context=5)|I would say it really has to depend where you are. Sharks have resting grounds and feeding ground. If the boat went down at seal island I would be nervous as this is their hunting ground. If we were in their area that they rest I would still be uneasy as there are always opportunistic sharks and we would be a group of panicky animals splashing on the surface but there would be a good chance we could make it to shore.
 |For the record, I would try to get everyone to be a calm as possible and clump together as close as possible so we look like one massive animal as opposed to many individual small animals.
[*If the boat went down at seal island I would be nervous.*  *If we were in their area that they rest I would still be uneasy.*  So we'd be fucked either way.  Gotcha.  Good to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8t1o?context=5)|I wouldnt say fucked but I would say that your fate is out of your hands at that point. 50/50.
[What is the coolest shark encounter you have ever experienced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9ats?context=5)|There are so many aye. I have to give it to the first time I ever saw a great white. I was on the dive step off the back of the boat and the spotter in the eagles nest called out a shark coming in from the left. I immediately looked and saw a shadow moving our way. As it came closer the shadow transformed into a shark shaped shadow, then it came and swam right under my feet. at that point 20 years of wondering what they look like in real life became a reality. It was such a memorable moment in my life.
 |Pardon the pun, but i was hooked from then onwards.
[What is the most sharks you've been in the water with at once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbicj3c?context=5)|This is a picture of me that I would probably say is the most sharks i have dove with in one sitting [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/r45qWi8)
[ if you think you're about to be attacked, what is your ""oh shit"" plan to gtfo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbicj3c?context=5)|As far as a GTFO plan, I would assess how far I have to go to get out of the water. If it is close enough I would just break all my rules and try as hard as I could to get there as quick as possible. If i am out in the open I would try to just fight it off until it gets over it. Last resort- shit myself an island and stand on it!
[What made you want to pursue a career in working with sharks? Is this something you've wanted to do since you were a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi8prl?context=5)|I've grown up on the ocean and always had an obsession and curiosity with sharks- especially great white sharks! There is so much mystery to these animals. i also find them beautiful, powerful, graceful and terrifying all wrapped up into one. 
[I am already scuba certified, and would love to go cage diving with sharks.  Do you have any tips, or recommendations on locations I should go for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbici5w?context=5)|My intentions are not to plug my company however I do have a shark diving company. the website is www.oceans-discovery.com.
 |I would say the best place to go cage diving in the united states is out of san diego california. There are live aboards that go down to an island called guadalupe off baja. here, the vis is 100 feet, the water is warm, and the sharks are biig!!
 |In SA the shark diving is also great however the water is cold and the vis is usually around 12 feet. the crowning jewel of SA is the sharks jumping.
 |Austrailia and New Zealand have equally amazing cage diving.
 |Drop me a line if you want the full shabang about great white shark diving planet earth ;) jeremy@oceans-discovery.com.
 |Again sorry to plug my company, that is not my intention of this AMA.
[I hear stories of massive great whites out there, what is the largest one you have personally seen and what did you feel when you saw it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiaj4f?context=5)|The biggest I saw was around 5.5 meters, or 17.5 feet, it is pretty rare to come across ones this big. When I saw it, my jaw freaking dropped- it looked like a baby whale!
 |I tell you it isnt the length of these animals it is the girth they gain as they grown.
 |This photo probably doesnt do much justice but it was my attempt at the time to make a comparison. [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/lgHsyLI)
 |Bare in mind that shark is about 6 feet underwater, that seal decoy on the surface is about 1.5 feet. 
[WOW! I would be terrified and awwed at the same time. One day I would like to go in a cage and see those beautiful creatures. Thanks for the pic!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiavfq?context=5)|Well you have a connection to the shark diving world now! ;)
[What is roughly the highest that you have seen a shark ""jump"" out of the water?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbi9227?context=5)|Probably about 12 feet or so. I work on shark guru chris Fallow's boat and this photo from 2011 was probably it. This is 3/4 on the downward fall. it was well over the sun at its peak.

Love the name but support the stormers through and through.
 |This answer will get me some down votes!
[Very interesting AMA to read. Do Orca come around Seal Island ? Heard any stories about killer whale encounter with great white off South Africa ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiqknv?context=5)|Yup, it isnt seen every year but they come in to hunt the common dolphins, we were lucky enough to catch up with them last year. They came right up and I got a killer fb profile picture out of the encounter! check it:  [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/BUaEduI)
 |I havent seen them hunt a great white but I have noticed that shark activity goes very quiet when they are in the area.
[Haha, humans are screwed either way. love it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbie9i8?context=5)|Lol certainly not free from unwanted shark encounters.
[How do you distinguish the sharks from male and female? Thanks for doing this it is cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbij5jz?context=5)|Cheers man, male sharks have what are known as claspers. For a lack of better words, it looks like a big wiener hanging from where you would imagine a sharks goods to be.
 |Here is a picture i shot that shows the claspers well. it's the two pronged thing towards the caudal end (back fin) of the shark. [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/TIMJVx8)
 |And yes sharks do have two dongs- have fun with that one reddit. 
[Not sure if this falls into your lap that often but have you ever seen a whale shark? If so what was your initial reaction to seeing it? Is it safe to ride them via dorsal fin or do they dive too deep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjbbh2?context=5)|I have seen and dove with them on several occassions. There are about as mellow as it gets. When to many people get around them they do tend to dive deep. At that point you just let go, head back to the boat, then wait for it to pop up again.
[Can we get a pic of you diving with the sharks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbia3zf?context=5)|Sure thing. I wont lie I dont have a ton. I've never really been a huge camera guy. Im all about watching with my eyes. meaning Im at the mercy of the people i am with. none the less I will try to get one up.
[Do hammerhead sharks behave notably different than the more ""normally-shaped"" sharks?  I recall reading at some point that the wider distribution of their sensors makes them more effective hunters.  Does it also help them to distinguish between human-food and seal-food?  Also, I've noticed that there are only 3 big stars of Shark Week - great white, bull shark, and tiger shark.  Any idea why this is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbime7e?context=5)|Hammerheads probably have the most well tuned electro reception capabilities. they are really good and picking out prey that is hiding in the sand and in crevices. Imagine their heads are like a metal detector. Beyond that I am not to credible of a source with the hammerheads- but they are an amazing shark.
 |The reason for only seeing those 3 shark species is simple- they sell.  
[Although you're practically living an episode on Shark Week, do you still like to watch shows from the program? If so, do you ever learn anything new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiipsi?context=5)|I like to watch the good stuff- not these 10 people who shouldnt be alive shark attack file stuff. Those docos bum me out.
 |Most docos are pretty superficial in terms of their knowledge they share but every now and then I hear something cool and new- especially when they cover sharks other than great whites.
[How did you end up working with sharks and what school/training did you need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiao1b?context=5)|It was a pretty cool little journey. I went to school for Marine Zoology and in my final year I saw an advert for a great white shark internship in Mossel Bay, South Africa and signed up for it about 4 seconds later.
 |While I was down there Chris Fallows and team came to mossel bay to film a segment for Ultimate Air Jaws. I was fortunate enough to spend the entire time working on the shoot with them and got to know chris and monique well. At the end of the shoot they offered me a job to come work for them in False Bay (Cape Town) and the rest is history. 
[Do you have any particular species that you're more fond of than others? (besides great whites i guess\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbio0k6?context=5)|A blue shark's skin is amazing- it is like a rainbow of blue when it hits the light. You dont know if you are looking at grey blue, colbalt, periwinkle, light blue, etc.
 |A mako shark skin is also amazing, it is so silver and shiny. Plus they are the fastest shark out there.
 |No picture can do justice to how beautiful a tiger sharks pattern actually is.
 |There's a couple.
[ off, thanks for doing this!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|First off i totally recommend Guadalupe for your first experience. The conditions there are amazing. If you are scuba certified you can go into the cage that drops 10 meters down- the other two cages are just below the surface. Also, make sure to go in october/ early november. This is when all the big 5+ meter mamas come in.
[It has been a life long dream of mine to swim with sharks.  For my 40th birthday, I plan on doing it - probably at Guadalupe Island from a US based charter company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|Look at companies that launch out of san diego and go down as opposed to ones launching from mexico. It will be cheaper from mexico but from what I have seen during my time there was the mexican boats are shaby and their cages look dodgy.
[My questions: 1\) How do I tell if they are a legit charter company, keeping safety (both mine and the sharks\) in mind?  I've read about companies feeding the sharks, rather than simply baiting them (which, I understand trains the sharks that boats/cages = food\) and others using shoddy cages.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|I would recommend Islander Charters. The price isnt outrageous, the crew works their ass off for you, the chef is out of this world and they use top notch equipment.
[2\) While I've been wanting to do this for a long time, I'm sure - once I see the shark in the water the first time - I'm going to freak.  How scary is it, the first time you see a Great White, 2-3 times larger than you, swimming towards you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiprhp?context=5)|I promise that when you see the shark for the first time all your fears are going to go away and you would be in awe. It is so surreal when you see a great white (or any shark species).  What you have in your mind now is an idea of how they behave. The instant you see them you immediately develop a completely different perception of them and usually scary wont be the way you explain them from that point on.
[Sharks terrify, yet fascinate me. Love the pictures you've already provided. Great AMA so far!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjbucp?context=5)|I have shark paraphernalia coming out the wazoo! When you work in this field most people tend to get you shark stuff for presents- im not complaining.
[Do you collect any shark things...a tooth or anything from your adventures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjbucp?context=5)|I do have a real great white tooth that was left behind in our seal decoy one year. they are super rare to get so that one sits in a special place. I also have a tiger shark tooth that I found via dumb luck.
[What kind of great white population is there near Seal Island. Since some great white have wide migration pattern do 'new' large great Whites from other well known areas visit Seal Island ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiqrec?context=5)|Ya the sharks are moving up and down the coast pretty regularly. They come into the island for anywhere from 1 day to several months then move on again.
 |Whether you are pro or anti sharkmen (Osearch) here are the live update results of the shark tracking off SA [Link to sharks-ocearch.verite.com](http://sharks-ocearch.verite.com) 
[Have you ever had an experience that left you wondering why you continue to do the shark diving and do you ever think how much longer you will continue to admire sharks and study them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbif0w7?context=5)|The only negative experience that I have had has been with people in the industry. Unfortunately you have to have thick skin in this industry. I know that my professional life will not always be with sharks but anytime I have to holiday will always be with them.
[Where is the safest and best place to do shark sighting in a cage? Also, what is the training for it? This is something on my bucket list. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbicwtt?context=5)|Cage diving requires no training and most places have everything you will need for your dive. there is an industry wide standard for cage strength. All cages are typically welded steel. We have all seen the horror photos of the shark inside the cage or pulling off the front of the cage. It would be very difficult for that to happen today given the evolution of the industry.
 |You could go to California (dont go to the Faralon Islands of San Francisco though- expensive and ver poos viz), South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. It will be interesting to see if one pops up off new england soon too.
[Awesome, thanks! I'm not too worried about being attacked in one, I just wanted to be sure the sharks are protected and not go somewhere sketchy. You never know, and I would hate to unknowingly support that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbid8p5?context=5)|It's wonderful to hear that!
[Did you ever get to work with a Great White called ""Alek""? If so, that was my shark on seal island!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiw0rb?context=5)|Hey no way do you remember you went out with to Seal Island? I have not, but I do remember a guest named Alek.
[Aren't blacktips considered As being far more ferocious then big whites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbiohk3?context=5)|Well you are certainly in more of a pack mentality atmosphere when diving with these guys. You need to be more aware of whats going on around you than when diving with a white shark, tiger shark or bull shark (referred to as the 3 most ""dangerous"" sharks.
 |So, I wouldnt say more dangerous, just more variables. I've dove this place countless times and still have ten fingers and ten toes.
[I've always wanted to dive or cage dive with great white sharks, but those trips are really expensive. Do you know of any options where someone would be able to volunteer in exchange for seeing/working with these amazing animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbidno7?context=5)|Off the top of my head i dont. Most companies do paid volunteer programs which would be less expensive then going out and booking as a guest but volunteer and view for free is hard to find. New Zealand is the ""newest"" emerging industry I would start down there and see what happens.
 |Otherwise Marine Dynamics in Gans Bai or White Shark Africa in Mossel Bay (both south africa) have pretty good programs.
[Have you ever had a shark other than a whale shark give attention and/or let you ride on them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbjeb51?context=5)|Sure, I've rode a tiger shark, black tip shark and duskie sharks. i've held blues, makos, 7 gills.  Most dont let you ride them, it is kind of like bull riding, you hold on until they throw you.
[I figured so, but is it possible for one to still be out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbj50z9?context=5)|There always is a possibility that some relict population is hanging around somewhere far away from humans (thus why we dont see them) but I think it is unlikely.
 |It would be bad ass though!
[Have you heard of the program they are doing in Southern California with trying to find where White sharks mate and breed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbihr52?context=5)|I havent heard of the specific program in Southern California but i do not that scientists are tying to figure out these areas all around the world in order to better protect the species.
[Could you wave hello to a great white on my behalf? They're my favorite animal, and I don't think I'll be seeing one in Michigan any time soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jtug2/iama_shark_diver_at_seal_island_south_africa_ama/cbil00b?context=5)|Abbbsolutely!
[I watched that show too and I am definitely skeptical of megalodons existing. But I was wondering, they showed a whale that had it's tail bit off, supposedly in one bite.

I currently have 1 semester remaining for a bachelor in CS and will be working part-time for them once this school year starts (in around 3 weeks).

Heres my problem: I want to move into development at this company. How do I make this clear without jeopardizing my part-time (well paying, for an internship) job during school and the offer after graduation (which I would accept until I found a development role). Right now the company is slightly low on QA, which I think works against me. I believe they will tell me something like, ""We simply can't spare any QA resources right now, just wait and we will see what we can do.""

I will work to move into development regardless of my staying at this company or not (if they don't move me to dev, I will look at other positions). How can I make this known without sounding selfish?

Raw text is below. 

How I picked up programming and got offered an internship

This is a quick summary of the journey I have been on thus far on how I went from zero knowledge to an internship. I am still learning a ton every day even as I write this. To be honest, I thought programming just wasn't my thing and never would be. The biggest surprise is that the skills I gained were not from courses at school but outside of the classroom learning on my own and at my own pace. If you would like become an autodidact send me an email and I can help point you in the right direction.

High School
Throughout high school, I had been searching for my “knack” (area in which one excels). Programming had always been in the back of my mind. I thought it was interesting and powerful just never the match for me. Some of my only exposure was a computer programming class sophomore year that covered basic java. That would hold true even when I decided to go to Francis Tuttle’s Pre-Engineering Academy as I would sway more towards hardware.

Highschool never did a great job at offering challenging programming courses.
College
I chose Oklahoma State University as the spot to pursue an electrical engineering degree. My first semester there, I took Computer Science 1. This was again a semester overview of Java. The course was a requirement for my degree, and that’s all I saw it as. I had not yet decided to make the leap to taking an interest in programming. We were using tools such as Vim and Putty to complete our work. Still at the time, I had not decided that I wanted to learn programming.

Finally, I had decided I need to face my inner doubts about my programming skills. For the longest time, I had told myself there would be a perfect time to start learning.

There will NEVER be a perfect time to start learning. Now is the right time.
Coming to the point of wanting to start coding came after multiple trips to San Francisco for various conferences and events. A couple being the Intersection Event hosted by Google and Hackademic by Uncollege. In January, I started with the Python track on Codecademy by beginning of summer my profile looked like this:

Codecademy profile after a semester
At this point, I still had no idea what Github or Bitbucket were or even what a repository was. I had not fallen upon the beauty of Sublime Text. I had just took my first steps on the path that I am still traveling down now.

I began to look for internships and started at the Hire OSU Grads site. I went looking for internships that were programming based but did not require extensive knowledge. I found a couple and reached out to them in hopes to makes some leads on getting a job for the summer. Needing a recommendation to help my cause I reached out to someone in my network who was the CTO of a startup based in Oklahoma City.

Internship
To my surprise, instead of getting a recommendation I was given a internship offer I could not refuse. Within a week and a half, I had started my new internship at ShoppinPal. I had went from starting Code School to landing a R&amp;D internship that would include programming projects. Here I was given even more resources to continue my learning such as a CodeSchool &amp; Lynda account.

Codeschool account after 2 months
I wanted to share this part of my journey with you to tell you that you can learn to program too. There are tons of resources out there and if you need help on where to start or what to use reach out. I will be writing more on what I have been able to complete in my time so far at my internship. I am no where near a full on programmer yet. I am learning a ton still. I am taking a Start Up Engineering (Coursera), Try Objective-C (Codeschool) and C &amp; C++ (Lynda). I am constantly trying to learn more and apply that at my work.

Take your time and learn at your own pace. I was my biggest barrier to overcome.

1juyo3,2,2013-08-06,"I'm a computer engineering major, but I'm not sure what I can do in the field of cs careers. Can someone help?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1juyo3/im_a_computer_engineering_major_but_im_not_sure/,"Okay, so my degree is in Computer Engineering. So my first questions are, how much of a disadvantage do I have to other computer science graduates, why/what they are, and if there is something I can do to put myself on par with that.

Second, I have extensive experience in Web Development as an intern and feel this is what I want to do as a career. Is this a CS career? What should a ""Developer"" or ""Software Engineer"" expect as their duties in a career? Does this also apply to development on the web? Can a person who knows Web Development also be able to learn how to use other languages/do development in other types of environments? 

Does a ""developer"" or ""software engineer"" need to supplement their education with further learning? What are some topics that appeal to CS majors as potential careers? 

Does getting a graduate degree help my chances? If so, then which degree would be the *best* one to get? IE, gives me the best opportunities to be happy and to make a lot of money? 

Computer Science - or other major which focuses on pure CompSci

Computer Engineering - an extension of my current degree 

Multimedia Experiences - a compsci related degree which focuses primarily on multimedia and presentation

Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics - a business related science degree which deals with data and what to do with it

Financial Engineering - knowing the business of financial engineering would be helpful if one wanted to write trading software 

Math....


Or is no Degree at all better?

If I worked at a company for 3-5 years, would it be really difficult to switch paths when it comes to what I'm working on?

Not a journalist, but marketing, PR, advertising, research, academia - as long as it's close to the media and pays okay, I'm at least willing to try it. 

I've had internships in all of the above fields and, not to sound arrogant, but I feel I've done a pretty good job. I've performed well throughout and have stellar letters of recommendation from all of them. But no one will actually hire me full-time, because...

I need a visa. 

I understand that handicaps me. I know I should be in a ""high demand"" field like engineering or programming. I know it's asking a lot of potential employers when there are tons of qualified citizens who need jobs too. 

But I know I'm a good worker. I know I can add to an organization. I'm sharp, I'm willing to learn and I work really hard. I was told straight by a supervisor: ""Everyone in the office loves you, you're our favorite intern and you add huge value to our accounts, but we can't hire you because you need a visa.""* So a bunch of other interns are getting hired, while I get to remain an intern because ""they'll have me for as long as I want to stay."" Unfortunately, I can't afford to be an intern for much longer. 

(*The company has thousands of employees, but the entry-level position is on an hourly wage, and apparently there are issues with paying non-citizens overtime.)

The vaguely good news is that my home country has an FTA with the US that makes a visa for me significantly easier to get than a typical H1B. Lower cost, less paperwork, less time, less risk. 

But still, it's work that they wouldn't have to do if they employed a US citizen. It's hard enough to get a company to give me a chance, but I don't just need a chance - I almost need a favor, because of the extra work. And I'm just getting really discouraged. 

So, I don't know what I'm asking. Maybe just a listening ear. But if you know of someone who's navigated a similar situation, or if you have any advice for me, or hell - if you think your company (or a friend's company) would be willing to give me the time of day for a salaried position - please, please let me know. Any advice is welcome.  "

So I received my offer today, and it was a bit underwhelming, but I'm unsure whether I'm overreacting or not. Here's a quick overview.

* Fortune 60 tech company.
* Greater Boston Area (emphasis on Greater, but I'd like to live closer)
* Computer Science Degree, Bachelors
* 1st Full Time Salaried Job
* 22 Years Old
* Non-""Elite"" School (you've definitely never heard of it) 
* Experience: 2 months at current co-op, 8 months previous co-op, 11 months previous CS related job. 

The offer was for 71k base (making 61.5 as an intern right now) bonuses and what not bump it up to about 78k. Plus a one time relocation fee (I'm from New York) that based off my intern relocation fee, will be about $2000, bumping me up to 80k before tax (are bonuses before tax??) for my first full year.

The number I had in my head before the offer was presented was 80k base, considering the major metropolitan area close by, the prestige of the company, general salary for CS majors, etc. I've tried to do my due diligence, and 80k base stuck in my head. I don't know, something about it just.. stuck. 

Anywho, like I said I was a little underwhelmed with the base, the benefits seem to be all in order (3 weeks vacation, health, vision, the works) and I really like the company and the work I'm doing, my only issue was wanting to live closer to Boston (big city kid at heart I guess) and I thought the 80k base number would compensate for that. 

The HR rep said that their offer was based on a formula that took into account degree level, school, major, and experience, and I got the vibe that this is non-negotiable. I told her I would review the offer and give her a response soon, were my expectations too high? Is this a solid offer or am I getting low balled?

Thanks for reading."

I was wondering how does it look to go for a second bachelor's degree? 

I am 22, and I recently graduated with a chemical engineering degree, but the job prospects seem very bleak. I have been over at /r/ChemicalEngineering and a lot of the threads seem depressing. To give you an idea, I saw multiple threads where recent grads are unemployed and some are thinking of going for a masters in a different field cause they couldn't find an entry level chemical engineering job. 

I was thinking of getting a BS in CS or Computer Engineering. My plan would be to go to a CC for 2-3 years then transfer to a 4 year and finish up my degree. The thing is I'll be 27 or 28 when I come out because I'll be working part time (either in retail or after i get some classes under my belt - an internship) throughout this as well. 

Will my age or the fact that I went for a second degree affect my future employment? Or if I go for grad school later, will getting my degree affect that ?

After looking for an internship related to my major, I found your internship program and realize it's everything I'm looking for.  


Working for the largest communications holding company in the world while also being able to develop and practice my programming and leadership skills would be the experience of a lifetime.  My experience and passion would also be of great value to the company.  With skills that cannot be taught inside a classroom and an excellant education to serve as a base, I am easily molded and make a great addition to any team.  I communicate and work well with others, yet work well independently. 


I'm very eager to gain professional experience and looking forward to a challenge.  I would greatly appreciate hearing back from you so we could discuss how I can be the perfect addition to your team.

I got into EET because of my interest in digital systems and microcontrollers. However, after my internship experience this summer and some research into the university curriculum, I've realized 

1) I'm really not one for circuit analysis and hardware. I'd like to do more programming.  

2) The rest of the EET program is almost ALL about hardware and circuit design. Not much in terms of programming/microcontrollers. 

If I switched to software engineering, it would take an extra year or longer before I could transfer.
Then I found out that the university also offers an Embedded Systems Technology degree that focuses a lot on programming. Almost all my EET credits transfer toward that degree. It would also better qualify me for the kind of work I really want to do. It seems like the right choice but I have some concerns:

1) It's a new program, not yet ABET accredited, and has low student enrollment compared to the software and EE(T) programs.

2) An EET or software engineering degree both can get you a job in embedded systems, plus you can go into many other areas. Is Embedded Systems too narrow a discipline? Would it limit my job options down the road? Or is it best of both worlds?

tl;dr- EE(T) vs Software vs Embedded Systems degrees. Pros? Cons? Practical advice?

So, I have an A-Level in Computer science and just finishing an apprenticeship in programming (equal to 3 A-Levels). My tutor has commented a number of times saying 'why are you on this course?' in a good way, she means I should be a on a much higher course than the one im on. Im thinking of it as an internship as such.

Now, I love programming but I really hate where I am at. I like my boss and colleagues, but the work is draining its in an office which doesnt feel enlightening and often I actually have little or no work to do, I'm not pushed or challenged and its just dull.

So, I am now looking to progress. Im making so little money it hurts, I was on around £700 per month which isnt bad for my age and considering im on an apprenticeship, but now my hours are cut and im on £375 a month and Im looking to move in with a mate. I am looking to start progressing.

So, when I started I was a web developer (not something I really enjoy) and I have great skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL etc etc. 

Then I moved on to android and iOS programming (Java and Objective-C). 

During my A-Level we were taught programming paradigms and concepts in Visual Basic and C, so my knowledge of the fundamentals of programming is good, not excellent, but good. I love to study OOP and I love things like data structures and objects, something about them really fascinate me - which is one reason I dont like the web dev side of programming, I love the nitty gritty stuff where you beam hugely when your massive module works (no pun intended).

**Questions:**

1) Whats next for me? My software dev skills arn't great for a computer, but this is an area I would like to go into, I have the skills but I havent done anything commercial for a computer (just phone OS)

2) What is your workplace like? I ask this because I dont like the setup we have, it just doesnt feel nice, I dislike going into the room and sitting down for the whole day

3) Pay prospects? At the moment as I stated above im on next to nothing for what I do. How can I grow this?

4) Finally, why do you enjoy software dev? I may not pursue this career (as I am also in line for the police full time from special constable, but there may be an issue with my application) so I want to know my options :)

Thanks for reading this anyway! Appreciate it loads :)"

I was one of those isolationist hermit-like depressives, but I've made a lot of progress in the past year and am feeling pretty good now. I also realized that I hated programming, but I felt trapped in my degree. I'm starting to look for jobs now, and I'm worried that if I take a job as a programmer all the progress I've made in dealing with my depression will go down the drain as I work a job I hate. However, my school really only helps students find jobs programming for reasons I don't fully understand. (I asked this question to my adviser, and she directed me to an online listing that was entirely made up of small-medium business programming jobs. It was a similar situation at the campus career fair.) 

I'm hoping someone can help me find what else is out there for someone in my situation. I still like the problem solving aspect of CS, and I particularly like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction, but don't know how to explore those outside of the research route. I could deal with a small amount of coding, but I think it's more something I would do a hobby than something I could make a career out of. I'm having a really hard time finding resources on the web, so if someone could suggest a few job titles to research, or even provide some links to resources for CS majors looking for jobs outside their degree I'd really appreciate it.

**Summary in case my rambling is confusing:**
I'm looking for a job outside of programming, or even CS entirely. Hoping someone could suggest a place to start.

**EDIT:** Just wanted to thank everyone for the help, I've got a lot of things to read up on now! I was really frustrated trying to find info on what a CS degree can be used for, so you guys have helped me out a bunch."

I've been doing a crazy amount of Python work this summer and would like to be competitive for internships this fall. I'm having an issue figuring out what my next step should be. Should I do my next project in Node, which I won't be that proficient in by the time career fairs start, or continue learning and applying Python stuff?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Nurse here. Thank you for your work !  What are the worst lab results you remember ? The ones that make you go ""whoa, did they send me a sample from Uranus or what ?"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk0zx?context=5)|Turns out that the nurse who collected it poured the purple-top into the yellow-top.  Which is bad.  Purple tops are used for hematology, and they contain EDTA stabilized with potassium.  The EDTA prevents clotting by binding to calcium.
 |Also had a few patients come in who had hemoglobins below 4 g/dL.  One had kidney failure, another I think had a GI bleed.
[Whoa. Thanks for your answer !  I remember a patient with D-dimers through the roof, the lab had to double-check the results. Bad case of thrombosis, but the patient survived in the end.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllkjd?context=5)|Huh.  That seems weird to me.  Normally, D-dimer is a rule-out test.  If it's below a certain threshold, then the chance of there being a clot is very low.  However, it's not a very specific test and an elevated result could be caused by a number of conditions (including even very mild traumas).
 |The only reason I could think that they'd need to double-check it is if it was above their analyzer's linearity, or there was some kind of error along the way.
[Vets do this all the time. ""oh we didn't have enough in the sst so we poured some into it from the lavender.""  Clients who don't have at least some in house lab work to do sometimes really just don't understand. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm4gr?context=5)|I've yet to see a specimen from our local vet clinic that wasn't hemolyzed.
[We always redraw/rerun unexpectedly high/low results.  Sounds like you guys don't deal with much other than your normal run of the mill patients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblmc22?context=5)|If the result is unexpected, then yeah we'd look into it.  My point was more that an elevated D-dimer isn't really unexpected.
 |We're a smaller facility.  We can handle a lot of things, but yeah, most of it is run of the mill stuff.  Broken bones, chest pain, fevers, etc.  Our more serious patients are usually shipped to a a facility better equipped to handle them after being stabilized.
[How accurately do shows like CSI and NCIS portray your line of work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljfej?context=5)|Not very.
 |Lab tests take time.  And every picture of blood cells I've seen on TV has been fake.
[When someone comes into the ER for an injury, are results submitted to the police and/or health insurance company?  I don't think this exactly your area, but maybe you would know.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljcz1?context=5)|No.
 |We do need to submit **Which** tests we're performing to the insurance company, but we don't send them the results.
 |As for the police, the only way that we can turn over test results to them is if it's been ordered by the court.
 |And routine medical drug tests do not hold up in court due to a lack of chain-of-custody.
[What LIS do you use and do you like it? Is your CAH part of a larger health system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljnd6?context=5)|We just switched to Cerner.  There are a lot of things that I like about it, and a lot of things that I find frustrating.  And our computer system is part of a larger system (which is where a lot of the problems come from).
[Did you ever work as an MLT during college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljqjq?context=5)|No, I went straight through the four-year program, and MLT is a separate 2 year program.
[Could you actually work in research or does that take more studying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljqjq?context=5)|Yes, to both parts.  There are research laboratories out there which perform testing for clinical trials and stuff like that, and I would qualify for those positions.  As for researching new types of testing, I wouldn't be in charge of any projects, but I could work under someone who was.
 |Honestly?  The paycheck.
[Was it difficult to find a job and did your school help with job placement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0dko?context=5)|It was actually very easy to find a job, and in fact I had 3 offers shortly after I started looking.  My school did have a contact person for job placement, although in my case it wasn't necessary.
[I have heard that CLS is in high demand at biotech companies (such as 23 and Me\). Do you think you might go that route or do you know classmates that have done that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0dko?context=5)|It is an option for the future, but at the moment I'm happy where I am.  I don't really keep in touch with my classmates, so I don't know if any took that route.  However, I do have some interaction with biotech companies (they're the ones who supply our analyzers and reagents, after all), and almost all of their support personnel seem to be former MLS.
[Did your coursework help you with what you do in your job or has on-the-job-training contributed more toward your understanding of how to run the tests you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0dko?context=5)|You need to understand the coursework to understand the theory behind what happens when you run a test, what the sources for error are, possible contamination, stuff like that.  My program had 3 months of classes during the summer, and by the time I finished with that I already understood the majority of what I was going to be actually be doing when I got to my clinical site.
[Another nurse here. Are you the one who calls me with critical lab results? How do you handle notifying the direct care team of a crazy result (like that Pseudomonas in the CSF, woah\) in your facility? Thanks for the AMA, and thanks for your work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblki3l?context=5)|Yes, I am the one who calls you with critical results.
 |Basically, once a result verified, it's put in a queue to be called.  If it's for our own facility, we usually just call it to the nurses station or the physician's office.  If it's an outpatient, we would need to find the contact information for the responsible medical provider and give them a ring.
[What's the strangest color sample you've ever received?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblj9si?context=5)|I've seen some strange colored urine.  Brown is fairly common.  Green is a bit rarer, but I've seen that too.  Also orange, red, and pink.
[How tough is the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|I don't find it very difficult.  The education was challenging, but I also enjoyed it.  The job itself is mostly mental work, although there's a lot of time on your feet and stuff like that.
[Do you work long hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Larger labs usually do typical shift-work, and how long the shift is depends on the lab, but usually it's either 8, 10, or 12 hours.  In hospitals they need to have 24 hour lab coverage, so there are night and evening shift positions out there.
[Do you enjoy the work](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Yes.
[What's the job market like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Very good.  We're currently in high demand.
[Any advice that has to do with school or the job itself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Pay attention in all of your science classes, especially microbiology, immunology, hematology, and all of your chemistry classes.  Develop good study habits, they'll be very important once you start your actual program.
[Would you recommend it](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllluw?context=5)|Yes.
[Thanks. I really struggled in my high school science classes because I never paid attention. My last year of chem and bio finally reeled me in because it was much more hands on. I loved it. I'm glad you enjoy the job.Ii'm looking forward to the possibility of doing the same.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblmtw6?context=5)|Check with your MLS adviser to see if he/she can set up a shadowing experience or a tour of a local medical laboratory for you.  That should give you a bit of an idea what the actual work entails.
 |Also, should point out, as far as the job market goes...
 |Most programs report job placement for new graduates above 90%.
[By testing blood samples of a snake bite, can you recognize what kind of venomous snake was it ? Thank you . ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljbfu?context=5)|With the equipment at my facility, definitely not.
 |There are probably some places out there that could test for it though, but in reality it's not a practical way of figuring out how to treat it.  You're better off figuring out what snake did it some other way.
 |We can, however, do some tests for snakebites that would help.  For example, one of the more common ways that snake venom works is by interfering with coagulation, which we can test.
[What's a ""critical access hospital""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm283?context=5)|It's a designation for hospitals in rural areas.
 |Basically, it means that we provide medical coverage for a very large area that would otherwise be very delayed in getting emergency treatment.
[Can you go over the process for testing a sample? In our research lab, we use different kits, ELISAs to test for hormones, blots for different molecules, etc. I'm very curious about the clinical side of tests. Is it just centrifuge and stick it into some machine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk550?context=5)|So, I just got back from the ER with some blood.
 |I throw the chemistry and coag tubes in the centrifuge, and put the CBC tube on the analyzer.
 |The CBC comes off in a minute or two, and I look at the results to see if I need to do a manual review/differential.  If I do, I make the slide and let it start to dry, if not I release the CBC.
 |By that time, the Centrifuge is finishing, and I start the coag/chemistry tests.  When those finish, I review them to make sure that they make sense, and do any follow-up actions I might need to do (repeat testing, dilution, stuff like that).
 |We currently have one analyzer that does our general chemistry testing and another that does immunoassays, but we're working on bringing a new one online to replace both of them and consolidate our chemistry testing onto one machine.
 |All of our urine testing is done manually using test-strips and microscopic review.
 |We do have some ELISA test kits for things like influensae, rapid-streps, RSVs, mononucleosis, legionella, etc.
 |We do microbiology testing in-house as well, although we can only do basic cultures, organism ID's, and sensitivities.  Anything too unusual we'd need to send out.
[What chemistry / heme analyzers do you use? Do you do any manual differentials? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblmwkk?context=5)|We currently use a Vitros 350 for chemistry, with a miniVidas for immunoassays, but we are working on bringing a Vitros 5600 online to replace them.
 |Our hematology analyzer is a Sysmex XT.
 |Yes, we do manual differentials, but only when something flags as seriously abnormal on the analyzer.
[Hey I'm currently an MLS student and will be graduating in three semesters. What's the job market currently like? From what I've found it still looks pretty good, but the level of automation in labs today is a bit of a concern.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnmr3?context=5)|According to my university, for five years before I graduated more than 90% of graduates in the field were hired immediately after graduation.  From what I've seen, it's still very good.  Even with automation, there are a lot of things which are simply never going away.
[ what tips do you have for studying for the certification exam? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnmr3?context=5)|As for studying, the biggest thing is not to procrastinate and then try to cram.  It's a long program, and there is a lot to learn.  You need to learn it as you go along and build on what you know. 
[What is the schooling like for MLS? And as a biology major, was there any overlap in classes? I'm working at a blood bank now, and to be a tester, you need to have a degree in MLS. It's something that I may be interested in the future, and I have a degree in biology already...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljpyr?context=5)|You probably already have a good portion of the pre-reqs.  Take a look at some of your local universities and see if they have a MLS/CLS program, and maybe give them a call.
 |It's typically a 4 year degree, and has a lot of overlap with biology and other medical professions (which is the main reason I also have a biology major).
 |It's likely that you could get in on the certification program pretty quickly.
[Hey, just had to say thank you so much for working at a critical access hospital. If you're in the U.S. what do you think of the State Legislators that that refuse the new healthcare funding? I know it is a big issue for  hospitals in Missouri because they have refused it which may lead to many closing down the road. As someone who works there do you see how the special funding plays into treatment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblk7bk?context=5)|It definitely is an issue.  I know our hospital is having some issues with money as well, but we're not in any real trouble yet, and since we have the critical access designation we have a lot of people on our side, trying to keep our doors open.
[How many people are in the lab usually? Excluding the one weekend you're the only person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljbq8?context=5)|During the day, it's usually two people on the bench (lab-slang for doing our job).  The lab manager helps out if it gets busy.
 |Currently our lab only has four full-time employees and a PRN, who is actually leaving to start a teaching career.
[Do you process biopsies? I was hospitalized back in May and it took 3 biopsies of my lung mass  before I had my diagnosis. It ended up being Hodgkin's Lymphoma, any idea why it took so long? They just kept coming back 'inconclusive'. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblql3q?context=5)|In my position, no.  We never get tissue samples, you'd need to go to a larger facility for that.
 |I think there are some instances out there where a MLS would assist with their processing, however for the most part in my experience biopsies are done by pathologists.
 |The reason they take so long depends on what's actually being done.  Often they're actually making slides and looking at the cells, which can be an extensive process that's as much an art as a science.  They may also be using some genetics techniques, which tend to take significantly longer than routine lab work.
[Have you ever mixed up samples and given the results to the wrong patient?  If so, how did you deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljtz5?context=5)|Have I done it?  Not to my knowledge.  I always double-check when labeling, and when collecting specimens I'm very careful to confirm the patient's identity.  But mistakes can and do happen.
 |How we would correct it if it happened would depend on the exact circumstance.  If it's a clerical/transcription error, we'd issue a corrected report.  If it's a case of a mislabeled specimen or something like that, the ideal way would be to contact the physician as soon as possible, inform them of the error.  
[How long does a test usually take? Does it depend on the sample/what you're testing for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljoto?context=5)|Turn-around-time varies greatly depending on what test it is.
 |I can get CBC results out within five minutes of receiving the specimen.
 |Chemistry results usually take twenty minutes or so, partly because we need to centrifuge them to separate the cells from the plasma/serum first.
 |Urine tests can take anywhere from 5 minutes to twenty minutes or so.
 |Bloodbank testing (type and cross type stuff) usually takes at least 1-3 hours.
 |Almost all microbiology testing takes 1-5 days.
[I saw my school does no offer this position, so, my question to you is, what websites can I visit, or what is the process to go about becoming an MLS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnv5f?context=5)|I think the [ASCP website](http://www.ascp.org/Functional-Nav/Career-Center) would be a good place for you to start.  I think you'll probably be wanting to find a professional program.
 |And it's a certification.  You can go on for a master's (and a doctorate) in the field, but they're not required.
[if I were to obtain a master's, would that grant any increase in pay or is it just for resume building purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblohwy?context=5)|Yes.  But seriously, if you have a masters you're overqualified for some positions, where the facility is probably looking for someone with just the 4 year program for day-to-day stuff, but you'd get more attention when applying for supervisor and specialist positions.
 |Also, aside from the masters program, there are also a lot of special endorsements you can get in various fields, such as chemistry, hematology, microbiology, and blood-bank.
 |And my pay is about typical for most states, I think.  Maybe slightly above average, but I've never seen a job listing for less than $20/hour, except when they're looking for a MLS/MLT (the 4 year or 2 year job title).
 |Edit: just found this, has quite a bit of info on wages.  [Link to labmed.ascpjournals.org](http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/42/3/141.full.pdf+html)
[What is the most unexpected thing you've ever found?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljqs1?context=5)|*Streptococcus pneumoniae* in a CSF sample.  *Strep. pneumo* isn't that uncommon, but it's usually found in sputum.  That was one very, very, very sick lady.
[As someone who earned their MLT through the military (USAF\) what can you tell us about the different in the quality of your civilian MLTs and the military ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblsptm?context=5)|I actually haven't worked with a lot of MLTs, most of my coworkers/teachers have been MLS or higher.
[Is any one group given more responsibility or allowed to perform in a higher capacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblsptm?context=5)|However, I don't think there's much difference between the position in civilian vs military settings.  At least in a civilian setting, MLTs are able to do most of the same things that an MLS can, albeit with a bit more oversight required and a few exceptions.
[Can you elaborate what you mean by special endorsements? So, you mean to say that if I were to exclude the master's degree, I could do any of those specialties because of my degree biology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblp1nv?context=5)|They are basically an extra level of certification beyond just MLS that allow you to specialize in those areas.  You would still need to do the MLS certification, and they can be either aside from or in addition to the masters degree.
[What do you think overall? I'm starting a 17 month MLS program on Monday which will complete my bachelors and hopefully land me a job (assuming that I pass the ASCP exam\)... I originally was going to do pharmacy, but quickly found out that it wasn't for me. Any recommendations or life hacks you'd like to share? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbluecs?context=5)|I definitely enjoy it, and have been quite happy with my decision to enter this field since I graduated.
 |The biggest tip I have is to not put off studying.  There is a hell of a lot of information that you need to cover, the sooner you get a grasp of it the better.  By the time you go to take the exam, everything should already be review.
[Wow. S. pneumoniae in CSF? Jesus. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkjov?context=5)|Yeah.  It was a pretty serious case.
 |I found out later that she'd had some kind of facial reconstruction surgery done a few years ago where they'd done something with her nasal bones, which is probably how it got to her brain.
[How's the pay? I've heard entry level is around $40-55k.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm0ad8?context=5)|I answered this a couple of places.  I'm currently making $26/hour.  Here's a link to the ASCP's pay study.
 |[Link to labmed.ascpjournals.org](http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/42/3/141.full.pdf)
[Do you do urine drug tests? If so, do you use dipsticks, immunoassay, or MS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblm3sb?context=5)|For medical purposes, we are currently using an Elisa kit, which only gives negative/non-negative results.  Once our new chemistry analyzer is online, I believe we're going to be using that for drug screens.
 |We also do collections for occupational testing, but we're not equipped to test those.
[I actually want to major in Biology and Medical Laboratory Science as well, do you have any kind of tips that would help me out?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkaj6?context=5)|Develop good study habits.  In my university, the only people who dropped out of the program were those who didn't put the time in.
 |Also, the only reason I have the biology major is because I came across MLS late and already had all the credits I needed for it.  I don't currently get any professional advantage for it (although that could change in the future), so if you're just looking to work in a lab I'd recommend evaluating whether you need to put forth the extra effort/money.
[How hard was the ASCP exam? How much preparation did it take? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbn6q87?context=5)|I actually thought that the final at the end of my program was more difficult than the ASCP certification exam.
 |Of course, neither of them were exactly easy.  If I hadn't spent an entire year learning the material, I would have a much more difficult time.
[Don't you just hate that massage therapists usurped the 'MT' (Medical Technologist\) designation forcing us to move to 'MLS'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblp58g?context=5)|Honestly, I kind of prefer Medical laboratory Scientist to Medical Technologist.  It just sounds sexier.
[What's the nastiest/scariest bacteria you have cultured?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblrifh?context=5)|Probably the antibiotic resistant ones.  I've seen quite a bit of MRSA, and a little bit of ESBL *E. coli*.
[What is the most shocking discovery you ever made on a patient?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbmxwa8?context=5)|Well, there was the *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in a woman's CSF that I mentioned elsewhere.
 |We also once diagnosed a guy with malaria on a routine CBC.  Which isn't really abnormal by itself, since that's often how it is diagnosed; malaria is just pretty uncommon in the US.  He had apparently just gotten back from India.
 |Once had a lipase that I had to dilute 1:20 to get it to work because it was so high above the analyzer's range.  I think it was like 44,000 U/L.  A normal lipase is 0-120ish U/L.
[What kind of weird or fucked up ebola type viruses have you found in people's bodily fluids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbljera?context=5)|None.
 |Our lab can only test for a handful of common viruses (the flu, Mono, RSV, and a couple others).  If the physician suspected something exotic like that, we would need to send the sample to a reference lab.  But in all likelihood, we would be transferring the patient to a larger facility anyway, so it wouldn't matter.
 |As for bacteria, I've seen *Pseudomonas aeruginos* in blood, and *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in CSF.
[That's odd. Isn't *P. aeruginosa* usually in the lungs and *S. pneumoniae* found in the throat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblnj0y?context=5)|*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is actually a pretty hardy pathogen and can cause a variety of infections.
 |*S. pneumoniae* is usually a respiratory pathogen.
[Have you ever thought you made a mistake with a sample that you think might have compromised the test results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblphm8?context=5)|If I thought the results were compromised, I wouldn't release them until I was confident that they were accurate.
 |I've had to reject quite a few specimens, including some that I collected myself, for a variety of reasons, including results that don't make sense.
 |Typically I would have it recollected, if at all possible. 
[On average how many hours a week do you work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbll963?context=5)|I do 3 twelve hour shifts per week, plus 1-3 nights on call.  When I'm on call, I usually get called in between zero to three times, usually less than an hour.  So usually, it's around 40 hours or so, counting call-back.
[How's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbll1fg?context=5)|Currently, one year out of school, I'm making just over $26 an hour.  I get $1.5 dollars per hour for being on call, and any time I get called back in after hours it's automatically time and a half.
[I'm almost done graduating with a biology degree and I'm thinking about going for an accelerated certificate program (~1yr\) in MLS.

The only part facilities are actually interested in is the professional certification.  Once you're qualified to take the test, you can usually find a position relatively easily.
[Would you recommend this major for a pre med student?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkf2b?context=5)|That depends on whether you want to go to med-school immediately after college, or work for a few years.
 |Going to med-school after working in a lab for a few years is a great career path.
[Not bad.must enjoy the long weekends.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllhlg?context=5)|It is kind of nice, but the long shifts can get a little exhausting.  Especially if I do one shift, then go on call and get called in multiple times in the middle of the night, and then have to do another shift in the morning.
[Did your degree include lab placement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbm3j32?context=5)|Not completely sure what you're asking.

If you buckle-down and work your ass off, you could probably do it in a little less time.
[Pretty good..I got a CMB major.how would one attain the certificate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cbllie5?context=5)|You'd need to go through the professional program.  The one I went through was 3 months of classes and then a 9-month internship.  The structure varies a bit, but it's usually a 1 year program.
 |There are also a few other options for qualifying for the exam.
 |Check out your university and see if they have a MLS program, if they do they can walk you through what you need to do.  You should also check out the [ASCP website.](http://www.ascp.org/functional-nav/career-center)

[Interesting. Are you guys capable of testing for mycobacteria? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblkrig?context=5)|Nope, those would be sent out.

That's about the worst thing we can possibly do.  Fortunately we caught it and no erroneous results went out.
[Probably over but here is my question, and any lab workers could post just to see: What state do you work in and how much do you make per hour? :\)  I work in ohio, I make 19.12/hr as and MLT (ASCP\) with 3 years experience...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k5c25/iama_medical_laboratory_scientist_mls_working_at/cblteqt?context=5)|I answered this already, but I make a little over $26/hr.

[No prior college, only vocational school. It would probably take a really long time since I work full time and am a full time mommy also.

It's a 2 year program instead of a 4 year program.  The pay isn't as good and you're more limited in your options, but it's still a very good job and a nice step up from a phlebotomist.  It would also allow you to continue to go on for MLS later on.

 |But most of the time, if we're called in after-hours, its for an ER, and the nurse will have drawn blood when they started an IV.  So we don't have to collect anything unless they're not doing an IV, or they couldn't get blood when they did.

Dear Mr. XXX,

it has come to my attention that the XXX International website (since XXX International’s website…) is written in English and since it is an international company (anyway), I decided to write this application in English. 

For this reason, I would especially like to (apply for the apprenticeship at XXX …) do the apprenticeship at XXX International, because it would be exciting and challenging (for me) to work for an internationally operating company at which I can use and improve my (already fluent) English skills.

The most appealing aspect of this job profile for me, are the opportunity to work and correspond with customers and people from different countries, as well as the (constantly) perpetually challenging duty (assignment) of organizing and planning shipping logistics.

During my internship at XXX as a Management Assistant for Insurance and Finance
I have already advised customers, learned and practiced office management and also gained experience in solving specific customer problems as a team.
   
While attending grammar school, focused on economics (Wirtschaftsgymnasium), I also got to study Economics, Business Economics (VWL, BWL), Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik) and Business English. I am also familiar with the Just-In-Time principle. 
Since these subjects appealed to me a lot, I decided to look for a job based on these topics.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further details about me and my education with you personally.


Sincerely,

1k49gg,404,2013-08-10,They didn’t know that it was just a show.,urban_teller,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k49gg/they_didnt_know_that_it_was_just_a_show/,"Of course they had volunteered. Low budget; volunteers instead of actors. It’s cheaper that way and, if you’re lucky, more interesting.

That’s the core of reality TV.

You will have seen the shows; weird experiments and challenges or just a group locked inside a bungalow and manipulated to hate and attack and love each other.

Now, not all shows make it to your TV screens. Some because they are too boring. Some because the test audiences turn their thumbs down. And some because of accidents.

Accidents, that’s what you could call it.

Of course, they all volunteered and they all volunteered all liability away. Those blanko contracts are strong; even with such unusual cases. The director had trouble and we a bit too - but our studio got off with just a bit of paper money to keep things quiet.

TV works in very simple ways. With ratings and advertisers in your back there is no room for creativity. Creativity dies a slow and dry death the higher you climb the ladder. I saw quite a few that lost their creativity first, then their honor, then their soul.

That thing that actresses sleep with directors - well, think not of the director as that evil or the actress as a slut. It’s a simple business transaction. The director lost his soul; there is nothing left in his life and he has long learned that the power he seems to hold is in reality just a sham and illusion; the power to do what you are told. He does it to own at least some power; to exert what he can and feel like a man again.

The actress, of course, just wants her dream fulfilled. She sells her soul because she thinks her life’s dream will be fulfilled. Then she finds that selling your soul once is not enough. That most shows tanks before they are ever seen and that even when they are seen they will likely will tank soon after. It’s the plot. The way it goes. There are exceptions, of course, actresses and actors - oh, don’t ask me what *they* have to do to get a role - that keep their morality and standing and some of them even succeed. But for far too many the pleasure of the film becomes a trap for their souls and bodies; to consume them until they are too exhausted or too ugly to be consumed any further.

There are too many stories from inside. Too many shoe-licking and sensitive-part-massaging stories to be told.

With those soulless creatures wandering the studios reality TV often seems like a relief. Characters so desperate to be famous that they lose all their shame and soul for free. Volunteers to be sacrificed to the viewers’ voyeurism.

Now, but there are different volunteers. Those that know and those that don’t.

Some know what show they are in. They go to castings and make it through the rounds until they are herded into a room where they can be prostituted to the audience.

But the more interesting ones are those that don’t know. They volunteer. They fill out questionnaires, are quickly taped to show their bodies and voices and then they sign a document that says they are ready for *everything*.

Times were different back then, TV was still big and invading all our minds. Still, it’s not even ten years ago. It doesn’t work much different now. It probably could still happen today. I’m wondering whether we are the only ones that did such a thing.

Ready for everything the studio chooses for them. They resign their fate; they give their soul for free and don’t even know in what way it will be abused.

Now, we got 10 of those. Five men and five women. All good looking, of course, nobody wants to see the ugly reality on TV. Some stupid, some smart. All loud and opinionated, as it should be, but two of them shy for good measure.

As said there is no creativity. Creativity has no place in the film and show business. It’s all about safety and sure ratings and sure ad revenue.

So we took a concept - I’m sure you’ll know which - and tweaked it a bit.

They are locked not in a house, but a room instead.

Not so outrageous, is it? That’s what the studio bosses thought too. So we spiced it up a little.

They didn’t know that it was just a show.

We thought about leading them into the room; telling them that there would be a casting or free viewing or one of the other things that attention-seekers crave for. Then someone, and I don’t remember who but I hope it wasn’t me, had the glorious idea.

“What if,” that person said. “We pretend to abduct them?”

Now, really, I hope that wasn’t me.

Their relatives were in on it, of course. That’s why we later had to pay a lot.

One snatched from her car.

Another on his way home from work.

A third in the shopping mall bathroom.

The fourth on his forest jog.

The fifth, the youngest one, pulled into a car on her way home from school.

The sixth, the shy accountant, taken as a fake hostage in a fake police shootout.

The seventh pulled under water and chloroformed on her beach holidays.

For the eighth, a father of two, we took his sons and told him to come to get them back. That hacked off little boy’s hand was surely well done. Never heard a man scream like that.

The ninth taken from her bedroom at night. We made sure to knock her out. Then to tie her up well. Then to wait for her to wake. Oh, how she squeamed on the way to the car.

The tenth, of course, our favorite. On his way to class, followed by four men. He noticed them but ran too slow. He tried to fight back when they cuffed and gagged him. When they pulled his trousers down he only cried. Of course, nothing was really inside him. But they were convincing, I have to say that.

A pleasure, all of them in the same room. Some cried and some screamed. Mostly they fought against each other.

They never so much as thought of the contract they had signed. They never so much as noticed the cameras above.

It was good to watch them try and scale the walls. There was a fist fight early on, but they got calmer soon after.

“We have to work together,” said one of them.

They tried to build a pyramid but failed every time. Too weak, even the men, and the walls too high.

The bathroom was meant to be a good joke. Something practical, to keep things fresh. When the first man went we let him in and out just fine. But when the first woman went, the young thing, well, let’s say she was surprised that the walls came down and that all was dark around her.

We saw her, of course, with the right camera you can see enough. It was sure to be a good show with the girl scratching her fingers open on the bare metal wall.

The others were not so helpful as expected. Without thought they banged against the metal wall and tried to ram it to open.

Poor thing. Admittedly, we too were at fault. We should have known that the noise would be reflected inside the small room; that the one inside would hear too much and too loud.

Still, legally all fine. They signed it. No problem there and fun enough for us.

Now, it wasn’t really planned that way with her promise. She promised she would take her clothes off if she was let out.

We found that funny enough and opened the wall. We didn’t really expect her to follow through. But she did.

Those eyes. If I could describe those greedy eyes in full tones I would, but they cannot be described.

You would think the men would have pity - oh, but no. Some showed shame and pretended to look away, but they all stared. The women, too, they all stared. Two of them were even laughing among themselves, giggling at the young thing’s misfortune.

We thought about ending it there, or about a bit more instruction. But it can all be censored, after all, and as the slogan goes - sex sells. Too late anyway. She waived those rights, so all was good. Still I’m happy that those tapes were never seen by the police.

They didn’t know that it was just a show.

It got a bit worse from then on. We had it planned for two weeks. Food thrown in from above - bread at first, then insects. Hungry people eat many things. Nothing bad about that anyway - some are even quite tasty. Grilled of course, *I* never ate them raw.

Things were going too fast for our taste. So we tightened the plan a bit and skipped the bread.

Now, the other thing we had not planned was their fear. It seems none of them wanted to use the toilet anymore; particularly not after the young thing put her underwear back on and we made the door close and open two times; just for good measure. She took it off again, if you are wondering.

The mess was pretty quick. First they had a corner where they did it and the others looked away. But the floor was a bit too even for that purpose. The liquids spread until they were all huddled on just one side.

Probably we should have stopped it then. But the lawyers said it was okay. The girl was legal age - we checked twice - and would be well payed to stop any complaints. The others, of course, were all still fine, except for the mess on the floor.

But what are feet in a bit of feces? Not so bad in the end. Everybody has a toilet leak once or twice in their life.

Water, just so you know, was okay. They had their water through a small hole in a wall. Big enough for a mouth to go in and drink; but the drainage too small for anything to be pushed inside.

That bug thing did not work out so great as we thought. They landed on the ground and quickly huddled deep in the, well, mud. Not such a good choice for food. The ten were complaining of hunger a lot.

We dropped a few other items; just to see what they would do. Paper airplanes were good fun but didn’t live long. Then balloons worked quite well. There were a few pieces of wooden and special matches made without heads. They had a few hours of fun trying to get those to make a fire. Who knows what they would have done with a fire. 

I want to be honest here, after all this is all about honesty. We were excited when the first man took a bite of his own, well, product.

“Not as horrible as I thought.”

We thought that would be a good episode title.

Our accountant grew bolder that day. He was the one to say “I can’t stand it” and enter the toilet again.

It was meant as a joke. You have to believe that. We didn’t mean to truly hurt him. Just to lower the wall so he would be caught too and the girl not alone.

Really, it was his fault that he kept his hand outside; that he thought that his hand would stop the door.

That was one loud cracking sound and one loud scream.

We wanted to get him out; we really did. It was just not that easy. When we lowered the rope one of the other men climbed on it. We had to swing him against the wall until he fell back down; right in the black and yellow mud and on the stack of bugs.

There was not really a way to open it all up; to calm them down and continue the show. There were not even doors down there; the only way would be to pull them up.

It was just going to be a day anyway. We had a doctor tell us it would be okay; that it could all be healed. Not that it mattered to us. We knew the money would be good enough for him to stay quiet. Money and a false fame; that’s all that people need and want.

We really wanted to make it easier. I wouldn’t say it was my idea but I would lie if I said that I didn’t have at least some contribution to it.

I swear with all my soul that the paper said “Only one more day” when we threw it into the room and went to lunch after that.

We expected a frenzy - excitement and hope and maybe even celebration.

Sure, it fell in the mud, but they must have ripped it somehow. Ripped it in half.

“Only one,” that’s what they read.

They took it a bit different from what we thought.

It was the father of two. I think that’s what made it; he had kids and didn’t want to risk a thing.

He got his hands on one of pieces of wood; a long one.

We were at lunch. There were only two interns in the room and not the smartest ones at that. By the time they called us it was all a bit too late.

He was quick; you have to leave him that. He started thrashing on another man’s head and within just a moment that man was with his face in the mud; the legs twitching but the arms calm.

Before the father made another move another man pushed him to the ground. He hit the man’s back until there was blood, but the others managed to hold him down and wrest the piece of wood from his hand and smash it on his head instead.

But that man, the one that now had the piece of wood, he too understood.

He must have done some sort of martial arts. He got the accountant pretty quick and the other man right in the bathroom. The interns should have locked him in there, who knows why they didn’t know how to close that door.

He went for the women next. They were huddled together at the other end, right where the mud was. But the moment he came they ran to the sides and only one slipped and had his foot on her head until she stopped moving. The other women didn’t try to help.

They found more pieces of wood though and assembled on the other side. When the man came running the young thing threw her stick at him and must have got an eye because he screamed and slipped and a moment later the women had their clubs on his face. He pulled one of them down and choked her, but the others made sure that he stopped moving soon after.

That must have been the time when the interns found us; not ten minutes after the paper was dropped inside.

I remember how the girl was screaming and crying and it took us a minute to calm her down enough that she could tell us to quickly go back.

That minute would maybe have saved one of them. Not sure about that.

When the man stopped moving the women were the quick ones. One said “Stop! Stop!” and the young thing stopped but the third one standing was quick to hit the club on the choked woman’s face - just to make sure.

The young thing stumbled backwards and fell over the father of two and with her ass in the mud. The two other women both got their clubs and went one after the other around the place while the young thing pretended to be out cold.

While running one got the other’s hair and they both fell and one club hit a face and the other a head from the side. They both fell and struggled and the clubs fell out of their hands. There were fingers in eyes. Once you’ve heard those screams, even just from tape, believe me, you don’t forget them again.

One still had an eye and was on her knees when she’d choked the other.

That’s when the young thing saw her chance.

“Now or never,” that’s what she must have thought.

A piece of wood on the woman’s head and she too was out on the floor. Funny to learn later that she wasn’t dead, really, she drowned instead from the brown liquid on the floor or maybe her own blood.

We got the young thing out. Got her a towel and the camera. The “You’re on television” moment didn’t go as well as we had planned it the weeks before.

Was easy to keep the girl quiet. She’d done things and she knew it.

The bodies on a boat and the boat sent out and sank. Told the coast guard a wrong location and they never even found the wreck.

We made a trailer and pilot and all. Thought to at least get some of the cost back. The studio bosses stopped us. Better sunk cost then the risk to get any news about it out. It was just a room after all; we could have said it all happened on a boat. But the bosses thought it could get too much trouble even with the last few minutes left out.

Those tapes were all meant to be destroyed. Who knows whether that was done. I sure as hell wouldn’t have. Just hope no one finds it before I’m dead.

It’s funny, I saw that room once again. In a martial arts movie. Guess they only cleaned it up and didn’t even bother to take it apart.

We, the crew, got out of the mess. We pretended to be nice little sheep that didn’t know a thing about the boat being dangerous. That’s the wonder of a good lawyer.

The director was less lucky. Had a court case scheduled but jumped his bail and drowned on the way to Cuba. Might have been less of an accident.

The girl, well, that’s the only one I’m really sad about.

I was told she kept talking about bugs nibbling on the bodies while she was waiting to be saved. Lost half her weight. Had nightmares and such things. Cut her wrists once and failed.

They drugged her pretty bad in that institution.

Supposedly she never talked about it. Funny actually. They said she got better with the drugs and allowed her out for half a day. She went straight to a supermarket and that time she did the cuts deep enough.

And all that because they didn’t know that it was just a show."
1k86bb,1,2013-08-12,[Troubleshooting] Glitches/Freeze while playing games with my brand new PC with gtx 770.,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1k86bb/troubleshooting_glitchesfreeze_while_playing/,"I built my brand new PC last week and as you understand I was (and still am) very excited to have so much more speed available to me. But one thing bothers me. When playing games there are some small glitches/freeze. It is not really big, but annoying enough to be noticeable. My first thought was that maybe I played the games with the specs too high. That did not make a difference. I tried turning of v-sync in the games, also no difference. I played Crysis 2 (Ultra and High settings), Battlefield 2 Bad Company, Total War Shogun 2 and Company of Heroes (2006 version). All the games had it more or less but Crysis 2 was the worst one. I played them all on 2560x1440 resolution.

Here are my specs

* Asus Z87-DELUXE - Moederbord - ATX - LGA1150 Socket - Z87
* MSI GTX770 Lightning - graphics card - GeForce GTX 770 - 2 GB GDDR5 - PCI Express 3.0 x16
* Be quiet! Pure Power BQT L8-CM-630W - ATX12V 2.31/ EPS12V 2.92 - 80 PLUS 
* Seagate Barracuda ST2000DM001 - Vaste schijf - 2 TB - intern - 3.5"" - SATA-600 - 7200 tpm 
* Fractal Design Define R4
* Corsair Vengeance Pro Series - Memory- 16 GB : 2 x 8 GB - DIMM 240-pins - DDR3 - 1600 MHz
* Samsung 840 Pro Series MZ-7PD128 - Solid state drive - 128 GB - intern - 2.5"" - SATA-600
* Intel Core i7 4770K / 3.5 GHz - 8 MB cache - LGA1150 Socket 
* Be quiet! Dark Rock Advanced C1 CPU cooler
* Dell UltraSharp U2713HM - LED-monitor - 27'' - 2560 x 1440
* Windows 8 pro, 64bit

Here are a few logfiles, [a gif](http://i.imgur.com/mY1jbuq.gif), I made with MSI afterburner. You can see that there is a significant drop in power, GPU usage and framerate.

My first thought was that maybe my PSU not powerful enough. I made several calculations on googled websites and came to about 500watt when buying my new pc. But now with the glitches I digged a little deeper. The ASUS PSU calculator recommends 700watt and The spec for the MSI GTX770 Lightning that I have recommend a 600 watt, 12v 42A, two 8-pin PCi Express power.

On my Be Quiet 630watt PSU box is stated that the combined output of the 12v1 and the 12v2 is 47A. It also states that the GPU has two independent 12v rails. Actually when I read that I came to the conclusion that I had put only one PCIe power cable (a rail?) in my GTX770 instead of two. The PCIe power cable itself has three plugs, one for the PSU, the other two I just put in the Graphics Card. So I plugged in the extra powercable (the second rail?) in the GPU and the PSU. I was relieved I had found it...but no. It did not make any difference, it was maybe even worse.

Ok long story but no solutions yet. I am still thinking PSU but even in old games with low load it happens (but it is more rare). My second thought is Drivers, yes the good old drivers. I installed the latest drivers 320.49. My third thought is faulty graphics cards. But to be honest I just don't know. And before I buy a new PSU or send back my graphics card, I am looking for opinions. 

So do you guys have any recommendations or maybe even a solution? Thx in advance."

Questions|Answers

[What does the University of Rochester's motto, Meliora, mean to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7nrj?context=5)|You can't trick me into giving away the best answers for our supplemental application. 
[Rephrasing- How does what you do in your job reflect the idea of becoming ever better? What are things you have pushed for/done to achieve this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8flh?context=5)|Wow--I live Meliora nonstop. I truly believe incremental positive change is the best way forward in life. You get breakthroughs and they're amazing, but ""planning"" for them seems foolish. So we've grown in purposeful ways during my entire ten years here (both enrollment and admissions activity). 
[Although U of R has very high academic prestige, it is not that well known by people. How do U of R students rank in employ-ability and how well do employers think of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7u1w?context=5)|I've never known a Rochester student who couldn't get a job. I'm happier to say most of them have enough confidence to look for and ultimately get really good jobs--the kind they like doing rather than just those that pay the bills. Rochester isn't a household name but (as it turns out) most colleges aren't. Our reputation has grown over 10 years mostly through word-of-mouth, which is sustainable, rather than one-time media buys.
[How do you see the University expanding in the future? (e.g. internationally, becoming more selective, opening up more residence halls across the river, etc.\)  What the hell happened this past year? Were the expected yields miscalculated or something? (for reference, some nontraditional students are gonna have to live in upperclassmen housing because there aren't enough spots in freshman housing\)  Does the University **plan** to increase class sizes, and is there a plan to make the university more selective by slightly diminishing class sizes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7wlu?context=5)|1) pretty much yes. Why should a student who lives &lt;10 miles away get a pass on showing that they've done their homework about what Rochester really does and doesn't offer them? 2) more international seems likely. We're way out in front of peers and it has been positive all the way. More selectivity also seems a given, since that has grown each year. More residence halls across the river--we're coming to the end of a period of rapid enrollment growth, so probably not. We'll see more upperclassmen searching for private housing on the other side of the river, however.
 |3) This year we had a surge in applications from very-well-qualified applicants. History would have told us that our yield was going to decrease a lot. It didn't. The phenomenon was particularly striking with international students, where average test scores were up more than 100 points for admitted. We believed they'd choose elsewhere (they tend to be more sensitive to rankings) but they're coming to Rochester.  My apologies to upperclassmen who were displaced, although Rochester's percentage of upperclassmen housed on campus remains one of the highest you'll see at any university.
[In your 28 years has any one application (or a few\) stood out from the others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7ow6?context=5)|One of my favorite applicants of all time is now my regional director in New York City. He distinguished himself as an inventive leader on paper, including staging a protest walkout at his public school in Portland. When we met for his interview he talked about it with a sense of humor. Challenging the status quo and demonstrating humor both go a long way with me.
[How will Rochester market itself over the next 10 years and how will this affect our global impact? Also, are there any plans (other than College Town of course\) that will make UR more attractive for prospective students against our peers (Emory, UChicago, Northwestern, Brown, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7tes?context=5)|Rochester has three things going for it that have contributed to 40% growth in enrollment over the last 7 years--1) commitment to growing new programs, facilities and faculty; 2) unique curricular philosophy; 3) that unusual combination of huge research with still-small undergraduate population, so most/best teaching is actually coaching. We're ahead of most peers. We stack up well against almost anybody and we've made inroads head-to-head against several peers per the numbers, including all four of the schools you're listing.
[UR Class of 2002 alum here.  Just wondering if anyone has actually been trapped inside Dean Burgett's fiery furnace?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7q0x?context=5)|At last count 37 students were in there. In winter months people go searching for it.
[How does the university help aspiring undergraduates who want to do research ?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8gbb?context=5)|The door is open to anyone who's willing to hustle and learn, and 90% of Rochester undergraduates do it. We give one grant program for some entering students, and another for students once they're here. 
[What are your requirements inside and outside of academics (such as charity work\) for admissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7zx9?context=5)|""Requirements"" is kind of a dirty word at Rochester. Our aim is to support you in requiring a lot of yourself, whatever form that might take. Doesn't bother me at all to admit a student who thinks charity work is completely uninteresting, as long as s/he articulates well something s/he does instead.
[1\)Do you have any plans about going to China for interviewing? 2\)Can I select both ED and GEAR at the same time? 3\)Do I need to pay extra tuition fees for extra courses? 4\)Where can I find stuffs about internship on the website, and could you give me some details about OPT and CPT in Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Science? 5\)When can I join internship? Are there any limits for international students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm807x?context=5)|I just got back from China. We'll be there again several times each year. 2) yes as long as you know your ED status doesn't guarantee a 'yes' for GEAR. 3) NO--a great feature of Rochester is you can overload to the limit of your ability with not extra charges 4) I'll have to refer you to the websites for now, but AMLater deanafa@rochester.edu if you want. 5) internships can start as soon as you're able to seek and find one you like. No limits for international.
[Is next year's admissions going to be EVEN more selective after you guys getting your two largest classes ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7o70?context=5)|It may have to be a *lot* more selective next year. The housing staff certainly hope so.
[What makes you think you have what it takes at Reddit University? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7kb4?context=5)|I'm new here but I'd say I have good grades and scores and a fantastic resume.
[Since there is no major in civil engineering, what options does a student interested in that field have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm80lp?context=5)|Some students have designed their own engineering major. The closest established major (and it's very interesting) is Archaeology, Technology and the History of Structures. Enough math and physics to advance you in your civil engineering career, plus you get to spend a summer in Italy studying the foundations of 2,000 years of Western building.
[What do you look for most in an applicant , when considering him/her for a merit scholarship ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7v77?context=5)|I published a blog about this with a lot of detail that I intend to update. As it turns out all kinds of things mattered in scholarship decisions, since (like admission decisions) we make them one at a time. Biggest single impactful factor was communicating with the admissions and financial aid offices.
[Yes, I read your 4 parts blogs .. It has really nice insights on Rochester's approach to admissions ..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8agb?context=5)|Glad you liked it. Update soon now that I've stopped so much summer travel. 
[What do you really look for in application essays? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7xi1?context=5)|Personal, authentic voice. Mechanics (spelling, sentence structure etc.) can't be so bad that they get in the way, but I'm trying to read an essay to see if it feels like I'm talking to and listening to a real person. The only way to get there is to give yourself time (as in weeks/months) to return to it several times and do multiple rewrites. 
[Ever had anybody contact you directly to try to get admitted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8f3j?context=5)|LOL all the time. Doesn't work the way they think it does. It works if I learn things about them that are very appealing. 
[Is it a good idea to talk about how you have in internship at the university, helped some of the clubs at the university at events, kind of joined one of the clubs at the university even though you don't go to the university, etc in your admissions essay? Would that help/hurt/no affect on the chances of getting in?  I know this is only looking at academics and not any other part of the applicant but my school is on trimesters and I had to switch from calculus BC to calculus AB because I couldn't pass any of my tests. The grading system is 90% tests and 10% homework+other stuff for calculus. Almost all other classes are 80% tests and 20% homework and I have all A's other than 1-3 B's every year. *In your opinion, how badly would that affect my chances of getting into one of the bigger public universities in my state (the universities that admit ~16k people every year from a pool of ~40k and has no interview process\)?* ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm85vs?context=5)|Your admissions essay is a slice of stuff we can't get any other way. Don't spend too much time in it writing about things that you can just as easily put on your activities list, like clubs and summer experiences.
 |Your other question is too complicated for here and my limited time. Ask me again at deanafa@rochester.edu if you like. 
[How does your process of selecting Early Admission applicants differ from that of Regular Decision applicants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm826a?context=5)|Because Early Decision is a commitment from students, parents, and counselors, these applicants are more likely to gain admission on average.
[Are there any creative Youtube videos in the making from Rochester Admissions that we should keep our eyes peeled for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm80cl?context=5)|Our new videographer has just started. Look for good stuff from him soon.
[PS: How did you choose your dogs' names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm80cl?context=5)|""Stella!"" is my Marlon Brando shout for a full-of-life, runaway dog. The whole neighborhood helps her come back to me. Tuck looks like Friar Tuck, sort of. Fat, with a cross on his face.
[Is the essay really the most important part of an application or can someone be admitted because of outstanding test scores and GPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7uws?context=5)|It's easier to power through weak test scores in particular than a weak essay. In terms of impact on your chances, I'd say GPA and test scores have a (soft) floor, but most applicants face a hard and fast ceiling (we have many who are perfect, and turn many of those down), while essays have a 'higher' floor (it possible to write your way out of admission), and almost no ceiling. 
[What separates Rochester's engineering from other school's engineering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8fml?context=5)|Research--direct, hands-on, side-by-side with faculty. Lots of it. 
[Hello, Mr. Burdick. Can you tell me anything about the diversity of UR? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7w93?context=5)|Diversity (cognitive) has been my number-one priority for my ten years here. I'm pleased and it's fun every day to see how much diversity has grown on campus, and I mean all kinds, including racial/ethnic/national. Basically I take seriously the idea that no two Rochester students should think alike, and that's the way we read apps. For the objective data: this fall's freshman class is 'majority-minority,' unheard of among peer-private schools. We have a very high share of low-income students and all of that perspective, unlike many peer schools recently criticized in the New York Times. We have 71 nations in the freshman class, and our in-state percentage is lower than some of the Ivy League schools. Etc.
[Thank you very much for responding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8hwj?context=5)|My pleasure thanks for the question.
[Hello thank you for doing this, I am entering my senior year of high school this year. I have taken many AP and honors classes and am heavily involved in student activities and sports. I am a white middle class male. How does someone like me appear diverse on an application?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm84uu?context=5)|Collegebound, it's all about how you think. I guarantee you that 17 years of lived experiences in your environment, and the effects those experiences have generated in your brain, have given you some perspectives no other white middle class male has. Find them and show them to us. 
[UR Class of 2012 graduate here. Living in New York City now. How feasible is it for younger graduates to get involved with doing interviews for the school or speaking at college fairs on behalf of the University?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm88lb?context=5)|We are eager to put students like you to work, and we do a LOT of work in NYC. We will be hosting our 7th annual breakfast for NYC area counselors in cooperation with Emory, Carnegie-Mellon and...Brandeis? Tufts? (one of those) this fall, and I'd like to stack the tables with local impressive young alumni. Contact our office (Beth Luke) for more information on getting involved. 
[How do admissions work for masters programs that are unrelated to an applicant's undergraduate major?  I'm curious about the computer science masters program at U of R, but my undergraduate degree is in biotechnology and my masters is in microbiology.  I'd like to earn a degree in computer science so I'm better equipped to analyze large data sets that come from genomics studies.  I'm assuming I'll need to fulfill some required coursework before I can enter the program.  Do I need to apply and be accepted into the undergraduate computer science program and then switch to the master's program if I'm accepted?  How does taking the prerequisites for a graduate program work if I'd like to take them at University of Rochester?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm88r4?context=5)|You should apply directly to the master's program. CS is looking for all kinds of people, including at least some in each class who come from different backgrounds...as long as they can rely on your basic competence through some undergraduate coursework. 
[About the special programs at UR like the ' Take Five ' , 'Travel grants' ..are international students eligible for these programs ?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7xi3?context=5)|Yes, absolutely. We flew students here from Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Norway, Beijing, Mumbai last year (more that's just off the top of my head). Take Five is possible for anyone with a great project idea.
[Does UR take in person interviews for international students?  And , when would the dates be ready for international interviews ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7osz?context=5)|We love interviews and we spend a lot of time all over the world doing them. Schedule is up or nearly so...matter of days if not available yet. Check again by the end of the week.
[What is one thing that really stands out to you on an undergraduate application? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7r9z?context=5)|I'm looking for something individual, unique, one-of-a-kind. That can include being a genuine person who hasn't been corrupted by the college-admission-industrial-complex.
[Do you always check reddit comments here? I mean, if I have some questons in the future how could I connect with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8ebh?context=5)|Deanafa@rochester.edu.
[Hello! Thank you for doing this. So as a high school student who is looking at Rochester as a possible college and as one who has an interview scheduled there, could you explain briefly how an interview at Rochester might play out? And how much weight it has in the overall decision of acceptance, if any at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm87fj?context=5)|Interview is the ""third dimension."" If your application is not strong without it, it's not going to make you suddenly great. If your application is very strong without it, you're only going to hurt yourself a bit with a bad interview. Most interviews are very good and I'd say 85% of them enhance an applicant's chances for admission. 
[When deciding to accept or reject an applicant, do you tend to discriminate by their intended major?  *Well, that's enough English majors for me today! *Toss!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7y3i?context=5)|We don't discriminate on intended major, except if we have to guess that a student wouldn't succeed (i.e. a potential engineering major with a noticeable deficit in math preparation and achievements). 
[Can I send my SAT reasoning or subject test scores after November 1st , if I apply under ED ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7rhs?context=5)|Yes if they arrive any time before December 6th or so you're golden.
[How easy is it to double major across schools?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7xq2?context=5)|It's so easy that I think everyone should do it. For one thing every school except Eastman/music is under the same admissions program, and we're not limiting our admission based on your academic goals. For another we don't require any general education courses (years sometimes elsewhere) so fitting in that totally different second major is simpler here. 
[How many 'recommendations letters'  are ideal to sent ?  2 from teachers and 1 from a mentor will do ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm88r5?context=5)|3 usually works out well. 2 and 4 are typically ok. 1 is too few and 5+ generally is too many. 
[What does a typical business student's 4 years look like? Do they begin taking business courses their freshman year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8d76?context=5)|They certainly can. There are some pre-requisites in calculus and economics, and sometimes the preferred accounting, etc. class might be full of upperclassmen, but there's no deliberate prohibition and each year several freshmen will take business courses. 
[As one of the nation's leading safety schools, what is your position on student safety?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm7oen?context=5)|I'm in favor of it.
[When an individual is accepted to U of R, are they accepted to all of its schools and colleges?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm8d0y?context=5)|All same admission policy except Eastman performance (music) degree programs. There the audition is paramount. 
[Hi, nice to chat with you. I am a student from China. As we all know, there is an increasing tendency for Chinese students to study in America and the competition is really intense. many of Chinese students  have SAT 2200+ and TOEFL 105+. I know grades don't mean anything. So I just wonder.  1\what kind of attitudes and strategy do you hold towards international students and     which kind of undergraduates are you looking for (I mean, what kind of personality or traits\).  2\As for the schools, I would like to know what the spirits of U Rochester,     what are the way or idea of teaching, why it is different from other universities,     what the influences or traits do the college imparts to the students,    what contributions and inspirations can we gain and make inside and outside the college.  3\and after all, why do you choose to work in U Rochester for so long,   What does the college attracts you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1k7q6l/i_am_jon_burdick_the_dean_of_admissions_at_the/cbm81mv?context=5)|I just returned from 10 cities/12 days in China. The rules aren't different. We look for individual personalities, interests, and goals. Every Chinese student is different here (too). 2) Rochester starts with this motto ""Excellence requires freedom."" Meaning if a student isn't motivated to learn, nothing else matters (it has a particular resonance vis-a-vis the Chinese national secondary curriculum). 3) I love the students who come here and the young alumni they turn into. They're smart, funny, and contrarian--all the things I admire in people.

So I have been doing an internship this summer at a local software development company. I'm going into my junior year this fall. They have asked me to stay on and work part-time through the rest of school. For the internship they were paying me $15 an hour and my pay rate has stayed the same now that I will be a part-time employee.


My question is, should I have asked for more? Or is keeping the same rate a good thing? At this point, I am doing the work of a full-time developer that they would hire normally, but getting paid probably half what they would pay a normal developer. On one hand, I know i am still in school and this is still considered a ""learning"" experience, but on the other hand I feel like I am getting shafted.


They said we would talk again in December to monitor the situation for the following school semester. Should I ask for a pay increase then?

I am a 21 year old engineering student in Australia, I have come across an opportunity to work in Germany for 6 months, starting mid November, for a company that engineers really cool stuff by Lake Constance (Friedrichshafen). The application process has gone well so far, however I have not made up my mind about going. My concerns are not so much about the job, I am fairly confident about that, but more about living in Germany. So I'll start:

1. I know a little German, but realistically I am a novice. I have approximately 4 months to learn as much German as I can, which probably won't be a lot. How well will I be able to function, for example, use public transport and make friends? Do most young people speak English? On this topic, what do Germans think of people who come to their country and don't speak German? Note that speaking German is not a requirement for the job.

2. Why do so many German companies offer internships to overseas students? To me it just seems like they are exporting their own methods of success to other countries, only making themselves less competitive for the future. I mean, why pick me over a local student? It just seems like I am being offered something too good to be true. Also this company will have no shortage of applicants...

3. Any specific things specific to this area of note?

4. What time does the sun rise and set in southern Germany during winter and summer? What's the weather like?

5. How easy is it to pass from Germany into neighbouring countries like Austria and Switzerland?

Anything else I should know?


Thanks."

I am a fashion student, and so the man I am interning for gave me a big fashion project to work on.  He is creating a line which I am helping him with.  Anyways, this man is VERY successful and wealthy; so much that it intimidates me.  I have been shy all of my life, but as I grew up I have come out of my shell much more.  I am not afraid of talking to people anymore, which is awesome.  However, with my internship guy (boss), it's like I'm 5 years old all over again, squeaky voiced and wanting to hide!

I think I am so intimidated by his success.  Whenever he speaks to me without asking a question, I never know how to respond so I just nod along and agree with whatever he says.  When he asks me a question, my voice becomes high pitched instead of firm and neutral.  As if I'm saying ""yes?"" instead of ""yes.""

ALL I EVER SAY TO HIM IS YES, OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD, I UNDERSTAND, AND GOT IT.  I'm always way too shy to give my own input in fear that he will judge me or get angry.  He is very busy and gets stressed easily, so sometimes when I do tell him something he just goes ""yea yea"" or ""okay I know that"" or something.  Like rushed kind of

I have noticed a few things to work on, such as giving direct answers.  I often say ""I think"" (for example, he asks do we have enough hangers; I say I think we have enough).  I feel this sounds unsure and insecure.  So I am going to work on sounding more sure of myself and confident.  Today he hung an outfit on the wall and asked if I thought it was a good spot to take photos.  I said ""I think this is okay"" as in I think its fine, and he got kind of frustrated and said okay is not good enough, and we won't do something unless it's ""fucking perfect""

I'm going to have to make a potentially life-altering decision in the upcoming weeks, and would like to get some opinions on what is the best course of action.

I'm a community college student starting my sophomore year at the end of the month. I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and graduated high school with honors and a 4.1 (weighted) GPA. I also do a lot of hobbyist programming, largely in game development, and have ~4 years of personal experience in Python and C++.

As of now, I'm working as a paid intern doing a variety of work, but largely related to web development (back/front-end, DBs, etc). I've been informed by my supervisor that I will be receiving an offer soon to work a full time, salaried position for the company. No details on pay yet, but the minimum in CA is around $80K.

As you can imagine, this seems like an incredible opportunity for an 18 year old. But I am forced to decide between staying in school, or taking this job (and maybe going back to school later, but I'm not sure about my willpower in that regard). Ideally, I would like to see myself working at a big tech firm, or a game studio, *not* doing web development as I am now. At its core, my question is this: if I take this offer and ever decide to quit, what are my chances of achieving that goal with my current experience (plus that of the job)? 

I am considering making them a counter-offer to stay an intern and part-time. I would explain that education is important to me / my parents, an educated employee == a better employee, there's almost no loss in productivity vs. full-time, and that thusly it's more profitable for the company to keep me as such. I definitely want to keep working there, as it's a solid source of income I desperately need to keep myself afloat as I go through college.

**TL;DR** Sophomore at a CC: get a Bachelor's, or take the $80K salary?"

My question is simple: is this worth it?



I have considered making them a counter-offer, as I am able to work part-time during the school year. I was considering touching on the fact that education is incredibly important to me / my parents, that an educated employee == a better employee, that my productivity in the work place would be relatively similar if I stay on an hourly basis, and that thus it would be more profitable to the company to keep me as such. 


I would basically like to hear some of the pros and cons of finishing school vs. gaining experience / money now, and *possibly* going back to school later (I'm not sure about my willpower in that regard). In an ideal world, I see myself working for a big tech firm, and *not* doing web-dev as I am now.

1k8zol,7,2013-08-12,Finding an Internship,Treasy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k8zol/finding_an_internship/,"So summer's over and I feel that stinging regret of not making the most of my time.  I recently switched back to a BS in Computer Science after testing out a few other disciplines.  I have all of my gen-eds finished so I am doing what amounts to basically a crash course of the core comp sci courses over the next 3 semesters. 

I live in an area where the tech industry is nascent.  There's nothing really beyond IT jobs or front-end web development within 100 miles.  So I will have to look out of state for an internship.  I didn't feel as though I was qualified enough this summer to get an internship that would bring me across the United States (A self-fulfilling prophecy, I know), so I told myself I would work on personal projects/school instead.  

I've worked and had internships in a variety of fields, but never in anything related to computer science.  This coming summer will probably be my last before I graduate, so I want to use that opportunity to get myself an internship that I will really learn a lot from, but I don't know how to find one.  

I understand that career fairs are a solid option.  My school draws a plethora of companies to its annual career fair, but is better known for its business and economics programs than its computer science program, and many interesting smaller companies can't afford a spot at a career fair.  So how do I find companies to apply for outside of the big players?  Do I just look for opportunities at companies whose products I use?  Should I send my resume to anyone willing to listen?

Similarly, how often do companies hire out-of-state interns?  Do any of you have experience with taking an internship in a different location?"

Ok, so I'm 31, engaged, and am trying to figure out this school thing. For the last year, I have been taking Trig every semester, and all 4 times I've not passed. I've tried tutoring, staying late with the teacher, and working extra hard. I just am not amazing at math. The only thing that stands in my way of a degree in my field is this math class. I should let you know that besides my difficulties in math i have a 3.7 GPA. Also i should mention i have very high test anxiety and often times would start crying in class and/or the way home after a frustrating day. Besides the trig class, most things in my life are wonderful. I work a part time job, that helps with money, and my amazing fiancee is fully supportive and encouraging in every way. Also i do a lot of work for a National non profit organization, and this year i received an award for my services over the years. Lastly, in about 7 weeks i'm getting married. The planning is wrapping up and we're both extremely excited to finally be husband and wife ( we've been together for nearly 7 years).

This is where it gets tricky. Because of my anxiety, and also for the reason that I thought a few months away from school would help me to calm my mind and jump back in in January. My Fiancee agrees somewhat with that. Yesterday however, my cousin's husband gave me a call asking what was up with school. My uncle had mentioned to him that I was thinking about taking a semester off to get married and to enjoy some marriage time. He disagreed with that suggestion. 

Now, I like him alot, and i highly respect him, and deep down I think he has awesome points. He may even be right. But the way he went about it just made me feel like even more of a failure. He talked about how i'm 31 and working a part time job, and that I'm my fiancee's burden because once we get married I'll be on her insurance plan. He highly suggested i go back this semester. He said the wedding was just one day and it isn't a valid excuse to take a semester off. 

He also mentioned how jobs wouldn't think much of a 31 year old person who's still trying to get his life straight. I appreciated all he had to say, but i feel like he's jumping to a lot of conclusions. After everything he said I could at least be trying to find a school that offers an alternative to trig that my school would accept. I actually called 5 schools today about that and have a few options now. 3 of those school don't offer what I need, and one is getting back to me, but the most likely one is an hour drive away and my fiancee uses the car to get to her job as a teacher. It just seems like the timing isn't right. I still don't think it would be the worst thing in the world to enjoy my wedding without any anxiety and stress over what may be happening in my class, but I don't want my family to think i'm a loser. I have amazing things going for me, but this is just the last piece of the puzzle. Plus, I'm still pursuing internships and jobs in my field while I finish my degree. Thanks everyone, please give me some advice. "

I had a great opportunity with a company in DC, which my friend referred me for, but I lost it to someone who was a recent intern and lived in the area.  My friend suggested that perhaps if I moved to NY or DC, held a less-desirable job to pay rent, and searched for ""real"" jobs in the area, that my prospects would be better.

Because my housing is coming to an end where I'm currently living, I was planning on moving back to my home in Wisconsin to continue applying to jobs in NY and DC, and possibly Madison as well.  Will my change of location hurt my prospects?  Or should I consider moving, as my friend suggested?"

Thanks for the advice everyone. I think I will accept it and continue applying throughout the year. And for the people wondering how I got the offer. I am an intern and I suppose they liked my work.

I want to dive into and make love to math. I want to do it by writing curve-fitting and peak value analyses, Fourier analyses, and data parsers. I also want to write what I understand are called ""scrapers,"" which go through sites like Facebook and pull out interesting data patterns and classes. I also want to eventually write what I understand are called ""bots,"" programs which iteratively identify patterns, then write scripts for themselves to investigate and test those patterns, and name them, and repeat.

I don't want to manipulate servers and things like that. I respect that those tasks are very valuable and important, but it's not where my interests lie.

[ off, thank you two so much for doing this. I'm a huge fan of *(500\) Days of Summer* and am very much looking forward to *The Spectacular Now*. As a directing/screenwriting student, I appreciate opportunities such as these. The interwebs are a wonderful place.  I'm always curious about the process of writing as a team, versus solo...  Seth &amp; Even say they write in the same room, literally back to back. Do you guys work in a similar way, or do you spend more time apart? Would you say the final result is typically 50/50, or does one take more credit than the other? I'm sure by the end of the day, you're looked at as equals, credit-wise. I'm more so asking from a personal standpoint. I can't imagine the two of you have too many major conflicts if you're still working together, but I also can't imagine it's always sunshine any rainbows. Any stories you'd like to share?  Thanks for doing this! You're brilliant writers and I look forward to your future projects.  Bonus question (time permitting\): Is the Screenwriter's Bible all it's cracked up to be or would you recommend other sources? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboit0s?context=5)|Thanks for your question! weber and i met a long time ago when we both lived in new york. even when we lived in the same city, we never ever ever wrote in the same room. 500 was written when i was in london and he was in new york. and subsequently all our stuff has been written with me in LA and weber in new york. the process is pretty simple. lots of talking in the beginning until we get a solid outline down. then we divide up the scenes and send them back and forth. hope thats helpful! 
[For an aspiring screenwriter, do you have any recommendations of must read scripts and great movies to learn from? What really helped you each to learn storytelling when you were starting off? Thank you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboj7nj?context=5)|Read EVERYTHING. good, bad, movies you like, movies you hate, all the different genres. its the most important thing you can do if you want to write. plus, check out stephen kings book ""on writing"" and william goldman's book about hollywood called ""adventures in the screen trade."" they will both make you feel like anythings possible and that you can do it too which when you're just starting out, is really nice to hear! - scott.
[The writers seem to be king in television, yet for film it still seems to be the director has all control even over the script. How involved are you with your script while the film is in production and do you find yourself fixing dialogue on set, or when you finish your final draft are you done. Have you seen a shift of involvement of screenwriters in film for the better and what are your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokett?context=5)|We've been very lucky - with both 500 and Spec Now we've been very involved.  Marc Webb was hired over a year before we started shooting 500 so we had a lot of time to bond.  i think he knew how important the movie was to us and hopefully we were a resource to him on set.  with Spec Now we were also producers so we were involved in finding James Ponsoldt and casting.  as producers it was expected of us to be on set and fortunately James wanted us there too.  it won't always be this way but so far we've enjoyed staying involved as much as possible.  -Michael.
[Hi guys. Can I trust you guys to make me, a 6ft bearded guy, come out of the TFIOS film bawling my eyes out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojagx?context=5)|If not, see a doctor immediately, check those tear ducts. - Scott.
[I loved 'The Spectacular Now' and although it is based on a book - I can imagine that you all were able to flesh out and shape characters in the screenplay in ways that the author hadn't. Were there real life people or other fictional characters that influenced how you wrote any of the characters? Once you had chosen the cast, did you go back and rewrite anything based on either Shailene or Miles's style? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboj0r0?context=5)|In terms of your first question:  the ""tool"" we rely upon when we write anything is we ask ourselves &amp; each other a very simple question - what would really happen?  it's a question that guides us when we're outlining, we're writing, when we're problem-solving.  and b/c of that i think so much of what we do - including The Spectacular Now - comes from a real place, things we have experienced, people we know, etc.  and for your 2nd question:  you're almost always tweaking the script.  when Shailene and Miles came on board they certainly had some thoughts.  nothing changed significantly though b/c they each had such a great understanding of Aimee &amp; Sutter.  in only a few small places did either of them want to change what was written and always their ideas were for the better!  -Michael 
[I'm a young screenwriter trying to break into the industry. What's the best way to break in? How did you guys do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojcwx?context=5)|I started interning when i was in high school. every summer, real job on the weekends, working for free during the week. i read every script, learned some of the ins and outs, and was fortunate enough to get hired when i graduated college. because of this, when i did decide to get serious about the screenwriting thing, i had people who were one degree of separation away from someone who could be helpful. and that was key. always helps to put a face to the name on the cover page of the script thats buried amidst fifteen other scripts on a producer's desk. - Scott.
[What was it like working with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboit71?context=5)|Amazing! really thoughtful, really smart, super committed and a pleasure to be around. love them! - scott.
[1\) After (500\) Days of Summer, what made you two decide to stick with independent filmmaking, whereas the director went way into the mainstream with Spider-Man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokp5m?context=5)|Spec Now started as a studio movie, with the same people who made 500, and then they decided not to make it.  we still believed in the project so we decided to go the independent route.  it took almost 5 years but it was worth it!
[How does one go down the independent route? did you fund the films yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokyz3?context=5)|In this case, we had a script, actors, a filmmaker, passionate people who wanted to see it made - but we had no money. it was only when andrew lauren read the script and was able to come in with his own money that we actually were able to make a movie. the cool part is 16 years earlier, i was andrew's intern. - scott.
[Hey i recently acquired a great interest in writing and reading scripts,i have no education on these,i learn all by reading other scripts. What advice could you give me?  Also one of my biggest fear is that my screenplay looks like other people style how can i avoid that?  Also What you guys think about Quentin Tarantino?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojnww?context=5)|We love QT and his films!  and were lucky enough to meet him once a few years ago.  he couldn't have been nicer to us.  reading scripts is a great start - keep reading 'em and keep watching a ton of movies.  bust most of all KEEP WRITING!  and then write some more after that.  -Michael.
[Hi huge fan love (500\) I've spoke to one of u already over twitter lol . can I ask? do you have any writing advice? :~\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokk3q?context=5)|This is so simple but it's everything:  write... write some more... and then write more after that.  write every day.  don't wait until you have a good idea or are in the mood to write - write especially when you're not in the mood, when you don't have time, when it's the last thing on earth you want to be doing.  make writing more important than just about everything else in your life... and then, in time, you will see a big difference in your writing.  good luck!  -Michael.
[A lot of reviews of The Spectacular Now are using John Hughes as a reference point, was he an influence on the movie at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboiu1v?context=5)|Definitely!  we both love the work of John Hughes.  he wrote about young people without talking down to them.  Ferris Bueller's Day Off was especially a touchstone for Spectacular Now.  Sutter Keely has some Ferris Bueller in him.  personally i've seen FBDO a few hundred times - no exaggeration.  i cut waaay too much high school b/c of that movie.  quick trivia question: anyone know who fouled off the ball Ferris caught at the Cubs game? -Michael.
[Hey guys. I used to work as a reader and there were probably three or four scripts out of the hundreds that made me cry. Spectacular Now was one of them. A beautifully told and honest story. So nice to read material where writers treat teenagers like real people...with complexity, as opposed to cardboard cutouts. What did you see in James Ponsoldt's work &amp; vision that convinced you he was right for this story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboj6mg?context=5)|Love to hear that. its always nice to make someone cry! as for james, we both went crazy for his previous film smashed. we were slightly concerned that he wouldnt want to do our movie because of all the drinking in both stories but when we sat with james, all we did was talk about the movies we loved, what it felt like to be young and immature, and then we knew he was the right guy for the job. we were thrilled he said yes to us! - Scott.
[Hi guys, this is awesome, thanks!!!  Just a few questions, when did you realize you wanted to be a screenwriter? What pieces influenced you in that journey? Also being a part of some excellent films, what is the most important thing when telling a story that you want your viewers to know? I think that in life there's always underlining meanings and inspirational values that stories reveal to us. What are some of your thoughts considering the works you've been a part of? Thanks in advance, you guys are awesome! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojhbp?context=5)|I always wanted to be a writer but i didn't consider screenwriting till i got to college (Syracuse - let's go Orange!).  what influenced me was watching 5+ movies a week - the work of Woody Allen, Cameron Crowe, Billy Wilder, Hal Ashby... i could keep going.  in terms of our work... before we start we ask ourselves a simple question:  would we go see this movie?  we're fans first so we only want to work on movies we'd go see.  -Michael.
[What are your favorite movies?  What are your favorite sandwiches?  What're the best steps a young screenwriter can take to get better and get noticed?  I wish I could ask you questions whenever I actually can think of good ones! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbolaay?context=5)|See my answer below about PBJ - it's my daily go-to.  yesterday i had an incredible proscuito &amp; fig jam sandwich - i'm still thinking about it.  Scott likes turkey or chicken on bread, totally plain.  my favorite movies?  Manhattan... The Apartment... Raiders of the Lost Ark... Five Easy Pieces... Ferris Bueller's Day Off... The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly... ask us questions anytime on twitter!  - Michael.
[In an interview you guys said that with The Spectacular Now (and maybe TFIOS?\) you have to make the script cinematic while doing justice to the original material. How does that work with your outline process? How do you know which scenes would be good for screen and which to cut?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojsmd?context=5)|We don't always know!  we talk about it a lot.  we outline and re-outline.  and we understand that a script is very fluid - it will change when a director comes on board.  a script is a map for the director to go make a movie.  and we will spend a lot of time with the director talking about how to make it more cinematic.  - Michael.
[Hey!  I just did an interview with your Costume Designer, Peggy Stamper!  I saw this film at Sundance and loved it.  I think it gives ""The Breakfast Club"" a run for ""Best High School Coming of Age film"" ever.  Just wanted to say thank you too for avoiding the cliched tropes and delivering a genre-defining film.  After doing ""500 Days of Summer"", how did you too decide that TSN would be your next project?  Why this genre?  What other stories/genres were you considering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojnnu?context=5)|In the same way that summer was a reaction to the way hollywood was making romantic comedies, weber and i very much wanted to find a way to bring back the more sensitive, honest, teenage coming of age movies we grew up with and loved so much. tim's book seemed to give us a great opportunity for that and so we dove in. - scott.
[Were you at all worried about having such a major character as the one played by Kyle Chandler not come into the picture until so late in the film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokthq?context=5)|Not at all. SPOILER ALERT: its kind of like jaws. or i should say anti-jaws. we hear a lot about sutter's dad, what a great guy he is etc. so when we finally do get to meet him, we have expectations. he's been built up in our minds to be a certain thing. and then kyle chandler opens the door and you're hopefully all ""hey coach taylor is the dad! this is gonna work out great!"" which of course it does not. but thats all part of the fun. would have been quite a different thing with a different actor opening that door. - scott 
[Saw The Spectacular Now at Montclair FF and thought it was absolutely brilliant. Which three films should every aspiring screenwriter watch (read\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojd95?context=5)|Thank you! i think that depends on what you want to write, what stories move you. for me, i would say ""the graduate,"" ""annie hall,"" and ""almost famous."" theres definitely no set three and three is nowhere near enough! - scott.
[Hey guys, I saw *The Spectacular Now* yesterday and loved it. It was great to see a high school movie that has complex characters with dimensions and unique personalities.  My question is, Do you like it when Actors use some improvisation to add to scenes or would you prefer for them to stick to the script?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojo9s?context=5)|God no!  stick to the damn script!  just kidding.  we love when an actor has a deep understanding of the character b/c then they bring ideas to the movie that we never thought of.  we've been lucky with both 500 and Spec Now that everyone involved wanted to make the same movie.  which means there were a lot of good, new ideas when the actors came on board.  -Michael.

[For my senior project I am working on a short film screenplay. I am so stoked for Spectacular Now to come to Pittsburgh, and I am a huge fan of 500 Days of Summer. What advice do you guys have for first time screenwriters? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbojftp?context=5)|First time screenwriters:  hey i think Scott may have already answered this but... watch a ton of movies, read a lot of scripts... and then don't be afraid to make mistakes.  the only way to get better is to write and then write more and then more after that.  keep doing it and it will get better.  good luck!  -Michael.
[How did you sell (500\) days of summer? was it a difficult pitch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cboklgk?context=5)|We always called it ""boy meets girl meets memento."" that was our pitch. of course we didnt pitch it and if we ever had pitched it, we would have been laughed out of every room. in this case, we had the script, it was what it was, and we hoped people would get it. some did, some did, but even those who did did not want to buy it. and so it sat there, unwanted, untouched, collecting dust on shelves across los angeles, until some passionate producers convinced a cool guy at fox searchlight to take a chance. and a year later we made the thing. - scott.
[How was the writing process different for writing The Fault in Our Stars, knowing it has such a crazy fan-base with all the nerd-fighters anticipating it's release, and would you guys adapt any other of John Green's novels'?  My last question is, i have always felt that i can somehow maybe get my voice out there in script form. While i can just write a narrative, what books or computer programs would you recommend to get started?  Thank You!!! :\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokc6k?context=5)|I dont think the fact that fault was so beloved and had such a huge fan base was an influence on our writing process or on what we kept and didnt keep from the book. the truth is, the book is just so good that it made no sense to deviate from it just for the sake of deviation. our goal was to capture, translate, and visually communicate what all of you (and both of us) loved so much about this book. and we hopefully did that. - Scott.
[John Green said your script moved him and he barely cries with TFIOS stuff. As writer of the screenplay, did you get emotional writing it? or were you a bit detached?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbolhoh?context=5)|Thats great to hear about john. i didnt know that. reading the book, i of course was very emotional, and probably not just because i had just lost my dad. the book packs that kind of punch for everyone i think. reading the script, i kept my emotions in check - but watching some of the auditions, man, i was a weeping mess! we've got an amazing cast and i think its gonna be really moving. invest in kleenex stock, everybody. - Scott.
[How complicated was the notes process on a priorly unheralded screenplay like 500 Days of Summer versus a 'brand' property like The Fault in Our Stars? You guys write films that are a little left of center. Any interesting studio headbutting anecdotes to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kfxma/we_are_scott_neustadter_and_michael_weber/cbokzwm?context=5)|On both projects the notes process was fairly simple - sorry, no headbutting anecdotes.  Peter Rice, who ran Fox Searchlight, had only one really smart note on 500 - and that note ultimately led to the reality / expectations splitscreen.  on TFIOS the only notes were a few typos!  we start shooting TFIOS in 2 weeks so hopefully we don't have to change anything between now and then...  -Michael.
[How do you hope the die hard TFIOS fans react to the way you've adapted it?

I hate sleeping. I pop caffeine pills like tic tacs just to avoid the frightening dreams I've been having since last Summer. It was hard, but I'd worked my ass off to obtain an internship in the field I was studying at the time. My parents were ecstatic. I'd been a very troubled teenager, and even had minor outbursts that resulted in a juvenile criminal record, so you can imagine how happy they were. I needed the experience, and this was a great start for me. 

I remember how hot it was when I first arrived at the facility. The heat, combined with my nervousness caused sweat marks beneath my armpits, the anxiety was unbearable. If that wasn't enough, the 20 foot-tall barbed wire fencing was screaming ""Who the fuck are you?"" I mustered the courage to buzz through the intercom, and told the woman inside why I was there. It was at that moment I met Dr. Kent, a tall guy with the softest handshake I've ever experienced. He gave me a welcome speech and asked me if I had any questions before we got started. Really nice man, but had a reluctant attitude about him, almost like he was constantly anxious. 

When I first stepped into the ward, I was taken back by how big it was. I'd always based my opinion of psych wards off of television and movies, so seeing so many long hallways and corridors there were kind of freaked me out. I pretty much shadowed Dr.Kent around the ward as he checked on patient reports, this doubled as my tour of the workplace. About an hour into the day, he was told a patient was freaking out in one of the ""white rooms"", so we rushed to the woman's room hoping to prevent it from escalating. I knew right fucking then that this was not the career for me. This woman was throwing a fit, biting, scratching and screaming death threats at every one in the room. The guards held her down and the doctor administered an injection into her thigh. I was shit-scared, which amplified into petrified when the woman held a steady, half-conscious glare into my eyes and kept repeating ""Why not you?"". Those words played throughout my head for the next 2 hours. 

After the doctor apologized and informed me that sometimes the patients will dedicate their focus to new faces, we spent an hour distributing medication on level 3. This was considered the ""safe"" area, as most of the patients were non-violent, with heavy depression and shit like that. I didn't mind it there, I felt a lot more relaxed in that atmosphere as opposed to level 2. When we finally got called to level 1 my heart started pounding like a bass drum. My previous encounter really creeped me out, so the thought of going somewhere worse was terrifying. 

This level was like something straight out of a Stephen King book, you couldn't dream up a more frightening-looking psych ward. Throw in the whispering, the loud chants and the lonely crying of a woman begging for her baby and you've got this fucking place. I tried asking to use the bathroom we passed on our way in, but the doctor pointed to a staff restroom next to the security booth. I remember trying to piss for 2 straight minutes before I gave up and tried to gather a bit of courage. I just wanted the fuck out of the place, I'd already decided this wasn't the career for me and I didn't need a convicted baby killer trying to shank me in search of her dead child. I had to get through the day, that was my only objective. 

The first stop in psychological hell? Paul Henry. Dr.Kent was nice enough to start listing the disorders he'd been diagnosed with. Bottom of the list was an intense form of OCD, followed by some other brands of dementia, topped by the Schizophrenia that got him put in there in the first place. Apparently he'd been practicing surgery on dead stray cats as a kid, which with age, manifested into a violent attack on a prostitute and an altercation resulting in a man having his eye-balls cut out. They found Paul huddled up beside the fridge whispering ""see no evil"", rocking and holding a lighter to one of the eye-balls. Once again, I was petrified.

In the corner of a heavily padded room, a slim, balding white man sat pressed up against the faded, torn protective material. He didn't look at us when we entered, he just sat there staring at the opposite corner of the room, gently caressing what seemed to be a raggedy old stuffed-animal. The doctor started asking routine questions - ""How do you feel today Paul?"" and ""have you been eating your meals?"". These questions went unanswered, and with time I began feeling more comfortable in this scenario. Of course, at the very moment my heart rate returned to normal, Paul opened his mouth : ""They don't know, do they?"". He was staring at me, distorting his calm demeanour with an eerie grin worthy only of someone with his track record. Before I could enquire as to what he meant by that comment, he started chattering rapidly: ""Marco… Polo… Marco… Polo!"". The doctor could see I was clearly disturbed by what was happening, and he asked security to escort me back to the front of the ward. 

There, I waited… and waited… and waited. In sheer boredom I began reading through security's procedural handbook. It was basically a politically correct guide to dealing with the most fucked up kind of people on Earth. ""If I followed that shit, I'd be wheeled down to the basement on a stretcher before I got to the second chapter"" the guard stated, after watching me genuinely attempt to learn from the manual. At this point, my ""shift"" was almost over, and I wanted nothing more than someone to guide me through this maze, out of this hell-on-earth, and back to the comforts of my easy-going, middle-class life. My day couldn't get any worse… and then it did.

8:23 - That was the exact time on the clock. I was watching the hour hand crawl towards the 9 for what felt like an eternity, and then 'click'…. darkness. Not the kind of darkness you experience when subtle light illuminates from windows… I mean complete, blinding darkness. Those horrific seconds felt like hours, until relief came in the form of an emergency light. The generator had switched on and allowed for security to begin a safety check of the facility. There I was, alone, scared and confused in one of the most terrifying environments your imagination could ever conjure. I wanted to be home with my parents, I missed them now… ironically, after years of consistent arguing and heated altercations, it was my mother and father that I wanted the most at that very moment. 

The ward had slipped into near complete silence, shy of a lonely voice echoing down through the corridor, pleading for someone to turn on a light. My eyes began to swell, and before I knew it I was sobbing like an infant. This traumatic moment was scarring me with each passing second, and then… darkness. The sound of the generator shutting down caused my heart to race quicker than Cadillac Silver, the greyhound I'd made a thousand dollars off the previous summer. Silence. The man's eerie plea for light had disappeared, leaving nothing but a suffocating silence throughout the ward. I wanted nothing more than to hear something… anything. Regret swallowed that thought as the sound of metal puzzles unlocking travelled through the corridors, rapidly gaining momentum as the clicks and clanks worked their way towards me. I didn't need anyone to inform me as to what was transpiring. The rooms had unlocked due to the power outage, a safety procedure that occurred in order to prevent loss of life in the event of a fire. I'd read about it in the manual, however it failed to outline just how horrific the sound of dozens of heavy, secured metal doors actually is.

""Hello!?!"" - I'd mustered up the courage to search for a friendly voice. Nothing. Where the fuck has security gone? Why isn't the doctor rushing back to ensure me that everything would be ok? Should I stay where I'm standing? Should I search for someone? Words cannot describe the vast array of emotional reactions that ripped their way through my body… I was trembling, visibly shaking… and I was alone. Seconds felt like hours, and my lack of action was beginning to taunt me. I needed to find the doctor, at the very least he'd possess the knowledge and know-how needed to react to the situation we'd been placed in. I remembered he'd been seeing to Paul Henry when I'd last seen him, that was where I needed to go. My knees nearly gave way to the weight of my upper body as I slowly shifted through the corridor. I think I prayed to God a thousand times during that walk, a crushing revelation for a dedicated Atheist such as myself. ""Dr. Kent???"" - I asked quietly, ""are you there Dr. Kent???"" - I wanted to shout those words, but my fear of attracting the attention of a patient allowed for only a whisper. I repeated my cry for help, but was interrupted by the sound of a woman mocking me from what could only be a few meters behind me. ""Dr.Kent"" she echoed, followed by what sounded like the school yard laughter of a young school girl. My heart dove into the pit of my stomach, my throat successfully blocking any oxygen from reaching my lungs. As my fingertips caressed the hallway walls, I slowly approached what I believed to be Paul Henry's room. 

""Doctor… Dr. Kent?…?"" I whispered. Nothing. I was broken. Fear swallowed me hole at that moment, and I collapsed into the corner of the padded room, sliding down into a fetal position, whimpering in despair. I'd given up. My survival instinct was overcome by an intense feeling of hopelessness. I began apologizing through my tears… to my parents… to friends I'd wronged. At that moment, the only thing I wanted in the entire world was forgiveness. 

""Marco"" - my sobbing was interrupted. Again… ""Marco"". I sat there, huddled in a corner, attempting to remain as silent as possible in order to avoid any further interaction. It continued in my silence. I didn't want to respond, but the sound of coordinated footsteps approaching provided a comforting sense of security. ""Polo"" - I responded softly.  My response interrupted the voice as it attempted to repeat the word once again - ""Mar.."". The man fell silent abruptly. The fear began to strangle me as I sat helplessly in the corner of that padded room. What felt like a decade passed before the voice spoke once again - ""see no evil"" it whispered. With that, I felt someone's presence enter through the dark doorway. The voice began to scream violently. Pleading for help, cries for mercy were interspersed with the phrase he'd previously whispered - ""SEE NO EVIL!""

Laughter reverberated off of the corridor walls, travelling like a wild pack of hyenas encroaching on their prey. I could hear nothing but my parents voices begging for it to stop, my mother shrieking ""DON'T HURT HIM! PLEASE!"" at the top of her lungs. ""Mom??? Why is she here???"" I thought desperately, rocking viciously on the padded floor, my eyelids clenching down tightly as if being forced closed by a steel vice… then it stopped. I sat through the silence for a few seconds before slowly opening my eyes. The lights were on… I was alone once again, still huddled in the corner of the familiar padded room. 

Dr.Kent was standing above me, along with the security guard I'd met earlier. I was relieved, the overwhelming feeling of joy caused me to erupt into unstoppable laughter. ""Dr.Kent!"" I shouted - ""Where is my mother? I heard her here! Has she come to pick me up? Please take me to her!"".  The look on his face was unforgettable, it was as though he was genuinely perplexed by my request. ""Mark…"" he replied, ""tell us about Paul."" Why was he asking me about Paul? He knows about fucking Paul, I just wanted to see my parents. I reacted with anger, how dare he ask such a trivial question after I'd experienced such a horrifying ordeal. ""You already know about Paul!"" I shrieked - ""I just want to get the fuck out of this place!"". With that another doctor entered the room, and a collection of uniformed individuals attempted to persuade me to calm down. The feeling of the syringe being jammed into my thigh is unforgettable, however the forceful sting was mellowed by the overwhelming feeling of peace that followed. Unable to speak, I watched calmly as Dr.Kent began showing the contents of a file to the most recent arrival. I observed motionless as a photo drifted gently to the soft, white floor. The image depicted what seemed to be a man in his late 40's, lying in a pool of his own blood and feces, lifeless on the kitchen floor. I remember feeling disgusted, appalled at the idea that someone was capable of such evil. As my eyelids began to close, Paul's voice returned once again… ""Marco"" he whispered.

The following weeks were a blur. I think the trauma I endured forced my memory to block out much of what followed, although I'd love to have a memory of the moment I reunited with my parents. We're closer than ever now and our lives are pretty much the epitome of what you'd consider the perfect American family. I see the world differently, almost as though everything is in bright and clear high definition. I have reconnected with old friends, made right of my wrongs, and am generally happy with the life I've made since that terrifying ordeal. However, almost every night since, I keep having these recurring dreams. There I am, huddled up in the corner of that padded room on level 1… staring at Paul as he whispers softly… ""See no evil… see no evil"".

[How serious of a threat is Islamic radicalization in Russia via both the Caucasus and the quickly growing Muslim population in other regions?  Will Putin's often times heavy hand lead to instability via this particular demographic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobae1?context=5)|It's a pretty serious threat, and I can't say that the Russians are doing a good job fighting it. For one thing, they've installed a guy named Ramzan Kadyrov to run Chechnya (once torn up by war) and he's running a pretty Islamist ship. (If you want proof, look at his Instagram account.) And Putin, who is in many ways hostage to him, can't do much about it. 
[I'm a black college student and am wondering if it would be safe for me to study in Russia. I'm sure on a day to day basis I may be fine, but what i'm worried about is the one time something goes wrong. What would be your advice as a Russian-American?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobkax?context=5)|Hmmm, that's a tough one. I think that, for the most part, you'd be okay -- if you consider people glaring at you and cracking racist jokes okay. (Russians are, er, not the most tolerant bunch.) There's quite a bit of violence against people considered to be black, which includes, in the Russian mind, people from Central Asia and the Caucasus. My advice is go, but stick to the city center and try to go to a bigger city like Moscow. (St. Pete is crawling with skinheads.) Be extra, extra careful and make sure the American Embassy knows you're there. They have a special unit to deal with threats to American citizens, so you should report anything that happens immediately. You should ask, btw, Jelani Cobb, who spent time teaching in Moscow, if he has any advice.
[Wow. Thank you for the detailed advice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboch8b?context=5)|No problem. You should definitely go, but talk to Jelani first. 
[Hey Julia,  First off, your recent ""mansplaining"" article (link for those interested: Link to www.newrepublic.com was EPIC.  Question: Given your unique life experiences -- both personally and professionally -- what would you say your very best piece of life advice is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbob9u2?context=5)|Speak up when you know you're right.
[Julia,  Is Navalny really as right wing as they say? What are his views on incoming migrants?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobb81?context=5)|I don't think he is. He is as nationalist as most Russian liberals, who aren't really liberals at all, but are closer to the libertarian end of the spectrum (a natural reaction to a suffocating Russian state). If you ask Navalny, he would tell you that migration is a serious problem (Russia has the second largest number of migrants, after the U.S.) and it's a problem not just for Russia, but for the countries the migrants leave (fatherless families, torn up social fabric, etc.). Moreover, because these migrants live in the shadows in Russia, they don't have access to health care, the courts, etc. His view is that if you don't talk about this, the neo-Nazis will. And I tend to agree with him.
[What are your thoughts on 2014 Olympics? Should gay athletes not attend, attend but protest? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobdn2?context=5)|I think gay athletes should absolutely attend, kick ass, and show Russia and the rest of the largely homophobic world that they are an athletic force to be reckoned with.
[Where did you pick up your voice or your writing style? best advice you would give to aspiring journalists or your 18 year old self?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobbdn?context=5)|My best advice is, read a ton of good writing, especially before you sleep, but, when you write, don't try to imitate it. Just write as yourself.
[Hi Julia, we, who are not particularly knowledgeable about Russia, still think of it as having  a pretty sexist culture. Are women treated more inferior there than in other more 'westernized' countries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobibl?context=5)|Yes! Omg, yes, yes, yes. Russia is still extremely sexist. I can write volumes on this, but, good lord. Basically, it's a matriarchy parading around as a macho patriarchy. That said, the wage gap between men and women is smaller in Russia than in the U.S. And once a year, on International Women's Day (March 8) Russian women get tons and tons of flowers -- I guess to make up for being treated as cooks/strippers with uteruses the rest of the year.
[Thanks for answering! Any awful experiences in your work you'd want to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocxh7?context=5)|Once, I had coffee with a political analyst. Then I made the mistake of trying to pay for the coffee, which confused him. He said, ""What are you doing?"" and ""Why?"" And I said, ""Because that's the rule: the journalist pays."" And he said, ""But you're not a journalist. You're a woman!""
[Do Vladimir Putin and the Russian government have complete, total, absolute control over this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobb87?context=5)|Oh, you bet.
[Do you think Putin is really this homophobic or is he just making a statement? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobcmy?context=5)|I don't think Putin is any more homophobic than most Russians, which is pretty homophobic -- Russians, like I said, are pretty ignorant about homosexuality and think it's abnormal). I also don't think it was his initiative. This law, unlike many, came up to the federal level after being introduced in cities around Russia, and Putin signed into law what the Duma gave him, which obviously signifies his approval: if he hadn't approved, it would've never made it out of the lower chamber of the Russian parliament. That said, the law reflects a tone set by Putin by bringing the Orthodox Church, a very conservative institution, increasingly not just into public life but into the government. It's all part of a pattern of looking for a more conservative, ""Russian"" national idea -- whatever that means. 
[Could you talk about some of the international initiatives have been killed - or can never be pursued - due to Russia's veto power in the UN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobeed?context=5)|Russia kills anything in the UNSC that it thinks violates national sovereignty, not because they're such fighters for self-determination, but because they're afraid these measures will eventually be used on them, say, when they crack down on dissent.
[How fare the efforts of making Russia cease its support of the Assad regime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobeed?context=5)|The efforts of making Putin stop supporting Assad are not going very well, in part because Russia is a big, nuclear power with a UN veto, and takes that very seriously (image-wise), so yelling at them and telling them to stop doesn't really do anything, just as it wouldn't work if someone did that with the U.S.
[What can and should we, as individuals, and our international politicians do about the Russian anti-LGBT Olympics that's more than just a symbolic gesture of frustration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobeed?context=5)|As for the anti-gay stuff, that's your answer, too. We can get angry and pour vodka into the gutters all we want, but, ultimately, this is something Russia needs to work out on its own. After all, the vast majority of Russians (like over 70%) still see homosexuality as a disease or a psychiatric aberration. 
[Hey Julia! And thanks for your great article (all the previous ones as well\)! I live very close to StPete so I see how (wealthy\) Russian gays come over and be ""free"" even for a weekend. I feel so sad for them. I read a great article by Miriam Elder as well where she pointed out why this all is happening in Russia right now. Very scary. What is your opinion - can this all just go on? Can all this harassments &amp; violence just go on? Is it only happening cos Putin &amp; Kirill needs someone to blame? Today a silvermedalist dedicated his medal to his GLTB friends. Everything goes so fast, do you think that #boycottsochi will happen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobpf4?context=5)|Miriam Elder is a close friend but also a brilliant journalist, so I recommend reading everything she writes.
 |As to your question, this is something Russians have to work out on their own. American pressure isn't going to change the minds of Vanya and Petya in some central Russian village that gays are freaks of nature. And look, America doesn't have the best history with this stuff either. We *just* repealed DOMA and still have a very, very long way to go, not just in terms of gay rights but general equality (see: gutting of the Voting Rights Act). We have a lot of work to do at home, too.
[Can you speak to Russia Today? They have a growing audience in the west, who seem unaware of their connections to Putin's Kremlin. What's your take on the objectivity, or trustworthiness of RT as a news source?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocy0v?context=5)|Russia Today was created and is still financed by the Kremlin. Their mission is not to bring objectivity, but to serve as ""a counterweight"" to the West. (Which, you'll agree, is weird for a news outlet.) Putin talks about RT's editorial policies as ""we."" So, no, RT is not a news source. It's a joke.
[Thank you for the response. That's my take too, but I figured I should get some perspective from a professional with actual experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbod68d?context=5)|Lord, you only have to watch it to understand. Have you seen their segment, in the wake of Assange's sex charges, about how Sweden has become a U.S. colony? It referred to ""The United States of Swedamerica.""
[Here's a naive question: I know that you and the Forbes writer Mark Adomanis often disagree. My understanding of Russian politics is unsophisticated, though, so I have trouble grasping the specific faultlines of your ideological differences. How would you characterize his work as opposed to your own? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobw41?context=5)|Mark Adomanis is a very nice fellow. That said, he's never lived and worked in Russia, nor does he speak language. He is too credulous of what the Kremlin says. He is often counterintuitive for counterintuitiveness's sake. He is academic in the way that academics ignore the parts of reality that undermine their nice, abstract theory. That's about it, I guess.

[Is there something about Russian Culture/Society that makes the country  so prone to authoritarian dictatorship-esque regimes (Stalin, USSR, to Putin\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobewa?context=5)|I think Stalin set the stage for Putin, and the czars set the stage for Stalin. If the czars taught Russians that they were eternal subjects to the holy emperor and his Church, Stalin drove home the notion by jailing and killing millions and millions of Soviets, of making people afraid not just to speak up and resist, but to trust each other. The scars of what he did are there, but they're fading in the generation born after the fall of the Soviet Union. I don't know that it's a cultural thing as much as it is hard, cruel historical training.
[What has living in Russia made you realize about US politics?

It was a pretty rude awakening to come home to Newtown and the background check fail, the AP leak investigation, the NSA run completely amok, and to see that old white men are still obsessing about abortion. Sad Ioffe.
[Do you think the Times does accurate, fair reporting on Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobdul?context=5)|The Times has a fantastic bureau in Moscow, staffed with wonderful, intelligent reporters.

[You lived in Russia for a long time. Favorite vodka?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbob97h?context=5)|Horseradish vodka. It's the best.

[When you say that those who bear the scars of communism are being supplanted by subsequent generations, what are the implications of this?

The problem is that hope and fearlessness don't last forever. If the Russian state doesn't change itself to fit them, they'll either leave or become embittered and cynical, just like their parents and grandparents.
[Hey again! What do you feel about May6 prisoners? Do you think that they will get very long sentences for nothing? Is there any possibility that they will go free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboc99d?context=5)|Unfortunately, I doubt they will go free, and it breaks my heart: one of my very good friends, Maria Baronova, is among them.

[Your little dustup on MSNBC about Putin not being omnipotent(a surprisingly controversial assertion\) seems intuitively correct, but I was hoping you could go into a little more detail about the Russian 'power structure'. What is the source of his political staying power? What part do the oligarchs play in that?  It was recently announced that Khodorkovsky might be released as soon as 2014, do you expect that to happen and if so, what are the implications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobgf4?context=5)|Nope. I hear they're now cobbling together a third set of charges. This is how Russia does things: slapdash, and without any grand strategy. Really, when they tried him in 2005, and the public opinion jury was still out on him -- Khodorkovsky was the worst of the worst in the 90s -- they should have given him 20, 30 years. By now, everyone would have forgotten. Instead, they keep brining it back into the spotlight, where it becomes increasingly apparent to everyone who has eyes that this is political.
[What do you think is going to happen to lgbt athletes at the Olympic Games? Can Russia really punish all of them without major repercussions from their allies or is Russia just making thinly veiled threats? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbobe2h?context=5)|I doubt Russia (the government) will punish gay athletes -- they don't want the media mess. The more pressing concern is what happens to a gay athlete that goes out into Russia and, say, holds hands with his partner. The mood in Russia is pretty poisonous right now. Will they be heckled? Beaten up? What will the Russian government do if that happens?

[Julia, I have visited Russia several times and just married a Russian!  I love the culture but just wonder why they are being so incredibly stupid right now just before Sochi!

They passed the law and were probably surprised that it complicates their hosting the olympics.
[Hi Julia, You're considered (one of\) the best journalists writing about Russia today. Do you feel like an expert on Russia, or is it just the fact that you're Russian that gives you headway? That is, you definitely know Russia better than most American journalists or pundits; but do you think you understand Russian politics significantly better than a random political activist or just an informed voter in Russia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboc238?context=5)|Being from Russia definitely helped. That said, I was only 7 when my family left the Soviet Union. And I worked pretty hard -- with a tutor in grade school, in college, and when in Russia -- to learn the place well.

Can you recommend anyone worth following nowadays?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cboc2kc?context=5)|Oh, that's just not true! When I was there, I was honored to work and become friends with some of the best in the business: Cliff Levy, Ellen Barry, Michael Schwirtz, Miriam Elder, Catherine Belton, Shaun Walker, Charles Clover. Most of us are gone now, but Shaun and Charles are still still there, and they're being replaced by good, young blood: Max Seddon of Buzzfeed, and Andrew Roth of the Times.

That said, the income inequality is extreme in Russia. Also, given all its natural resources, Russia should be quite wealthy. However, once you leave Moscow and St. Pete, you can see the immediate effects -- squalid poverty -- of rich Russians stashing their money abroad.

I guess its more worthwhile to answer questions about horse steak and American dad...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kf8ni/i_am_julia_ioffe_senior_editor_of_the_new/cbocuzc?context=5)|Ha, no, it's not too difficult, there's just not much to say on it. Russia has mostly ignored China, while China has gobbled up energy markets in Central Asia. Russia always wanted to focus on Europe as a customer of its natural resources, in part because the Chinese drive a hard bargain and the Russians jack up their prices. Recently, though, we're seeing a new pivot in Russia toward the Chinese energy market. Smart, but very late. 
[Great question.

Putin is clearly not a man looking for an exit strategy. That said, I don't know how much longer he can hang on. 2024, when a second (well, fourth) term runs out, seems unrealistic.

The regular sysadmin, in all his genius, managed to break the spool of cat 5 that was neatly nestled in a box to allow for easy pulling. So he pulls out the whole roll to fix it. Spool looks similar to [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O3XkB1KFL._SX342_.jpg), but wound with cat5. Problem was that the top and bottom plastic pieces pulled apart separately, and now was causing issues.

Anyhow, next time he utters the words ""Is your hand small enough to fit in here?"" I'm going to lie. 20 minutes, a scraped up knuckle from the tight fit of squeezing it into the center of the spool, and his adamant refusal so give up and just mount it on some PVC pipe or a dowel, we finally managed to get it back together. 

Bonus: he probably just ruined the couple loops of wire that were being pinched as he tried to manhandle the halves back together, so that'll add some bonus fun down the line.

Added bonus: He also just cemented his status as ""that creepy loud guy"" to the interns we have on staff as he let loose with pretty much every swear word there is in those 20 minutes.

I currently work at an internship now at a very small startup. (The only employees are the two cofounders, CEO and COO.) The rest of the job is done by interns, including myself. While others, who are both college students, work as designer and publicist, I work as a coder. When I applied for this job, I was hoping to learn programming on the iPhone while getting mentored. It was perhaps a productive way to spend my summer after graduating high school. As it turns out, my job is pretty much debugging code my boss (CEO) wrote. Whenever I encounter a problem, my boss tells me to just Google it, even after I have. He occasionally takes interest in my work when he isn't busy, but otherwise he's prioritizes his own work.


I thought keeping my internship was better than quitting and potentially squandering time this summer, until recently a friend offered me a job. While taking a break from his engineer job at a reputable social media company this summer, he began working on a personal project. He wanted some website design and development help, and wanted me to learn Rails and even promised to help me whenever I got stuck in coding. We are neighbors and we've already comfortable with each other - often our rants about technology went late into the night. He urged me to quit my job and just join him.


I certainly got excited by such prospects. He's already got plenty of coding experience and time to help me. While I could stay at my job without any significant contributions, helping my friend's project would enable me to learn  how to make my own projects from scratch. Besides, the communication would be much better; while there is seldom casual non-work communication at my current workplace, the communication between my friend and myself would hardly see any friction.


I'm certain that I want to quit my current internship. But I don't know how. Outside the workplace, my boss and I almost always go out for lunch together and we chat. We also once had a small party to welcome me. It is quite difficult for me to inform my consent to quit this job. I already have notified my consideration, hoping that my boss will allow me to leave. However, he urged me to stay until I leave a month later as I intended at the beginning of the job (which would coincide with the time college starts). He said he had intended to delegate some more work for me, indicating the choices of iPhone apps I can work on to fix bugs he wrote. He suggested to work on Rails during my free time. I said I'll think about it. Meanwhile, he's expecting me to work on another app he began.


As this job was my first internship, I was interested in this job at the beginning of this summer. However, my enthusiasm waned, and now spending time at work drains my energy further. I get paid, but money matters less to me than satisfaction. I am eager to quit now, but how can I convince my boss?"

Working with new boss for 6 months now, still no hire – he keeps saying I’m in “evaluation process”. What should I do?


I’ve been working as an intern for 1,5 years in the same company. During this time, I’ve received extremely positive feedbacks both from superiors and peers, and managed to build quite a reputation among coworkers. 

The thing is: I do business intelligence for a tech company, and our marketing department is actually abroad. The only local position for marketing is intern. Considering this, I was planning to look for a “real job” mid July (since I’ll graduate this December) when my boss told me he was making all he could to create a position for me. Which included the possibility of relocating me in the holding that owns our company (M&amp;A is quite recent, so we’re not fully integrated. Next year we’ll join them in a new office, which will also be close to home)

So he made an agreement with the new MKT Director at the holding: that I’d be working for both of them for a while, and if the guy liked me, I’d be hired.  

I’ve been this guy’s bitch since March. Been working up to 4h past my shift (hey, I still have to attend college at night!!) and recently he demanded I moved to his office – 40km away from home, which means basically a 2h drive in the morning and another 2h in the night. 

When I said I wouldn’t go as an intern, that my condition would have to change, he said I was being evaluated and this would count. Grand finale to the conversation: he threatened to open my position to the market. So I went back to my old boss and said I wasn’t too confident, and was considering leaving the company. He spoke to our CEO, who personally asked me to stay and endorsed me as a great professional to new boss. New boss said I’d be hired in November and offered me a notebook, so I could work from both offices. Silly me took the offer.

Now I’m not getting any extra money, but my commitment to the company keeps growing. Also, the energy I’m investing is huge. In the other hand, he’s not very present (dude, then why do I have to stay in your office?!) and plus, he’s been showing some more and more authoritarian behavior.

The cherry on top happened today: he said I’m gonna have to go through HR selection processes, make tests and have an interview, so they can consider me among other applicants. He asked me how I feel about it and I had no much reaction, just said I was happy the company had such an elaborate assessment and that in the end, if I didn’t have the company’s profile it wouldn’t be good for any of us (WTF, aye?!)

Am I being too stubborn to get FUCKING pissed at this? I never heard of a job application that lasts 6 months, really. This is not a damn reality show.

Should I quit? If so, how should I do it?

1kic0p,2,2013-08-16,Long time depression/suicidal tendencies suddenly hit with divorce and a get out now. SAHM to toddler.,breakingupTA,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1kic0p/long_time_depressionsuicidal_tendencies_suddenly/,"I've had serious mental health issues most of my life.

This is just the event that broke the camels back; I've thought of killing myself before but never this tether to reality and my life has been severed.

My mom often has to take my young son to her house to watch him because of my severe depression, I'm unable to take care of him right now.

My husband and I have been married for coming up on four years (actually, our anniversary is in five days.) We've had our share of problems, but things we've always managed to work through.

Tuesday, he told me, totally as a shock, he doesn't love me anymore and that he hasn't in a long time. He doesn't want to continue the marriage or get counseling together. We actually slept on it and talked about it Wednesday morning.


That morning, he told me the things I've done wrong, and he accepted blame for some things. Mostly to him it comes down to ""not working well together"" but before this, we had ups and downs but nothing that seemed unfixable. We were fine now. He said he can't take it anymore. He doesn't know HOW to love me. That hurt so, so much...

but he did something wrong. Something you shouldn't do to someone who is emotionally unstable. He told me he CAN love me. That we'll be stubborn and work through this. He rubbed my back and held my hand. He told me we will work on this and make it right for our son.

I go out to dinner with my best friend. By the time I'm back, he told me he lied to me earlier and he just can't work on this marriage anymore. I've never felt so low. I can't even begin to describe it. I felt like he could have literally stabbed my heart and it would feel about the same. There is no WAY he's going to hurt me like this! That night I took quite a few pills just to ease the pain. The next day he said such hurtful things I hit my head into a concrete wall and pulled out wads of my hair. 

Things have gotten worse, of course. He's so cold. It's not the divorce but how cold he is that kills me. He doesn't acknowledge that I'm still in love with him, so he should be a bit kinder even if we are to split up and not make it work. We had passionate sex on Monday. There was no hint at all of a problem in the marriage. He insists it isn't someone else, but just recently he had an intern flirting with him but he took it to his boss because she was harassing him via work email.

Me: stay at home mom. No substantial income. No car. No place to go (my mom is a hoarder in her spare bedroom, no room. Son is fine there. Has baby room.). Some college, no job experience. No insurance to help with medication or counseling. 

I truly do not have any help for myself or my son. This has taken my severe depression to a new level. 

It wasn't a bad marriage that I should at least be optimistic about leaving. This was a fairly good marriage with a man I was/am totally in love with. It hurts me so much. His coldness is eventually what will end this for me.

I constantly fantasize about suicide now. The only thing that is stopping me is lack of courage. I didnt know where he went the other day, left in the middle of the night and asked a friend if he stayed there. The husband/wife team (who have had it out for me a bit, frenemies) decided to block me JUST BECAUSE I said ""Did (name) stay there last night?"" We'd been friends for six years. Sent my husband screenshot proof that is all I asked. 

I'm so bad that even the friend thing made me want to die. Everyone hears this diluted story of what actually happened with us. He stays out until 3 am partying and stuff and all of a sudden I call him at 2 am (when he was supposed to be home at 10) and I'm the bad guy and the c razy insecure wife. Hello. You're in your mid thirties, not 21. 

Everything is reminding me of what I should have done years ago before I had my child. I know that I am linked to him now, but it's hard to think when people just tell you that you should stay alive for your child. He's an amazing reason, but I feel like I have to suffer just for that reason.

I'm in a bad place. This has driven my elderly grandfather to be so upset (my divorce) that he is anxious and needs consoling. I'm consoling him for something I am grieving myself.


I'm not sure if I make a lot of sense. I typed this quickly. 


**TL;DR. History of severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Husband wants sudden divorce when we just made love on Monday and everything seemed fine. Stay at home mom with no income, work experience, or car.**"

I'm currently undecided as to whether I want to go down a software engineering career path, or a security/Information Assurance career path. I'm leaning more towards SE. Would the 4011 and 4012 certs be worth putting on a resume for a SE job search?  So far none of the SE job postings I've seen ask for any type of security background or credentials.

Would I be better served to just work on a personal project instead of getting the credentials?  I'm already doing an internship, but it's not related to security."

It seems that, if I'm not mistaken, that the consensus on this sub-reddit is that if you are hoping to work in industry, then it is more prudent to enter the workforce as early as possible, as to get more experience and move up to more senior positions. (I.e. Internships). 

In this vain, the costs of pursuing a PhD or MsC in CS (I.e. time) for those not interested in Academia, outweigh the limited benefits in career advancement gained through the extra schooling. 

**My Question boils down to this:**  Is there any portion of the industry where a candidate who takes extra couple of years to pursue advanced studies, be compensated for his/her efforts?

**TL/DR:** If I want to work as a Software Engineer, is there any point in getting a Masters or PhD?"

Not all of the credit, though. I deserve most of it. I worked my ass off.  

That being said, based on advice I read here, plus a growing interest in possibly getting a Ph.D., I quit my job in IT at the end of my sophomore year, and was lucky enough to get a job as a research assistant. I did that all summer, and throughout the course of the next year. The summer after my junior year, I got an internship with a pretty big tech company (I'll just say you've probably all owned / currently own products made by us and leave it there).  My internship ends tomorrow, and yesterday I was offered (and accepted) a full-time job once I graduate.

Information
-I will be attending the University of South Carolina.
-I am going to major in either Business-Management or International Business
-I am not on any financial aid due to scholarships and my parents preparing quite well for paying for my education.

Questions
-Should I join a Fraternity? (Growing up with 3 sisters I have always missed out on a sense of brotherhood, and this is why fraternities appeal to me. But I am not sure I want to commit that much of my life towards something I am not 100% about.)
-Does a High GPA or internships get you a job after graduation? 
-Should I take the time to join clubs and sign up for a lot of extra curricular activities?
-Should I major in business-management or international business?

-None of my friends or anyone from my school is going to the same school as me, and I am quite a shy person, I'm not weird or awkward or anything I just don't put myself out there. I was just wondering what is the best way to make friends and connect with complete strangers?

I will be a senior this fall at UMD studying civil &amp; environmental engineering. My school lumps these two together but seperates them into tracks. mine is water resources aka environmental. I have had 2 internships both dealing with stormwater and stream restoration. I have experience with CAD and GIS. I am not doing so well at school and have a 2.65 cumulative. I will work to boost my grades senior year but it is not possible for me to reach 3.0 which ive learned to accept. Because I am behind I will be hopefully graduating next august which is just 3 months beyond 4 years in total for my degree. Firstly, when is the right time to start applying to jobs. Should i start in spring or will people take me seriously in the fall and know in advance they need someone fall 2014? Will they look down on the fact that i am behind and not finishing until the summer? Or should I wait till spring or summer after I have finished my degree. I am not sure if companies typically offer you a position until after you graduate. My second concern is with the FE exam. Firstly is obvious do I have to take it to get a job and be content with my life? Will i regret it later or not be able to pass once ive forgotten material? Will companies only hire people who have passed? Also should i take the general engineering test, civil, or environmental? My grades are low and I struggle with material across the board so idk what my strengths are. What is the most effective strategy for preparing for this? I know it seems i am freaking out over stuff in the future but i really cant fuck up this year and am scared about not getting off on the right foot. Do i even have a shot at a decent job with my poor grades? Any advice is greatly appreciated"

1kkfe6,6,2013-08-17,"Worth quitting a rather dead-end ""programming"" internship to focus on school?",eatmyheadset,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kkfe6/worth_quitting_a_rather_deadend_programming/,"I'm going into my junior year of CS, and have worked my entire college career so far. It's been good, because I've been able to finance myself the entire time, have only had to take a tiny bit of loans (relatively), and haven't needed to rely on my parents for any support.

The downside is that my grades have suffered somewhat from having to balance work and school, and I've not been able to commit to taking as many classes as I need to in order to graduate when I'd like.

The current ""programming"" internship I've been doing since November has been alright in that it pays decent for a part time college student job in this area ($14/hour), but it isn't really teaching me anything or giving me any relevant skills. Calling what we do ""programming"" is a bit of a stretch. 

Anyway, I *think* I have enough money saved up that I could live off of until next Summer, at which point I plan on getting a much better summer internship. Quitting this job would free up enough time for me that I could focus a lot more on school, and my own personal projects. I've got a fairly decent stack of them that should look really good on my portfolio. I kind of feel like having those projects continually fleshed out/adding more, would be more impressive on my resume then staying at this dead end job another year. Something I wouldn't have much time for if I kept at this job come this next semester.

It would be taking a financial risk, but if I did run into financial issues there's a previous job that I'm pretty sure would hire me back in a heartbeat (and they've said as much in the past).

I guess I'm wondering whether someone with similar experiences can tell me of the virtues (or lack thereof) of not working while going to school, or whether I'm crazy and should just stay with what I have."

When first going to school at the age of 18, I really screwed up. I changed majors a hundred different times, and before I took an extended ""break"" from college, I left with a 2.7 GPA. This was all done at a Community College.

Years have passed, and I've been doing a bit better now. I'm a bartender at a hotel (Possible business internships.) and I own a house too. I'm ready to get back into school. I would really like to major in finance, with a minor in CompSci. I live in Dallas, Tx.

Here are my questions (thanks again for your help.)

How important is the school you choose in regards to Finance? 

My GPA is not exactly competitive, from what I hear, if I want to get into UT Austin, someone suggested to me that I change schools so my GPA doesn't transfer, and THEN ask for a transfer to UT Austin.

Your thoughts on that?

I live in Texas, but I would prefer to stay in the DFW area. What school would you recommend for me in regards to ROI, and more importantly risk?

Finally, given my major and my minor. What language would you recommend I begin learning? I'd imagine Mandarin, or German.


Thanks again everyone. The counselors here are way too busy to actually give me any sound advice, I'm looking for ANYTHING to help point me into the right direction."

[Hey Mandy, have you spoken to Aaron Sorkin about the whole ""Bad Mandy"" thing since the episode aired? What did he have to say for himself?  That whole thing was so fucking shady and it made me hate him even more than I already did. He's such a narcissist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgnxv?context=5)|He asked to get a drink with me a few weeks back. It was my first time I had seen him in a year since I wrote the story. Our drink lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. The first thing he said when I sat down was: ""I just have one question. Why did you do it?"" I told him that since he hadn't made good on his professional promise to use me as a consultant and had gotten an entire character and plotline inspired by me and inside information I told him, I felt that I at least deserved professional credit by writing a story about it. He then followed this with: ""So it was just revenge?"" And I said, no, it wasn't revenge. I didn't say that. He then said, ""You printed every email between us."" Which I did not. We have exchanged over a hundred emails and purposefully took out anything personal or embarrassing or intimate or not related to the development of the character he told me -- in writing -- that I inspired. During this drink, he continued to tell me that I had done the wrong thing, violated his privacy, it couldn't have come at a worst time, he thought we were friends with the potential to be something more, and had I NOT written that I would be making thousands a week because he would have hired me as a story editor. Then he started going into how if the show got picked up I would then eventually become producer and on and on. It reminded me of the scene where McAvoy buys the engagement ring just to try to torture McKenzie. He was never going to hire me. Even though the first thing I said when we got a drink back in 2011 was asking him to become a consultant and he said, done, I'll be in touch -- and let me know if you ever want to go a date. When I started to point out these things -- and how I could have really used the money and the credit and I never would have written about it had he come through on anything he told me, he said, ""How much do you think you deserve? I'll write you a check."" And then he changed the conversation pretty quickly after that. When he noted to me that I hadn't written him back after he wrote me after the article, I then repeated back to him an email he sent to me. The first email he sent me after the article ran basically said he was sorry it made me cry and was a kind note. The second email said, ""I deserved it because I'm getting a paycheck from HB fucking O? What would you do if I won the lottery, shoot my daughter in the face?"" I didn't respond to that one. But I quoted it back to him and said, ""My father -- who actually was shot twice in the face -- really enjoyed that email. He thought it was really witty."" At that point, Aaron stormed off. He then sent me an email with a bullet point list of items trying to counter everything I had told him. Whatever. I'm as complicit in that entire thing as him. When you have two people who are fairly manipulative dancing with one another and the best intentions are not involved, you come up with Nina Howard, one xoJane article and one angry Aaron Sorkin.
[Was there a five to ten minute self-important soliloquy full of smart people words involved?  Life, after all, does imitate art.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbph5w3?context=5)|You imagine it however you want to imagine it, friend. He's a smart man. I have a lot of respect for him. Hence me not being all Sydney Leathers about it but instead ""hey, I'm a shady starfucker and here's my story about the whole thing"" without revealing anything truly intimate or unrelated to the character development. That said, I'm glad that all of the following events conspired to inspire me to write the piece. These events were: I watched Scarface twice in a row on AMC after spilling lentil soup on the dress I wore for about a week straight, my friend Bonnie McFarlane texted me that the Hope Davis episode would be airing soon while I was living at home with my parents in San Diego -- and when I emailed Aaron about the episode saying some stupid suck-uppy thing like ""I knew it would be great"" got an auto-reply that said: ""This is no longer Aaron Sorkin's email address."" All of these events pretty much clinched my decision for me to write my story but do it in a self-effacing way. I'm rarely a scorch the earth type person. I hate hurting feelings and burning bridges. I think a lot of people bet on this with me. Oh, and I did call him when I got that auto-reply, and he gave me the new email, but the humiliation of this pretty much cemented that this dude was never coming through on any of the professional promises he made me. God bless. Love and light, dude.
[I wondered if that bit about the NY Post writer woman who tweeted about the snub from Will (from the most recent episode\) had anything to do with this situation... thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpssll?context=5)|I'm behind a couple episodes because I was interviewing Hannibal Buress for my podcast at his Sunday night Knitting Factory show and then Breaking Bad trumped Newsroom obviously.

[Has it sunk in yet that there won't be any more episodes of Enlightened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfz79?context=5)|Ugh. it does suck. But I got more over it from falling in love with new shows -- and from weeping at the perfect ending to Season 2. I'm glad he closed it up so nice. I don't know if there's anything on TV that has made me feel quite the same way is that show, though. It really affected me emotionally and viscerally.
[Don't you freak out about your mother reading your articles?  That's totally why I don't write about my own life under my real name.  Also, why do you follow me on Twitter?  (My twitter handle's not the same as my Reddit handle, so this is more of a ""why do you follow who you follow?""\)  And finally, as you're such a fan of porn and supporter prostitution, have you ever considered these as a career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphyno?context=5)|I wouldn't say I'm such a fan of porn or a supporter of prostitution. I had a bizarre assignment at The Post involving a prostitute and I took it. I was asked if I thought sex workers should be decriminalized and I do. I've watched porn occasionally and I think it takes a lot of strength to be a sex worker. I guess my thinking would be that your question could be compared to asking a woman who is pro-choice, ""If you're such a fan of abortion, why don't you become an abortion doctor?"" Or even, ""Why don't you get one?"" My biggest aim in a lot of the things I write or talk about it is to try to break down the Madonna/whore paradigm where you are either ""such a fan of sexy sexy sex sex"" or you are a good girl who knows that in polite society our mothers might read things and we can't admit that we are sexual creatures because that then makes us BAD. None of this is a slag on you, I'm just trying to explain this the best way I know how. My mom is a very interesting individual in that she and my father both have masters in counseling and say that they raised us as if ""life were just a big encounter group."" Which I think explains a lot. She is a provocateur who married a guy because he was even angrier than her father. So I think I've always been raised to try to challenge things -- and for me demonizing or even quickly categorizing a woman for tainting her prestige by talking about sexuality is an area I like to unpack. All of this said, I remember telling my mom about a threeway for the first time, and I was mortified. I had never felt such shame. So much shame. I've worked a lot to fight against shame, which I think does a lot more harm than good. As for following you on Twitter, I used to use TweetAdder which would auto-follow people of similar interests so that might be how I found you. I definitely employed on Twitter the strategy of following a lot of people to increase my own follows. I'm using ManageFlitter now to try to trim it down, but I'm still over 20,000 which is pretty ridiculous.
[Hey Mandy,  What is the best resource for the best juice re: non-hollywood figures, in your opinion? I'm thinking things like Valley Wag, Jim Romenesko, etc. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpiyk2?context=5)|Oh man, that's interesting. Well, I have a separate Twitter that I use since I follow so many people on my main Twitter that staying up to date on things as a breaking news source isn't the best. That (secret) Twitter is @mandystat which I first registered just for people who misspelled my name. But I've come to use it as a feed for all things breaking news. I've had interns find sources to follow. My big cheat is this: Go TO the sources and see who THEY follow. So for instance, we write about issues of sexuality at my web site so I don't just follow Dan Savage on that breaking-news-focused Twitter I've gone through and followed who HE follows. Because a lot of times that is how news is breaking nowadays. I think a lot of news gets culled from reddit and 4chan. I would look at who Adrian Chen from Gawker follows on Twitter. That guy breaks so many great stories. I think the key is to just keep going deeper and going primary-source. Anonymous and Wikileaks are good obviously. College sites are great for stories -- like, just look at how many stories from Gawker have simply been ganked from Ivgate.com or just by repurposing and repackaging breaking news with YouTube video from the @ap feed. Great question! I think there are also a lot of message boards that have great subcommunities in them, but I mostly stick to twitter and reddit. I'd like to get deeper into 4chan and Anonymous though. I had someone recently contact me offering to give me hacker news. I should probably take him or her up on it. I love that stuff. Also -- did you know there are whole parts of the Internet that exist in secret? I have to share these links... written about by Gawker at some point, of course. But I need to find them. It'll take me a second...

[How's the dating life treating you ?!  I feel like its been awhile since I saw a story on XoJ. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphkdc?context=5)|It's been okay. I'm still seeing that guy I wrote about in the ""grown-ass man"" article. He's a really good guy. I'm not sure where it will go, but I enjoy him. I'm trying to go pretty opposite day in terms of my dating life. I used to be very hellbent on getting married again by 40 (because I got all freaked out by ""Marry Him"" that Lori Gottlieb book I like to joke fucked me harder than any man could) but now I think I'll be fine. I have oily skin so tend to look younger than my age (not drinking helps too) and I think I'll make my own money and I never have trouble finding someone to date or have a relationship with -- so I think I'm looking at the whole thing as less of a societal challenge now. It's like the song ""Little Boxes,"" you know? I always think of that song when I think about how you really don't have to go down one path. I feel like having this attitude is making me value myself, my time and definitely leading to me coming from a much stronger position of power (which can be hard for women who have esteem issues). Also, last week the dude I'm seeing -- I called him The Rugby Player -- brought me flowers and popsicles and sushi pre-Breaking Bad, which was dope.
[Oh you're gorgeous, I don't think you'll have any problem in the looks department.  If anything I think guys will be intimidated by you.  Heh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpi071?context=5)|Honestly, anyone intimidated by a woman or a man, my advice? Just ask her out anyway. She'll either say yes or no or not respond, but I think it's so great to push yourself to try. I've written about how shy I used to be. The only way I've gotten at all confident is by pushing my way, inch by inch, with things that intimidated me. Sorry to be all Earnesto Cheese, but whatever, I believe in that shit :) So many great people who don't try things because they're intimidated. And who cares? A million failures is a huge success because you went for it, dude. Jesus. I think now I'm just like straight up cribbing Wayne Gretzky.
[What has been your favorite or most memorable interview you've done? Also how was the whole male prostitute thing lol? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfyv5?context=5)|I always point to Billie Joe Armstrong at the VMAs because I adore him and found talking to him electrifying. But Dr. Brad Blanton probably changed me the most when we talked about radical honesty. The male prostitute felt like an undercover reporting assignment challenge slash bad date -- in that I had to shower with him immediately. It was like proving I wasn't a narc with no wire. (Even though I guess I kind of was.)
[Do a lot of bad dates start out that way for you? I can't remember a bad date that started that way. Though I can't remember a good date that started that way. Unrelated side note I can't remember a date.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpg745?context=5)|Ha, no. Although I've hooked up a few times with strangers from Craigslist Casual Encounters back in the crazy-party-day (2009 mostly) and that did lead to being naked pretty quickly.
[Are you interested in screenwriting? Written anything you're hoping to get produced? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphn9r?context=5)|I'm very interested in screenwriting. I haven't given it a serious go since I wrote an Arrested Development spec script in 2005. (I've written a few other old specs besides, but my comedy writing and my writing in general have improved a lot since.) I think I'd like to try another spec or two. My thinking is that I need to finish my book -- which needs a lot more work -- and most likely if that got optioned then I would have input in that regard and learn more about screenwriting that way. I also have the monologue packet and the sketch packet that landed me as a top 3 finalist writing for Jimmy Fallon and he said when we met, ""You're here because we love your packet,"" but alas, I did not get that gig and those sketches were not produced. Eventually. I have time! Are you a screenwriter? Do you have any advice here?
[Would you ever do stand up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgt34?context=5)|I've done standup. Full time? No. But you can google to see some things of me online.
[Much appreciate the advice! I'll be grabbing that book tomorrow, before spending the rest of the day procrastinating against better judgement, because, hey, that's *always* step one. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpism8?context=5)|Nope. Fuck that shit. No cutesy putting yourself down ""Art of the Gifted Child"" b.s. Do it. Fail. And then sometimes succeed. Seriously, do it :) Make one of your friends a partner in motivating you. Or find a MeetUp group of writers who will hold you accountable. Seriously! &lt;3.
[""art of the gifted child"". Hilarious. I'm into it and, of course, you're right. Matter of fact, I'm going to hit page 1 tonight. Lets make a pact-- first one to the Newsroom writers room burns it down. HBO, here I come. I'm joking but seriously, thanks for being cool and offering some wise words. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpixup?context=5)|I love motivation from Internet people! And yes, first one of us who is a producer gives 10 percent of the earnings to charity! That's what you said yeah? Glad you piped in here, and fuckyeah Art of the Gifted Child references!
[How or what do you generally think about your readers or audience? do you imagine them (us\) as supportive friends? a crowd you're trying to win over? voyeuristic drama-addicts slavering for their next intimacy fix? who do you generally write for, or to, and how do you keep reminders of other less-that-ideal audiences from negatively affecting your work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpkah7?context=5)|That's a pretty great question. I think that I try to remember my own advice that I give to people in terms of networking and the career world. Which is demonstrating value. I try to do it either by telling a good story, starting an interesting discussion or providing insights I might be able to offer. The ones who I have interacted with in comments I really care for, as a lot of times their reactions are what inspires me right back.
[What's your take on the whole Bustle thing? Especially as a writer for a publication that caters to, oh you know, all the things Bryan Goldberg said no existing publications currently cater to for women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpg2r0?context=5)|I was pretty surprised by that statement as were a lot of people it seems like from checking Twitter and seeing how many people took the piss out of him for that exact statement. Having said that, I was impressed at the writing when I checked out the site. Especially the #solidarityisforwhitewomen article. Then again, I haven't gone back since. Maybe on principle because of that statement. What do you think of it? Are there comments? The few articles I looked at seemed to have no place for discussion, which maybe is on purpose? To share articles only on social and then let little mini-discussions emerge from there? Or did I just miss something?
[Provocative, eh? What is the most weiners you have had in your mouth in 24 hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgfmi?context=5)|In the last 24 hours? None. I'm mostly seeing this one guy and I see him every few weeks because my work keeps me so busy. The most weiners I've had in my sex in 24 hours? Probably three. Maybe two. Never more than one at a time to be clear not that there's anything wrong with that. (And if this is my mom asking the question, HEY GURRRL HEYYY)
[Before switching gears; my friend wants to know if there is such a thing as too small. He would ask himself, but I'm far too shy. Err, not me, him! He is too shy about his package. Mine is great!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgnyl?context=5)|I've been with a few guys who had extremely small penises. It was fine. They have other skills. Who cares. A lot of times big-dicked guys are the laziest in bed. It's all about skills in my opinion. Also, unrelated but sort of related, I gave a friend the WeVibe I had sent me from a publicist, and she said it was amazing for increasing sensation and pleasure. Not an official endorsement as I've never even used it. But I think that might be the market for that thing. Dudes with small peen.
[What podcast do you host? Sorry my question sucks but you deserve a question for actually doing a 3 hour AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpjc3n?context=5)|Hey there. I host a podcast called ""News Whore,"" which debuted last month and has been consistently in the top 50 comedy podcasts on iTunes (its highest ranking was #22 after I did O&amp;A). We've had guests like Colin Quinn, Taylor Negron and this week was Hannibal Buress who was fucking hilarious. Free to subscribe which you can do here: [Link to riotcast.com](http://riotcast.com/newswhore) Thanks for letting me plug! :)
[What grudges are you holding and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgwmq?context=5)|I hold a lot of grudges against my father. But it's hard because he has a head injury (sorry to be a broken record about the whole blind shot dad, but my dad survived two AK-47 rounds in Vietnam, then met my mom, then had my sister, then had me). So I try to look at my grudges as opportunities for: What is the lesson here? What is there for me to learn? Sometimes it's patience. Sometimes it's that I need to be my own person. Sometimes it's that I need to have a backbone. Sometimes it's that I don't have to let someone else's energy affect my own. Other grudges, mostly personal. A lot of times they're pretty pain and grief based. Doing Al-Anon has helped a lot with that. The whole detaching with love technique is baller.
[When is News Whore coming out?! Not the podcast; the book!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfy44?context=5)|I've got a prequel coming out any day now which is a compendium of my blog posts from 2004-2010. The roman a clef about The Post I want to do well and take a bit of time with. My goal is 2014.
[Aside from Al-Anon, do you have any advice or go-to resources for people who grew up with similar situations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphdlq?context=5)|Don't knock Al-Anon. You parents don't even have to be alcoholics. They can just be dysfunctional. Reading ""Courage to Change"" was like a soothing tonic. Finding a great therapist is good. EMDR is touted by a lot of people. In terms of therapists recs, going on the resource page at caron.org is a start, and emailing or calling them for recs can be one way to go. I did the Caron Breakthrough program which allows for dramatic re-enactments to be done of situations like this. For some reason it helps. The therapist asked me to let out the tension I felt from my childhood and I emitted two bloodcurdling screams. I need to scream more. I think it really does release energy. And you can do it in a pillow. Just like Lydia on Breaking Bad. Also meditation can be helpful. And writing a letter to someone saying ""What I got from you was X, but what I needed was Y."" It lets you give voice to things that you may have been storing up. Louise Hay's ""Releasing Anger"" meditation is good, too. I also found ""Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma"" to be really tremendous, but I've never done the experiential therapy they talk about in the book -- but there are several excellent practitioners of it.
[Thanks so much, you have no idea how helpful this is.  Not knocking, just curious about the other resources you'd recommend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphtkn?context=5)|Awesome! And yeah, I've been to some shit Al-Anon meetings. Go to like 4 or 5 and see if you meet one or two people who you think might be chill to talk to. There's something about talking to like-minded people that can be really helpful I find. Also, do you do morning pages? I've been getting back into them recently at 750words.com and it's definitely helping my focus and working out my shit.
[Thanks for the motivation!  I've thought about trying again for a long time.  (But I actually always recommend it to people, who are also hesitant about going.  Is there a meeting for people who hate the idea of going to meetings?\) I do write morning pages at 750 words, and because of you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpjk52?context=5)|That's tremendous. I'm trying to get up the motivation to do the 750 words for today even though it's 5:30pm but I think I'm going to make myself :)
[Anything that's off-limits in your comedy or writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgv4b?context=5)|The stories of other people who haven't given me permission to tell these stories -- unless they are a public figure and their actions have warranted discussion. Exhibit A: Andy Dick. Exhibit B: First legal male prostitute. Exhibit C: Aaron Sorkin taking inside information I gave him, telling me he would make me a consultant, failing to do so and me writing an article about this portion of our relationship -- but nothing, mind you, truly intimate or explicit.
[If the pen is mightier than the sword, than why do actions speak louder than words?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgfo9?context=5)|Your question is relying on the supposition that I agree with the first statement, my dear secret international spy friend. I would counter that a sword's ability to behead the gentleman writing the pithy phrase ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" proves yet again that actions speak louder than words. I'm an action girl. Too much bullshit in the world. It's a waste of time.

[Can you introduce me to James Franco? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgnpu?context=5)|No, but I can recommend that you watch his episode of ""30 Rock."" It is very funny.
[I love that episode! Are you excited for Tina Fey's return to television? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbph4r3?context=5)|Absolutely. Bossypants is essential reading for women anywhere and everywhere. Have you read it? Go read it. I will go to the Met and you must read that. (Or even audiobook it, as her telling made me legitimately laugh several times.)
[I have read it! ""That's Don Fey"" could be about my dad except he's Jamaican. I also love the prayer for her daughter. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphf5v?context=5)|I forget the prayer. What is the prayer?
[Anyone tell you you resemble Jodi arias?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbprecs?context=5)|In my personality or my appearance? And no. I mostly get Jenna Elfman.
[I really am sorry if this offends a bit, but in the first podcast...is that your real laugh? I remember listening and thinking 'that can't be her real laugh'. It seemed more natural towards the end, but it really caught me off guard at the beginning. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgk5j?context=5)|HA! That's okay, it's so funny because I was horrified by the first instance of my laugh in the first podcast. I actually really like my laugh but yeah it's way over the top in that first one. I think I was trying to like BRING THE ENERGY or something, but yeah, it was the worst. I even asked Graham to tone it down in post, which I think he ignored because it's a dumb request.
[Hello Mandy.  Man, I feel like I've gone through a really intense Mandy Bootcamp for the past 4 hours. All the while watching Yanks/Red Sox at Fenway, with Turner Classic Movies on in the background. YET here I am reading and taking in every thought your brain has generated. Amazon Prime will be hooking me up with that book suggestion you told someone was worthy of eyeballs; ""My Story Can Beat Up Your Story""--hopefully it's coming from AZ or NV and just hopping on a jet plane for a morning delivery. My reading best starts at 4am. Until I'm sidetracked by the next great thing. Which in this case, it's been following your insight and stories and ideas and LINKS. Spankwire is not bad. Oh boy, I digress, Mandy. For the longest time Sorkin's vice was cocaine. What was your vice, Mandy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpk66h?context=5)|Hey, that is awesome. I also love the way you wrote this. I feel like I'm right there with you. Honestly, my vice is work. I've done coke about six times, and it's what led me to stop everything and get sober three years ago because I liked it so much.
[Hey Mandy, I know you're a big fan of books! What books are you currently reading right now?  Also, I know you probably get this one a lot: what advice do you have for writers who have stories cueing up in their brain but are apprehensive about pitching them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpmj20?context=5)|I'm mostly reading dog training books right now :) ""Civilizing the City Dog"" is the one on my bedside table. I have a few audio books I haven't been all that motivated to listen to, but the start of ""The Survivors Club"" sounded good. As for getting the courage to pitch, I think people should definitely get over their mental blocks -- but before they pitch they should do their research to see what else is out there and then write a paragraph of what the meat of the story is to see if there really is a story along with the headline they envision. Doing all these things guarantees that you really have a story in the first place.
[What was it like working with cat marnell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphyn7?context=5)|I didn't work with her. I've met her once. At the xoJane launch party where I networked my way in (I wasn't even originally on the list). She offered me Adderall. I declined. That was the extent of our interaction. I love her writing, though. Especially her Whitney Houston piece. It's extraordinary. I also think she's gorgeous and has great style. I'm excited for her book. (I also dig AJ, if she's still dating him.)
[What is it like working with other xoJaners?  Do you enjoy the work environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpil1u?context=5)|They're awesome. I largely work from home because I spend a lot of nights and weekends on news-related stories. But I really love all the people who work there. Jane inspires me to take chances even more. Emily inspires me to be stronger and more fearless. Corynne inspires me to be better organized. Lesley inspires me to be a better feminist. Madeline inspires me to be better at social media. Olivia inspires me to be a better photographer. Marci inspires me to be more wordsmithy. Annie inspires me to be more DGAF in general. And all the contributors are fantastic as well. Alison is incredibly lovely and generous, and I can't wait to hang with her when I (eventually) make an LA visit.
[How many times did Reed Tucker sniff your chair at the NY Post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpk4wv?context=5)|Ha. Never, obviously, but for the record: That guy is one of the funniest people I've ever met.
[Do you think prostitution should be decriminalized?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpfzws?context=5)|Yes. Do you?
[Yes I do. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpg1hk?context=5)|That is one of my first date questions you know. I have three. #1 What are your Top 5 favorite movies? (The Graduate, Annie Hall, Heathers, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, When Harry Met Sally). #2 Have you ever hired a prostitute? (Yes.) #3 What drugs have you done? (Pot, acid, cocaine.)
[Do you have a similar top 5 list of books?  I need some mind expansion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgap9?context=5)|That's a really good question. I'm going to come up with one now. OK, here goes: Lord of the Flies, Catcher in the Rye, 1984, them (by Joyce Carol Oates), A Taste of Power (Elaine Brown). How's that? And you?
[Yeah I get that most likely if a person has hired one they prob agree to decriminalization.  But you never know.  Edit: could be a cop who busted/hired one on your date.  yuck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpggah?context=5)|I used to read cop reports of prostitute busts when I worked in the cop shop and covered night cops for The Des Moines Register. It was pretty skeevy. A lot of the women got pretty far in proving they were prostitutes. Cops, man. (Although I secretly kind of want to be one because, The Wire.)
[I am always envious of people with vivid recollections of their dreams -- it's rare that I remember anything.  Are you big into the ""My subconscious is trying to tell me something!"" theory?  Maybe mine is not interested or something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgu4x?context=5)|Yeah part of it is me taking Zoloft. It leads to insane dreams. But I've always had vivid dreams -- but I definitely notice that when I take Zoloft they are even more heightened. I once had a really terrible dream and I was so disturbed by it and this lovely reiki practitioner I saw (Britta Dubbels, who used to be this super-sexed up model so google her just for that) said something great which I always think about. She said that a lot of times our subconscious can be purging out what we don't need in our dreams. So when they are dark and disturbing, I like to think of it as a purging -- my body working out what it doesn't need.
[Do you think that anyone is out to get you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphcrq?context=5)|Naw. I think have people who don't like me and don't like what I write or say, but I doubt I have any active plotters of my demise.
[Can I admit that I'm from Baltimore and I refuse to watch The Wire b/c I don't want to see my city that I capital L-LOVE portrayed poorly?  But I love good television.  It's a dilemma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpjrnd?context=5)|Watch it. The extraordinary goodness of some of the characters will make you glad you did. But it will also break your heart at times. I feel like a more enriched person for having seen it. I really do.
[You seem especially proficient at translating your skills/strengths across fields and quantifying your achievements in your professional life/in how you market yourself.  Is that something that you've learned over time or does it come naturally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphwf9?context=5)|It comes from 7 years at The New York Post and thousands upon thousands of pitches sent my way seeing how hard it is for people to focus and realizing that no one really cares about anyone but themselves. I wrote a little about this in the branding series I wrote on xoJane. And it's what I've done as a paid consultant a few times for people who have hired me to come up with a name for their brand or to distill what they would be wise to focus on. A few big secrets: consistency, having one big idea, having secrecy at all (why do you think those stupid fake speakeasies were so big), having extreme empathy with how other people give zero fucks about you or the players in your world and ""owning"" whatever it is that may be the most difficult thing for you to own. For me, I would say that is the whole play on words of News Corp with the News Whore thing. I can be a bit of a media whore and also probably ""slutty"" by mainstream society's standards. When you own it, magical things happen.
[Is it too late for me to be a ballerina? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgyz5?context=5)|Yes. And it's too late for me to be a cop. Cutoff is 35, sadly. For a ballerina it's probably even younger, believe it or not. That said, still take a ballet course! And I will still get a P.I. license, because I can damn it.
[What disgusts you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbphwqi?context=5)|People who are always right. Entitlement. Sadism. Majoring in the minor. Living in test tubes of idealism with no basis in reality. Pathetic attempts to bullshit a bullshitter. And all the usual horrible shit.
[What do you imagine people say when they gossip about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgb1b?context=5)|Well I can read things that people write at GOMI but those people don't know me so I suppose that's different. Bad gossip? That I act like I know everything, too aggro, annoying, it's all about me.
[Where is the most regrettable place you've ever canoodled and with whom?  Bonus points for an arrest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kj2ks/im_mandy_stadtmiller_ama/cbpgsq9?context=5)|I've never been arrested. Perhaps the dude who played a key role in me getting sober who i went to a sex club with in 2010. So yeah, canoodling with sex club boy at the sex club.

1kizxo,3,2013-08-16,Internships: is it important to appear loyal?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kizxo/internships_is_it_important_to_appear_loyal/,"Hi all, I'll first describe my situation.

I am an entering 3rd year, likely doing 5 years to get my BS in CS. I have an internship this summer (2013) at a well-known company. I also have another internship at a different well-known company this coming fall. I already feel a little odd at my summer internship, like I'm basically leeching all of the knowledge at one company to go use it at another. 

Adding on to that is my feeling that I'm in a good position for an internship at one of the big 4 next summer (2014). This is because of my (no longer nonexistent) work experience, a *really* great semester last spring, and research experience that's been ongoing.

Now my worries.

1) Applying for a summer internship while I'm in the middle of a fall internship will look bad. What do I say when interviewers ask me why I'm applying for the job? Is it at all appropriate to leverage a current internship to secure a future one?

2) While I want to sample the industry as much as possible, I don't want to get a reputation as a ""serial intern"". I know that many of you are full-timers; what is the perception of interns who continuously hop between companies? Is this a positive, a negative, or a wash?

Any insight that you all can provide would be really helpful."
1kisz9,19,2013-08-16,"I'm joining the Army for 4 years, and while in I have the opportunity to get a degree. Should I do that, or think about my deep down desire to move to the midwest and work a trade/manual labor job when I get out? Details inside",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kisz9/im_joining_the_army_for_4_years_and_while_in_i/,"I'm a 20 year old guy, and I'm leaving for the Army in a few months. I have a great job secured, IT Specialist, and as part of training I go to tech school to learn the basics of networking and stuff like that. That in itself is cool, and there's lots of tuition assistance options and programs that will make it super easy for me to get a degree while in. I have a 4 year contract, so I might be able to complete a B.A. by then, but if not then it can just extend out into my civilian life. I could get a degree in IT, MIS, business, it could be anything. So theoretically that combined with my Army experience and the tech school and getting certifications, I should hopefully be pretty well off upon coming out. 

That is the safe option, and it sounds really appealing. I have a general interest in computers and technology (I got that job because I put it as my job preference, not really expecting to get it because its rare). So before enlisting I hadn't really thought of a career after that. However, I don't want to dive fully into a degree in IT on top of my other training if I don't really like it. I like the idea of working in the Army in IT because it'll be dynamic (I will have Airborne and Ranger training so I can work in some cool locations), but upon getting out, do I want to work in an office?

I've always had this sort of fantasy that I move out to some part of the country that most people wouldn't want to go to, 'the middle of nowhere' if you will, and working a manual labor or trade job. Maybe start my own business of some sort. Something not very huge, something modest, like the guys who cut branches from trees or work on windmills or welding or just something like that. I know this sounds dumb that I don't know the specifics, but the thought of working during the week at a hard job, making enough money to get by and enough to support some cool activities like hunting and fishing (hence living in that kind of area, but location isn't important for this question) sounds lovely to me. Rather than working in an office and working toward that with internships and being stressed all the time...

I'm rambling, and I'm sorry this is long, but any insight would be appreciated. I'm joining the Army for the adventure, travel, and for service to the country. I don't want to go for a full career, because I'd want more personal freedom, but a 4 year enlistment is just right. After that....I could use the skills I have from that time to work in IT and be secure, or 'throw it away' and work for a living. I don't know what I truly want, so its not a case of merely picking what I want more. They both sound great to me. So any general advice? Anyone go through a similar situation? How hard would it be to make a path for myself in a new place after leaving the Army? Thank you for any discussion or tips or advice. 

TL;DR: I'm enlisting in the Army for 4 years, I have an IT job (IT Specialist, networking, routers, switches, etc, basic stuff). While in, I could get a degree if I want. Should I do that and work a 'real job' when I get out with that degree, or go another route, where I go to some random place thats comfortable, work a manual labor job or start my own business, and just live simply. Any advice? "

I haven't been able to find any relevant programming internships for the school year that are paid. I have internships doing reports development and IT/tech support under my belt, but I feel I really need something in the area of software/programming since that's the field I want to enter. I would likely be doing software engineering material (unpaid) for this internship for about 10 hours a week. 

I feel like my skills are worth something, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot by turning this down and having no programming internships completed when I graduate this spring.  I also dislike the idea of doing paid work for free. 

I don't know if pay would even be negotiable for this internship, but somehow I feel not (I guess I'll know when I start next month). What should I do?  Looking for the smartest decision here in the long term.

So in CS, I'm basically taking freshman/sophomore year classes this year, and junior/senior classes next year.

I'd really like to get a more CS-oriented internship this summer, and I'm not sure how to list my year/major.  It seems a bit disingenuous to call myself a junior CS major, when I'm really not at that level of classes yet.  From my transcript, that will be very obvious, but I don't want my initial description to be misleading.

Btw.. The processor has such a low price because I got it As a combo with the mobo for $100 off.

I'll be using this build for gaming and programming as I get into college next year. I mainly play Starcraft II. Other than that, I'll be trying out Planetside 2 and Splinter Cell Blacklist that came with the video card. Idk if I'll get time to play any other games. I know it might be an overkill but I worked as an intern this summer and just spent most of the money I made on this build to make it last the longest it can by getting better parts.

Finally.. the pics: [HERE](http://imgur.com/a/5BTOt#0) ya go. One thing though, I love taking pics so there might be too much ^.^

I'll be doing some benchmarking and will report the results in an hour or so.

EDIT: Sorry for being late: [here](http://imgur.com/a/TUNPr#0) the bench marking results!

Questions:
1) How long can I expect this PC to live?

2) How long before I need to change the cooler? How long can I expect the Liquid cooler to last without destroying my processor?

3) I haven't tried overclocking yet, is it helpful? I don't really play any high-end games on ultra so.. do I need that speed? Will it hurt my processor's longetivity?

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I'll try to answer them."

I have already read the sidebar links but am unsure about how to start the process, especially considering there are a few unique aspects of my job.

For example, the position I was offered is not a traditional job title, but one where I'll be doing rotations around the company in various areas ranging from being an analyst, project manager, or application developer--thus making it a little difficult to do the research. 

I have heard from colleagues before in this current position, during my internship with the company, that their salaries were around $70,000. However, they were also CS majors.

While I do have intro to intermediate college course knowledge in Java, C/C++ and Python--I have never actually utilized any of these skills outside of class. However, I have done basic web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Wordpress.

**(tl;dr)** So two questions:
1.) How would I initiate the conversation? 
2.) What are some things I can leverage considering my position? (i.e. being an MIS graduate with a BBA)"

I've also dabbled with the idea of staying an extra semester or two and getting a minor in Chinese or another language. I don't have to worry about College expenses as my other jobs, which are long term part-time, and very flexible, can easily cover the costs. 

Assuming I pursued the the same amount of internships, which is the better use of my time? Going and just getting the computer science degree, double majoring, or going and double majoring + the minor in a foreign language?

1kn117,1,2013-08-18,Academic research assistant (RA) vs private experience for graduates,mikeyinthesfl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kn117/academic_research_assistant_ra_vs_private/,"Abstract:
I'm wondering how experience working in CS research (as an RA) in a university is looked at in recent graduates. Again, this is for academia, not private R&amp;D.  How does that compare to a grad who, let's say worked as a webmaster for a local business or did an internship, etc. while in school?

Full Text:
I'm computer science undergrad and currently working for the cryptology and infosec research  group at my university.  I work for 2 different professors in that group. One is Python, the other is mixed C++ and Java.  Very interesting work and security is definitely my area of interest. My job is mostly number theory and linear algebra, neither of which I knew much about when I started but both of which I learned a lot about.  I'm not an RA (no assistantship), just a cryptology programmer (paid as an undergrad student assistant).  I might be able to apply for RA positions if/when I get grad status.  My grades are excellent (but I've heard that grades don't mean squat when you apply to a company after graduation, it's all about what you can or cannot do).  

Right now, I'm the only undergrad (in either math or cs) that I'm aware of that actually works in a research group (undergrads are almost always directed-independent-study meaning they paid to take a class to be allowed to do something for the prof).  Everyone else is mostly grad (mostly phd students) or the actual senior professors in charge, so it can get intimidating sometimes.  I try to be as helpful as possible, write the cleanest code possible, ask for the fewest explanations, and do my work as quickly as possible with the highest level of quality I am capable of.  Basically I just try to shut my mouth, and make myself as 'small' as possible.  I guess I'm like 'beaker', like a lab assistant but for cryptology.  I truly enjoy my work and my programming skills have gotten noticeably better, and the extra math really let's me understand more in my classes.

My question is, am I better off staying in this job, going for the master's in cs (another semester and I can apply), and going for an RA position?  Or better to try to work for private companies as a coder?  If you vote for me going after an RA position, then should it be in the CS dept or should I try to keep my position with crypto as well?  This is already 2 jobs for me now, so would it advisable to try for an internship or part-time in industry on top of this?

I've tried making submissions on this subreddit and others (under different accounts) and forums but usually they just die away without a reply. Considering that I have nowhere else to turn, I would really appreciate advice (no matter how simple or concise it is). I'll try to keep this short.

I've completed around 60 hours of coursework at a good state university with a top 15 business school. I was planning on getting a business major but was rejected from entering the business school this summer. I'm paying out-of-state tuition, so to me, it seems reasonable that I should transfer and get the degree I originally came for instead of settling for a degree that I don't want.

I like to think that I'm intelligent. I had poor grades in high school but got into my current university because I scored in the 97% percentile on the SAT. have a decent academic record in college. My GPA is 3.33, mostly because of poor performance during my first fall semester. This last semester I took 21 credit hours and came out with a 3.55. I have a decent list of extra-curricular involvement that's relevant to my major.  

So school starts in a week and it makes no sense to go back since I can't get a degree that I want there. I hope to either take a semester or two off until the point where I can submit transfer applications. Right now I'm working a part time job at a fast food restaurant and desperately want to get something that will make me more appealing to a school, but as you might imagine, internship opportunities are sparse on such short notice.

I've been submitting applications to open positions but haven't heard anything back, despite tailored cover letters and résumés. I feel like I'm completely screwed right now and in a hopeless situation, but I'm really eager to try anything that will help me out of it.

Can /r/jobs offer me any advice?

1krc4d,1,2013-08-20,Internship Help,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1krc4d/internship_help/,I'm an ECE major. I started applying for internships for next summer and already I've been rejected from 7 companies. I feel like in order to get an internship I'm going to have to take one at a company I don't like or in an area that doesn't interest me. How do you get around this?
1kr2pp,5,2013-08-20,Finally seeking treatment,Alihandreu,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kr2pp/finally_seeking_treatment/,"I just found this subreddit and I'm already feeling better about myself. I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age and was treated for it all through grade school until I graduated. I stopped medicating and taking advantage of help when I first entered college. I think this was a pride issue along with the thought that the real world wouldn't give a crap about my condition. For the most part I've done alright in college, except for last year and especially last Spring. It was my fourth year of college and I was on track to graduate this December. Last Spring I failed two classes and got a D in another. I just couldn't get organized last semester and it severely affected my grades. Now I won't be able to graduate until May and I'm costing myself and my parents a lot more money. This Summer I've been at an internship and still haven't managed to get my act together.


What really opened my eyes though was a whole debacle with getting approval to live off campus. I never filled out the paperwork because I forgot about it. I went to residence life and was told the only way I would be approved would be to either get married or be approved my disabilities to live off campus. Well, I wasn't going to suddenly get married so I went to the disabilities office with my ADHD diagnosis and they told me I needed to get a doctor's letter to be approved for off campus but in the meantime, I could be approved for other services like extended test time or extended due dates. After a lot of hassle and having my parents get involved, I got approval to live off campus. This whole ordeal, as well as my last years performance has really shown me that I need to get my act together if I'm going to be a successful person. My parents insurance, which I'm still on, is changing soon but as soon as that is all settled I'm going to find a psychiatrist near me and get counseling and get back on medication. I'm happy with myself now and although I'm still struggling right now, soon it will all be better and I can focus on being a functioning person again.

I currently intern at a big 4 media company in tv news, but graduated with my grade degree 2 weeks ago. As a result, the internship is ending in 2 weeks and school is now done. 

A month ago, I interviewed at a marketing agency that does ratings analytics (my field), and was just called this morning with an offer, albeit below the salary level I requested, but it's a solid opportunity. 

Here's the problem: I have two weeks notice from this Wednesday (if I accept, the new job starts August 4th) and when I spoke with the hiring manager, I told him I wanted to take some time to think about the offer and I will get back to him tomorrow - I said this because I wasn't sure what else to do regarding talking this over with some friends and family. However, I just found out, post phone call, that I might be able to secure a full time position here at the media company, moving my year long internship to a salaried position. Ideally this is WAY more preferable than the other position because I have experience, friendships, and a love for this current internship. To discuss this chance to stay here, is on Friday with my current supervisor as I set up a meeting with her moments ago. 

Can I tell the hiring manager at the media agency that I wanted more time to consider this offer, or will this be perceived negatively and could result in them pulling it before I officially sign? Ideally I want to see how Friday will pan out, then get back to other company on acceptance, if I know my internship will end indefinitely. 

Any information helps guys.

She is an intern there and we occasionally cross paths. But not all that often. I also have no idea when her internship is over. I haven't crossed paths with her in a while (which isn't uncommon), but I suppose its possible she's already gone.

I know her first name, but that's it. I've tried searching for her on facebook through mutual work friends, but nothing. 

As of right now, I don't know any of her interests, her age, her last name... Nothing. Just her first name and that I think she is incredibly cute.

How should I proceed? Just strike up a convo the next time I happen to cross her path (if she's even still there)?

What if she's gone? Is there anyway I can get in contact with her without coming off creepy?

How would you act in this situation?"

Back in 2010 I was laid off from my music publishing job as we were bought by another company.  I found work again a year later doing music licensing and it just did not pan out as they were a small company and it was one of those things that just did not fit.  My time at my first company was much better.  I was there for 5 years and it was the job I first got out of college after interning there my senior year.  I moved up to a decent spot from Intern to Assistant to Coordinator of Creative where I brought in actual big revenue dollars for the company.  

Now since July 2011 I haven't had full-time, salaried work despite applying to many jobs that fit my experience.  I wanted to take a step up as I felt I was ready for that.  And I was going to get a job in LA but they decided to hire from within.  I was the clear cut best candidate outside of the company.  And this was a big company, so I felt I warranted those feelings.  

Now it's been 2 years and I have had 2 interviews despite a very good, detailed resume listing my accomplishments, not tasks.  When I got laid off in 2010 they set us up with a company who would help us with resume writing and such.  

I am now willing to take a step back for an assistant/coordinator position if it means that I can prove to myself and to another company that I can be the best hire they have.  I have a lot of confidence in myself and what I can accomplish.  My philosophy is this...if a baseball player can take a minor league deal and prove he belongs on the major league roster, why can't I take an assistant position and in a year or so, show that I'm capable of being a great hire.  

I'm really stuck in a rough spot.  It's almost like I'm too good to be an assistant but don't have enough WOW factor to be a manager.  HELP!!! "
1kppcb,25,2013-08-20,"Best non-workstation-GPU for a workstation? Also, the murky topic of modding/bios flashing a GTX card to run Quadro drivers...",savage_loins,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1kppcb/best_nonworkstationgpu_for_a_workstation_also_the/,"I'm an arch student and I recently put together an i7-3930k build for doing CAD, raytracing and adobe work for school as well as internships. It's beautifully fast - what with the SSD (intel 520), ample ram (16gb - haven't used it up yet) and *beauty* of a processor - seriously guys, this 3930k is legiitt, especially compared to the Athlon x4 620 of my old build.

Anyways, my GPU is a reference HD6850 recycled in from my old build. It's been holding up quite well, since I'm not really a gamer (or at least a hi-res gamer... I still go for some civ 3 or some KSP from time to time...) and the tasks I perform are much, much more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive. For the *most* part.

Now, I don't regret having spent well over a third of my U.S. $1.3k budget on the processor - I'd take twelve sexy threads of CPU power over GPU power any day of the week - but I'm starting to think *maybe I can do both...*

I'm thinking this because I've started to find that my performance in the viewport is a bit lacking in the openGL-based programs I've been using -- namely Rhino 5 and SketchUp -- i.e. I need to turn layers off for things to run smoothly once models start getting big (100+mb in rhino). Similarly, things get slow in PS/indesign/illustrator from time to time in ""viewport""-related tasks (e.g. rotating/resizing a heavy pdf, but not applying a filter e.g. gaussian blur). Now AutoCAD runs like a champ, even on the gigantic million-xref dwg's I work with from the arch studio I'm interning at. It could be better, but it's like comparing butter to melted butter.

From what I've read, GTX-series cards are actually *better* performers in DX11 viewports (i.e. autocad) than their Quadro counterparts. However, it's the opposite with openGL viewports and 2D work (i.e. adobe suite). I could be wrong - this is minimal research. But what I've definitely found is that **for the sub-$1000 budget, Quadros / workstation GPUs are not worth it.** I could be wrong. Call me out.

What a friend told me - along with some more minimal internet research - is that the main difference between GTX and workstation cards, besides the whopping VRAM, is the drivers they run; furthermore, it is possible to flash the BIOS on the video card (something which sounds terrifying, but potentially not terrifying after extensive research, like overclocking... or building a computer...) and I think do some small hardware mod (short like two contacts on the PCB?) and then voila: your GTX card now runs Quadro drivers and thus performs *like butter* in CAD viewports and 2D GPU work (adobe suite), in exchange for a small performance hit in gaming applications (which I honestly do not mind exchanging at all).

This could also be completely wrong. Please let me know.


In any case, if everything I said was true, then I'm leaning towards getting one of the 3GB models of the GTX770 - it fits pretty comfortably in my budget - and going in the direction of the Quadro BIOS flashing or whatnot after some research; I could wait and save more money if it's really worth it, or spend less if it isn't (and then put everything underwater with the leftover $... hehehe), but I'm definitely not going to shell out $1K+ on a workstation GPU.

Thanks in advance for any insight."

I posted this over in r/Accountancy, but would be grateful to get some additional feedback here.

I'm looking for some general advice on how to approach the fall recruiting season, during which I'm hoping to obtain an internship offer for next summer (2014) in a large public firm.

About me - Big10, senior in accountancy who will be graduating this Dec. 2013 with bachelors and plans to come back next fall 2014 for 5th year masters. Unfortunately, I don't have any prior accounting internship experience, but I do have an accounting internship lined up for this winter (post-graduation) at a Fortune 500 manufacturer.

My question regards how to leverage (if at all) my upcoming winter internship when talking to public accounting firms about internship opportunities for next summer.

* Can I/should I list my upcoming internship on my resume/cover letters, even though I haven't started it yet? Especially because I don't have any other accounting experience, I feel this knowledge of an upcoming internship could add weight to my application, as it will show that I will have professional experience prior to starting a summer internship. Am I wrong? To be clear, I would just be listing the company name and a brief statement that I'll working there in the winter.

I'd appreciate any advice on my situation! Thanks!"

This is why they kept me over the summer, and because I previously had no plans to find another job, I told them I could stay for the fall semester. I like the job, but it is not relevant to my major, and I am getting to the point where it is crucial to start gaining experience if I hope to get a job in my major when I graduate. I've begun looking for jobs relating to my major, and I even got called in for an interview for one of them. The only problem is, I don't know how to quit my job because I feel like I will be letting them down after I already said I could stay. Also, I need to cut into some of my already scheduled work time so that I can interview for this other job. So my questions for you guys are:

* 1) How should I go about quitting this internship (if I get offered the other job)? 
* 2) They know that I don't intend to stay forever, as this job isn't relevant to my major, but they expected me to at least be there for the fall. Should I give any indication that I am looking for something new?
* 3) Should I tell the truth when I ask them if I can come in later on the date that I have the interview for the other job? 
* 4) Should I list my current boss as a reference?

Its amazing how far technology has come. Looking at the Pentiums of today to the Pentium of my last computer is such a huge difference! To have hard drives almost reaching 1 terabyte, and 16gb of ram!! I want a big motherboard so I can use my Audigy sound card because I love that surround! Question: What are the best blue cold cathodes you can get? My last build was red-themed and it was great.

I'll be back to answer questions but I'm going to go watch ""The Internship"" with some buddies."

(24 y/o),bad_at_photosharp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktcno/should_i_quit_my_current_steady_job_in_an/,"Since I graduated in 2012 with a Materials Science degree (specialization in Electronic Materials) I've been working at a large Automotive OEM as a process/quality engineer. I learned C and Matlab my sophomore year in school liked it so I dove in to Java on my own. For the past year and a half, I've been using every resource to teach myself C++ and consider myself to be at least at an intermediate level with it. I'm working on my own game now and have been looking for a suitable open source project to contribute to.

I find myself more and more fantasizing about a programming job but I have no idea how to break in to the profession without any experience or a CS degree. My question is, would it be wise to leave my current, well paying job for a programming internship? Or is it possible to break in to the scene another way?"
1ktaaa,5,2013-08-21,Electrical engineering student with emphasis on Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ktaaa/electrical_engineering_student_with_emphasis_on/,"Hello all. So I posed these questions in r/EngineeringStudents, and forgot about r/engineering. I figured you guys have much more experience and maybe some of you do in this field, so I decided to post here. I am a sophomore taking the normal route of electrical engineering in my university, along with suggested elective courses of: **Introduction to Nanoelectronics**, **Introduction to Nanotechnology**, **Electronic Materials**, **Physics III: Modern Physics**, **Quantum Physics Laboratory**, and **Introduction to Quantum Mechanics I**. If you could provide me with *any* valuable insight into the field, I would very much appreciate it.

Questions:

1. How well do you guys think these classes will prepare me for work in the nanotechnology/nanoengineering field? 

2. From several Google searches I've gathered information that suggests getting a Masters and maybe a Phd if I wanted to do research. I have no problem with this scenario, seeing as I have around two years of internship experience, so upon graduation I would go work in industry for a few years and hopefully my employer will pay my way through a masters and possibly a Phd.

3. What do you think of gainful employment in such a field? Will taking these 6 electives rather than some other classes hinder my chances at employment? 

4. Lastly, if anyone reading this is working towards an emphasis in Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering degree, or if anyone is already in the field, what is your day at work like? What projects are you working on? What sort of entry and mid-career pay should I be looking at? Do you work at a university, in industry, etc...? Any information is much appreciated.

Just for reference, these are the technical elective tracks my university. What do you guys think of these areas?:

* Power Electronics and Power Systems
* Optics
* Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering
* Microwave/Radio-Frequency Engineering
* Electronics
* Controls
* Computer Systems
* Communications and Signal Processing
* Biomedical Imaging

1ksqe0,7,2013-08-21,Help... They're coming for me,Devynne,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ksqe0/help_theyre_coming_for_me/,"I was taken by a tall man and a very old woman. It seemed as if they were a couple.  The woman seemed much older than the man, at least 20 years difference. They were completely silent the whole time, never answering to my pleas, only responding by brute force. Each time I would speak, the mans grip on my wrists would get tighter, as he drug me through the house. I kicked and screamed for help, but the only response I got was the echo of my own voice throughout the room. This place seemed like an endless maze.
 
Why was I here? Why won't they answer me? Why are they so silent? Am I the only one ?

I tried thinking of an explanation for the situation I was in. I looked up to see the man still dragging me along, chuckling to himself . What the hell was so funny? After a while of me struggling against his grip, he finally let go. I quickly got on my feet and glanced around, trying to find a way out. I couldn't see any other door except the one in front of me where the man was standing. All other directions were just long, stretched hallways leading into blackness. The man stepped closer to me and I backed myself into the nearest wall, practically slinking down to the floor. His gaze was intimidating, and his smile was unnerving. He roughly grabbed my shoulder, and shoved me through the door that he was standing by a second ago. I let out a yelp of pain as I fell onto the cold, cement floor. I heard the door shut abruptly and turned around just in time to hear the deadbolt click into place.

I began to shake out of fear as I got up and took a look around the room. I gagged as a rancid smell filled the air. I couldn't place the scent but it was unlike anything I had ever smelled before. The room was dark, but I could make out figures. It was as if there were chairs placed throughout the room surrounding a big screen that projected onto the cement wall. I gasped once I realized I was not alone. As I glanced around at the people here, I saw that there were at least twenty kids here. They seemed to range from the ages of seven to fifteen. It was mostly girls but there were a few boys that looked to be sixteen.

None of the children seemed phased by my appearance, as they just gazed sadly in my direction. A few of them just nodded to me, as if to acknowledge my presence. I tried talking to some of the older kids, and asking for help but they didn't talk either. Nothing seemed to work. I decided to sit down and came to the conclusion that I wasn't getting out of there. I started to cry softly. I sat there feeling sorry for myself until a light snapped me back to reality. The projector flashed on and began booting up. All of the children sat down and turned their heads toward the screen, almost as if they were trained to do it at the exact time. Like they EXPECTED it. The theater remained dark for the most part but I could faintly see the outline of a brown haired girls head in the seat in front of mine. 

Above the screen, there was a room that I didn't notice before. It was like the kind you see in movie theaters. The room that controls the video and audio. I saw the old woman and the man through the glass, and they were just talking. The woman began to mess with the equipment and suddenly the video started. I tried watching the video and keeping an eye on the couple at the same time, but when I looked to the video one second and looked at the room another, they were gone. I focused on the video. It seemed that the video was being taken by someone following a child. It showed a blonde girl in her teens walking along the street, when suddenly the camera man runs towards her and the video cuts off. It starts up again, but the scenery has changed to a very dark room with a steel door and a single wooden table in the middle. I see the same girl huddled in the corner of the room, screaming and pleading ""please don't do this.."" Over and over again. I started feeling sick to my stomach when I realized what came next. The camera was advancing toward her swiftly and I saw a knife in the side vision of the camera.

The girl starting crying out louder as she saw the knife. I looked away, but not fast enough. Right before I flicked my gaze away, I saw her being stabbed repeatedly, fresh blood staining the girls clothes and the floor beneath her. I felt myself dry heaving as I tried to hold back tears. For what seemed like hours, I heard her blood curdling screams echo throughout the theater room. Some children looked away, while others cried. The girl in front of me whimpered a name. 

""Whitney..."" She started crying, with her head tilted down, sobs wracked her frail body. Eventually the video stopped and I heard a few audible cries from the kids. 

I had to get out of there.

I got up quickly and searched for something that would help me escape. I saw a glass vase across the room and ran to it. I picked it up, smashed it against the wall and took a shard from the broken pile, shoving it into my boot to hide it. I needed an escape plan fast. I scouted out the nearest door, when suddenly it opened. The man stood waiting at the door, smile still on his face. The door slammed behind him. I walked calmly to the man and asked if I could use the restroom. He must have thought I wasn't lying, because he paused for a moment just before opening the door back up. He grabbed me by the shoulder, leading me out of the room. I still felt sick from the video seconds before but there was a feeling of excitement that was intensifying every second we got further from the theater room, because I knew that I was getting closer to the exit. When we reached the bathroom, I realized it was next to a door. I remembered that door from when I came in. It was the entrance that led outside. I made a quick glance at the door, but the man thought nothing of it. He followed me into the bathroom and I gave him an innocent yet startled look.

""What, a girl can't get any privacy around here?"" He stared at me coldly until I asked ""can you at least turn around?"" He reluctantly complied. Once he turned around, I saw my chance. I quietly took the shard out of my boot. I gripped it in my right hand, making a gash on my palm from how hard I was holding on to it.

""You're not gonna get away with this"" I said with more confidence than I felt. He started turning around swiftly, as if he was going to answer, but he wasn't faster than me. He let out a cry of pain when he felt the glass pierce his skin. I had pushed the glass shard into his side, making him paralyzed momentarily. But it was just enough to make my move. Blood began to seep through his clothes, and with a look of hate on his face, he snarled. My adrenaline kicked in and I was pulling him away from the door so I could make it through. I opened the door just as I felt a hand grip my ankle. I let out a yelp and kicked my foot free. I slammed the door behind me for good measure.

I ran across the hall to the door that led outside and unlocked the dead bolt. I was running down the opposite hallway when I saw the old lady literally sprinting in my direction. She was at least 20 feet away so I had little time. I let out a sound of frustration as the lock didn't budge, but right at the last second it gave way. I hadn't realized how much time had passed since I was brought here, but it was night when I got out of that sickening place. I was sprinting as fast as I could when I heard footsteps behind me. I decided to look back, when I knew that I shouldn't have. The man was just steps behind me, attempting to reach towards my hips to grab me. I shrieked out of fear and ran even faster. I lost him eventually, but I don't remember when. I remember being tired and stopping near some building. It was marked ""Police Department"". I frantically pushed the doors open and ran inside, panting. An intern at the department walked out from behind her desk quickly, asking me if I was alright. I began crying and sunk to my knees, exhausted and scared. I think someone helped me up and took me to an office, because the next thing I knew, I was in some officers room and they were asking me who they could call, and what had happened to me. 

I told them everything that happened and where I thought the house was. I described the man and woman to a sketch artist, and told them everything I knew. Everything I had done. 

As it turns out, the man and woman were wanted for murder and there was an open case about them that the police had been working on. None of the children  had ever made it out of there, and the couple was untraceable. 

The police searched the house I described to them, but all they found were the children. There was no trace of evidence that the man and woman had ever been there. They also discovered the source of the smell in the room. Apparently the video room above the projector was also where they found the bodies of the past victims. The police said the two must have fled the scene after I had escaped. The story was broadcast all over the news.

**14 year old girl escapes from certain death**

That was 2 years ago.

I feel terrified, because as I type this, I can't help but notice the two dark figures, standing in my front yard. With each minute, they draw closer.

 Help me... They're coming back.

So far, I have applied for 22 different companies who are offering internships for electrical engineering, while still completing a few more applications. Most companies tend to only hire students in their penultimate year, i'm freaking out that I won't get anything this summer.. If i didn't get anything, would it be a wise decision to only do say 2 units per semester next year? This would add extra time to my degree and give me the chance to get an internship. The other option is doing unpaid work experience, but that's a bit difficult considering I need money for rent, food, bills etc."

1ks6sj,2,2013-08-20,Electrical engineering student with emphasis on Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ks6sj/electrical_engineering_student_with_emphasis_on/,"Hello all. I am a sophomore taking the normal route of electrical engineering in my university, along with suggested elective courses of: **Introduction to Nanoelectronics**, **Introduction to Nanotechnology**, **Electronic Materials**, **Physics III: Modern Physics**, **Quantum Physics Laboratory**, and **Introduction to Quantum Mechanics I**. If you could provide me with *any* valuable insight into the field, I would very much appreciate it.

Questions:

1. How well do you guys think these classes will prepare me for work in the nanotechnology/nanoengineering field? 

2. From several Google searches I've gathered information that suggests getting a Masters and maybe a Phd if I wanted to do research. I have no problem with this scenario, seeing as I have around two years of internship experience, so upon graduation I would go work in industry for a few years and hopefully my employer will pay my way through a masters and possibly a Phd.

3. What do you think of gainful employment in such a field? Will taking these 6 electives rather than some other classes hinder my chances at employment? 

4. Lastly, if anyone reading this is working towards an emphasis in Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering degree, or if anyone is already in the field, what is your day at work like? What projects are you working on? What sort of entry and mid-career pay should I be looking at? Do you work at a university, in industry, etc...? Any information is much appreciated.

Just for reference, these are the technical elective tracks my university. What do you guys think of these areas?:

* Power Electronics and Power Systems
* Optics
* Nanotechnology/Nanoengineering
* Microwave/Radio-Frequency Engineering
* Electronics
* Controls
* Computer Systems
* Communications and Signal Processing
* Biomedical Imaging

1ks5vd,2,2013-08-20,Intern vs entry-level interview content,lithium42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ks5vd/intern_vs_entrylevel_interview_content/,"Today I was offered an interview for a full-time software dev position. I'm graduating March 2014, thus so far I've only experienced intern interviews. These have mainly focused on algorithms and data structures (as I would expect), but I'm not sure what the content difference is between an intern and full-time interview. 

It seems to me most intern interviews are looking for someone who knows at least one language well, can identify complexity, and can communicate well (among other things). While I expect algorithms and data structures to be at the core of a full-time interview, should I expect questions on things like architecture, kernels, or networks when interviewing for a generic software dev position?

I'm somewhat concerned because over these last two quarters I'll be taking some important courses: OS and networks. 

For a generic entry-level software dev position at a place like Microsoft, Amazon, or Google, should I expect to be tested on these topics? If so, would it be wisest to wait until I've completed one or both of these courses before applying for full-time positions?"
1krzsw,5,2013-08-20,Suggestions for Motion Sensor Camera On My Front Door,teppischfresser,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1krzsw/suggestions_for_motion_sensor_camera_on_my_front/,"I had an internship in Raleigh over the summer. During that time a girl was in desperate need of a room to stay in, so I offered her my apartment for $350/month, which is a steal! Well, ehen I got back to my apartment after my internship, she had run off. I tracked her down and have been hounding her for my money over the past three weeks.

Today, I got back from a bike ride to find a lockpick by my door, which has never happened in thre three years I've lived here, so I'm pretty sure we all know who dun it. The cops didn't care because the police department here sucks, so I want a motion sensor camera outside my door to take pictures of those that come to my door. 

Are there any suggestions as to what tiny camera and motion sensor I can get? There is a plastic handrail by my door I can use to drill in as well. 

Thanks for any suggestions!"

[How do you feel about Texas banning the sale of Tesla cars?  Doesn't seem very American or Libertarian.  Link to news.yahoo.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9cov?context=5)|It's un-American and it's unpatriotic and it's bad economic policy, and it should not be any business of the government what car you can buy. 
[, thanks for answering congressman.  *I do not like the idea of any government writing prohibitions in these areas.*  That's exactly what the bill you voted for was trying to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9tr5?context=5)|I'll go back and look into it and get back to you.
[What can I go about doing to change away from the destructive 2-party system that currently dominates politics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8fzm?context=5)|I think the first thing that we have to do is recognize that we don't have a two party system. I sort of kid about this by saying that we have a one party system, and someday I'm hoping for a second party! Because my experience in Washington has showed me that the 2 parties are much more closely aligned than the people realize. Both of them support our foreign policy of wars overseas (which is wrong), both parties support the Federal Reserve System and the banking cartel, both parties have endlessly supported deficit financing, and both parties unfortunately have supported the attacks on our personal civil liberties. Now the problem is, if we don't have a process whereby you disagree with the two parties, you don't have anyplace to go because it is very difficult to get on the ballot, it's difficult to get in the debates unless you participate in the ""so-called"" two-party system we have today, and ultimately the changes come about not by tinkering with either political party - it only comes through education and getting people to understand the wisdom of non-intervention in foreign policy, non-intervention in personal liberties, and non-intervention in the economy.  
[Is there anything that Obama has done that you **DO** support?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8ux3?context=5)|That's a narrow question. How long since it's been since I've strongly supported what ANY president have done? Unfortunately our Presidents and our Congress have been systematically moving in the wrong direction. They have been undermining our freedoms and bankrupting our country and supporting perpetual war. 
[Dr. Paul, if you could reverse one decision Obama made in office, which would it be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8eba?context=5)|Taking his oath of office! No, I don't have any one because I believe he is just continuing a process that has been going on for a hundred years of government ever-growing.  So there is no one thing that he has done other than (in a very general sense) continue the process. Continue the wars, continue the attack on our liberties - so it has to be a broad answer. Sometimes people would like me to say just one thing like ""Obamacare"" but it's not just one thing. It's the continuation of Big Government and the attacks on our personal liberties.
[Dr. Paul, what is the bravest thing you've ever done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8ey5?context=5)|To tell you the truth, I've never thought about it.  I've never thought of me doing a whole lot that I would categorize as brave. Other people have said that what I do standing up to the establishment and speaking my piece of mind and not backing down as being something brave, but I don't think of it in that manner. So I don't have a good answer for that, but I appreciate it when people compliment me on sticking to my principles. 
[Mr. Paul -- Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA.  What are your thoughts on Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8cyq?context=5)|My thoughts on Bitcoin and the other currencies is that they ought to be legal unless there is fraud involved. The government should not get involved in regulating private money if there is no fraud. I do not take a position on Bitcoin and other proposed currencies in a technical fashion, but I understand the political ramifications of them and I think that government should stay out of them and they should be perfectly legal, even though I don't endorse (technically) one over another.  
[Hi Dr Paul!  Happy late Birthday!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8d7z?context=5)|Well they obviously ought to be protected and politicians pay lip service to that and pass laws to protect whistleblowers - but then they disobey the law, disobey the Constitution, and arrest people who actually reveal the truth. The only way that it can work is that the people themselves have to want the truth and tolerate the truth and understand that whistleblowers are trying to help us and not believe the propaganda of those who are trying to defend the Empire.
[My question is with Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning exposing government abuses, and subsequently being hunted - and prosecuted in Manning's case - what do you think needs to be done to protect whistle blowers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8d7z?context=5)|There's a saying that I use quite often - ""Truth becomes Treason in an Empire of lies."" It's a change in attitude where people don't want to live in an empire, or with a government that is abusing our rights or pretending to police the world and doing all these wonderful things. So we should do everything we can to protect the whistleblowers, but we need better people in government to achieve that. 
[What are your thoughts on free migration? Do you think restrictions against immigration violate the non-aggression principle? Do you agree with economists who say that the World's GDP would increase by magnitudes if you allowed free migration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8n7q?context=5)|That might be the ideal to seek and it should be talked about and maybe someday we can reach that. That is essentially what our 13 Colonies set up under the Constitution - we could move back and forth as freely as possible, and it's worked out rather well. The problem that we have today deals with the economy and the Welfare State. Because if the doors are wide open and you let all individuals in, all individuals suddenly qualify for welfare benefits - and you are looking for lots of problems. In a free society that is prosperous, the doors should be open as wide as possible. Even today we could do that if we could say ""Come and work, come and play, but you don't get automatic citizenship or benefits."" Those open doors would be very beneficial to us, but it's been messed up because of the demagoguery and welfare state. But in an ideal world, there would be an economic benefit to it. 
[Dr. Paul, you have been the most outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve. However, no matter how much I look into your positions on the Fed, something is still a little unclear. Would you prefer to have the Federal Reserve powers returned to the United States Congress and have congress control the money supply and interest rate, or would you rather those powers be left to the free market and have private competing currencies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8o64?context=5)|The second. I would allow the market to do it. I would not trust Congress either. But the guidance can come from our Constitution, because it says we are not allowed to print money and only gold &amp; silver can be legal tender and there is no authority for a central bank. But I like the idea of competing currencies, especially in a transition period, because it would be hard to take what we have today and suddenly have a gold standard without some problems. 
[What are your thoughts on Gary Johnson and Judge Napolitano as possible presidential nominees? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8k6b?context=5)|I think that they'd be great! Both of them would be outstanding. They are both very close to each other in beliefs, and pretty darn close to what I believe in, and they are both friends of mine - so I think they'd be great candidates for any office, to tell you the truth. 
[Hi Ron Paul your name is an anagram for ""Our Plan."" What's that mean? Who are you? Did we *create* you? Please explain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8olg?context=5)|Well, I hope OUR PLAN is a good plan and the plan that I describe is that of defending individual liberty and limited government - so I think that's a good plan!
[Why did you name your son Rand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8f90?context=5)|My wife had the children and she had the privilege of naming the children. Afterwards there was a little bit of discussing with her husband, namely me.
 |But his name is not after Ayn Rand. His name is RANDALL despite some things that have been around on the internet. He was called ""Randy"" at home, and he became ""Rand"" after becoming a physician. 
[Hi Ron! Just wanted to say hello. And while I highly agree with many of your policies, can you give us an official response on your stance of separation of church and state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8drm?context=5)|Yes. The church should never run the state. They should never be synonymous. And the state should never interfere with the church. The responsibility of the government should be to protect the right to free choice, whether it is religion, philosophy, or our personal habits. 
[Dr. Paul,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dtf?context=5)|Free markets and the economy.
[My question is: **What is the easiest, most significant thing than an average American can do right now to advance the cause of liberty?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dtf?context=5)|Foreign policy.
[EDIT: Thank you for answering! Doing my part for personal liberty by plugging CryptoReddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dtf?context=5)|Education is the key to this, and then after that, there will always be a job for somebody who is (if they make themselves available) educated to spread the message. There is always a vehicle for the individual to help spread this message - whether as a teacher, as a politician, even as an intern or a college student. 
[Hi Ron! I am a huge fan of you and you new show, and I have a few questions I would like to ask you.    Do you have a stance on animal rights? If so what is it?    Which members of the 113th congress are you most impressed with so far?    Who would you like to see be elected president in 2016?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dbq?context=5)|I have a stand: I think rights are for individual human beings. I don't have a good conception on where an individual animal has rights. That leads to confused thinking on my part. That doesn't mean that abuse of animals should be tolerated, but in terms of rights, I am very precise. Individuals have rights, I do not believe in collective rights (because a person belongs to a particular group) and I don't believe in the principle that an animal would have the same rights in court as an individual like you or I.  Well you know that's a dangerous question because if I name 2-3, I might forget 3 and get myself into trouble! I know a senator from Kentucky that I""m related to that would have to be one of my favorites, but there are so many in the House now - there might be 6 or 8 or 10. The one individual who is one of my closest friends in Congress is Walter Jones from North Carolina because he has become very anti-war. Jimmy Duncan from Tennessee is a close friend, and Dustin Amash, and Thomas Massie are some others.
[What issue is most important to you and why?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8dbq?context=5)|The most important issue to me is the broad issue of personal liberty because I believe it can answer all our questions if we can recognize that the individual is sovereign, and that sovereignty should be protected. But there are so many issues that are secondary, and are a reflection of individual liberty - because I speak quite a lot about non-interventionism in foreign policy, sound money, and free markets and property rights. That can all come from the concept of our natural rights to our lives as individuals.
 |I think it's too early for that - they started talking about 2016 the day after the last election! We don't even know who the candidates yet. I haven't even talked to my son the Senator about what his plans are, but I think it's too premature to be talking about what our plans are three years from now.
[Dr. Paul, I am a big fan. My question is, What is the most effective way for regular citizens to oppose NSA/FISA overreach? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8hot?context=5)|There's a couple things to oppose.
 |One is to become very well educated, to understand how they came about and how terrible they are.
 |The next thing we do is we have to get other people to agree with us, which means we have to educate other people to know that it's important and in their best interest to know about them.
 |And the next thing we all should do is our very best in influencing our members of Congress to not vote for these things and oppose them when they come up and become politically active.
 |If one does this, they should not have to wait until they are penalized by these laws (and we are at this point today because every American is being spied on by our government and from my viewpoint, it is all illegal except for the very few instances when there is a proper search warrant received from a judge). 
[What's your favorite part about being a politician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9jr4?context=5)|My favorite part with politics has been interacting with young people, especially on college campuses, because their minds are more open to the principles of liberty, they generally are against war, and they understand the importance of following the Constitution. A lot of young people said that I got them interested in politics and in the Constitution, but I would credit them with inspiring me. 
[The Tea Party had so much steam in 2010.  Everyone was afraid of the Tea Party's political influence.  Everything fell apart by 2012 and the GOP blew the Presidential election.  What went wrong and what will you do to regain and maintain political relevance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8ddz?context=5)|Well I don't deal with the Tea Party (or the Republican party or any of that) per se, we must deal with the idealogy of the concept of liberty. The Tea Party was actually started during the Ron Paul presidential campaign in 2007 when there was a spontaneous moneybomb that was done on the anniversary of the original tea party. And it was strictly related to the issues and ideas I have just finished talking about. What happened after that was that a lot of people came onboard - including Republicans - who watered down some of the beliefs, and certainly changed the opinion of some on foreign policy so that the original Tea Party movement was taken over by the Republican Party, which I think was part of the problem.
[Dr. Paul, who is your favorite historical figure in (American\) politics and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8g13?context=5)|You know, I don't have one favorite historical political figure. Most of the pictures I had in my Congressional office were pictures of economists, which included Von Mises, and I essentially didn't have pictures of politicians. I had a picture of one president who was my favorite (Grover Cleveland) and under his picture the quote was (paraphrased)
 |""What is it worth to get elected, and re-elected, if you don't stand for something?""
 |He was a man of principle, who believed in the Constitution and the Gold Standard. 
[What is your favorite color? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt9lyy?context=5)|Green. I'm a ""greenie."" 
[Dr. Paul, we have seen the  expansion of libertarianism over the past several years.  How much of it do you think is enabled by the internet, and what are your thoughts on the recent, repeated attempts to limit the freedom of the net and our right to privacy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt8g3z?context=5)|Well that's a great threat - the attack on the internet - because the internet is our best vehicle. It has been the best thing for us to have to spread our message. So it has been VERY instrumental in being able to get the message of libertarianism out. The other thing that has helped us with this message is the evident failure now of our Keynesian economic system which we've had now for close to 100 years, and also the obvious evidence that our foreign policy is a complete failure and people are looking for answers, especially the young people, because they see it deeply flawed.
[What are some guests that you'd like to interview on future Ron Paul Channel shows?  May I suggest former Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio who allegedly stood up to an NSA blanket surveillance request **pre-9/11**.  He was later imprisoned on insider trading charges, but he'll be a free man next month.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kw9u9/i_am_ron_paul_ask_me_anything/cbt91qu?context=5)|Well we are going to have a lot of interviews - Glenn Greenwald has done one already - and I will probably interviewing Julian Assange, as well as others individuals who have participated in doing something special to promote the cause of liberty. Or anyone who has done something extraordinary in their lives: I've already done 8-10 interviews along these lines.

1kwhfd,1,2013-08-22,Got preliminary offer. Time to negotiate salary. Any help?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kwhfd/got_preliminary_offer_time_to_negotiate_salary/,"I'm a new grad who just received a preliminary job offer after going through four rounds of technical interview. Right now they are asking for my salary expectations and salary history. The number I'd like to suggest is 10% above the median which I think is reasonable (can anyone confirm?), but I don't know if I should wait for them to throw out a number first. 

Also, I've had two internships, both with pretty low pay. I think the only reason they are asking me this is so they can use it as an anchor when trying to low-ball me. 

What should I do in this case? I appreciate all the help I can get

**edit**

As a side question, can people who work in Vancouver tell me what your starting salary was? salary.com lists the median for Software Engineer I as $60,000. Do you think this is accurate? "
1kw6kw,3,2013-08-22,Stay with my iOS development [student] job or seek out an internship?,AdmiralApocalypse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kw6kw/stay_with_my_ios_development_student_job_or_seek/,"So I'm getting my masters in CS, and right now I have a job as a legit iOS developer developing apps for an organization run by the school.  I'm being paid to do it and learn the skills needed to do it, and I'm the sole developer on the project, in effect it's a real/legit job.

It's turning into an ""opportunity"" (I'm severely underpaid and locked at ""student hours"" of 19.5/week,) in that I can say, ""Yes, I am a iOS developer, I developed these apps while working for X-organization,"" and show it off as a portfolio, if you will.

So my question is next summer (of '14) should I bother to seek out an internship at all seeing as I have a 'real job' right now?  I'm kind of torn on the whole thing since the hours are very convenient for me and while I'm underpaid, it's enough to keep me afloat while I work (and I'm doing work in my actual field.)

My expected graduation date is Dec of '14 as well, if that plays into anyone's opinion."

-I can use just about every single Microsoft Office program that I can think of, and I can do it pretty well. Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, etc.

-I am quite comfortable on both a PC and a Mac.

-I've worked in a million restaurants, so I know how to use plenty of POS systems (not really relevant, I guess.)

-I can use google sketchup and very basic photoshop.

-I can... navigate my way around the internet? What I mean to say is that I'm pretty good at using the internet to troubleshoot things and if I had to use some sort of online program, I'm sure I could figure it out.

That's all I can think of right now. Here's the problem though: Although I am by NO means some sort of tech-genius, I look at that list and I see a bunch of basic, no-brainer stuff.

Looking for some input or advice.,Zazenroshi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kusbg/im_a_recent_cs_grad_suffering_from_postdegree/,"Thanks for reading, i'll attempt to be both descriptive and brief.

I recently graduated with a CS degree with emphasis in Software Engineering at the end of April.  I finished with a good GPA, 3.97, but I never found an internship or did any personal projects outside of the normal coursework.  The last year of school took a heavy toll on me, I was suffering from a lot of depression and anxiety from problems from a 5 year romantic relationship falling apart.

I kept a part-time job doing menial labor, but I stayed on top of my coursework and kept my GPA up; however, I never had the energy or motivation to do outside projects or seek internships.  After graduation, most of my focus has spent trying to piece my personal and social life back together, and I've written practically no code and my skills have no doubt gotten rusty.

It is now 3 months after graduation and i'm slowly recovering from my depression, but i'm finding the job search a little overwhelming and I don't know what direction to move in.  I've only had a phone interview which I think went really poorly, and a first face to face interview which went okay, still waiting to hear back if i'm considered for second round technical interview.

The degree coursework has given me a good foundation for CS topics and a few different languages, C++, Java, C#, Bash, Perl, and Python, a little RDMS and SQL work, a little web development in ASP.NET.  None of these technologies have really gripped me as a favorite and i'm struggling to chose a direction.  I know I need to do some independent study and projects to help my chances of getting a job, but I don't know where to start and with what.

* Anyone else have to take time off after college to collect themselves personally?  How did you get back on track to sharpen your skills and find a job?
* It would probably help me to get involved with a project that has some real benefit, instead of just throwaway code to learn syntax and concepts, how can I find open source or smaller personal projects to begin building a portfolio?
* Any online tutorials you would suggest to help me get back in gear and into the programming mindset?

Thanks again for considering my problems, i'm happy to expand on anything or answer any questions to get the best advice possible."

I'm a CS student at a university in Canada not well known for its CS program. I'll be entering my senior year in September, and currently I'm a on an internship as a software developer at a large, non-tech company.

They've approached me and asked to extend my internship by 8 or 12 months (delaying my graduation from 2014 to 2015).  I have personal reasons for wanting to delay my graduation; my SO is not graduating until 2015.  I plan on pursing employment in the states after graduation, so I'd hate to spend a year apart.  She is an american citizen as well, which will make the immigration process easier (I'll still need to get an H1-B but after than I hope to get a green card to remain in the country).

Also, if I take an 8 month extension, I'll have another opportunity at getting an internship at one of the big guys in Summer 2014.  I had an in-person interview with MSFT and a phone interview with AMZN for internship positions last year, but wasn't prepared enough.  This year, I feel much more prepared.

I feel that because my school isn't well known, getting my first job with one of the major tech companies will give me a sense of legitimacy when recruiters look at me.

I know many of you might say that I should just pursue full-time employment at one of the big guys after graduate, but I'm not confident I will be able to secure it.  The interview questions for new grads are much harder than internship questions.  I feel if I don't start my career with one of the major players I will be set back given my educational background.

What is your suggestion?  I understand that there is an opportunity cost with delaying my graduation so I need to figure out if it is worth it."

I always have a little bit of anxiety about making the right choices in life, but since I was a wee one, I've always wanted to make games,cool stories etc. As I know much more goes on now that I'm older, I'm more excited to be apart of a design team, and equally afraid to fail.

I'm okay with working hard, or long hours, but I want a balance. I know that the industry is a very tough one to handle at best, so I decided, I can make it on my own terms if I become an indie developer, go to school, get some internships and what have you.

My question is not so much, should I do it, because only I can answer that. However, when large topics come up on game development, I see so many disheartening posts about being one. It almost NEVER seems worth it, and being as ruthless as it is, only the cream of the crop ever get any where in most cases.

Am I just chasing a silly childhood dream? Would being Indie be a better choice? Should I just switch majors?

reddit rules.


**Added-**
I really appreciate the insight from all of you, and in a lot of ways have encouraged me and given me some hope as what I should do.

It seems like it might be a bumpy ride, but if its something I truly want to do, how could I be wrong, just focus, be smart and get in it. 

And to that I appreciate all of the advice and encouragement. :)

If there is anything else you want to add or can think of I'd still want a look at what you have to say, surely out of 66,721 GD in this subreddit there are many more opinions and ideas, and all of which I'd love to hear from, and your personal experiences, too. Maybe this will help any one who second guesses them selves, or worries about making the right choice for them selves.

(MS in MechE)",MechECareerThrowaway,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1kxk5d/hate_to_be_this_person_but_what_would_an/,"*First off, sorry for the throwaway, but I've been a bit too open on my actual account and don't want all these details there too.  Also, sorry for the novel*

I recently received an email from a company I had an internship at last summer.  They had offered me a full-time job after my internship as I graduated from my undergrad in December 2012.  However, I turned them down as nicely as possible because I had the opportunity to complete a funded masters at an accelerated pace.

Anyway, the people who offered me a job then emailed me to see how things were going.  I emailed back, and they indicated they wanted to have a phone call with me.  They seemed to really like me when I interned for them before, so I believe there may be a possible job offer in the future as I will be graduating from my masters this May.

The job they offered me before is in one of the areas I prefer - R&amp;D - and had the possibility of going into my other area of preference - controls (which is what I've been pursuing in my MS).  They offered me $60,000 which is pretty respectable.

However, I don't know how much is reasonable for salary now.

In my undergrad, I think I was a pretty good student.  I graduated with a 3.69/4.0, and I had a total of two years of engineering internships and co-ops at 4 different companies.  I also was a tutor for intro level MechE courses and German.

Grad school has not been so kind.  I've been battling depression, so my GPA is a 3.37 as of right now, and I technically only have to take one more class, so it's not going to change much.  I also don't have tons of research experience, but I'm hopeful I'll have at least one journal paper published.

Because of this disparaging achievement, I don't know what I should be expecting.  My school's report on salaries for MechE indicate for a BS that low is $24,960, average is $56,592 and high is $70,000.  I couldn't find numbers for MS, or MS might be rolled into that - I'm not certain.  Additionally, the company is is a low-ish cost of living area (Midwest).

So, any ideas?  I'm inclined to think I'm probably not worth much more than the $60,000 they offered me before, but that seems silly as I will (hopefully) have an advanced degree by then.

**TL;DR: I'm graduating with an MS in mechanical engineering.  My grades and experience for undergrad were good, but my grades in grad school are average at best.  What am I worth?**"

Lately, as I've been speaking to more students at the university I'll be attending (UCSD), while the engineering school as a whole is regarded fairly well, the chemical program seems to be mostly ignored in favor of other programs, and there seems to be little in the way of networking and internship options, whereas the CS department has much more in the way of opportunities at the school.

Personally, I'm more interested in the ChemE material, but I have more actual experience with programming and software design, not to mention the fact that everyone I know is in the software field, while I don't have a single connection to the chemical/process industry. For that reason along with the program's strength, it concerns me that pursuing Chem E will limit my options and possibly result in inability to find employment.

Am I being foolish and unnecessarily worried in wanting to switch my major based on concerns about the job market? My main concern throughout going back to school is that I end up being a viable job candidate."

* My GPA is abysmal. I'm currently sitting at a cumulative 2.67 (with my CS GPA being 2.18) but may be able to get it up to a 2.77 (CS GPA) if I get all A's this upcoming semester and the one following it (Spring 2014).

* To get A's, I'd need all of the time available to me to study and would find it difficult to squeeze in time for side projects/open source contributions. 

* I don't have any previous internships.

* As a friend put it, listing coursework in my resume would not really be saying why I'm exceptional; every CS major has CS-related coursework. Thus, it's better to stand out by having actual personal projects and coding beyond what's taught in the classroom. 

Some considerations/questions:

* I have ideas for side projects that I'd really like to actually implement. The problem is I'd have to sacrifice getting the highest possible GPA (I could have a 2.9 CS GPA, tops and a 3.0 cumulative GPA, tops) to make room for those side projects. The cost of actually working to build those projects would make me have three A's and a B, or two B's and a C and an A, or anything else other than all A's.

Is it more worth it to have those side projects/open source contributions in terms of being employable as opposed to having the highest possible GPA I can have at this point?

* I find projects like [this](http://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/) and [this](http://intothecontinuum.tumblr.com/) and even [this](http://tane.us) to be awesome and totally worth my time, if I did something similar. Would these be good side projects to show in place of some other application on github, for instance?

* I don't really even have a resume worked out at the moment, but is there any advantage to listing the fact that I was a college algebra tutor for two semesters? The thing to consider is this was during Fall 2009 and Spring 2010.

-------------------------

I have always been shy and reluctant to talk to people. I was always a little reserved and got the perfect hobby for that, computers. Ever since the age of 4, I have been associated with computers and known for it.

I have always had friends but never got close friends until college. 

During elementary school, I had friends from school. I talked to them during school but that was it. I don't think I have ever went out with them. When they invited me out, I had always come up with excuses. At first they kept inviting me but then they gave up too. I don't remember those times very well.

I never really got hot flushes or shaky hands in social situations. I was attentive in class and wasn't very anxious around people.

I had a decent childhood overall. When you start to look at my past though, I think you might say that I had some bad social experiences. Some bullying in the first two years of high school but I don't think this is what is causing all the problems with my life. Nothing traumatizing but some of my experiences could have been discouraging. I'm pretty sure that many people had similar experiences and lived their lives without social anxiety.

My parents don't have the best marriage. They constantly argued as I was growing up and they still do. As I was growing up, they would have these all-night-long fights every three months or so where they would yell at each other with all the stress they accumulated in-between these fights. I can easily call it a loveless marriage. I don't have the best relationship with my dad. We always had arguments, and essentially never got along. I still am not fond of him and we still don't treat each other well. That might have had an impact.

When I look back, I think I have always been avoidant of social occasions. I remember, I was never that kid who sat in the corner. I would socialize with people only in school, though. I'm not sure why. I just didn't feel like it and always felt too shy (and ashamed maybe, for some reason. Makes no sense to me either but I think I remember feeling that way) to ask my parents if I could go out with friends.

College comes in. I make some friends and socialize with them. We go to bars and frats basically every weekend. For the first time in my life, I get a close friend circle but still constantly felt like I am actually not regarded as a part of the group. I am at a Junior right now and doing a great internship in California where I make a lot of money and meet with the industry leaders. I see all these people who are great at their jobs and also great from a social perspective. I thought you couldn't have both. That's how I was reassuring myself. More on this later.

I never had a girlfriend even though I liked some girls a lot and felt really close to them. There was this girl in high school, Melanie. I had a huge crush on her. 

I was very reluctant asking her out. Maybe I was too shy, maybe I felt inadequate, maybe I didn't want her to reject me. Maybe I just felt ashamed, I didn't know how to tell my parents that I was dating with this girl. Which is very funny because they would be extremely encouraging and they would get very excited and be very proud.

Melanie and I got close and she was showing signs of interest. I was really into her. I constantly debated with myself whether if I should ask her out. Never did. One time, I got really close. We were walking together from a class and I just stopped, looked her in the eyes and told her I wanted to tell her something. She reciprocated. She smiled and looked at me in the eyes. It was obvious that she was excited and I felt that she was expecting me to ask her out. I chickened out and told her something else.

Fast-forward a year (where we still kept in touch with a similar pattern). Our graduation ceremony... I see her after the ceremony is over and she sees me. I look at her, trying to say something. She looks at me and she is with her parents. I just go to her and hug her. We hug for something around ten seconds. I let go. She does the same. And then out of the blue, she hugs me again. This one takes longer.

We have another graduation party probably a couple of days after that. It was at a beach resort where we all get to drink, all expenses covered by the school. At some point, it is just me and her and we walk together by the beach. It is obvious she is expecting something and I should make a move but I end up not doing it. We talk about some stuff that are bothering her. Drink some more, plan to go to the after-party party. We go there and meet again. Get some more drinks. She gets distracted, I get distracted and we spend some time separately. She jumps into the sea fully clothed and is promptly carried outside. I stand by her all night, assuring that everything will be okay. She isn't very responsive to my attempts to cheer her up so I just tell her that I'll just leave then. She says ""no, please don't go"". I don't. I end up carrying her back to a cab and then to her parents place. Next day, she texts me, apologizes and thanks me for everything that I have done. I say no problem and this is the last time I have heard from her. Except for her appearing on my Facebook feed and me telling her that I really liked her over Facebook Chat and not hearing back.

My current self would be more proactive and confident in a situation like this. I have changed and improved ever since high-school, that's for sure. I wish I could see her and talk to her but we live in different countries now and even though I go back to my home country at least twice a year, I never tried to contact her.

Anyway... I know it looks like I am fixated on this girl, and while I admit that I used to be, that's not the case anymore. She is just an epic social failure in my past and that's it. If I improve, I might give her a call when I get back but that's a topic for later...

Back to the topic...

I had sex before, but never had a girlfriend. No girl that I was sincerely interested in and attracted to ever showed interest in me. I had sex with an escort a year ago and hooked up with a couple of friends of mine (that I wasn't particularly interested, so I had some erectile dysfunction)..

I am amped up about meeting with friends etc. but I always end up canceling the last minute because I just don't feel like going. The reason why I was able to socialize with people in college was because we lived right by each other.

I am now in California, the end of my internship is coming and even though I was imagining that this time would be awesome because I would have my own place in San Francisco and go out to bars every day, I went out once. Some friends invited me out constantly but I always came up with excuses.

I tried many nootropics, many psychostimulants, many supplements but none really helped. Racetams give me verbal fluency and that's why I'll keep taking them. Magnesium, Zinc and B6 seem to decrease my anxiety around people. I don't normally get sweaty or shaky but I get this shitty bodily sensation when I am anxious. It feels like people are paying attention to even the smallest of my actions and judging me. Which is unsettling and makes me even more self-conscious. I am consciously aware that this is not the case and people wouldn't call me out on an eye twitch or small gesture like that but I can't help that feeling.

I take ADHD medication daily. It helps me be more outgoing and sociable. I started taking it my sophomore year of college, and I think it helps. It makes me less avoidant, more sociable and more cheerful versus lethargic and cloudy. Granted it might be exacerbating my anxiety to a certain degree but I don't know what my options are.

I experimented with recreational substances. My psychedelic experiences were always positive. I felt blissful, music sounded amazing and I noticed that I had some things I didn't like about myself and that I can change them. I felt motivated to take steps to change myself but this motivation was short-lived. It faded away very quickly and I turned back to my old behavior in no time.

When I was young, I remember feeling ashamed in social occasions. For instance, when I was eating outside with my parents and I end up needing something (utensils or a refill or something) and a similar/same feeling of shame holds me back from asking to the waiter/waitress. I remember not having this problem when I am outside eating alone, or with friends. Basically, I am/was noticeably more introverted around my parents.

I am aware that exposure therapy is supposed to help. I am doing my best meeting with people on a daily basis, saying hi to random people at school or work, and getting into conversations with people. It hasn't helped much but it's something I have been working on. I don't think I have textbook social anxiety. Something is off somewhere.

I am totally fine with talking to authority figures, or customer service as I am returning an item, or doing a presentation. I am more comfortable doing those than walking on the street.

I never tried SSRIs or social-anxiety-targeting MAOIs. I went to a psychiatrist once when I was younger to talk about the problems I was having while trying to fall asleep alone. I was afraid, even when the lights were on. The doctor told me that it was an anxiety disorder and it should fix itself as I grow up. I felt this feeling that kept me away from closing my eyes and going to sleep until the junior year of high school. Interestingly enough, this psychiatrist insisted on seeing me at least weekly. I thought it was just for money at the time and adamantly refused it. I think she knew something. She knew that there was a high chance of this anxiety turning into social anxiety or something similar.

Anyway... long story short, I am not even sure if this is social anxiety. Reading your reports, this feels a little different. What do you think? My life is revolving around this problem. I am wasting the best years of my life and I should fix this.

I wasn't considering of trying SSRIs because of their side effects but I am feeling desperate to try anything right now. I recently tried Tianeptine (an SSRE) for a day and also Kanna extract (a natural serotonin reuptake inhibitor). They both exacerbated my social anxiety and made me feel even worse.

I don't know what to do."

They basically hooked me with fast promotions and good pay. I'm now 28 and have been regretting not following my computer passion for several years. I've always done a bit of programming on the side, and the closest thing to a hobby is building and playing with electronics and computers. 
I know a bit of python, c++, and visual basic. Not enough to really matter though. 
I want to go back to school and get a computer science degree. I have a child and a full time job so this is going to be something I can do online at night. I know that sounds like a full plate, but I've been managing taking a full load at the local college just fine this way to get my gen eds out of the way. 
I'm at the point where I need to really look hard. at schools.  This is one area I would like some advice. Regis university has one of the two online programs that is ABET certified that you can do fully online. it seems like the school has a good reputation. has anyone heard different? or have other suggestions?
Unfortunately my time is going to be very tight. I won't be able to do a proper internship or do a lot of spare time projects. How much will this hurt me?  

Any other thoughts or suggestions? Its a pretty scary thing leaving a rock solid job and company I've worked for the past 12 years, but I'm really excited at the same time. It is possible I could land a job at the corporate office since we use quite a few in house tools, but I don't want to strictly count on that. "

When I started secondary school I was a gifted pupil with 'straight A*s on my horizon, I wanted to be a vet and as the school I chose was publicized as a Science Specialist school - I had made my choice. The first year &amp; a half went well, I was excelling in all my classes &amp; had a solid social circle, &amp; I met my best friend who to this day means the world to me. At the end of the 2nd year, it went a tad rocky - I had befriended one of the 'naughty' girls in my year &amp; started social smoking &amp; drinking (not excessively) - I was still getting my grades. My 3rd year everything went wrong - me &amp; my best friend had befriended these 2 other girls who were into bunking (truanting) &amp; we loved the thrill of it - we started missing school on a regular basis, staying out past midnight on school days (we were 13) &amp; just generally fucking up. My Mum &amp; Dad went awol when this started to happen - I had to climb from my 2nd story window if I wanted to go out, I was constantly 'grounded' &amp; when I did manage to sneak out - I wouldn't return for 3 days until they had calmed down. At this point I started stealing from my parents too - from cash, alcohol &amp; cigarettes to money out of their banks. At this stage I had also started smoking cannabis, but only occasionally &amp; it was always recreational. My parents cut all pocket money &amp; I resorted to shoplifting - this ceased when I was arrested (moderately). My home life was so unbearable at this point - I had made my parents resent me &amp; I was a thief, they couldn't even leave their wallets around their OWN home. The only thing I had which was solid was my social life, I had a best friend, a solid &amp; vast friendship group - I've always been social so this aspect of my life meant so much to me. One day I was out with my friends &amp; I kissed a boy who was at least 8 years older than me, this got out in my school &amp; I was briefly despised. It was my best-friend who had told people as she wanted me to 'learn from my mistakes' - looking back I agree with her. When aware that everyone knew, I felt lost. I felt that my parents hated me &amp; so did the world - I had no-one. This particular night my parents had gone out to dinner, it was rare for my Dad to go out apart from shopping &amp; to the doctors as he has chronic bronchitis and COPD. That night I took 10 packets of paracetemol, 5 of ibuprofen &amp; 3 of aspirin. I went straight to sleep &amp; woke up with the feeling I had been stabbed in the stomach. My dad being such an observant man had noticed I had put one of the medicine packets back in the cabinet the wrong way &amp; burst into my room asking if I had taken anything, even though I was denying it he could see by my body language &amp; that I was constantly retching that I had. He instantly woke up my Mum &amp; called an ambulance. I was in Hospital for 4 nights &amp; 3 days, luckily they pumped my stomach in time &amp; their was no permanent damage apart from a weaker liver than the average. My dad saved my life.
My social life returned back to normal - if not better. But week by week I was becoming more of a delinquent. My grades were dropping, I was barely in school &amp; I started smoking cannabis quite a few times a week, even alone. My parents started expecting my behaviour rather than getting so angry when I had done anything wrong. By the age of 14 I didn't have a curfew &amp; could basically do what I pleased. I have always been a Daddy's girl, even though I love my Mum no less. I was gifted with the wittiest most insightful man as a Dad, &amp; he was always the parent I had felt most comfortable opening up to. I am naturally clever, so I was still getting A's in English as all you need to be is articulate, but all my other subjects I had dropped down to border-line average as I wasn't in any lessons to acquire any of the knowledge I needed. My Brother stayed on the right route, getting top grades in all his GCSEs and Alevels, getting a internship at credit suisse &amp; going to the top uni for economics in London. Everything my Dad wanted for him, he was so proud. I was/am the complete opposite. The last year of secondary school I still had the same attitude - I had no work ethic nor motivation, even though every year I said would be a 'clean slate' . I was smoking weed daily at this point. During my Mock exams I tried MDMA (extasy) for the first time &amp; loved it - I was so happy like you wouldn't believe. I never got addicted nor took it excessively. I managed to scrape 5 C's in my GCSE's, even though I was predicted 10 A*'s when I had first started the school. I was actually surprised at the results - as in the last 3 years of school I probably only attended 1 &amp; a half overall. This was enough for me to be allowed to start my A-levels. I wanted a fresh start so I went to college rather than staying at the 6th form at my school- this was a horrible horrible mistake. When I was in lessons I did well, but I was rarely in them. My dad would scream &amp; scream at me in the mornings to get out of bed - I would scream the worst abuse imaginable to him &amp; lock myself in. I was addicted to cannabis &amp; when I was in college I was too paranoid that I almost always went home nearly as soon as I got there. The teachers there liked me, my attendance was 17% but I was doing better than a lot of the other students around me (it was a pretty shitty college). One night 3 days before my exams begun I was in central London with all of my friends just basically getting pissed &amp; meeting people. This night was the first night I took cocaine. I lost my friends that night &amp; I also lost my phone. I came home at 7am crying my eyes out just wanting to have a conversation with my Dad ( he was always up all night and asleep during the day because he was so ill ). I found my Dad sat down at the kitchen table slumped across it. He had had a heart attack &amp; died. The next few hours were a blur. I slept through the mortuary picking up his body, but I had to be interviewed by the police. At the time I had a boyfriend, who I cared for a lot, but he was a coke-head. As much as he helped me, I got into cocaine far more than I should have.  I went into deep deep depression and filmed myself on my laptop daily just crying &amp; conversing with myself. I felt so guilty &amp; I still do. As much as I knew that he knew I loved him I couldn't help but constantly think about how I could have made his life so much better, how I could have made him happier. I didn't attend my exams, understandably &amp; that whole summer was a combination of drugs, alcohol &amp; depression. My Mum is also very reserved so she dealt with it herself, so I had to aswell. My friends being 16 year olds didn't know how to handle it - personally I think they could have done a lot more - but I detached myself from everything - refusing to talk about it unless I was drunk &amp; then I just exploded in a fit of tears. It didn't get better with time as everyone had promised. All I wanted/want to do is to make my Dad proud of me &amp; become as successful as he wanted me to be, as I wanted to be &amp; what I'm capable to be. I enrolled back at my old school the following year adamant I was going to be a changed person. The first month I was excelling, I felt comfortable &amp; was doing well in my classes.  I was still massively depressed &amp; would commonly go home sit in my room with the lights off &amp; watch video's of soldiers being reunited with their daughters on Youtube &amp; just cry over them (I don't know why). I began to not turn up to a lot of my classes, the weed was a trigger as it made me so unmotivated, paranoid &amp; even more depressed. I was kicked out at Christmas because of my attendance. Since then I enrolled to private tutoring but as my Mum was always at work during the day - I lied about going. I never went. I lied to my friends, I lied to everyone. My best friend managed to fix up, she's going to university this September &amp; I am so proud of her. One day in January I made the rash decision that I wanted to move out of London in September &amp; have a clean slate - I chose liverpool (5 hour drive away). I love the idea of being whoever I want to be &amp; starting making new foundations. My house is just a constant reminder of that awful night. I want to get my A-levels &amp; go to university like I've always planned to do. Moving out is so soon &amp; I am so worried I will go into a vortex of depression, have no friends &amp; hate college &amp; the city. I can't go back now as I've paid for the accommodation &amp; I feel like I will be a laughing stock if I once again fuck up. I just got back from a festival with my friends, &amp; me &amp; my best friend had a massive drunken argument. 'You are only moving away because I'm going to University' 'You will never change' 'No-one really likes you' 'You've changed' 'You haven't been my bestfriend for years now' 'I hate you' 'You're a slag' 'I can't wait to get  rid of you' were a few of the things she said to me. We made up that night but I can't let go. I have only tried to kill myself once after my Dad had died - but I walked into A&amp;E as I realised how selfish it was - It would destroy my Mum &amp; she deserves so much better. Killing yourself is so selfish towards your loved ones. These past few months I have been constantly having more suicidal thoughts &amp; I think I am near the brink. I know this feeling too well. I am either going to end up running away abroad &amp; killing myself, moving to Liverpool and eventually killing myself, or killing myself before I move. But I can't. I feel one day I will just do it &amp; I don't want to but It's the only way out. Maybe I can never change. I understand there are people out there who have lost their whole families tragically, who have to walk miles for food or suffer from a terrible illness but I can't help but feel like this. I have read a few of the other posts, I am close with my Mum again now after my Dad passed, I love my friends dearly &amp; have a great social life. But my life is dead-end, I am so so so useless &amp; all I do is fret about 'who I used to be' &amp; 'who I am now'. Since my Dad died, I agree I have changed but I couldn't help it. He was my world &amp; now I feel I have nothing going for me &amp; never will. I'm not religious so even if I DID turn things around (impossible) I know he died knowing I was a fuck up, &amp; couldn't see that I had changed. This kills me. "
1l2eld,6,2013-08-25,How To Write A Challenging Letter Of Recommendation,Websitecontact6,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1l2eld/how_to_write_a_challenging_letter_of/,"Hello Readers,
Every six months or so I am often asked to write a letter of recommendation for the interns that I work with.  I would say that 80% of the time I am happy to do this and treat it as a compliment.  It is an honor to be asked to comment on colleague in a positive way.  It is obviously something I don’t take lightly.  I understand the importance of being a link between the employer and the candidate.  When writing a letter for a candidate that has proven to be a quality colleague, the writing is easy.  I can simply state their qualities, accomplishments and work habits.  However, I don’t want to write about the 80% of the individuals I write letters for.  I want to learn about how others responsed to the 20% of the people you do not want to write a letter for, yet feel obligated to.  

Here is what I typically do, but any other advice would be great!   I do believe that based on my position I am required to be honest towards the interns that work with me.  Part of my job is to help them grow into their position and become successful as they move on from our program.  Therefore, honesty is where I begin.  If a person continues to make mistakes and is never given constructive criticism, that person will never learn.  

When asked to write a letter of recommendation for that person I believe in being honest and explain where I think they have room to grow.  I tell them that I will highlight what they have done well, but perhaps they might want to follow up with another colleague who could speak more to their strengths.  If they continue to ask me to write a letter, I find myself in a predicament and typically oblige the request.  
I have included two letters of recommendations that clearly show the difference between how I valued their commitment to the job they did with me.  I have taken the view that I will not bash or slander a person on a letter of recommendation, but I also won’t lie.  I take the idea that the employer can “read between the lines” and follow up with any questions or concerns. 

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.  



Positive Letter

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Kim Smith.  Kim was my teaching intern during the spring semester of 2012 at Eagle Primary School in a kindergarten, first and second grade classroom.  Kim was an incredibly valuable asset to our classroom community.  Kim’s compassion, enthusiasm and creativity inspired our students throughout the semester. 

Kim was natural at classroom management applying a firm but compassionate equality to all students.  Kim created a strong and creative curriculum unit focused on health and nutrition, which drastically changed many students eating habits and thoughts about health.  Kim incorporated all subject matter during her unit while keeping it focused on her thematic goal.  

Finally, Kim and I have talked at length about the drastic change of being a classroom intern compared to being a first year teacher.  Kim is eager to take on that responsibility.  She understands the commitment involved and the learning curve associated with those first years of teaching.  I have nothing but great things to say about kim; both as a colleague and friend.  I highly recommend Kim Smith as a teacher at your school.  Please do not hesitate to call or e-mail with any further questions. 

 

Sincerely,

 

Pat Smith

Not Positive 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing this letter regarding Kim Smith.  Kim was part of the Eagle Primary Teacher Preparation Program for the 2012-2013 school year.  Kim was a teaching intern during the fall semester in my multiage kindergarten, first and second grade classroom.  It was evident from the start she was passionate about children.  Kim was caring and enthusiastic.  

During her time in my classroom, Kim gradually gained more responsibility as the semester progressed.  She worked in both full group and small group settings in all academic areas.  Kim was also responsible for writing a child study researching the developmental milestones and goals for an individual student.  

Please contact me with any questions you have regarding Kim Smith.

I answer for a director and work with a sysadmin and an intern. 

I started doing things that needs to be done like a imaging server and started to get backups for Internet, switches, servers etc. My problem is that I'm not used to this kind of job. The other sysadmin doesn't seem to like that I am doing new stuff instead of just doing tech support. He isn't doing anything to stop me but this is strange. This company doubled the users (100) in a year and the way it worked is that the sysadmin had to make things work. But now all he seems to do is the tech support that happens like 3 times a day. 
I think I am doing the right thing and have the same mindset of the director but everyone else seem happy to just keep the way things are. 

Any tips on how should I be doing this job? "

After their responses, I'm making this post. If there are questions, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain. However, some rules were put in place a long time ago by the founder of the sub (/u/MediaMoguls) and as such I have to defer those to him. The main one is the No NSFW posts one.

##DISCLAIMER

If you find some way to post something that is against the spirit but not the letter of the rules, it will still get removed.  We reserve the right to create new rules as necessary.

For example: we previously didn't realize how popular it was for SEO people to ask students to create blog posts on their behalf, in an attempt to boost their pagerank with incoming links from a .edu domain.

##THE RULES

* No B2B (Business to Business). For Hire does not mean like a taxi. It means like a person who wants someone to hire them to do a job.  The original intent of the subreddit was connecting freelancers to gigs, not companies to clients.
* No asking students to blog about your company (buying ""backlinks"") on a .edu domain.
* No NSFW posts. /u/MediaMoguls posted about this [here](/r/forhire/comments/rzgxo) and [here](/r/forhire/comments/s1pvb). Please try /r/NSFWforhire
* Nothing illegal in the US, even if you're not in the US, because reddit is bound by US laws.  If you think it might be illegal, assume it is. If you're not sure, feel free to message the mods.
* We will not sticky your post. You can [buy an ad through reddit](/ad_inq) for $30 a day if it really matters. 
* No [Hiring] posts about buying comments on youtube or similar social sites, nor facebook likes or twitter followers or similar.
* No bounties/competitions/speculative work. See http://www.nospec.com/faq. [MediaMoguls agreed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1dto59/hiring_a_graphic_designer_to_create_new_company/c9tq429).
* Jobs must pay currency, not equity. People aren't here hoping to eat someday. They're hoping to eat _to_day.  If you're only paying in cryptocurrency with no fiat alternative, please try /r/jobs4bitcoins.
* Internships: Paid can go in /r/forhire _and_ /r/internships, while unpaid must go solely to /r/internships. ForHire does not work for free.

##Please Note

* All link submissions go straight to the spam queue. Experience taught me spammers would rather post a link submission than a text submission with a link in the text field. Thus, we now allow links, but all links are instantly in the mod queue and removed. We may decide later to allow it or not, but expect it to stay permanently removed. Basically, don't post links.
* Also, you may be interested in posting testimonials to /r/testimonials.  You might also benefit from posting location based jobs to a local subreddit, we have a huge list in /r/forhire/w/local. Some fields, like ""big data"" or ""game development"", also have special job subreddits that we link in /r/forhire/w/field.

##Not a rule but a guideline

* It seems some of you have decided to repost your [For Hire] threads weekly. While I'd personally prefer a good use of the search feature (since it's gotten better), it's an upstream battle, so the guideline seems to be wait at least a week between reposts. If someone's reposting every other day or something like that, feel free to report them, but actually send the mods a message explaining it or we'll think it was just the use of ""**SUPER DOWNVOTE**"".

P.S. Read the sidebar! It's got some helpful resources too.  The big green ""Hire a Redditor"" and ""Get Hired"" buttons will prefill a lot of the post for you and give you suggestions on what to write. "

Got burned out with the whole rat race recently and landed a night shift monitoring job at a data center that frees up a ton of study time, I’ve been hitting the pavement hard since.

I'm wrapping up my AS (ME emphasis, transfers to university as a junior), hopefully within a year. That way those credits are locked in and I have something to show for my 6 years of work so far, LOL. I’m working on the transfer process now with advisors. Senior year I plan to start on my FE &amp; hope to enter the market as an EIT. Due to job/family commitments, can only take 2 - 3 classes per semester plus summer &amp; may/winter semesters. I’m looking at least 4 years left. Depressing but what can I do, gotta keep my kids fed. 

My job now pays above avg ME starting salary, full benefits, etc. so I’m not necessarily in a hurry, although this shift sucks balls. Due to everything, internships are not an option for me -- I’m sure this will be my biggest hurdle. I'm hoping that my so called 'life experience' will supplement here. I'm also a massive tinkerer so I'm looking to expand my hobbies into more engr related things adding to my 'life experience' while I’m in school. (not really counting on this to benefit a career, but can't hurt, and it's good enough excuse for expensive toys).

Tl;dr: My questions are what I am looking at after graduation with my work experience and without an internship. Any insight or advise from anyone who's been here before or from anyone close with hiring managers, etc... I'm not going to change my course regardless.  I know it’s crazy, but I’m driven. This is my passion so I’ll finish come hell or high water. I struggle since I’m not fresh out of HS, but I’ve maintained a 3.8 GPA thus far. The only advantage is I know what I’m missing so I take my classes very seriously. 

Anyway, I just want to maybe hear some things to keep in mind on my journey. Thanks in advance.

It's a great industry and the company is something I think I would really like to be a part of. 



I was offered a job when I graudate ( in the spring ) as a COBOL programmer. The company wants me to maintain and update code and in the summer train a bunch of interns so I can build my own team.


The intern part sounds pretty cool. They're interested in almost building me my own small department and it's a large investment that they plan on following through with.





**Acutal Question** - If I do this will it ruin me? If I want to stay in financial services that is. I don't want my first job to disappear and for me to be useless or stuck in this one position for a long time. What I want to do is train up these interns for a few years than move over to a new department.

You guys have always been helpful and give excellent advice, so I'm wondering if you could please help a fellow job-seeker who needs a morale boost... :(

My story is weird and complicated, but basically, I feel pretty behind my peers and because of this, have been feeling pretty terrible about myself lately. I graduated with a B.A. in English and Professional Writing in 2011, and afterwards went through a few personal things so I was unable to really look for work. I'm currently attending a mental health group that has been helping heaps, but the depression and hopelessness of being unemployed is mind-numbing.

A huge problem for me is lack of motivation to actually search &amp; apply on a consistent, regular basis, so I end up sending off resumes and applications here and there a few times a week. What I've heard from everyone, everywhere, is to aim for 10+ resumes a day and still it will take months.

I'm currently looking for jobs within the fields of corporate writing/editing/proofreading/communications, as some of my fellow graduates have had success working in these fields with smaller start-up companies. I'm thinking of branching out, though, to other positions that aren't so writing-focused. I don't have enough experience, though, even though I do have some freelance work and an internship under my belt... I feel like I still don't stand a chance in my field because of how competitive and over-saturated it is. Maybe I'm not really meant to write for a living like I always thought?

So, /j/jobs, any words of advice, or any comments about your own journeys would be so very much appreciated. I've stopped even talking to friends about the subject because I always end up moping about my situation and feeling bad about it. I wish I could put my I'm-an-adult pants on but after a lifetime of judging my accomplishment on academics, I feel completely lost in a sea of post-graduate disappointment. 

**Tl;dr - Graduated a few years ago and feel behind, low morale and motivation, could really use some help or advice.**

Edited to say that I'm so pleasantly surprised at the comments of advice and encouragement! I really didn't think this post would go anywhere. Thank you, /r/jobs, for reminding me that I'm not alone, and that I'll be okay :) You guys are so great. I wish everyone the best of luck in their future!"

I have to get away from this place, its making me depressed and affecting my marriage.

I have been working at my company for over 6 years.

The first two years I was an intern while in Graduate school (summers off). First year unpaid, second year I got a small stipend which paid for my travel and lunch expenses.

After I graduated with my Masters, I started working full time two days later. I felt great, the extreme minority of those who got a job directly in the field before even graduating. 

I started off with a very entry level salary, as a contractor. but I am good with money and budgeting, so it didnt phase me, I was just super excited to be working and enjoying my career. I was promised that my boss will try to get me off contract and be an employee of the company.

A year later, I asked to be included as an employee, no longer a contractor, to which my boss said he could only get me decent raise after a few tough discussions with corporate. I was happy all my hard work was paying off, but a little disappointed I wasnt recognized as an employee. Even though the new salary was still pretty low, I didnt mind since I LOVE what I do. 

Now in my Fourth Year since graduating, boss keeps give me the run around about why Corporate wont make me an employee, including budget issues. Recently, the team I work with, all Employees, got decent promotions -except me of course. I protested, saying I was a part of the team and the success and deserved similar treatment. 

Boss and I had a big falling out but he still said he would try for me.

Two month later, Boss hires his DAUGHTER as a contractor at an extremely better salary than me. She gets so many perks and I am barley making it every month. 

I confront him saying that he keeps making excuses when it comes to me, but when it comes to others, especially his daughter, it was a cake walk. she didnt intern for two years, she has ZERO relevant experience.

Her in the office has created a lot of resent me and heightened tensions. Every time I talk to him or her I get very uncomfortable, and they even team up on me sometimes. I think its Time I leave. I will find another job at my own pace. 

I have a great wife whom I neglect and am often times in a bad mood due to the crap I deal with at work. I want to take my severance, pay off some debt and hopefully move on to greener and healthier pastures. "
1l4za0,3,2013-08-26,Don't know,mightyapple,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1l4za0/dont_know/,"Yeah, so a bit of a background. My parents went through a bankruptcy when I where in a middle school.  They are short of money, I have a 3 younger siblings that are not capable yet to work.
My Dad has several problems with his health including his heart, lungs and diabetes. He still works for several hours a day. I'm a computer science student at one of the best universities in my country. I have a great girlfriend (which in fact has some issues with herself, but it is not a relationship advice subreddit).

I do some freelance stuff, I'm on a good paid internship, I'm almost healthy, have food, ability to learn, but still I've felt like sad for several years. In fact my Girlfriend is my last (I don't know if it is a proper phrase in english) ray of happiness in my life.

Since middle school I knew that I would like to work in computer science, but since last year of high school I just don't know if I want to do this anymore, but frankly I see no other choice of career. I would like to be entrepreneur, but maybe I weren't born to do things like that. In fact from childhood I easily gain interest in things, new projects, hobbies and loose motivation after few days and abandon them. I could earn good money several times but lack of persistence stopped me from doing those projects. And in computer science persistence is very important. I lost several freelance jobs because of missing deadlines because of lack of motivation in doing them.

 I hardly have any friend anymore, through high school I would usually choose to stay at home and help my father in his work rather than going to parties, meeting with friends etc. I don't have any hobbies anymore. I get up in the morning and think about how I don't know what to do with my life.

I'm shy, quiet, introverted and constantly tired, maybe a bit depressed. Only thanks to this great person with a blond hair and pretty face ( :) ) I've met some new people and done some new things lately.

After work I'm just to tired to do anything. In few weeks I'll get back to university again and I will have even less time and energy to do things.

I talk once with my Dad about taking a one year gap in studying and just travel a bit, work and just think what to do with my life, but he asked me to finish my studies as fast as I could, because after those studies I'll get well paid job, I'll be able to help my family.

I know that I should be a support for my family and my girlfriend (as I said, she has some issues with herself and last thing she should have and deserve is a sad boyfriend).

I know that those words are just whinings of young, spoiled guy, because there are people with no food, no health care, no access to education doing great things, helping people, and I'm here, in developed country with all tools to just be happy and successful, and this post is very selfish, but I'm just like... sad.

Frankly I don't know what to do with my life, should I continue with my studies, what should I do to feel less overwhelmed with a world? What to do with myself to feel happy. I'm not sure if I ever was like 100% happy for longer then a week or something. I need an advice what to do with my life.

I am planing to move in october 2013 to a country in Europe to a study a BS in computer science. I have got several acceptances but I do not know what should I consider when I want to choose where study CS.
I am accepted at the University of Nice, but I do not think I would find a lot of internship opportunities in Nice, France. Nice is more like a touristic city. However it has a great computer science exchange program with the University of Cambridge, and I am very fluent in French since I studied in a French Lycee.
I am accepted too at University of Hannover and University of Bochum. Germany is a known to be a great place to study engineering and stuff related to technology. 
I am also accepted in TU Wien = Technical University of Vienna. In Vienna there is Microsoft and there is IBM, and I am sure there is a lot of other international firms that are related to CS. And I have lived for one month in Vienna and fell in love with the city.
But I want to choose the best university between these since I am planing to do a master's degree in ETH Zurich or in a great university in the UK.And I need to have a great portfolio and I guess a great university will boost my chances of getting accepted in a great university.
So I have no idea what to look at to choose the best place to study.
I do not know if this info about me will help, but I am a girl, 20 years old.

I also graduated cum laude, which I am now realizing is not a big deal whatsoever in the job world.  

Since May I have had applied to hundreds of jobs, and have yet to receive a call back.  My experience includes my editorial internship, event planning in college, and multiple retail supervision positions.

I obviously would like to find a job that would pay well, have room for growth, and utilize/require my degree, but I'm even applying to jobs that I am way overqualified for and can't get a call.

I started off my job search applying for everything and anything I saw that didn't require a higher degree or a specified degree I didn't have. 

I have since changed my approach to only apply for things I'm qualified for and limit myself to 3-5 jobs a day.  I feel less overwhelmed and more organized in my job search since the change, but I still haven't had any luck (even with jobs I'm overqualified for).

I'm not too picky with my search.  I only have a couple requirements. 

1) I won't work with food unless it is vegan (personal beliefs). So no McDonalds or anything until I find something better.

2)While I am more than willing to work for retail as a filler job, I won't work for Walmart. And would prefer a manager position due to my work history. 

3)I'm even willing to relocate as far south as NJ and as far west as PA, as long as the job is right. Obviously I'm not moving for a retail job, but a strong career will have my bags packed.

I use indeed, careerbuilder, monster, simplyhired, linkedin, and city and state job listings.

We're currently long distance and obviously would like that to stop.  We've seen a couple options and are trying to figure out what would work.  

Something that has come up is being a 'package deal' for a company.  I think that with our particular specialties, this might be possible as we're similar enough that one company would likely have both departments, but different enough that we wouldn't be physically working together (look, I love him, but I don't want to be around him 24/7!).

I'd say we're about equal in ability.  I've got 2 years of internship experience, he's been working for about 1.5 years plus about 1 year of internship.  I will have a masters.  I did have better grades in undergrad, but his are perfectly adequate, and we both went to the same school.  He's gotten excellent reviews from his current company, and I got good reviews from my internships.

Have you ever even seen a company hire both spouses?  Was there any resentment towards the 'trailing spouse' (the one who maybe the company didn't initially want)? Do companies actually do this?

I would like to ask a bit of advice as I am currently seeking a return to cs related work after a 4 year hiatus.

Relevant past:
From 2005-2008 I attended Montana State University where I was pursuing a degree in Computer Science (and a degree in History). In December 2007 I was employed as a QA Intern in a local enterprise level software firm. I remained there for 9 months, and in the summer I negotiated a full-time job in the Sydney, Australia branch as a junior consultant/QA/software engineer. When I got there, I suffered from culture shock, panicked, and resigned immediately as I was not ready for such a big life change. I believe I could have done the job, but I was young and stupid and I messed up.

Following that I spent a year with family in Tasmania getting my feet back. I enlisted in the Australian Army in 2009 as an Analyst Intelligence Operations where I picked up military skills, two languages (Diploma in Vocational Indonesian and Cert III in Vocational Javanese). I finished my stint in Psychological Operations, where I spent a year as an operations NCO. My responsibilities were personnel tracking, exercise planning, and general office miscellanea in addition to general intelligence analysis reporting and tasks. I also took on the development of our Sharepoint external page (within defence, but external to the unit), and spent a month-long exercise as a database manager.

I've returned to Montana as of August '13 in order to marry my fiancee, and I am looking for work. Specifically I would like to find work as a junior/intern level developer as I have maintained my skills at the level they were when I left. Is this realistic? What should I be doing while looking for a job that will improve my profile and my chances?

TL;DR : Dropped out of university 3 years in for a job offer in Sydney that I immediately left for personal reasons, joined the military in an unrelated field, returned to the US and am looking to return to cs."

When I started secondary school I was a gifted pupil with 'straight As on my horizon, I wanted to be a vet and as the school I chose was publicized as a Science Specialist school - I had made my choice. The first year &amp; a half went well, I was excelling in all my classes &amp; had a solid social circle, &amp; I met my best friend who to this day means the world to me. At the end of the 2nd year, it went a tad rocky - I had befriended one of the 'naughty' girls in my year &amp; started social smoking &amp; drinking (not excessively) - I was still getting my grades. My 3rd year everything went wrong - me &amp; my best friend had befriended these 2 other girls who were into bunking (truanting) &amp; we loved the thrill of it - we started missing school on a regular basis, staying out past midnight on school days (we were 13) &amp; just generally fucking up. My Mum &amp; Dad went awol when this started to happen - I had to climb from my 2nd story window if I wanted to go out, I was constantly 'grounded' &amp; when I did manage to sneak out - I wouldn't return for 3 days until they had calmed down. At this point I started stealing from my parents too - from cash, alcohol &amp; cigarettes to money out of their banks. At this stage I had also started smoking cannabis, but only occasionally &amp; it was always recreational. My parents cut all pocket money &amp; I resorted to shoplifting - this ceased when I was arrested (moderately). My home life was so unbearable at this point - I had made my parents resent me &amp; I was a thief, they couldn't even leave their wallets around their OWN home. The only thing I had which was solid was my social life, I had a best friend, a solid &amp; vast friendship group - I've always been social so this aspect of my life meant so much to me. One day I was out with my friends &amp; I kissed a boy who was at least 8 years older than me, this got out in my school &amp; I was briefly despised. It was my best-friend who had told people as she wanted me to 'learn from my mistakes' - looking back I agree with her. When aware that everyone knew, I felt lost. I felt that my parents hated me &amp; so did the world - I had no-one. This particular night my parents had gone out to dinner, it was rare for my Dad to go out apart from shopping &amp; to the doctors as he has chronic bronchitis and COPD. That night I took 10 packets of paracetemol, 5 of ibuprofen &amp; 3 of aspirin. I went straight to sleep &amp; woke up with the feeling I had been stabbed in the stomach. My dad being such an observant man had noticed I had put one of the medicine packets back in the cabinet the wrong way &amp; burst into my room asking if I had taken anything, even though I was denying it he could see by my body language &amp; that I was constantly retching that I had. He instantly woke up my Mum &amp; called an ambulance. I was in Hospital for 4 nights &amp; 3 days, luckily they pumped my stomach in time &amp; their was no permanent damage apart from a weaker liver than the average. My dad saved my life. My social life returned back to normal - if not better. But week by week I was becoming more of a delinquent. My grades were dropping, I was barely in school &amp; I started smoking cannabis quite a few times a week, even alone. My parents started expecting my behaviour rather than getting so angry when I had done anything wrong. By the age of 14 I didn't have a curfew &amp; could basically do what I pleased. I have always been a Daddy's girl, even though I love my Mum no less. I was gifted with the wittiest most insightful man as a Dad, &amp; he was always the parent I had felt most comfortable opening up to. I am naturally clever, so I was still getting A's in English as all you need to be is articulate, but all my other subjects I had dropped down to border-line average as I wasn't in any lessons to acquire any of the knowledge I needed. My Brother stayed on the right route, getting top grades in all his GCSEs and Alevels, getting a internship at credit suisse &amp; going to the top uni for economics in London. Everything my Dad wanted for him, he was so proud. I was/am the complete opposite. The last year of secondary school I still had the same attitude - I had no work ethic nor motivation, even though every year I said would be a 'clean slate' . I was smoking weed daily at this point. During my Mock exams I tried MDMA (extasy) for the first time &amp; loved it - I was so happy like you wouldn't believe. I never got addicted nor took it excessively. I managed to scrape 5 C's in my GCSE's, even though I was predicted 10 A's when I had first started the school. I was actually surprised at the results - as in the last 3 years of school I probably only attended 1 &amp; a half overall. This was enough for me to be allowed to start my A-levels. I wanted a fresh start so I went to college rather than staying at the 6th form at my school- this was a horrible horrible mistake. When I was in lessons I did well, but I was rarely in them. My dad would scream &amp; scream at me in the mornings to get out of bed - I would scream the worst abuse imaginable to him &amp; lock myself in. I was addicted to cannabis &amp; when I was in college I was too paranoid that I almost always went home nearly as soon as I got there. The teachers there liked me, my attendance was 17% but I was doing better than a lot of the other students around me (it was a pretty shitty college). One night 3 days before my exams begun I was in central London with all of my friends just basically getting pissed &amp; meeting people. This night was the first night I took cocaine. I lost my friends that night &amp; I also lost my phone. I came home at 7am crying my eyes out just wanting to have a conversation with my Dad ( he was always up all night and asleep during the day because he was so ill ). I found my Dad sat down at the kitchen table slumped across it. He had had a heart attack &amp; died. The next few hours were a blur. I slept through the mortuary picking up his body, but I had to be interviewed by the police. At the time I had a boyfriend, who I cared for a lot, but he was a coke-head. As much as he helped me, I got into cocaine far more than I should have. I went into deep deep depression and filmed myself on my laptop daily just crying &amp; conversing with myself. I felt so guilty &amp; I still do. As much as I knew that he knew I loved him I couldn't help but constantly think about how I could have made his life so much better, how I could have made him happier. I didn't attend my exams, understandably &amp; that whole summer was a combination of drugs, alcohol &amp; depression. My Mum is also very reserved so she dealt with it herself, so I had to aswell. My friends being 16 year olds didn't know how to handle it - personally I think they could have done a lot more - but I detached myself from everything - refusing to talk about it unless I was drunk &amp; then I just exploded in a fit of tears. It didn't get better with time as everyone had promised. All I wanted/want to do is to make my Dad proud of me &amp; become as successful as he wanted me to be, as I wanted to be &amp; what I'm capable to be. I enrolled back at my old school the following year adamant I was going to be a changed person. The first month I was excelling, I felt comfortable &amp; was doing well in my classes. I was still massively depressed &amp; would commonly go home sit in my room with the lights off &amp; watch video's of soldiers being reunited with their daughters on Youtube &amp; just cry over them (I don't know why). I began to not turn up to a lot of my classes, the weed was a trigger as it made me so unmotivated, paranoid &amp; even more depressed. I was kicked out at Christmas because of my attendance. Since then I enrolled to private tutoring but as my Mum was always at work during the day - I lied about going. I never went. I lied to my friends, I lied to everyone. My best friend managed to fix up, she's going to university this September &amp; I am so proud of her. One day in January I made the rash decision that I wanted to move out of London in September &amp; have a clean slate - I chose liverpool (5 hour drive away). I love the idea of being whoever I want to be &amp; starting making new foundations. My house is just a constant reminder of that awful night. I want to get my A-levels &amp; go to university like I've always planned to do. Moving out is so soon &amp; I am so worried I will go into a vortex of depression, have no friends &amp; hate college &amp; the city. I can't go back now as I've paid for the accommodation &amp; I feel like I will be a laughing stock if I once again fuck up. I just got back from a festival with my friends, &amp; me &amp; my best friend had a massive drunken argument. 'You are only moving away because I'm going to University' 'You will never change' 'No-one really likes you' 'You've changed' 'You haven't been my bestfriend for years now' 'I hate you' 'You're a slag' 'I can't wait to get rid of you' were a few of the things she said to me. We made up that night but I can't let go. I have only tried to kill myself once after my Dad had died - but I walked into A&amp;E as I realised how selfish it was - It would destroy my Mum &amp; she deserves so much better. Killing yourself is so selfish towards your loved ones. These past few months I have been constantly having more suicidal thoughts &amp; I think I am near the brink. I know this feeling too well. I am either going to end up running away abroad &amp; killing myself, moving to Liverpool and eventually killing myself, or killing myself before I move. But I can't. I feel one day I will just do it &amp; I don't want to but It's the only way out. Maybe I can never change. I understand there are people out there who have lost their whole families tragically, who have to walk miles for food or suffer from a terrible illness but I can't help but feel like this. I have read a few of the other posts, I am close with my Mum again now after my Dad passed, I love my friends dearly &amp; have a great social life. But my life is dead-end, I am so so so useless &amp; all I do is fret about 'who I used to be' &amp; 'who I am now'. Since my Dad died, I agree I have changed but I couldn't help it. He was my world &amp; now I feel I have nothing going for me &amp; never will. I'm not religious so even if I DID turn things around (impossible) I know he died knowing I was a fuck up, &amp; couldn't see that I had changed. This kills me.

Right now, I have yet to decide whether to continue on to graduate school as soon as I graduate or to get a 12-18 month internship to get work experience before returning to school. Which of these options would be preferable, money not being an issue? I should add that I have no internship experience, but have a decent GPA (3.7-ish) and have worked as a TA for 4 courses at my university.

My desired field is in computer architecture and hardware design.

Thanks!"

I am currently a Junior in College and I started my major a bit late and I know it's a bit too late to start Extracurriculars but I was wondering if I should bother with an Internship as a IT or should I just take the semester off to focus on school/learn a new language so I can get an actual Software Engineering Internship. I don't really know that many languages (working on C++ and Python) and it's really hard to find an internship for that. Should I still go for it? I'm currently residing in NYC if that helps.

I wasn't a particularly good student and graduated with a 2.33 GPA and did not get any internships.  Hindsight is everything and I wish I had devoted much more time to school.  However, here I am today with a degree and what I feel is nothing to show for it.  I like programming, but I feel like I am not nearly skilled enough to land a job anywhere.  My lack of confidence on top of many ""entry level"" jobs requiring skill in languages and tools I have never heard of, let alone used, make applying to jobs rather difficult.  I know the worst the employer can say is no, but I would rather save myself the embarrassment of not knowing something simple in an interview.  I have applied for several tech sales jobs and had some interviews but I don't really like people all that much and I get incredibly nervous.  I am also really shy so you can imagine what those interviews and follow-ups were like.  I have considered sysadmin stuff but again I don't have the certs/skills for that and I don't like being on call 24/7.  As far as jobs go I guess I'd like to sit and write code mostly.  I enjoy doing tech support kinds of things to an extent.  I don't really want to spend another couple of years honing my skills to where they should already be.  Another thing is I'm not sure where to search for jobs now that I am out of school.  I have been using LinkedIn and Dice and Monster etc., but half the listings seem to be third party recruiters, who I am wary of.  Am I looking in the right place?  Can I still get a job writing code soon?  If not, can I get some other job besides sales or something where I have to talk to customers all day?  I am really concerned that I am paying back all these loans with an income that can't pay them at the moment.  I know I should have done a lot of things sooner/at all.  Any advice would be great.

**TL;DR  I got a degree and now feel like I don't know anything.  Not being a great student, what are my options?**

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your replies.  You have really told me some things I needed to hear.  It has definitely let me know some things about myself that I didn't realize and I will actively work on changing them for the better and hopefully get a job soon!"

Oh and for most of the internship I was actually a de facto free translator betweenthe Virginia branch and the China branch.

I have a 3.0 gpa in applied math and am going into my 5th year, but with some extraordinarily bad grades in some core cs classes (along with every other class I was taking at the time).

You shake the recruiters hand, thank them from bringing you in and engage in some small talk, mostly about the weather. Now it’s time to get down to business: “Why don’t you begin by walking me through your resume.”

It’s critical that you take no more than two minutes to deliver your answer so as to avoid boring the interviewer and losing their attention and interest. Focus on the key selling points and give your answer a defined structure. The following list of things to check off in the following order is what we recommend from experience and consulting numerous recruiters:

Discuss where you went to school, what you majored in and why you choose your major
In order of oldest to newest, discuss briefly your work experience. Mention what skills you were able to develop and make sure that you only talk about the ones most pertinent to the job you’re interviewing for
Discuss briefly how you became interested in the industry you’re trying to break into and tie it back to why you’re interested in the job you’re interviewing for; show genuine interest
Briefly talking about your extracurricular involvement to come across as a more well rounded individual
Here’s a sample answer that we believe is a good example of how you can generally structure your answer:

“Originally, I’m from Toronto but I decided to move out to Boston after getting accepted into MIT. MIT is well known and has a lot of reputable profs who’re tops in their respective fields and so I felt it was the best fit for me. I chose to major in economics because I found the analytical and quantitative aspects really stimulating. I naturally enjoy following business news and seeing how the state of the economy shapes the business landscape, so majoring in economics was an easy choice for me.

During my junior summer, I had an internship with X Economic Consulting and I really enjoyed it. The position entailed that I do a lot of research, discuss findings with my superiors and perform certain analyses for reports that I’d be tasked with writing. I learned a lot and developed my analytical, writing and communication skills immensely.

But it was mainly the researching and writing aspect that I loved. And given my active interest in what’s happening in the business world and the economy, I decided that I want to pursue a career in economic reporting, so I’m here today to try make that dream a reality. Besides all that, in my free time, I like to play soccer, watch movies, read a lot of biographies and travel as often as I can.”"

1l8yky,1,2013-08-28,What do I do?,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1l8yky/what_do_i_do/,"Hi,

I’ve never really talked to anyone about this but I felt like it would be good.  People say that about writing your down your goals right? Supposedly it helps;  hopefully it will help with this issue as well. I figure the most appropriate way to start this is with some backstory. I’ve been throwing back some gin so bear with me. 
I’ve never really been happy. If happiness was as easy as distracting or entertaining myself than I doubt I’d even be posting here, but apparently it’s not. Like many others I have been the type of person that pushes off their goals. If I can accomplish goal “x” by time ”y” then I will be finally happy. It’s easy to take comfort in the premise that when you’re young you have an infinite amount of time ahead of you to rectify the mistakes of your past. Obviously life doesn’t work this way. 

I’ve never been a great student. Throughout high school I maintained (if my memory serves me correctly) around a 3.0 average gpa, and planned on improving this once I reached college. Like most college bound high school students and I suppose people in general, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted my future to look like.  After copious amounts of research, conversations with people in the medical field and even messaging the author of my favorite blog about being a surgeon (he even sent me a signed copy of his book, still have the damn thing) I had set my sights on becoming surgeon. 

With no sports or academic scholarships available for the level of mediocrity I brought to the table, I began attending community college. Of course just anticipating that you would try harder isn’t a viable replacement for actual hard work and my gpa reflected that.  At this point I realized I lacked the resolve required for medical school and redirected my ambitions. Like many other young students in college I began experimenting with drugs, and saw great utility within psychedelics.  I became enamored  with the writings and works of Shulgin and decided that my life’s work should be within a field of research that reflected that interest. In high school I realized I had a knack for chemistry, and coupled with this new found interest I was set. 

It was around this time that I transferred to my local state university seeking a degree in biochemistry. Even though I was spending a great deal of time studying and actually enjoying the classes I had the opportunity to take my gpa still remained around 3.0. Hardly good enough to pursue my masters and not even close enough to pursue my back up plan of going into pharmacy I sank into deep depression. 

I mean looking back it has been clear that I’ve always been depressed. I always told myself that I would be happy once I accomplished what I set out to accomplish. That once I was successful I would have no reason to feel unhappy. This mind state led me to almost complete apathy,  and I ended up failing a class that they would not allow me to take again (because they stopped offering it). This failing grade (in a fucking elective for Christ’s sake, it was always the electives I did poorly in) was the last nail in the coffin and I ended up graduating with a gpa less than 3.0. Which is the necessary gpa for attending grad school, at least in the schools I have researched. So here I am, still working at the same shitty job that I had in college, hiding in the back from embarrassment when people I used to know wander in. Watching my largely successful group of friends move on to great jobs, while I just wake up every morning thinking about ending it. 

In my mind, it would be better to die now than to grow old and accomplish nothing; which is my biggest fear. It seems that nothing would be shameful than that. It has been impossible for me to get a job in my field, as my lack of internships and work experience renders me useless as an employee apparently. So what do I do? Honestly I’ve thought about killing myself every day I wake up, and every night when I go to sleep for the last year. I’m not religious, but the thought of what happens afterwards terrifies me. So I really don’t know what to do. 

Thanks for reading this,

Signed  - Someone who appreciates it.

In the program, you do the internship over the summer and during ONE semester of the school year, while being considered a full time student (the 12 credits + 1 online course). 

Due to missing one semester at school (internship rather than classes), this will greatly implicate my living arrangements for the remainder of this school year. I have a lease that lasts for the next two semesters. It also complicates living arrangements for next year, as I will be left with my final semester without a housing lease.

My questions are...

How long do internships generally last?
Would I be okay to find an internship without participating in the school program?
Can I find an internship that is from June - late August? (so I don't miss a semester)

I understand internships are very important for finding a job after graduation, so I really want to make it happen. However, I don't know that it will be worth missing a semester of school for it (even though I am getting credits).

I ripped this next bit from my pcpartpicker listing:

After using my laptop for three years in college, I wanted to upgrade to something that had more storage and the ability to run all of my games at the highest settings. I'm a Computer Graphics Tech student so I use Maya, Photoshop, After Effects, and other suites frequently. Having this available when the lab is full is really nice, as well as heavy gaming. I had a paid internship so I saved a little chunk off to the side to build this computer. I changed the components many times and it still ended up pretty close to the budget that I set. This was my first time building a computer so I did a lot of research and got advice from some friends who had built their own. So far I'm extremely pleased at the performance that my machine has given me.

Thoughts on each part:

CPU: Works great. Haven't overclocked yet but might just a tad in the future. I was going to get ivy bridge but there was a combo on Newegg that made going LGA1150 $80 cheaper. Way faster than my i7 Q 720 in my laptop.

CPU Cooler: Works great. Didn't really want to go up to water cooling because I probably won't need it. The TPC-612 is basically a Hyper 212 Evo sized version of the TPC-812 so it doesn't take up as much space.

Mobo: Was going to go with MSI but the combo made going with ASRock the better option. It's been great so far and everything was easy to install to it. The only thing that's a bit odd is that extra fan plugs are just about right in the middle of the board so if you want a clean look and want more fans that might be a nuisance.

RAM: Works like a charm. OC'd it to 1866 with the presets in the UEFI settings. It's also blue. Very blue.

GPU: Was going to get a 660 TI before the 700 series was announced. I'm very glad that I stepped up to the 770. I can play just about everything on ultra settings on a 1080p monitor @ 60 fps. Turned down a few filters in Metro 2033 but everything looks beautiful. The GeForce experience app that you can download makes it easy to get the most out of your graphic configuration with games that are recognized. It also renders video previews in After Effects much faster. Not quite full speed with uncompressed 4k but it's awesome with everything else.

Case: Sexy. Cable routing is very easy and workable. Very solid build too. The airflow is pretty good and the compartment at the bottom is a nice feature. Just about everything is modular too so you can take off the front panels with your fingers or change position of the hard drive bays. I turned them 90 degrees so that the fans face in rather than sideways (how it was shipped.) The fans are also very nice and the white LEDs add a nice touch.

SSD: Fast as hell. Boots to desktop in about 8 seconds.

HDD: Really fast. Loads my games very quickly and runs CS6 great.

PSU: It does its job. I know it's a bit overkill for this system but I got it during a pretty good promotion which made it cheaper than the 750W.

Disk Drive: It installed Windows. I think I burned a CD on it once.

OS: Windows 8 isn't that bad. I put on StartIsBack and it's just like your cozy old Win7. I like the way it organized the explorer and it's also a lot faster.

Monitors: Yes, I bought two Acers for $2. A friend's company IT guy was upgrading to new monitors so they were basically giving the old ones away. 1080p &amp; 60Hz. Can't complain.

Other peripherals were ones I previously owned.

The building process went very smoothly as I watched several how-to videos and read guides beforehand. I'm very happy with this build and I'm proud of my new work/(but mostly)play rig. I ran 3DMark but I forgot what the score was. It was at least 9100 or something but haven't really tried to stress out the capabilities of it fully just yet. The original color scheme for the innards was going to be black and blue, but ended up black and gold (except for the RAM anyway.) It still works though. heh.

This site was very helpful in guiding me on what parts to get and how to balance a build out. So yeah, that's it. Thanks for looking!"

Should I hide my gpa and add my highschool info?

Does the formatting look to much like a template?

My work experience descriptions could use a redo but I am having a difficult time thinking of anything I achieved there.

Should I shorten the technical skills section?

Any other criticism is welcome!

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How long was the development of the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx20yu?context=5)|I think my first source of inspiration was an old german childrens show called ""Fablernas värld (in swedish)"" ([Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfrkKqu7OVs)) But of course the mood and setting of Watership Down. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" has also been an inspiration. We also watched a lot of nature documentaries during development (an honorably mention to David Attenborough). When it comes to games we played a lot of games with a much slower pace that focused on non-combat. Journey, Proteus, Dear Esther, for example.
[Were there other kinds of animals that you thought about using for the game? Why badgers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx20yu?context=5)|We started developing the game in January this year. So we've been working on it for about eight months.  I talked a bit about why we chose badgers here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
[I was really curious why you chose badgers, but the link you gave me doesn't seem to answer that. Could you check again that it's right?  EDIT: I found the right link! Link to www.reddit.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx36ua?context=5)|Thank you for your question! Sorry for giving you the wrong link. I've PM'd you with a Shelter Steam code.
[1.Rails or open world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyfdo?context=5)|The game is level based, so it has a rather linear progression. Although each area is quite large so there's a lot of exploration beside the main track.
[2.Can you please tell me average time needed to complete a game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyfdo?context=5)|The play time depends a lot on what kind of player you are. It's takes about 1,5 - 2 hours to run through it. But as I sad there's a lot of exploration, so if you want to experience everything it can take much longer. It also depends on how well you're taking care of your cubs.
[No saves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyfdo?context=5)|The game automatically save your progress after each area.
[Thank you. Right now I'm playing your game and get a deep pleasure from the process.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx1vg5?context=5)|Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code you can give away to a friend.
[How did you go about recording the badger sounds/calls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmaf?context=5)|Our Sound Designer studied how badgers sound and communicate with each other, and then cut, pitched and mixed different kind of animals to make them sound like real badgers. I'm not sure, but I don't think we have any sounds from an actual badger in the game.
[I love how you allow the player to become immersed in the world by hearing only the ambient forest sounds and intermittent squeaking of the badger cubs and only use actual music for certain instances.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2lef?context=5)|Thank you very much! I'm glad you liked it.
 |I've PM'd you a Steam Code.
[What made you decide to go small? What are the things that you learned in the big companies that a small indie guy doesn't know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr?context=5)|I personally wanted to try to have a much broader responsibility. As an indie you to have to make everything by your self most of the time (as I sad in my post: everything from marketing to planning your own work). You also have a much larger creative freedom. There's also a much broader scope on your own development. As an example, I was a Level Designer for Just Cause 2 and Fable III, and responsible for 4-5 levels over the course of several years (especially for Just Cause 2). I continued working as a Level Designer when developing Pid, where I created the foundation for all 124 level by my self during the first year.
 |I think a really useful thing I learned as a AAA-developer was to time box my own work. Overrating how long certain aspects of development take can really break the game (as well as yourself). I've also learned to develop my tasks to a specific standard, and then move on to the next. Instead of taking to much time to develop incredible detail. If you finish everything in before your deadline, you can always go back to the places where you want to add aditional polish. Time is a truly importaint resource that I think some indies (generally) tend to under estimate.
 |Hope that answers your questions (I'd love to give you more, but I have to continue to the next ones :))
 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[Which artist do you think inspired for the visual aspects of the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0kac?context=5)|We're artistically inspired by many different artists. The patterns largest inspiration was old japanese art. Everything from paper craft to old heraldry.
 |The color palette largest inspiration was water color.
 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[Did you have a team before the leap?  Fow how long did you think about going indie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzqky?context=5)|My leap from AAA to indie wasn't a truly active one. I actually moved from Lionhead back to Stockholm for personal reasons, and got an proposition from Might &amp; Delight which I couldn't refuse soon after that. Although I'd thought about it for several years before that, but just waited for the right moment. I was really lucky that M&amp;D had a stable economy before I started, cause I'm not sure if I would have skipped a really nice job, with a decent salary to create indie games without having an income. For me it would've been a too long leap, but I truly admire people who does it.
[Your path just goes to show the power of the dark side... Welcome my child. There are no colour-coordinated lunches here, but plenty of AMA's and translation errors in the final product.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2vk0?context=5)|Haha! Did you see the bashing we got on our Italian translation?
[EDIT:I guess self-deprecation isn't the way to go...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2vk0?context=5)|Thank you for your question though. I've sent you a Steam Code!
[The game looks excellent, I plan on buying it ASAP.  I hope it's a huge success on Steam for you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m?context=5)|Hi! Thank you very much! I hope you'll like it!
[My question:  Why did you guys choose badgers?  What was your second choice/runner up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m?context=5)|The only thing we were sure of in the early concept development was that we didn't want to create a player avatar that resembled other games, as well as we wanted an animal that was kind of low and fat, as it made the animation work much easier. I think our first prototype was an animal that more resembled a pig then a badger. Although we wanted it to feel more wild then domestic, so I gave the suggestion to make them badgers. Personally badgers have always been close to my heart. I remember when I was 7-9 years old my old elementary teacher gave all the children in my class a post card with an animal after each years graduation. Every year each children got a post card with a different animal, everyone except me who got a badger every year. This wasn't the reason we chosed badgers, but since it fit our profile so well we went with it.
[Bonus question:  What game are you guys developing next?  Anything in the works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m?context=5)|I've also gained a lot of grey hair lately, so it fits me pretty well :)
[Are you using Unity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwykat?context=5)|Yes! It's 100% made in Unity. Just as our previous game Pid.
 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[Since you have experience from major games, do you feel the pacing of creating your own has changed how you approach game development?  Working with a major developer with a tight schedule got shit done but you probably sacrificed a lot of 'what could have been' within the game to keep the progress moving. What is one of those biggest what could have beens or some type of system you always wanted to see fleshed out?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx3kgu?context=5)|I don't know if the pacing has changed, as you're still very bound to create something within set boundaries as an indie (economical, tight deadlines, etc). Although my understanding and admoration for different roles in game development has changed a lot. Both because you'll work much closer to all the different disciplines, but also because your own responsebility becomes much broader. I answered to something similar here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
[I mean I'm sure creatively you have even more say and more ability to mold what the end vision is, but do you find that working with an almost abstract idea can confine your play ability and how you see the world around you in the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx3kgu?context=5)|Your questions are very deep, but I'll try to answer them as good as I can. Please respond if you want to follow up or clarify something.  Our creative process almost always start by defining boundaries within we want to work. Initially they are dependent on how the team looks like. For example during Pid we only had one artist, so we knew that if we wanted to fulfill our vision we had to simplify the graphics in some way. Which ended up us removing all textures in the game (hence the quite unique look). We did something similar in Shelter, but decided to go the other way and remove all lighting. Decisions like these created a tight frame that we had to work within. We couldn't create gameplay that involved real-time shadows in Shelter for example (except for the bird, which is a texture). Or gameplay that involved textures in Pid.  There's always things in a game you create that you want to polish or flesh out more if you had the time. I worked as a Level Designer for my mayor releases, so the process looks a bit different compared to system designers for example. As a Level Designer the last thing you do on a level is decorating, which you do when everything else is finished, and you can continue to do it forever.
[I bought the game for a friend because it ""looked cute"" and ""badgers are the best"" and have some questions! Why a game about badgers? What inspired you all to make the game?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0phh?context=5)|I've answer to why we chose to make it about badgers here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzz2m)
 |I think our main source of inspiration was that we wanted to create something completely different. Both something anyone in the studio hasn't worked on before, but also a game that most players hasn't experienced. We were also very axious to try to create a (somewhat) non-combat oriented and emotional titel. As Pid was very focused on game mechanics, we wanted to create something that touched more ""softer"" variables like exploration and adventuring.
 |Thank you for your question! I've PM'd you a Steam Code so you can experience the game yourself.
[How much time did you _actually_ spend in the forest while making this game? :\)  (Judging by Link to www.youtube.com at least a few hours?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2ogs?context=5)|Being borned and raised in central Stockholm, I'm actually not much of a nature-guy myself. But we had to take a few hours walk while filming that dev diary. But that's about it, I'm afraid. Although we did watch a lot of documentaries about the wild.
[Hey Johannes, the game looks really cool I can't wait to play it. I have two questions, my first is about the art style, I get a very story book/ popup book feel from Shelter, is that what you guys were going for? Also I love the idea of a survival game where you are trying to keep yourself and others alive, was that the idea from the beginning or did you add the children later in development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx1zke?context=5)|I wrote an answer regarding the art-style here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0kac)
 |The original design for the game was an adventure, but we added the children really early. Probably within the first weeks of designing. I think that was really necessary since we base most of the mechanics in the game around the children. If we added them later we would probably have to redesign a lot of things.
[I just finished playing through the game and loved it! I have just one question: is there only one ending?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2vpr?context=5)|Thank you! I'm happy you liked it. The game focuses a lot on only one journey, so there's only one real ending. Although it can change a bit depending on how you managed you cubs.
 |Did you see the clip after the credits? :)
[Yes! I loved it! I managed to make it out with three on my first playthrough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx4d86?context=5)|Thank you! I've PM'd you a steam code you can give away to a friend.
[Hej!  How has your experience as an indie developer been since leaving a AAA company? Is having more control over your projects worth having a team of only seven people?  Do you think you would ever go back to AAA development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx184g?context=5)|Hej!
 |I answered to something similar here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
 |I think there's a tight balance between good and bad things when comparing indie development to AAA. It's worth it since I've learned A LOT that I don't think I'd learned if I still worked with AAA. But it would probably be the other way around as well. Just as I can't say that it's better to work with indie, or the other way around.
 |If I know myself I will probably go back to AAA one day, then back to Indie, then back to AAA again, back and forth forever :)
[Is there any possibility to download/buy the main menu song? I absolutely loved it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx6nge?context=5)|Thank you very much! It's made by a studio band called Retro Family. They created all the music in both Shelter and Pid, and we're really proud to be working with them. We're currently discussing how we want to distribute the music, but unfortunatly we haven't made a decission yet. My best bet is to like Retro Family on facebook and keep an eye open for any news.

[What do you find is the biggest obstacle for releasing a game like this, where you can't really appeal to the type gamers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0vyz?context=5)|When creating a niche game like Shelter we've always knew it wouldn't appeal to everyone. I'm not sure I see it as an obstacle, as it's more interesting to create niche titles then trying to satisfy everyone. Although when taking into account that a majority of gamers might not be interested in the game, you have to create it with a very tight budget to match the (possible) low income. Which of course effects the final product. I'm afraid I don't have any real experience with it, but I can understand the problem. I think that game and game culture still is in a very young state. Especially gamers. But the medium age of a gamer is constantly growing, so hopefully we will see a future soon where ""everyone"" play games, just as ""everyone"" watches movies or listen to music. This will also create a market for a much wider array of different use for games. I believe that there's a bright future for serious games (Research games, educational games, rehabilitating games, etc). But we're unfortunately not there yet. I think what your father does is admirable, and hopefully something that we will see much more of in the future.
[My dad is an artist who has worked on video games, and recently is working on a game made possible by a grant from the gates foundation, and it's about researching how video games can help people learn, and researching the relationship between video games and adult success. But he doesn't think the game will do very well because they can't find trained, skilled, committed workers to do the things they need. Most of the workers all have other jobs, and try and get unpaid interns and college students to do most of the work, which is great experience for them, but the game suffers because of it. Have you experienced anything like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0vyz?context=5)|Hi! Yes we actually got a review from buckys5thquarter.com ([Link to www.buckys5thquarter.com](http://www.buckys5thquarter.com/2013/8/26/4658592/shelter-badgers-video-game-review)) which was really great! So in return we made all you Wisconsin fans this artwork: [Link to www.dropbox.com](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b9ha2hq8o1gkkea/Shelter%20Supports%20Wisconsin%20Badgers.jpg)
[Do you find it easier or harder to work on a game with a simpler, low poly aesthetic? And did you find Unity to be an accommodating engine for what you were trying to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx43aj?context=5)|The simplicity and low poly aesthetic doesn't really change the development from a designers perspective. Although it helps since it takes a much shorter amount of time for our artists to create and modify our assets, which also speeds up the design production and can make iterations really short. Although working on a game that didn't have lighting (baked or real-time), as well as dialogue, HUD, man made structures (as easy recognisable landmarks) or quest system, made it really difficult to create a good player guidance. Which is a really important part of Level Designing. I think Unity is a great tool for game development. Specielly for smaller studios that can't realy on in-house tools. I can totally recommend it!
 |Thank you for you questions! I've PM'd you a steam code.
[I am a bit confused by your game concept, kinda like the endless forest?  I ask in all honesty, what is the appeal (designed appeal\) of your game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0vl2?context=5)|I think Shelter differs quite a bit from The Endless Forest. It's a level based single player adventure with it's own designed narative. Where The Endless Forest is purely multiplayer and draws much of its appeal from the player community. The setting might seem a bit similar, but gameplay wise I think they are two completely different games.
[How hard was it to leave the big companies and start making indie games? Do you miss the AAA development stuff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx1fmy?context=5)|I answered to something similar here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwzmhr)
 |And here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx184g)
 |Hope that answers your question.
[How is a Linux port looking? This is pretty much my deciding factor when it comes down to if I'm willing to actually purchase a game. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0ze4?context=5)|We've had a lot of requests for a Linux port. Unfortunately I can't give you a straight answer right now other than that we're definitely discussing it. I think we have to see how Shelters reception will be, and then decide whether we port it to other platforms.
 |I've PM'd you a Steam Code. Hope you have a PC or a Mac so your can try it out any ways.
[Any chance of the game ever getting a multiplayer update? Maybe one team is trying to defend the cubs and another team is trying to catch them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx2ykl?context=5)|The game needs a lot of rework if we want to create a multiplayer mode, so I'm afraid it's not in the pipeline at the moment. We want to focus on creating smaller games, but releasing them more frequent. And creating a single player game with a multiplayer mode is unfortunatly too much work for our small team at the moment. Although we have losely talked that we might want to create some kind of sequel in the future if people like Shelter, which might include (or focus on) multiplayer. So stay tuned and fingers crossed!
[Funnily enough, your post has coincided with the start of a badger cull in the UK to try and reduce the spread of TB. Your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyak4?context=5)|We've discussed it both with The Guardian ([Link to www.theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2013/may/28/could-video-game-save-badgers) and theartfulbadger.com. And of course we're on the badgers side.
[Link to www.bbc.co.uk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyak4?context=5)|Sorry for the late answer. I've sent you a Steam code as a thanks for your question.
[You ARE including ""The Badger Song"" as the easter egg somewhere, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0lvr?context=5)|Of course. Just as there are sharks in Just Cause. But unfortunately, no ones gonna find it.
[Working with such a diverse gallery of professionals as you do on the videogames industry, what can you say that is your most cherised memory of what you learnt by working with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx01f9?context=5)|Having worked quite a while now I have more cherised memories then I can remember. One in particular is an argument/discussion I had with one of the game designers at Avalanche while developing Just Cause 2. I wanted Rico (the main character) to be able to move while shooting with the minigun, but the designer thought it would be to over powered. I was designing a level that focused a lot on the minigun. Hence my strong oppinion. We had a long discussion about it and in the end he drew seniority on my, so I had to back off. That discussion, even if it was really minor, will haunt me for the rest of my life. I still believe I was right :) Another moment I cherish was sitting next to Peter Molyneux on a Lionhead christmas dinner, but instead of talking about games (which would be the most natural topic, i guess) we discussed family issues, and the lack of time we had to play games now days. He is a really great and lovable guy.
[What were the bigget challenges outside of actual game production as an AAA gone rogue? Marketing, social media, licensing, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbx0l1y?context=5)|I think our biggest challenge unfortunately has been an economical one. I believe we have a really good relationship with the press and our fans through social medias. But we're still very dependent on reaching out to a large market and people buying our product. Having a much lower wage than average (AAA) game developers is manageable, but the stress of not knowing if the studio survives the coming year is really hard to deal with. This is of course from a personal perspective.
[How do you stay creative and come up with fresh ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbxi1a6?context=5)|I think a good way to stay creative is to broaden your inspirational sources. I believe that it can be hurtful for a medium as a whole if everyone's just looking for inspiration within their own medium. When creating games I rather be inspired by other things than just games. Like books, music and film. Everyday scenarios can also be a source of inspiration, as well as political views and philosophical ideas.

[EDIT: So i played it through and good god was it beautiful!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1l98rg/im_the_creative_director_for_shelter_the/cbwyh3v?context=5)|One of our earliest decisions was that we wanted to create a single experience and focus on one playthrough rather then replayability. We're not discussing additional content at the office right now, but if people want it we'll certainly consider it. Personally I'd much rather see a sequel, with a whole new story and a completely different animal. I believe that games like these should be experienced just once. Hence the lack of replayability.

1lb6ft,3,2013-08-29,"High School Junior, Feeling Like I've Run Out of Time (Sorry for long post)",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lb6ft/high_school_junior_feeling_like_ive_run_out_of/,"**Things I feel are important have been bolded. If you don't feel like reading this wall of text, those and the tl;dr should explain enough**

**I've basically blown the past two years of high school.** (Barely skating by my first year, and then eventually having to drop all but 2 classes second semester last year due to failing grades and absence. The classes were German and Drama.) My first year they wouldn't put me in any electives I wanted, since they were all full, so I couldn't learn more about what I wanted to do then. **Last year, I took and engineering course, an introductory psychology course, and a theatre course**(having been involved in extracurricular drama the year before). 

I am not an actor in theatre. I do the lights for the shows. I joined it on a whim due to a friend's suggestion Freshman year and was running the crew by the end of it. I continued running it last year, though this year I am not in a leadership position as I could not attend the leadership workshops throughout the summer due to prior obligations. **(Given my ability and interest for lighting design, it could be something I do as a career though I'm not sure if I could live off of that kind of pay. Unless I made it big I wouldn't make much.)**

I had always been interested in being an engineer but the teacher and our many conflicts swayed me away from it. **(I would consider taking the class again, though I won't have the option to until college and I don't know if I want to spend that kind of money on a maybe)**I ended up dropping this class for the sake of my mental health, but, as I dropped it after the deadline to drop classes, I received a failing grade. As this class was for dual credit(high school and college through the local community college), **the failing grade put me on academic suspension with said community college.**

Having found a newfound attitude towards schoolwork and my future, I've now begun working at this really hard. I'm retaking all of my failed courses through an online program and that's occupying a majority of my free time. I am now taking three advanced placement classes, all of which I'm confident I will pass. **These classes are also for dual credit, but given the aforementioned academic suspension, I don't believe I'm getting that out of them.** They are still AP classes, so that counts for something, right? AP Psych **(having now pursued psychology, I am more and more interested in psychiatry, though I don't feel that it's engaging enough to do for the rest of my life)**, AP US History, and AP Environmental Sciences. 

I've volunteered at a ymca summer camp for the past three years now as dishroom staff, and now that I'm old enough I plan on working there as a counselor for several more years if my time allows the summer to work there. Last year, I was chosen as a ymca volunteer of the year for my leadership efforts and initiative taken in the kitchen and dishroom.

I've found through working in my school's drama department and the summer camp that **I love working under stress.** Whether that stress is ""The show opens in five minutes and one of the light bulbs above the stage burnt out,"" ""a kid has shit his pants three times in a day,"" ""I'm getting screamed at 24/7 by the guy the school hired to help organize shows because he's never satisfied with anything I ever do until I've done it over 12 times,"" or ""the camp board is visiting camp today, dinner starts in 5 minutes, and none of the food has been put into serving bowls yet and if 500 people worth of food isn't ready in 10 minutes we might not get the donations we need this summer."" (Obviously using just examples I've had from my limited work experience, having not had a ""real job""), I just always perform really well under the stress and handle it very well. **I'd love to work in a high stress job(like higher level business or behind-the-scenes politics**, not like dangerous stress such as bomb squad or something). 

**The Bottom Line: I feel that I have wasted too much of my time in high school to actually develop enough interests to really know what I want to do, and the things I have considered would make good career choices aren't likely options for someone who wasted a load of time in high school. In addition, given my academic record, I doubt it will be very easy to get into college, and I feel that I don't have enough time to remedy what I've already done. Community College doesn't really seem like a likely option either, given that I am on academic suspension with my local one. Lastly, I feel that I'm too late to apply or even qualify for any internships that would send in the direction of a career I want to do.**

Final Possible Thoughts List (in descending order of current desirability):

* Politics (more behind the scenes work, not like the president or anything)

* Higher Level Business(perhaps in finances or business strategy or legal for a corporation)

* Psychiatry

* Theatre Tech(though could possibly put skills to work for movie sets, or large stadiums if pursued).

*tl;dr Turned around high school fuck-up that works great under stress, has strong natural leadership qualities, and is generally charismatic wants to know how to fix what he's broken in time to get into college and hopefully move on to higher level business or politics.  ^A ^job ^in ^the ^meantime ^to ^actually ^have ^an ^income ^for ^gas ^money ^and ^savings ^would ^be ^nice ^too, ^any ^ideas ^on ^that?*

Edit- I realize a lot of my aspirations are quite unlikely goals, but I feel that the unlikelyhood stems from the past two years of my academic career, rather than my knowledge or ability. If it's not too late, I think these are things I could achieve. The only question is, is it too late?"

Sample FAQ

**What Engineering Discipline should I pick? How do I know what is best for me?**

You can try a subreddit search if you’re trying to decide between two specific majors; for example, here is a post about Electrical vs Mechanical
http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1layzs/mechanical_vs_electrical_engineering/

This topic is beaten to death though. A simple search will have many different posts and you can try reading through the descriptions.

Here’s a lovely one by KyleGG.
http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1i4axe/all_engineering_being_cool_to_me_is_a_problem/cb12xqm

See what you think you could foresee yourself doing for the rest of your life.


**Should I buy this book that’s needed for this class?**

Maybe. First of all check a website like abebooks for the international edition of the book; this will usually be way cheaper than buying the book in your university bookstore.

For me, a rule of thumb is if the book looks like something I would read after I take the class and it is less than $10, I just buy it.

Otherwise, I would recommend going to the first day of class and seeing if the professor says you need it or not.

**Should I take notes with a laptop/tablet?**

I personally recommend against it. 
It’s very easy to get distracted on a laptop, and a tablet is often a bit difficult to use efficiently.
Pen+notebook has worked for the past hundred years, so why change that?

However, it’s all personal preference, if you must use electronics though, download and open your professors slides and turn off the WiFi while in class.

**Help! I studied for 30 hours for this test and got a 30%. What do I do?**

First, relax and breathe. 

Okay. first you should try to find out the average. If the average for the class is 20%, then you did fine! 
If not, then you should relax and reevaluate your study habits. The most important thing is not pulling all-nighters and getting at least 8-9 hours of sleep the night before a test.
You can also take a look at my study tips post right here (not posted yet).

It’s okay, you can do better on the next test!


**Should I get a double major in &lt;Engineering Discipline&gt; and &lt;Other Engineering Discipline&gt;?**

If they’re disjoint majors like Chemical Engineering and Computer Engineering then I really advise against it. It’s going to be very difficult to get good grades in both of them, and even if you can do it, your college experience is going to suffer tremendously.

If they’re related majors like Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, then you can, but it is often wholly unnecessary. I would recommend looking into getting a masters in the second field rather than cramming everything into undergrad.

**When should I apply for internships?**

Yesterday.

**How do I get an internship/co-op?**

If you have classmates or know upperclassmen at certain companies, you can ask them to pass your resume on. Same thing applies to your parents or your friends’ parents.

Keep active with your school’s career fairs and job board (most schools have one). Talk to recruiters at these events and make sure your resume is in as many places as possible.

Finally, you can also apply on the company’s website, but keep in mind that, although possible, this is much more difficult than the other methods.

**How do I get an internship if my GPA is bad?**

Experience is worth more than GPA. Apply anyways!

GPA only really matters in the HR step, which is getting the initial interview. Having internal referrals and/or strong recommendations will help you get the interview as well.
Once you get the technical interview, it’s your turn to shine. Blow them out of the water with your knowledge and skills and most importantly, be personable. Actually, being personable is 80% of it. Because the primary goal of an interview is to figure out if they like you and would be willing to work with you, whether or not you’re technically adept is only the secondary goal.

That said, work on your GPA! Put some extra effort into your classes and you can take a look at my study tips below.

**Should I focus on side projects and stop caring about GPA?**

Don’t get me wrong, GPA is still important. Academics should still be your top priority.
However, No. You should still care about GPA. Projects are a supplement. Would you ever buy a mouse+keyboard if you don’t even own a computer? Same logic applies. Work hard on your grades, don’t be worried if they’re not perfect; work hard on your projects, but if you have homework or a midterm creeping up, the project can wait until Saturday :). 

**How does my resume look?**

Quite honestly, just take out personal information such as name and address and post it.
Here are some basic tips though:

1. Use a nice simple font. Please *don’t* use Comic Sans or Times New Roman. I personally am a big fan of Calibri and Roboto.
2. No long paragraphs. Use concise bullet points. If they want more information, they can ask you at the interview.
3. No spleling misatkes. 
4. No bright colors. You’re an engineer not a graphic designer, and color is very hard to pull off properly. Avoid it.
5. Stick to one page. You’re a student, you don’t have 20 years of work experience. 
6. No pictures, No personal information. 
7. Use PDF format and title it ‘FirstLast_Resume.pdf’. If you have to put it into an online form or they request it in .doc, that is when you do that. 
8. If you speak multiple languages and want it on your resume, don’t put English. For example on my resume I only put Chinese, Spanish.

**Should I learn &lt;SKILL&gt;?**

Yeah! If you want to, then go for it. 

**Is a MS worth it for me?**

You should make a new post with your details (goals, major, current status) because these should be handled on a case by case basis.

**Should I get a minor in &lt;Engineering discipline&gt;?**

It’s not necessary, but if you think it’ll help you to then go for it. Personally, I think that you’d be better off taking the classes that you think would be helpful and interesting rather than locking into a curriculum for a certain minor.

**Should I get a minor in &lt;Liberal Arts&gt;?**

Honestly in my opinion, it doesn't really make you a more ‘well-rounded person’. You get that by talking to people and socializing, not by taking certain classes. I personally recommend taking what topics you’re interested in(ie. Early Colonialism or Epistemology) rather than locking yourself into a curriculum.

**Can you recommend me a project to do?**

As I am a Computer Engineer, I can only recommend things within my scope. Hopefully others can add some ideas to this.

*Computer Science:*

Open Source: Try joining an open source project. Join the IRC, download the code, read it, look at the buglist, try to fix code, figure out why it doesn’t work, ask questions.

Android Apps: Make a simple android app. Maybe a live wallpaper? Maybe a game? Maybe you need a work-out scheduler and you don’t like the interface of the current apps out there? Go make something

*Electrical Engineering:*

Arduino: Arduino is a Microcontroller unit, basically you can program it to do stuff and you can hook wires and connect it to other things such as screens, LEDs, anything really. There are tons of cool arduino projects. Just google ‘cool arduino projects’.

FPGA: Field programmable gate arrays are slightly more advanced, but there are tons of awesome things you can do with them. I personally have a DE0-Nano device because it’s relatively inexpensive and a good toy to have as a student.

**Should I join a club?**

Yes! Check your school for engineering organizations.

If you’re interested in programming and/or electronics, I personally like IEEE and ACM.
There are tons of clubs for all people of engineering such as AiCHE, SWE, NSBE, ASCE, EWB and more! These will hook you up with networking, social events and tons of like-minded people.

If you’re not so much interested in these, check out other organizations such as the sports clubs, interest clubs, or even a frat. Nobody says you’re only allowed to join one.

As a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater, I have a strong background in politics and sales.  

In 2008 I graduated from a small rural community school in Wisconsin and began my studies at UW - Whitewater.  As I majored in political science, I quickly got involved in the area and began helping with some political campaigns.  The first campaign was for a small representative located in the Milwaukee area.  It was a five man team and we won the seat to which we were competing.  While I was working on this campaign I was also simultaneously working for both a political marking firm and a lieutenant gubernatorial candidate.  By the end of all this the Presidential campaigns were firing up and I promptly took a position assisting the Chief of Staff for one of these campaigns, the name of which I shall leave out since this is reddit.  Unfortunately the only successful campaign I was a part of was the former in Milwaukee.  Much was learned from all though and the experience gained was above and beyond what was expected.  

During my years in college I also worked for a telecommunications agency which sold U.S. Cellular phones.  The footprint of this company was Wisconsin and Illinois boasting roughly 10 different locations.  My time there was very valuable as great customer service was extremely important.  For this company I was the top part-time salesman, company wide.  

At the moment I am still located in Wisconsin and would have no issue relocating.  

Below is a pasted copy of my resume with names and affiliations censored out.  If you would like a true copy, feel free to message me directly.

Right now I'm looking at my college's ""experience"" website where jobs and internships are posted and a good amount of them are either unpaid (although some have the potential to turn into paid), have a higher expected student status (junior or senior), or require a skill I don't have (such as web programming for one internship.)

While I could apply for some, there are a few things that worry me.

* I only have five months of Python experience and about 2-3 weeks of C# experience under my belt. I'm studying more C# every day and will soon take C++ classes, so that experience will keep growing.
* I have no side projects I've been working on (or contributions to open source projects yet, as I don't feel I'm experienced enough for those) and as such my github is empty.
* Because of my lack of technical skill and projects, I don't have much to put on my resume to make it stand out.

What should be my next steps? Should I work on improving my resume and just apply and see what happens? Continue studying? Also I was wondering if I should look at other internship search places besides just my school's. Thank you in advance for reading this."

1ldar8,1,2013-08-29,My whole life is about to revolve around an awful full-time job. I'm so scared and sad. Someone please listen.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ldar8/my_whole_life_is_about_to_revolve_around_an_awful/,"To give you guys some background, I'm a 20-year-old with a slew of anxiety/depression/sensory-based issues. To put it as simply as I can, I'm a nervous wreck who is constantly paranoid, constantly afraid, constantly sad, and constantly afraid of change. It's clear and evident that I have some (or multiple) forms of mental illness, but my mother is too ignorant to admit it, and my older, manipulative brother keeps guilt tripping me about getting help.

Anyway, it's been a year since I was last working. I worked at a small-scale retail environment, and I hated everything about it. At first, I was working six-day weeks, closing the store, then opening it up the next morning. I spent every waking moment of my life worrying and thinking about the job, being afraid, crying in the middle of the night, etc. I convinced my supervisor to let me work weekends only, and although it was much better, I was still a nervous wreck. Even when I was familiar with the job, I was extremely neurotic, scared and sad. I would constantly rush things and get sidetracked. I eventually quit after some family drama, and in that one year, a ton has happened. My family split apart (numerous deaths), my family became poor (barely any food in the house), my brother forced me to sell my mobile phone to ""help out"", pocketing the money for himself. Because of that, I haven't been able to communicate with my friends/family, go out, or even look for jobs.

So, here I am. I have an interview soon, for a similar job, and I am so flustered, sad and anxious. I heard about the interview several days before, and I've spent each day pacing around my room crying, panicking, fidgeting, and not talking to my mother/brother. The two of them think that I'm ""too used"" to being in my room all the time, and that this is going to be a ""good thing"" for me. They think that working another horrible job is going to make me happier and solve all of my mental issues. They think I'm sad when I'm on the computer, browsing Reddit, listening to music, but I'm actually very content. I'm happy. I'm even happy/funny around my brother/mother when this work stuff is out of the question. I've been told ""things will get better"", but they won't. Last year when I got the first job I was told that, and look where I am, now.

Anyway, my whole life is going to consist of walking to work, working, walking home, and being scared/nervous about working. I never thought it would be like this. There are people my age with fancy internships, and people that are traveling the world, and I'm scared shitless over a retail job. This is really the end. I can't see any way out of it. This is no way to live.

The worst part? They just think it's me being lazy. I keep trying to tell them how I feel, but I can't articulate myself. I just end up stuttering, stammering and throwing a little baby tantrum. They'll never know. &gt;_&lt;"

1lhc2e,4,2013-08-31,What's Behind the Painted Window?,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lhc2e/whats_behind_the_painted_window/,"I have to believe this will end well. It’s the only thing currently keeping me alive: hope and a merciful captor. I can’t imagine how my parents are coping with my disappearance. They always loved me with the utmost intensity after my older sister went missing. I can’t believe it’s now happened to me. 

She was taken a few years back after we moved to our formerly new house. She complained about strange noises under the floorboards of her walk in wardrobe. My parents investigated but, of course, found nothing. They dismissed it as the paranoid fantasy of a teenage girl who missed her friends and hated moving to this new house. 

I found her two days ago. Her shock-stricken face was peeled back in an endless scream as it hung in the fake, painted window of a Paris apartment. I was walking by the open market one Saturday morning when I glanced upwards, my eyes following a startled flock of pigeons. And there she was, hanging there, arms raised above her head. My knees buckled under the weight of my grief, the old sense of loss suddenly renewed.

I went back to my first floor flat in Paris and that was when I started receiving the weird phone calls. I was busy writing a report for Le Monde, the French newspaper I was acting as the American intern for, when the phone rang. I picked it up without hesitating, thinking it was my boss.

“I’ll get this done as soon as possible, don’t worry Monsieur le Directeur.”

All I heard was breathing, constant and monotonous. 

“Umm,” I tried again, “this is Terry speaking, how can I help you?”

Still all I heard was breathing.

“I think you may have the wrong number.” I said, repeating the message in French incase they didn’t understand me. I hung up soon afterwards.

I thought nothing of it. I’d gotten wrong number calls before. The next night was stranger though. I’d submitted my article that day and went for a walk. I passed the painted window again, but this time, I didn’t see my sister. I chocked it up to some suppressed memory of buried sadness. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen. As a precaution, I checked my walking closet, remembering this was what my sister was worried about in the days before she went missing. Nothing abnormal was there. That was when the phone rang again.

“Hello, Terry speaking, how can I help y….”

“Did you like my artwork?” A male voice interrupted.

“I’m sorry?”

“My artwork,” he repeated, “you collapsed in front of it yesterday. I can only assume that you were in awe of it to give such a reaction.”

“I’m not sure what you’re talking about.” I weakly replied.

The voice on the other end suddenly took on a sharper tone.

“Oh come on you little bitch. You loved it didn’t you, seeing your sister in the window? I knew you would. I did it for you Terry, I did it for you!”

“What is this? How do you know about my sister? How do you know my name?”

“I know a lot about you, and I know about miss little complainer because I killed her! Listen here Terry, I won’t have my art ignored like some high school grade work from an amateur. You will appreciate…”

I hung up. I was so frightened by this call that I found the corner of my room and crumpled into it while tightly holding on to my stuffed bear. Tears began to stream down my face. I had a hard time sleeping that night, but I eventually succumb to the gentle call of sleep.

I woke up the next morning still shaken by the previous night. I called in sick to the paper and called my friend Victor from the opposite apartment. He worked at the boulangerie across from Le Monde headquarters where I worked. We hit it off on my first visit and he’d become a good friend. He came over since he was also taking the day off. I explained what had been happening and he suggested I get the phone line tapped if it happened again.

The phone rang. Victor was still there so I felt safe to pick it up.

“It.” The voice said.

“I’m sorry?” I replied.

“You didn’t let me finish my sentence last time. I wanted to say, ‘You will appreciate it!’ and yes, you will be sorry, very sorry if you ever hang up on me again.”

I gulped hard, and felt a bead of sweat begin to trickle down the side of my face. I signaled Victor to call the police. I stayed on the line with the voice and heard my friend explain to the police what was going on. I assumed them to be more than cooperating because Victor gave me a thumbs up. They tapped my phone line.

“Oh one more thing, if your friend ever gets in the way of my work again, I’ll pay him a visit, one which he won’t like.” 

The voice hung up. A few seconds passed when the phone rang again, making me jump.
“Hello? Mademoiselle? We tried tapping your phone line,” the French officer said, “but this man hung up before we could identify the origin of the call. We will stay tapped and listening in for the time being.”

“Merci beaucoup,” I thanked him, “please help me. I think this is the same man who murdered my sister. He admitted as much to me last night.”

“Did he say anything else to you mademoiselle? Last night I mean.”

“Yes, he said that he hung my sister in the frame of the fake window on la Rue du Meurtrier. But how is that possible? It isn’t a real one is it?” I was almost crying.

“This is very troubling miss, we’ll have a look into it. Now, I have to ask you to be very brave for us. We need to you pick up all the phone calls you get so we can trace this line. Can you do this?”

“I’ll try.”

“Good, now don’t worry, we will look into this, this window appearance. Have a good rest of the day if you can. Stay with company and don’t worry yourself into doing anything rash. We will go to this house straight away.”

The officer hung up as I was about to add in the threat the voice made towards Victor. And then it hit me, how did the voice know I had a friend over? I could actually think of a number of reasons. He could have stalked my dates with Victor, he could have a telescope peering through my windows or he could have bugged my apartment with a hearing device. I didn’t dare think of any of them at the time. Only now do I have time to reflect on them.

Victor went home a few hours later even after I begged him to stay. I understood though. He had his parents to think about in their last days. I tried to take my mind off things by watching a movie. I chose Dances With Wolves because it was a long film and it absorbed me every time I watched it. 

I fell asleep during the last minutes and awoke to a fuzzy television screen filled with static. The phone rang again. I bounded over to the handset with surprising energy and placed the receiver to my ear.

“Wake up sleepy dead head!” He chuckled at his own terrible sense of humor. “Enjoy the movie? I know I did. It was a bit long though. And yes, I can hear everything in your three room apartment.”

“What do you want?” I yelled down the line, “why did you kill my sister?”

“She hung up on me after I told her not to. So I came to your house in West County Pennsylvania and dragged her into her closet. There I ripped out her eyes with a spoon, I gutted her with a letter opener, I cut off her ears and nose with a blunt pair of scissors and finally broke her neck with my own hands.”

“Shut up you liar! I was there the night of her disappearance, we all were. None of us heard anything!”

“I took her down to my room. There was a door under the carpet in her closet. Check yours. I think you’ll find one there too. Yes, I lived under your house for years before my so-called family sold it to you. After all, it was once mine. Of course, they’d left me down there for so long, it probably didn’t cross their minds to take me with them.”

“I wish you’d starved down there.” I shouted at him, “no wonder your parents abandoned you in the dark.”

Feeling sure the police had traced the call by now and were on their way to arresting this psychopath, I hung up. The lights went off. I was left in the dark.

Why the fuck did I hang up?

He burst out my closet and grabbed me. He dragged me kicking and screaming through the trapdoor under the carpet in the third room of my apartment. 

He bound my hands and feet to pull me through the sewer system of Paris. We came out under la Rue du Meurtrier. It seems fitting that he lives on the Street of Murders. He took me up to his apartment, the one with the fake window. I was too exhausted to cry out anymore. 

I never heard from Victor or the police again. He keeps me in the window and I’m ever looking out over Paris, the personification of hope and freedom. Staring at liberty and letting his victims write letters, is his way of tormenting those he takes. I’ve seen him bring back many girls now. He kills them in front of me each time. I don’t know why he keeps me alive. I’m too weak to kill myself but I wish he’d taken me those years ago, instead of my sister.

I have to believe this will end well. It’s the only thing currently keeping me alive: hope and a merciful captor. I can’t imagine how my parents are coping with my disappearance. I hope they find this man, and kill him.

It was not a pleasant experience for someone with social anxiety, as I was talking to somebody one on one, and it definitely didn't help that the doctor was nearly as awkward as I was. The doctor wanted me to go to therapy instead of medicine, but I convinced him that just the thought of going to a therapist would keep me awake at night. I was then prescribed with medication.

The medication seemed to do nothing. It was very sad to me, as I thought that I was going to continue to live with social anxiety.

The one month check-in appointment with my doctor might just have been the peak of my anxiety. I was in tears begging my dad to not make me go, knowing that my social anxiety was as bad as ever, and that I would have to tell my doctor to his face that he was wrong, and should have prescribed a higher dosage of medicine (at least that's the way I was looking at it). 

To make matters worse, when I entered my doctor's office, there was a beautiful intern at the table. Being an awkward teenager, talking to pretty girls isn't my greatest skill. Instead of just sitting back and taking notes, she was the one asking the questions. I simply couldn't handle telling the truth, and ended up telling her and the doctor that everything was perfect with the medicine.

I cried myself to sleep many times in the following week, my parents being oblivious, and me being too anxious to tell them anything. Fortunately for me, I had a few shots due, and ended up at the hospital again. Even more fortune was in store for me, as the awkward doctor who I talked (typed?) about earlier was on vacation. 

The doctor I had instead was a friend of my dad, and was good at keeping a steady conversation going. He asked about my anxiety (meaning I didn't even need to bring it up) and I told him that I thought I needed a higher dose. He doubled my dose with no further questions.

The new dose has made me feel much more comfortable in all social situations, and it has made me a happier person overall. The only time I felt anxious at all was before the first day of soccer practice, but it still felt more controlled, perhaps even normal.

At long last, the title event- Alright, so you already know that I play soccer. The embarrassing moment came in the middle of a game, when I was throwing in a ball. Last year in soccer I was nervous about throw-ins, but the medication rid me of that. Anyways, all of the parents on the sidelines, the players on the field and benches, and the coaches were looking at me. I was sweating from all of the running, and I often wiped the sweat off my forehead with my palm, causing them to be even sweatier than the rest of my body. I pulled the ball back over my head and threw my arms forward over my head, but the ball slipped out, flying backwards into the crowd of parents. The entire area erupted into laughter. Where I usually would have buried my face in my hands, trying to avoid all eye contact, I joined the laughter. This is how I know my medicine is working. Thanks for reading! For all of you suffering from social anxiety, just see a doctor! It will change your life.

1lfz94,2,2013-08-30,What are your thoughts on Tony Robbins and discovering your purpose?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lfz94/what_are_your_thoughts_on_tony_robbins_and/,"My best friend who I grew up with is an aspiring life style coach and truthfully it's clear that it is his calling in life. He has a genuine interesting in helping as many people as possible reach there potential and life coaching his the medium he has chosen. 


Tony Robbins are one of the mentors he's chosen to learn from and this November he will be attending his event and has a free ticket. He offered it to me because he feels I will greatly benefit from it and I think I will also, what does the rest of reddit think? 


I am 20 years old and I have a few interest that I would like to follow, ultimatly with whatever I do I'd like to be an entrepreneur. 


I love photography so I would love to set up an online blog to express my opinions and show my work, I'd like to profit from it one day. 


I had an internship as a stock broker and learned a ton about the stock market and have used it/using it as a way to get extra income. 


I want to one day invest in small bussiness as a partial owner for residual income and even get involved in real estate. Maybe with a few wholesale deals and working up to flips then eventually rental properties that I then hire a property manager to manage. 


I also would like to become a United states Marine  for a few reasons but mainly because I feel it's something I want to experience. The lifestyle and adventure mixed with the opportunity to improve and prepare for everything else I want to do. 

The Marines won't let me join till March earliest so I have some time, I've been feeling in a rut. 

After a lengthy talk with my best friend he told me that it's mainly because I feel I'm not working towards my purpose. We spent some time trying to discover it and eventually concluded like him that what I spent most of my time on was learning new subject matter and helping those around me improve and live out there dreams. 

Now I'm considering and really resonating with the idea that my purpose is to help as much people as possible to improve themselves and life up to there expectations of themselves.  

As side investments to generate income I'd still love to do all the things listed above and the Marines would be a great way to explore and experience things in a way only military people have. 

So anyway that's where I am, don't know if this is the right place to post but..

Based on what I've said do you think Tony could help me? Should I forget some things and focus on others? I just want some opinions 

Tl:DR feed back on Tony Robbins effectiveness to help figure our ones true purpose in life. "
1lfpvf,80,2013-08-30,The Lusers are running the asylum! Better get your VAX-inations,Nekkidbear,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lfpvf/the_lusers_are_running_the_asylum_better_get_your/,"The story about moving the phones in a call center reminded me of one of my earliest jobs in IT. In the early 90's I was (theoretically) a work-study student in the telecom department for my local community college campus. Mostly it meant I got paid to do my homework or play Minesweeper on the boss's cool new Windows NT system! I remember watching my supervisor (an ex navy man) troubleshoot our old PBX and try to keep it working. Even then, if parts went bad, we had to find a reseller for boards because they weren't making new parts for that model.

 Most of my time however was spent pulling cables for new phone setups, tracing the circuits to document the wiring, and logging the day's tickets in the logbook. I loved it because it was one of my first real jobs and I was getting some valuable experience. We were a satellite campus so it was my boss, me, and another intern.

The other intern worked days and I worked evenings. He was known for slacking off, and doing things 'whenever'. I never met the guy except in passing, but between hearing the supervisor's grumbles and trying to make heads or tails out of the tickets he worked on, I knew this guy was not the best tech in the world. I might not have been good either, but I worked hard and tried my best.

My supervisor and I were the newcomers to the team, the other intern had been there long before us. When we came on there were a bazillion outstanding tickets (the majority of which were quick to fix) and none of them completed. The few that were completed were just randomly tossed in helter-skelter without any indication of logging and there was no documentation just 'fixed' or 'completed'. My supervisor set up a logging and filing system and stated whipping the office into shape.

Being a community college, the big 'thing' in the department was setting up for registration. The school had a VAX system to manage their student database. For registration this involved a frankenstein network of used DEC terminals (for the uninitiated think of a CRT monitor with a NIC and a keyboard port)  connected via flat, silver 8-conductor cables to a hub/bridge, which in turn were networked back to the VAX via BNC cables and co-ax. Every semester/quarter we would have to set this network up for a couple of weeks in the atrium, and then dismantle it once registration was over.

Prior to his arrival, when they would dismantle this monstrosity, they just threw all of the ribbon cables in a box, and put the coax in another. The next year they would take weeks setting it back up as they tried to find, test and or remake the cables they needed for the setup. Sometimes they would use a 20-ft cable for a 5 foot run between the terminal and the router/bridge, pooling the extra yardage on the floor by the user's feet. Other times they would stretch a 10 foot cable completely taut for a 12-foot run. After my first or second semester, my supervisor started standardizing the layout.

Instead of having random cables of oddly varying lengths, we cut and made cables to the correct length (with slack) for each run and harnessed them together properly with zip ties. Then we marked which terminal each end went to and designated the hub end from the terminal end. He made maps of the layout, too. These changes cut setup time from 1-2 weeks to a couple of days.

Things went swimmingly for a few semesters. Setting up registration was fast and relatively painless, issues were actually getting tracked and followed up on, and faculty didn't have to wait for their phone/VAX installs. Then it happened. My supervisor left for greener pastures.

The new supervisor had been the tech for both campuses before he was promoted to head of IT. (The guy who left things in such an undocumented mess before I came on.) Suddenly all my tickets dried up. When I came in for the evenings, there were no after hours installs or for me to do, no tickets to log. There were clearly work orders getting filled out, but nothing was in my inbox, but glancing at the other two guys boxes, they had tickets that had been open for weeks, and some were things I could handle. However there was a standing rule about not 'stealing' work from another technician. Another day my coffee cup got 'accidentally' knocked into the trash can. (When I left the previous day it had been on the shelf the 'good' supervisor let me use, and it happened to be above the trash can. The next day the shelf was clear and all my paperwork and things were in the trash.)

I hung on for a few more weeks. They ordered name plaques for the new technician and 'his' intern, but not for me. When they were installed, I put my name on a piece of paper and taped it in the third spot. When i came in the next day, it had been torn down. I finally got the message and submitted my resignation.

I'm not sure how far downhill things went after I left. I kept attending a few more semesters, working at the local grocery store, and I noticed around registration time that they weren't using the pre-measured harnesses I helped make. They had cut the zip ties and were just stringing them along the tables willy nilly again. Oh, well...

**tl; dr--** You load 16 tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. St. Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go! I owe my soul to the company store...
