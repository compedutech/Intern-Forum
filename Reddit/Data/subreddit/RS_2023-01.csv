1007yjn,3,2022-12-31,Top30 - Transfer Higher Possible?,GForceHampter,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/1007yjn/top30_transfer_higher_possible/,"Hi, I am a current first-year student at a ""top 30"" university in the USA majoring in Computer Science.  I will preface and say; I have viewed various other posts prior to this one to understand the process, ranges of GPA and grades, and questions/factors specifically related to transfers. I would like to get a better understanding of my personal chances and how I should approach the transfer of common application differently (if applicable) to the top 25 universities. 

Reason for transfer: My current education at school for my major is fairly poor in comparison to other universities I had sought, the networking capabilities of specific universities.

I am looking to get into a university that is top 25 that is heavily focused on engineering, my high school stats are very low and not the greatest, the SAT specifically.

Here are some general stats:

**High School:**

SAT: 1080

GPA: 3.89 UW, 4.7 W

**HS EC:**

\- NHS / SNHS - Member

\- Student Gov - Treasurer (2 years)

\- 150h service; Salvation Army

\- Co-Captain; USA National Rhythmic Gaming Team (19-21) (2x World Cup 2nd place, 1st place USA Regionals)

\- Interned as SWE at Health care facilities in London (3x Summers)

\- President of eSports Team (school-based)

**College:**

Major: Computer Science

GPA: 3.8

Credits taken: 73 (total)

**College EC:**

\- Internship @ Bloomberg (Summer 2023)

\- Research with professor in cybersecurity - 1x ACSAC co-publish/presentation.

\- Research Director @ SHPE 

\- Captain - USA National Rhythmic Gaming Team (2023)

**LOR:**

1 - I have a very heavily weighted letter from the Director of SLDC Engineering at Goldman Sachs, have met them at multiple technology summits and GS events.

2 - I am expecting a letter of recommendation from my research faculty/mentor, although it has been 6 months I am not sure what to expect.

1008jsl,112,2022-12-31,An End to the Job Hunt: A Retrospective from a Mediocre New Grad,MacAndSwiss,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1008jsl/an_end_to_the_job_hunt_a_retrospective_from_a/,"*Side Note: If you prefer saving an entire web page over a Reddit post, a mirror of the post can be found on my* [terrible blog here](https://macandthoughts.wordpress.com/2022/12/31/reflections-of-a-mediocre-cs-new-grad/)*, which also includes a copy of the close-ish resume that I used to apply to companies.*

*Side Note 2: This is a long post. If you already have a solid preparation routine or only care about my search results, scroll all the way down.*

As 2022 gives way to a new year, I feel that it is the right time to finally close the chapter on my job hunt for new grad positions. With most companies that I’ve applied to either full on headcount or rejecting me, I don’t expect much more communication to be coming my way.

## Background

I think I have a relatively mediocre, if not somewhat privileged, set of education and prior experiences before stepping into the professional world. I will have graduated from the University of California at Riverside (affectionately named “UC Reject” by the more crude of us for its higher acceptance rates) with a GPA within the 3.9x range.

A handful of experiences I believe carried the bulk of the work. My two part-time internships gave me an opportunity to grow as an engineer, and I would not be in the fortunate position that I find myself today if it were not for that. I had a few other interesting things – open source projects, game development, and Google-sort-of CSSI (the 2020, Coursera edition) – though from a few interviews I can’t tell if the folks on the other side of the call were confused or impressed.

## What Went Right, Part 1: Timing my Practice

If LeetCode were easy, or fun for the rest of us, nobody would have a problem getting a job in tech. Unfortunately, solving technical problems of the data structures and algorithms type is exhausting mental work that will sap your energy. Something I did right was to practice over the summer, and aim to land an offer as soon as possible to avoid overlap between school and interview practice.

The routine is simple – follow the list at [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) (it’s great), and for each problem, spend 30 minutes attempting to solve, and if unable to come up with a solution within that time, look at the solution and implement it. Repeat 1 more time, then call it a day.

Why 30 minutes? It’s subjective. I found it to be a good enough balance between my own ego, having enough time to think of all possibilities at the current moment, and not wasting time.

I chose Kotlin, due to one of my internships at the time primarily using that language. I really don’t think programming language matters. Most companies seem to use CodeSignal or HackerRank, which support Kotlin unless they explicitly disable it for some reason. It interops with Java anyways, so switching isn’t too big of a hassle. Some folks prefer Python for the extensive standard library and concise syntax, but ultimately it’s not about how you prepare, it’s that you do so at all, and consistently.

# What Went Right, Part 2: Breadth of Applications

Casting a wider net with regards to applications seemed to result in a higher number of callbacks, even in a bad year for interns/new grads. While amazing places to get started (shouts out to [PittCSC](https://github.com/pittcsc) for internships, [CoderQuad](https://github.com/coderquad) and their forks for new grad), aggregate sites or repositories tend to be slow to update and submissions seem to bias towards tech-focused companies with higher bars to clear.

I started to take a look around and found myself going down a list of [Fortune 500 companies](https://www.zyxware.com/articles/4344/list-of-fortune-500-companies-and-their-websites). For each company, I’d check their careers page for a new grad type opening, apply if the role existed, and moved on. Did it take more time than clicking a curated list of openings? Yes. But did I find openings of companies with less hoops to jump through and less competition? I believe so.

## What Went Wrong: Application Timing

My pace of practice was fine, if a bit slow, but companies start hiring damn early nowadays. Chances are, applications, or at least looking out for job openings, seem to be in the realm of August and even July, if not earlier. Certain companies like Amazing and Capital One seem to fill up even quicker: I applied to Capital One on 8/27 and failed to receive an interview even with an ok OA score of 813 before they closed the opening.

Had I known this, I likely would have started applying earlier than I did (end of August to early September), and potentially adjust my practice schedule to match.

# Results

|Applications|77|
|:-|:-|
|OA|19|
|Phone|10|
|Final|7|
|Offer|2|

Here's the Snakey Diagram: [https://i.imgur.com/GosrmiK.png](https://i.imgur.com/GosrmiK.png)

Overall, I say that the results are actually pretty good, with a (human) response rate over 10%, a handful of finals, and 2 offers to choose from. Some of these numbers are inaccurate, as they double-count skips in the process (application -&gt; final, and so on), so the rate from the numbers is about double of what actually happened.

The 2 offers were as follows:  
**AT&amp;T** (Dallas, TX): $87.5k base + 9% company success bonus, $3k sign-on, 6% 401k match @ 3 year cliff  
**Fannie Mae** (Plano, TX): $110k base, $10k sign-on, 8% 401k match (may be updated)

I chose AT&amp;T because I liked the location more. It's a stupid reason, but I wanted to work somewhere that I didn't have to drive (or at the very least, avoid driving as long as I could). Fannie Mae, being in northwest Plano, didn't really offer that, and I had no choice in either case for remote work.

I had a few close misses - SeatGeek (New York, NY) rejected me after the final round of interviews, as did AIG (Jersey City, NJ). I withdrew from 2 final interviews after receiving and accepting the AT&amp;T offer. Such is life.

## Final Thoughts, and a TL;DR

I still can’t help but feel that I somehow lucked out this cycle. Coming from 2 part-time internships that only appeared to me in June of this year and actually having meaningful work helped immensely. Consistent practice worked, despite a few hiccups, and it’s crazy to think that in about 7 months, I’ll be done with college forever.

2022 was a rough year to be searching for internships or new grad roles. Rescinded offers (or no return offers) left and right, hiring freezes, and layoffs didn’t make anyone’s life easy. Here’s to a better 2023 and beyond, for the sake of the rest of you still in various stages of the hunt.

In any case, time to migrate over to shitpost and give terrible advice on CSCQ instead. See y'all on the other side!

**TL;DR**

* 3.9x GPA from UC Riverside, 2 prior internships at tiny companies, received 2 offers: $87.5k + yearly 9% bonus from AT&amp;T and $110k from Fannie Mae in Dallas, TX. Nowhere near big N, but it's good money.
* LC grind/project work is exhausting, try to avoid having both that and school by starting as soon as school ends, aiming to have an offer before (or very near) the beginning of Fall quarter/semester.
* Consistent focused LC grind is efficient – 2 problems from [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75), 30 minutes to solve or peek the solution to balance ego, effort, and time spent. Spaced repetition is probably helpful, but I didn’t do it. You should, probably. Aim to finish the main list by mid-late July, mid-August at the latest.
* Apply early. August is now the de-facto start of season, if not earlier. Apply extra-early to companies like Amazing and Capital One, as they tend to fill up quickly.
* Look beyond PittCSC, CoderQuad and job aggregation websites, and start hunting down roles on company websites themselves.
* International students…I’m sorry."

So make this question short and sweet I’m just curious as I see most job posting for what I’m interested in (security analyst) prefer a bachelors degree in related field. Well I’m seeing a lot of guys are self taught and have a few certs and yea some do have their degrees. I plan on going to my local community college and get an AAS in Network Security Admin which focuses on cyber. With the certs they’re wanting me to look at getting plus an internship I’m assuming breaking into the business shouldn’t be too bad with just that associate is that right?

100c1es,64,2022-12-31,Horsehair,YungSeti,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100c1es/horsehair/,"I rang the doorbell with a nudge of my elbow, careful not to tip the container of homemade stew too much for fear of spilling it, rendering my journey relatively useless. 

I was there to deliver some homemade food, and play nurse to all three of my sick friends, whose house had apparently been torn through by some unnamed sickness - taking care of some of the chores that had fallen by the wayside; feeding the cat, tidying up a bit.

It had been a week since the first of the three got sick. It was the ever punctual Chelsea, missing a day of school for the first time I could recall since she had Mono in high school. 

""I just feel like shit,"" she explained when I called her that first day, after she’d missed class. 

“My head hurts, my muscles keep spasming, I'm dizzy.""

She sighed for a moment, before adding,"" Fuck, my hairs been falling out in clumps. And it…it's growing back but it's…it's different. I dunno what I'm saying."" 

""You think it's Covid?"" I asked, unsure quite how to respond.

She was the med student after all, studying veterinary medicine, in an exclusive program, operating at the top of her class so well that she’d been working some government internship she’d been reluctant to speak about. 

I studied early education, besides suggesting a doctor, a thought I’m sure she’d had on her own, I wasn't sure what else I could say. 

""Dunno, I'd guess so. Whatever it is, I need to shake it before finals week."" 

That had been almost two weeks ago. Yet finals week came, and went, and her condition only worsened gradually. Kyla and Tracy followed soon after, and before long it had been days since I’d last seen or spoken to them in person, and almost a week since I’d heard from Chelsea at all.

I wiggled my nose trying to ensure my mask was on, as the chime of the bell echoed from behind the double doors, running over my mental list. 

Drop off food, make sure the cat is fed, hang for a bit and leave before getting yourself sick too. It was a simple enough itinerary. 

Through the stained glass, I could see someone approaching from within, small and huddled beneath what looked to be a thick blanket.

After a few moments, Kyla opened the door, and I struggled to stifle my reaction as I took in my best friend's appearance, changing so drastically over a week.

She looked utterly pallid, her brown skin appearing unusually pale and paper thin, covered in a glistening sheen of sweat in which strands of thin hair stuck. I could see small flecks lining her skin, like blackheads though they weren’t raised, almost as though someone had scattered tiny seeds across her face. Her hair, what of it I could make out from beneath the blanket she wrapped around her like a shawl was coarse and short, and patchy in some places, almost to the scalp. 

It was a stark contrast to how I’d even seen her last, skin glowing and hair in healthy twin braids hanging past her shoulders. I did my best not to relay my shock.

“Hey girl,” I said, injecting perhaps a bit too much artificial cheer into my voice.

Lifting the tupperware I said, “I brought my famous chicken soup.”

“Come in.” She said with a thin smile, before shuddering, her body rocked by a sudden spasm that made her wince.

Her hand rose to her face, running along her skin gingerly as she winced. 

Her smile returned in an instant, but her eyes gleamed for a moment with pain and…*panic*? Unease? There was something in there for a moment, gone as soon as it appeared. 

I frowned beneath my mask, as I stepped inside, feeling both worried for my friend, and hoping beyond hope my N95 would work for whatever this was, assuming it wasn’t just Covid.

A part of me wanted to turn back and leave, to place the food on the entryway table, and say my goodbyes but a greater part of me had missed my friends, and didn’t intend to look like an ass in their collective moment of need.

Whether I wanted to admit it to myself or not, Chelsea’s complete radio silence unnerved me. It wasn’t like her to not even text, and it had been days since she’d given even that courtesy. I had to worry about just how sick she might be.

And besides, I’d only offered to come help with a few things they’d been too exhausted to do in their condition. I could be in and out in an hour or two, and shower vigorously once I returned to my apartment.

I stepped inside past Kyla, kicking my boots off in the loft. The first thing to catch my attention was the temperature, a bone-chilling cool, somehow worse than that outside. 

Quickly, I determined the jacket would be staying on.

“Is your heat broken?” I asked her, unable to keep the shock from my voice.

She shook her head with a humorless laugh, scratching her head roughly for a moment.

“No, we…like it like this. It gets…really hot.” She said, her eyes meeting mine. I stifled a shiver, an odd chill creeping up my back as she did so. There was something in her gaze, an…empty sort of intensity is the only way I can think to explain it, that was very much unlike her. It made me uneasy, in a way I couldn’t quite understand. 

I worried for a moment, just how sick my friends might be.

I nodded, unsure what to say, and continued forward into the house.

As she stepped forward to move in beside me, another sudden shudder seemed to rip through her, making her muscles tense visibly and body jerk violently.

“I’m okay,” she breathed, before I could speak, “Let’s take this to the kitchen.”

I nodded, stepping into the living room from which I could hear the T.V. blaring.

The room was quite a mess, empty and half-empty glasses and mugs littering the place, all filled with water to some extent, plates with unfinished meals, some of which were at least days old sat along any open space on the coffee table or lamp stands.

The air smelled stale, the aromas of faint sweat and sickness filling the room, as dust motes drift lazily through the air illuminated only by the glare of the television. 

I nearly jumped when I saw someone stir on the couch. 

“Tracy?” This time I could hardly contain my surprise at the sight of her.

After a moment Tracy opened her eyes, the lids an unhealthy yellowish tint with the rest of her skin no better off. As she did so, her eyes locked on me for a moment, and in that instance I was taken aback at the sight of a hunger, no, a thirst I had never seen before.

She shot up, for a moment revealing her bare skin in the t-shirt she wore, as she reached for the half-empty glass of water on the coffee table in front of her, in an instance breathing it down, and I felt my stomach turn. 

I stepped away, hardly able to help myself as I saw the skin of her chest, neck and forearms. Small holes seemed to riddle the now exposed skin, almost like massive pores in an effect that would send the worst trypophobe into a panic. 

It was a brief glimpse, but in that moment, I could swear the flesh beneath them…pulsed and moved, as though the very veins beneath were alive.

She quickly threw the blanket she was using as a makeshift shawl back over her, muttering an apology, her body wracked by a familiar shudder. 

“Hey,” she said weekly, smiling weakly at me.

“Is that the famous chicken soup?”

It took me a moment to respond, my mind still lingering on the sight of her skin, already questioning what I thought I’d seen. The image of her flesh seeming shifting beneath those patches riddled with so many holes…it was beginning to feel more corporeal and unlikely. 

I quickly nodded, realizing how my lack of response must have been seen, and determining that it was clear I hadn’t seen correctly. The lights in the living room were off, with only the T.V. and what waning sunlight spilled in through the shuttered blinds to see, and I couldn’t be certain what I had seen at such a brief glimpse, especially to determine it was something so…well, impossible.

“Yeah, I figured you guys probably weren’t feeling all that up to cooking, so,” I lifted the container with a smile.

She grinned, an expression that died before reaching her eyes - sitting up with visible effort, grunting and grimacing as she did so. 

I could see she was gathering herself to stand and greet me, likely with a hug.

My mind flashed back to those images just moments before. Whether I’d seen wrong or not, my stomach turned at the thought.

It feels awful even in retrospect, but the truth was I didn’t want them to touch me. Seeing the condition they were all in, the thought of getting…whatever this was was starting to horrify me, to the point that I was beginning to regret ever coming.

“I’m…gonna go put this down,” I said quickly, stepping away before she could make her way to her feet, and turning towards the kitchen. 

“Sure,” she spoke, voice notably hoarse. “You thirsty? Need water, anything?”

“I’m good.” I said, shooting back a tight-lipped grin, as I made my way into the kitchen.

Kyla trailed a short distance behind, pausing at the table to grab one of the unfinished glasses, and similarly finishing it in an instant.

Stepping into the kitchen, I was greeted by a scene hardly better than the rest of the house. Half-empty plates piled in the sink, meals abandoned in the midst of being made lining the counters as a heavy, mildew-y stench hung heavy the farther into the room I came. And similar to the living room, the presence of half-finished glasses of water appeared a staple of the place now.

I searched from some space, seeking out one of the few open surfaces I could find in the room, and making my way forward to set down the stew beside what usually served as the dining table, and now simply held glass after glass of water, and filthy plates.

As I was setting it down, my hand near a plate atop which a glass, and a myriad of trash had been piled, my skin buzzed with a sudden shock of panic as I felt…something, thin and cold run across the back of my hand. 

I yanked it back, in the process, toppling over one of the glasses and spilling water across the table. I shot up, some of the water spilling back into my lap.

“Fuck.” I spat. I was about to search the kitchen for the paper towels, the roll on the table empty save for a sparse few shred of paper, but before I could my eyes fell on the impromptu puddle on the table, searching for whatever it was I’d felt on my hand.

As I looked, I felt my stomach twist and furl into nauseating knots with snakelike motion, 

At first glance, they’d appeared some odd pattern in the table. I hadn’t looked too closely at first, more focused on the front of my pants now uncomfortably damp, but as I did so I noticed the tiny black lines moving and wriggling spastically through the shallow water.

They were bugs, worms of some sort, and as I looked I realized there weren't just a few, but dozens, maybe hundreds of the disgusting little things, throughout the room, visible in several of the glasses and mugs of room temperature water, floating and twisting lazily. 

I’d hardly noticed on entry, barely glancing in the cups and mugs lining the room, but now peering into each of them, my skin crawled as though the very insects were moving in droves across it, almost each turning up the same.

“Jesus Christ, what the hell are those?” I couldn’t keep the disgust out of my voice, as I looked over the table.

This was more than just a few bugs, it appeared to be a veritable infestation. Just how sick were they to let things get this bad? I knew Chelsea, she was a clean freak by the most generous of estimates, I couldn’t imagine her being okay with such a situation even on her deathbed.

No, something was *deeply* wrong here.

Kyla moved with the most quickness I’d seen from her since I’d arrived, pulling a series of hand towels from a drawer, and throwing them over the table, muttering nervous apologies.

“I’m sorry, I know it’s disgusting. I don’t know what they are, they showed up last week and the damn things have been everywhere.” I watched, skin crawling and stomach turning as I watched Kyla kneel by the table, peering closely at one of the small creatures dangling off the side.

I almost shuddered as she grasped it between her index finger and thumb, raising it for a moment to observe closer. 

“They seem to like water.”

“Jesus Christ, Ky, you’re touching it that’s…” I felt my gut rumble with the distant threat of nausea, mentally cursing my weak stomach as I watched her twist the thing between her fingers. 

I had half a mind to slap it from her hand, so taken aback by the behavior so unlike Kyla who until that point had never demonstrated anything less than utter revulsion when grazed by so much as a ladybug.

In that moment, watching her observe the wriggling creature as it wrapped around her finger, a look of placid interest bordering on something more, I felt as though I didn’t recognize the woman before me.

She scratched mindlessly beneath her eye for a moment, with such ferociously it left angry red cuts across her skin, thin trickles of blood running from it.

Another twitch seemed to shock her system.

“Ever since Chelsea got sick, they’ve been here,” she spoke, her eyes not leaving the creature still writhing around her fingers. 

Her face contorted for a moment, into something resembling a grimace, as though the muscles weren’t entirely under her control before returning to normal.

Standing in the light of the kitchen, my eyes followed the shape of her bones visible beneath her skin which clung to her like an ill-fitting suit. Her face was gaunt, what looked to be a single errant vein visible beneath stretching from her chin, down her neck and disappearing under her shirt, pulsing in a way that made it seem almost alive. 

The odd effect made my skin crawl, despite myself. 

Her eyes were bordered with deep set bags, casting a shadow around them and…

“Kyla…” I breathed, my vision not wavering once from her face, focused on the area beneath her eye. 

“Your face…” I felt my hand brush against my own, and after a moment, head cocking to the side as she looked at me with a moment's confusion, she appeared to realize what I was indicating.

I could feel the contents of my stomach shift as her hand touched her face. She scratched absently for a moment, staring at me with a glazed sort of expression that made my heart drop, before pressing her finger against it. There was…*something* beneath her eyelid. 

I almost hadn’t registered it at first, appearing almost like an overly-pronounced vein, thin and protruding, but after a moment I began to notice an unmistakable movement as the skin above shifted with a decidedly unnatural affect. 

“Huh.” she breathed, as if I’d simply pointed out an errant string on a piece of clothing. 

I watched in confusion and disgust as she lowered her hand, settling the worm-like thing between her fingers onto the lip of one of the cups before her finger began pressing against the lump in her skin.

I felt like I was going to vomit as a silent, squelching sound could be heard with each movement. 

“I’m gonna go say hi to Chelsea,” the words tumbled forth, as I turned my head staring into the living room and avoiding looking her way. 

“T - then I should get going, it’s - I have homework.” I could see her from the corner of my eye, heading tilting curiously as she looked at me. 

I didn’t want to look, couldn’t, the bubbling in my stomach telling me one more unpleasant sight might reintroduce me to my lunch from earlier, but I couldn’t help but see from the corner of my eye as she began to pull…something from beneath the lid.

My heart pounded, a sore, acidic taste welling in my throat, and swallowed hard against it.

“It -  It was good seeing you, Ky.” I said, making my way to the living room before she could say anything else, pausing only to add, “I’ll go look in on Chelsea, but I think you guys should see a doctor.” 

I left it at that, not feeling comfortable explaining just how odd they were all behaving. She didn’t bother to respond, and when I saw why I turned and left the room before I could lose my lunch. The tip of her index finger was below her lower eyelid, as she moved it around pulling at something….what, I didn’t stay to find out

I nodded a silent greeting to Tracy as I passed, feeling far too sick to my stomach to speak for a moment. As I entered the room, a drop of water fell before me, making a soft *plink* in the carpet before me. 

I glanced up at the ceiling, taken aback at the sight before me. The drywall seemed to sag ever so slightly, forming a hanging bubble on the ceiling, drops of water falling from its bulging center. I  locked eyes with Tracy for a moment, her own gaze traveling from the drop on the floor, to the ceiling, and back to me with a look that was almost frantic in its fear, as though she was terrified of what I may ask next.

“Chelsea’s upstairs?” I asked, doing my best to keep my voice even. I could feel Kyla’s presence behind me, and was beginning to feel all too surrounded. I wanted to see Chelsea, and *go*.

Tracy’s eyes met mine for a moment, before quickly breaking contact as she peered down at the carpet. Something in her expression made my heart skip a beat. 

“Tracy? Is Chelsea upstairs?”

She nodded slowly, before whispering,

“In the bathtub.” Her voice was low and uneven, hollow almost, like hearing some A.I. recreation of the real thing, missing that inherent human sort of liveliness.

I made my way to the stairs, casting an uneasy glance over my shoulder back into the living room. Kyle stood under the doorway of the kitchen, peering back at me with an expression I didn’t like. A glance over at Tracy revealed she, too, was watching eyes wide and body taken with slight tremors.

It revealed something else too, as I caught the tail end of something long and thin, as it disappeared beneath the collar of her shirt. It was an all too familiar sight after what had taken place in the kitchen, and one that made my lingering need to vomit all the more pronounced. 

I glanced into the nearest of the mugs on the table, stomach turning at what I expected to find. 

My head spun as I saw what lie in the cup. Contained within maybe an inch of water, there was a swarm of those long thin insects, like so many tiny snakes, curled around each other until I could only see a thrashing mass of movement at the bottom of the cup.

Feeling a pit form in my gut, and all the more certain I needed to be gone as soon as possible I began to climb the stairs towards the hallway leading to the bathroom. 

Chelsea had been my best friend for years, and if anything the weirdness with the others now had me slightly worried for her. It wasn’t as though I imagined they might have done something to her. 

No, even for how strange they were behaving, I knew Kyla and Tracy, and they’d never hurt her. 

Still, since I’d stepped foot in the house things had seemed…wrong, and only gotten moreso. I felt an almost suffocating unease as I wondered just what state she might be in comparatively, looking at the two of them.

As I stepped onto the stairs, I flicked the light switch, once then twice, anticipation turning into disquiet as the darkness remained.

“We...took the bulbs out. She didn’t like the light.” Tracy’s voice was small, almost a whisper as though she were sharing something she ought not to be.

There was little to no light guiding the way, the hallway pitch black, and the windows in the rooms curtain shut tight, leaving me to feel for a light switch as I made my way up. 

The stairs creaked underfoot as I arrived at the landing, and a glance over my shoulder revealed both Tracy and Kyla standing opposite each other at the bottom of the stairs. 

Tracy shuddered, her body shivering as though the temperature in the house was in the negatives, scratching violently at her cheek for a moment which appeared to…well, I couldn’t be sure with the distance, perhaps it was just a muscle spasm, but in the moment her flesh appeared it shift in response to the touch. 

Kyla just watched, teeth grinding as she worked her jaw from side to side, a smile on her face that looked deeply out of place. 

They watched me with wide, glassy eyes that seemed almost…hungry, in the darkness the gaunt shape of their faces casting eerie shadows across their features.

The lingering pit of anxiety had only worsened as throughout this visit, now feeling like a boulder in my gut. 

Any distant thought I may have had of turning back abated by the sight of them watching me, peering around the corner like sneaking children.

My heart strummed rapidly, and I swallowed hard against the lump I could feel forming in my throat, head buzzing with the din of anxiety.

Despite their behavior, now fully past unusual and into well creepy territory, I continued on, that unease lingered over me like a stubborn fog. 

As I passed Chelsea’s room, I peered inside. It was dark , though even with the lack of light, I could see it was in a state of utter disarray. 

Using the light of my phone, I stepped inside and looked around. 

The room smelled of sweat, blood and sickness. I pulled my shirt over my nose,  the acrid taste of bile filling my mouth.

I looked down at the dresser, seeing one of Chelsea’s vet school textbooks open, several papers and notes surrounding it, covered in her illegible handwriting, her laptop sat beside it. A tap to one of the buttons told me it was dead, seemingly having been sitting unused for a while. I glanced down at the textbook, my brow furrowing as I took in its contents.

It was a book pertaining to various insects and parasites one might encounter in the veterinary field, and the page was open to one particular section. I recognized the creature depicted immediately, I’d seen dozens of them sense I’d arrived.

Horsehair Worm: *Nematomorpha are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. Most species range in size from 50 to 100 millimetres long, reaching 2 metres in extreme cases, and 1 to 3 millimetres in diameter.*

*Harmless to humans, but this worm is deadly to its pray. Once it finds the perfect victim, it will burrow its way inside, altering the victims mindstate and behaviors, leading ultimately to their death as the horsehair worm drives it to drown itself in order to lay its eggs in water.*

“A parasitic worm…” I spoke the thought aloud, my skin crawling once more as I recalled being touched by one of the things. 

I was no entomologist, but I’d heard of things like that; parasites that could take over the mind of an unwitting host, usually some poor insect, driving them to destructive behaviors. 

My mind turned immediately to Kyla and Tracy, to their strange behavior and the way their skin seemed to move as though something was burrowing beneath… 

No. I tried to dismiss the conclusion beginning to form, though it clung stubbornly. Were my friends under the effect of some animal parasite? Whatever was happening, something told me only Chelsea would know. It seemed she was already looking into things.

A sound from the darkness ahead made me jump, something between a cough and a hacking.

On the far wall, a trail of those insects moved in disturbing unison, forming several trails as they all traveled into one corner of the room, the corner from which I’d heard the sound. It was dark, behind the long dresser against the wall, keeping it out of the light. 

Reluctantly I stepped forward, casting the light into the corner. I gasped despite myself, sucking in a mouthful of the awful air, sending me into an awful coughing fit. 

I couldn’t help it any longer, raising my shirt as a mouthful of vomit forced spewed forth. 

In the corner, sat Marlo, or what was left of the poor creature anyways. With all that had happened, I had forgotten the cat was half of the reason I was there. By the look of it, the creature was clinging to life, if it could even be called that, by a thread.

The right side of its face was gone, revealing flesh that was a patchwork mix of pale white and an inflamed, infected sort of red. In the gaping hole where its eye had one been, I could see those things moving in and out by the dozens. They covered him like so many massive fleas, and it didn’t take long to see what they were doing.

They were burrowing into his skin, moving through the fur and flesh, embedding themselves until only the smallest part was visible, appearing like thin, stiff strands of hair.

He tried to hiss, opening his mouth but managing little more than a crackle mewl.

“No, oh no, Marlo. You poor baby.” I felt my eyes burn with tears, heart pounding. 

For a moment it raised its head, and in its other eye I could see all of the pain it was in. Yet, in an instance it shifted. Without warning, it was on its feet. 

A look of animal rage filled its features, all the more horrifying given the state of it, as it began to stumble forth under legs that looked utterly destroyed, just a few visible tendons holding fur to bone, moving as though it was still learning their use.

It tried to hiss, this time making a sound between a hack and a growl, as a cloud of those wriggling horrors were sent forth from its mouth.

My heart thrummed against my chest, as I took a step back, its hiss rising to an awful yowl made worse by visible damage to its throat, which had been eaten away at so thoroughly I could see through it.

It stumbled forth with a sudden burst of speed, hacking up another cloud of the writhing things, nearly nipping me as it caught me off guard. 

“Marlo,” My voice shook, as I stepped back, head spinning. 

It hissed again, and when it did, its jaw snapped out of place, whatever tendon had been holding it tearing as the right side of its mouth hung impossibly wide. 

It started forward again, and I scampered back glancing over my shoulder at the door.

It was as though the cat knew what I was thinking, and as I turned to make my break for the doorway, it burst out into an uneven, frantic sprint in my direction, mouth hanging open as those things fell from its face with blood and saliva.

I ran, hurrying out of the room and slamming the door shut just as in time for it to collide against it, hissing and clawing furiously from the other side. For a moment, I remained there, pressed against the door and catching my breath before I felt something against my sock. Peering down, I could see a trail of those things, horsehair worms, I now knew, moving in unison from under the door and up my foot.

I stomped and kicked and shook until every last one was gone, stumbling away from the door. 

After a few moments to regain my composure, the sight of poor Marlo still fresh in mind, I peered down the stairs for the other two girls. They still stood there, watching me with big, empty eyes. A trickle of drool could be seen running down the corner of Tracy’s lips as she watched me.

I wanted to run, to speed past them and out the door but…my mind turned to Chelsea. I had to see her, with things seeming so wrong in the house, I had to be sure she was alright.

The bathroom was the last door at the end of the hall. It was shut tight, with only a small hint of light visible from the crack beneath, and with each step I made towards it I felt the knot in my throat grow until…

*Squish*.

I recoiled at the squelching sound beneath my feet, my foot suddenly soaked as I stepped onto damp carpet. There was water spilling out from beneath the doorway, and by the way it had spread out in a circle for almost four feet of the hallway carpet, it had been doing so for quite a while. 

My heart leapt in my chest, my entire body seeming to buzz with a shock of panic, as I quickly covered the rest of the ground between myself and the door, pounding three knocks against its frame. After several moments, suffocating on the tension that seemed content to strangle me with the knot in  my throat, I tried to knob. It turned without an issue, unlocked.

Taking a breath, I pushed inside.

A swell of water poured forth, running past my feet and into the surrounding rug. As I moved the door aside, I was taken aback by the sight of the bathroom. The walls, for a moment, appeared dark and writhing, until I realized that I hadn’t seen the walls at all, instead looking at a sheet of insects so thick it covered almost every inch of the place.

“Oh, oh *god…*” 

My blood ran cold at the sight.

I couldn’t see inside of the bathtub, the curtain, also rife with the horrid things was closed, but I could hear the running water and faint sloshing sounds from just behind the curtain, the unmistakable sounds of movement within the tub. 

My body was wracked but faint tremors, adrenaline, panic, and sheer disgust all coursing through me in waves, and the contents of my stomach twisting and turning at the thought of millions of little insects slithering over me. 

The floor was slick to the touch, water soaking every inch, discoloring the bottoms of the cabinets, sloshing as I reluctantly made my way into the room.

I shrieked, unable to help myself as I felt something hit my neck, cold and thin. I knew immediately what it was, slapping at the back of my neck furiously until I saw it fall onto the ground, washed out of the room in the streaming water. 

My skin crawled, and my eyes burned with tears, everything about this feeling like a waking nightmare as I stood before the bathtub, reaching for the shower curtain. 

I pulled the curtain aside with a hiss of the metal hooks against the rod, and in an instant I was face to face with a picture of horror. A scream ripped through me, loud and shrill, for what felt like minutes, head spinning with a sort of lightheadedness to when I stood up too fast. 

Chelsea was dead surely, the sight of her indicating she must have been so for quite some time. Her body was nearly unrecognizable, lying at the bottom of the tub utterly swollen and waterlogged, and her eyes…they were open, a glassy yellow staring up at me frozen in a look of utter horror. 

It would have been horrifying enough, had that been all, but from every inch of exposed skin, I could see holes riddled as those things, the worms burrowed their way out en masse. 

Before I could move, reach for my phone to call the police or do anything of the sort, her mouth snapped open with such force I wondered if somehow she was still living. 

The idea was stomped out by a wash of cold dread, as it continued to stretch, and stretch, until it was far past the limit of anything that ought to be possible for the human body.

At once, something began to emerge. It was large, a dark, shiny black like the carapace of a beetle. It began to slowly pull itself forth, shifting her head and stomach at points as something that appeared less like an insect, and more a massive snake began to unfurl through the water. 

It took only a few moments for me to realize what I was looking at. I took a step back as the massive worm began to thrash about the water, sending drops spraying in my direction. 

It had to be no less than five, maybe six feet in length, and from its surface it seemed to shed dozens of its smaller counterparts.

A creak from just beyond the door caught my ear. I turned just in time to see Tracy and Kyla bounding towards me, their faces utterly expressionless as either one of them grabbed me by an arm.

“What the fuck are you doing?!” I shrieked, struggling to pull myself free of their grip, which felt like iron. 

I struggled for purchase against the wet floor, realizing quickly where they were bringing me, as they began to drag me towards the tub. 

I felt the familiar sensation of those cold, tiny insects beginning to slide along my wrist, and could almost feel myself lose consciousness as I saw them pushing forth from Kyla and Tracy’s arms, burrowing out of skin like dirt, and crawling along my own.

My skin stung where they settled, and it didn’t take long to realize what was happening as so many needle-like sensations began to blaze through my forearms. 

They were burrowing…forcing themselves through my skin with excruciating effect. 

“Tracy, Ky, please get off of me, I -”  as I struggled pleading desperately in a vein effort to appeal to my friends, knowing already that it was useless, the sight of both girls filled me with a renewed terror. 

Both of their mouths hung open, so wide I was certain something in both of their jaws must have dislocated, and from it emerged the front half of creatures identical to that which had just emerged from Chelsea’s body.

It became horrifyingly apparent what they intended to do to me.

I fought, pushing hard against them to no avail as they brought my head closer to the tub.

The smell…it made my eyes water and stomach turn. My arm screamed with excruciating pain as three of the creatures attempted to burrow beneath my skin.

I felt a hand grip the back of my hair, forcing me towards the water. That thing, it coiled as, its body twisting and slipping into itself, writhing with something as similar to anticipation as such an alien form could permit, as it slowly rose up the side of the tub to meet me. 

I could see my face in its carapace as it approached, its body an oily black and smelling strongly of bile.

My arms sang with a stinging pain, a sensation like having fingers digging beneath my skin setting every nerve alight.

I had one chance to act, one opportunity to do *something* and little time to do it before I was a walking, talking *infestation* like my friends had become. 

My hair hung in the water below. I winced as they pressed my head against the side of the tub, my chin digging into the porcelain as my mouth was pried open.

The pain and panic lit my mind on fire. I let out a shriek, a shrill, primal sound like nothing I could imagine myself making, feeling a final surge of adrenaline. I pulled my legs in close so they were tucked beneath me, then out in front of me, and with all I could manage, kicked out against the bathtub. 

The sudden force sent me sliding back against the wet floor, taking the other girls off guard and making them momentarily lose both their grip and balance.

That thing emerged from over the edge of the tub, its head twisting in the air expectantly. I knew I had no time to think, scrambling and slipping to my feet, as I made a b-line for the door.

“NO!”

Tracy screeched in a voice that hardly seemed her own. I didn’t want to risk a glance back, unwilling to slow down as I barrelled towards, and down the stairs, desperately trying not to slip against the slick wood.

I could feel them behind me, my arms throbbing with a radiating pain that served as a reminder of why I needed to move, as I reached the door.

I quickly turned the lock and pulled it open, disregarding my shoes only a few feet away as I stumbled out into the night

As I clamored down the stone steps, feeling safe to chance a glance behind me, I could see Kyla reaching out from the doorway, her clawing hands just missing my shirt.

Tracy stood beside her, peering past us, face darkened in an expression that made my skin crawl.

There was a man walking his dog on the sidewalk just beyond watching us, the clamor of my exit having caught his attention. He looked on with an expression of mild interest and unease.

I pulled the gate open, thankful for the distraction as   I practically tripped over myself onto the sidewalk, landing on my knees a few feet in front of the man and his dog, which barked furiously at the doorway, its eyes never leaving Kyla or Tracy. 

""Are - are you okay, ma'am?"" he spoke. 

""Do you need me to call someone?""

The reluctance and unease palpable in his voice as he looked between myself, disheveled and wet, arms trialed with ribbons of blood, and the girls in the doorway. 

My head swam, and after a moment I made my way back to my feet, not taking my eyes off of the doorway from which Tracy and Kyla stood, watching me with those dead, empty eyes.

A sharp pain in my right arm snapped my attention back to it, and my skin crawled as I saw why. Two of those things hung halfway from newly created holes on the skin, still attempting to burrow beneath. 

I could hardly help myself, I gripped the first then the second by the half of their body still exposed, and gritting my teeth, yanked with all my might. 

The sensation was excruciating, tears springing into my eyes as I could hear the wet *pop* upon their release. 

""Jesus Christ,"" the man took a step away as I tossed them to the ground, stomping down furiously upon them, his eyes wide as he stared at my arm. 

He looked as though he was going to be sick, and I couldn't blame him. I raised my hand breathlessly, to motion for him that I was alright. I would surely call the police, my friends needed medical attention and Chelsea… I pushed the thought from my head, feeling emotion threatening to bubble to the surface, I just wanted to gather myself before I did so.

The dog barked at me furiously, urging me to take a step back, growling as its head swiveled between myself and the doorway, as though it were unsure of who the threat was. 

My eyes locked with Kyla’s then Tracy’s as they looked over me. I couldn’t be sure, but it seemed in the moment, cast in the shadow of that dark house, as though the girls bore the slightest of smirks. I could feel Kyla’s eyes on my arm, and followed her gaze. 

At the back of my forearm, what appeared to be a vein extended out past the skin, bulging unnaturally.

With only a brief nod, the momentary motion filled with darker meaning than I could understand the two disappeared back into the house, moving as if with a single mind. 

I wanted to feel relief, or calm, anything other than what I felt in that moment, which was an unshakeable lingering sense that, in one way or another, they’d accomplished what they’d intended.

Unsure of what to do, and feeling very uneasy in my own skin, I bid the shell-shocked man farewell with a nod and a tight smile, mind still reeling as I turned and pressed forth from my car. As I made the same walk back that I had made on my way to their door, it occurred to me how drastically my view of what was possible, what horrors this world contains had been distorted in a single evening. 

As I started my drive, my mind awash in chaos as I made my way in silence, watching the streetlights glow pass overhead, I squeezed hard against the steering wheel, my eyes traveling to the vein on my forearm. Had it always been there?

I called the police when I got home. Upon searching the house and finding no trace of any of the three girls, or even the cat, I was given a stern warning on the wastefulness and consequences of prank calls to the police. 

I suppose I should be worried about that. About the potential of Kyla and Tracy and whatever horrible parasites they were under the effect of coming after me, but truthfully my mind has been on other things.

I find I’ve been taken by a strange sort of twitch recently, a spasm that started in my arm and seems to be spreading through my body with time. Even as I right this, I can see the muscle in my arm contracting, shifting as if by some other power.

Perhaps it’s just nervous energy. That’s what I'll keep telling myself.

I don’t want to consider the alternative."

GPA: 3.95+/4.00 (PBK, couple other academic awards, and probs will get Summa cum)

WE: ran a tech startup, bunch of finance internships, and served in the military for 2 years as an officer (conscription service) Planning to go into IB post grad (GS/MS/JPM TMT).

TLDR on why MBA? Basically want to start my own edtech focused VC. 

Shooting for M7 but ideally HSW. 

Questions:
1) Ngl i’m pretty stressed with the GMAT. i get around 49-50 on Q but Verbal is a crapshoot (36-38). Ive only been prepping for 3 weeks but clock is ticking so… If I get a GMAT of say 720-740, would I still be competitive for HSW? 
2) Recommendation letters — still working on who to ask, probs someone from my last internship and a research gig I’m doing right now? 
3) Say I get rejected from M7s, can I still apply 2-3 years out with more WE? Or will this rejection be held against my app.

All the problems we do in classes are simplified crap so we do some math to get some right answer. It's just physics problems essentially.

How is that supposed to help in a real world work environment? No engineer is sitting &amp; doing derivatives at work.

Do they even give training when you're a new hire? Or do you just have to figure it out &amp; if you don't then ur fired?

I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS

A flood of emotions overwhelmed me as I began going through the rest of the containers. Every single one of them was accounted for: spare parts, ammunition, pre-purified foodstuffs, armor mods, and the drones. What remained distinctly unaccounted for out of *everything* however, was one of the most advanced pieces of equipment out of the entire manifest.

The Exoreality Communications Suite, or ECS for short.

But that was only half of the story.

The fact of the matter was, I was now in a race against time. The IAS was anything if not over prepared. Every contingency was accounted for, and every point of failure had been meticulously planned for months in advance. That’s how they were able to perfect the suit after all. That’s how they were able to ensure that if one particular aspect of the mission was compromised, another could easily take its place. Or at the very least, function adequately enough, in order to maintain an acceptable level of mission integrity. This over preparedness however went beyond planning and preparation for the mission itself. It even took into consideration the failsafes to be activated upon the unlikely event of my untimely demise, as macabre as that was to consider. Indeed, due to a lack of intel on the Nexus and with little to no communication on their end aside from vague and cryptic messages, the IAS had no choice but to double down on their contingency plans.

These plans ranged from the simplest of things such as the EVI’s killswitch, through to the Broken Arrow protocols to be activated in the event I was KIA.

Amongst these plans, one in particular had been activated the moment the containers left Earth. It was a contingency that sat somewhere between the EVI’s killswitch and the Broken Arrow Protocol in terms of its severity.

As the scientists and administrators back in the IAS were prone to do, this contingency was given a name quite fitting for its purpose, or rather, the context it was designed for.

The Lost and Found procedures.

That was, of course, its colloquial name. In actuality, the operational manual penned it as the *Denial of Sensitive Assets to Unauthorized Parties* protocols, or the DSAUP protocols. I had to agree on the colloquial term this time around.

The protocols, or procedures depending on how you looked at them, were deceptively simple. In the case any one container was not signed off on the manifest by its operator, or in the event a container was marked missing, an explosive would be detonated within the container causing the contents within to be rendered *beyond practical, operable, observational, and improvisational use by a malicious and, or unauthorized party*. The countdown would begin immediately after departure, and was set at 72 hours.

As it stood, the rest of the containers displayed a total of 1 hour having elapsed since the timer had begun, which left me with 71 hours on the clock.

Panic had slowly set in after that realization. Not just because of the countdown, but primarily due to the possibility of the *third* trigger for the DSAUP protocols being activated. That being, the detection of *substantial and systematic efforts in the forceful and unauthorized access of cargo*. So in the case of say, a liberal use of force being detected by the container without operator approval… the explosives would be activated all the same.

Whilst in theory the perpetrators would still be safe from harm, with the explosion being confined within the container, there was still a possibility of something going wrong. Especially if the structural integrity of the container had been sufficiently compromised.

This realization shook me to my core, and despite the extremely *low* possibility of the container’s structural integrity failing before the explosives went off, the fact that magic was involved immediately threw a spanner into *any* risk assessment calculations.

My whole body felt like it had just been dealt the greatest suckerpunch in the world, and for the 3rd time this night I felt existential dread once more flooding over me.

I struggled to find my footing as the suit was quite literally the only thing keeping me from losing my balance. I felt a sense of vertigo spread throughout my form from head to toe, as I closed my eyes and tried my best to remain calm, to regain my footing.

Instead of the slow, gradual journey into regaining my bearings however, I felt a warmth flooding over me similar to the one I felt back in the Grand Hall. It started on my shoulder, with a familiar soft and ticklish touch that sent a wave of warmth radiating through my whole body. After being cut off from the outside world for a full 7 hours, and experiencing the first taste of my life stuck behind a wall of synthetic fibers, steel, composites, and glass, a reassuring touch was the last thing I’d expected. But it was one I needed, as I turned around to face this would-be perpetrator and forced out a smile underneath my helmet.

“Emma, you have been standing staring at your… boxes for a considerable amount of time now. Are you feeling quite alright?” The princess asked with genuine concern.

To which I responded with a confident nod, as a renewed sense of purpose and invigoration flooded over me. “Yeah.”

Now wasn’t the time for panic, it was a time for action. So as soon as I regained my bearings so too did my list of priorities become clear to me. The source of *all* panic could always be tied to a lack of intel, and perhaps that’s what the Academy was banking on for *newrealmers* like me.

However if the Academy was going to play this game, then they’d find themselves woefully outmatched and underprepared. We were playing by two completely different rulesets. Heck, I’d say we were playing two completely different *games* outright. Maxxed out spells and tricked out enchantments might have been the name of the game for the likes of Fantasycraft and Hammer of Ages… but I was playing Call to Conflict.

They had no countermeasures for the moves I could take.

But I had to be wary.

Because that same logic went both ways.

And despite the starting advantage I had with the armor and the painstaking preparations of an entire government agency behind me, I knew better than to underestimate an opponent, especially one with home turf advantage.

At the end of the day, Intel would be the ultimate equalizer here. So it was time to rectify this disparity in situational awareness.

Step one on my priority list, was making use of the over preparedness of the IAS’ logistics and supply division. Courtesy of the Administrator herself, who deemed it necessary to push for the over engineered nature of every aspect of this mission, this step would involve the complete and systematic review of the logs from every sensor and camera on these containers.

**Accessing CARGO DATALOGS… Standing by…**

**DATALOGS** **Ready. Total raw footage: 793 Hours across 122 cameras. Total raw sensor logs: 527 Gigabytes.**

**Please Specify Query**

My heart *would* have sunk if I had to deal with this manually like some intern stuck in a low paying data aggregating job back in the 23rd century. It would take *weeks* for me to review all the footage in real time, not to mention the utter magnitude of the data recorded by the sensors. Thankfully I wouldn’t have to, as this was where the EVI would come in…

“EVI, what’s your status?” I spoke within my helmet, making sure all internal audio was severed from the outside world.

*“Nominal, Emma Booker. What are your orders?”*

“I want a full review of the raw camera footage and sensor scans within the Cargo Datalogs for anything anomalous or that could be considered intentional tampering or misappropriation. Report on anything and everything that could be considered tampering and unauthorized seizure of property that could activate the DSAUP protocols. Prioritize determining the location and whereabouts of Container 10.” I barked out, to which the EVI beeped once in affirmation.

*“Affirmative. Commencing data aggregation and processing… standby… time to completion… 5 minutes and 43 seconds.”* It spoke. Its voice was very much typical of what I’d expected from a military grade EVI. I didn’t know how or why this *norm* came to be, but the voice was harsher, gruffer, and more *direct* than that of most civilian smart systems. If this thing was a true AI and had genuine tonal inflexions, I could definitely see it being the most passive aggressive backseat drivers of all time. I was thankful that for my sake the EVI was just that, a simple, dumb virtual intelligence, because being stuck in a suit with a permanent backseat driver was an added stress I just didn’t need.

With the first order of business pending, I turned to the next item on my priority list: active tracking. All of the containers were equipped with a corresponding signal I could detect on my scanners. I knew that reviewing the logs would be necessary to narrow down the search radius as it *could* determine the last known location of the container. But given it would be a full 5 minutes before it was done, there was no harm in at least trying to see if I was able to detect the missing container’s signal.

With a few taps of my wrist mounted data-pad, I began pinging for the missing container.

The rest of the containers appeared on screen almost instantly. With the ping radius waning as it failed to travel through the thick solid stone slabs of the castle walls. Maybe it was because of the thickness of the walls themselves, and the fact that they only grew thicker and larger with every floor down. Or perhaps there was some latent signal dampening effect due to some enchantment or mana-derived anomaly. Whatever the case was, my scanner wasn’t able to travel further than the dorm, and the hallway in front of it.

With just under 5 minutes left on the clock, I finally turned to face Thacea, who at this point had been worryingly holding on to my shoulder for the entire duration of my voiceless tasks.

The princess would be the *third* matter to address on my priority list.

“Emma.” Thacea began, staring at me with those piercing, worrying eyes. “What is the matter?” She asked with increasing worry, tightening her grip on my shoulder as she did so.

I sighed in response, letting that go through my vocoders as my hands instinctively reached to pinch the bridge of my nose… only resulting in my gloved hands bonking against the glass and steel of my helmet unceremoniously. “I’m missing a container. Er. A piece of luggage. And it holds something very, *very* important to me.” I stated simply, barely able to hide my tired and strained voice underneath a veneer of stoic confidence.

This seemed to perplex the avian for the briefest of seconds. It hadn’t occurred to me how this might have looked like from an outsider’s perspective. Whining and basically throwing a tantrum over a lost bag… I must have looked like one of those passengers wheezing and whining at a spaceport baggage claim.

To her credit though, Thacea’s expressions didn’t remain entrenched in perplexity, nor did it evolve into disdain or annoyance. No, it moved into the same genuine look of concern and sympathy that she’d shown me multiple times before. “I see.” She began nodding slowly. “Can I assume that this piece of luggage contains an item that may be more than just a simple change of clothes, er…” She looked me up and down. “Armor… plates… in your case…” She corrected herself before moving on. “And perhaps contains materials vital in sustaining your existence here in the Nexus?” She asked, genuinely impressing me as she put two and two together. I’d only just introduced her to the concept of my armor and its intended use during the events of the orientation; and even then it was a short gross oversimplification. So to be drawing from that alone, and making relatively accurate guesswork as to the contents of my cargo, was a pretty sound and reasonable deduction. Plus, if it had been the tent that was missing she honestly wouldn’t have been far off the mark.

“No, no. It’s not that.” I quickly clarified, as I gave the container containing the tent a few hard slaps. “*That* is all accounted for right here. I guess I should be grateful that I’m not on a countdown for my assured demise then.” *But the potential demise for whoever’s messing with the missing fucking box.* I spoke jokingly, which certainly didn’t do much to lighten up the princess’ expressions. “Sorry. Right, so, what I’m missing is an item that isn’t necessarily vital to my long term survival no. However, it’s still something that’s…” *Vital to my mission? No, that doesn’t sound right.* “... necessary for me to be able to talk to folks back home.” I explained simply.

Thacea took this information with a certain pause, as if considering something before responding proper. “Emma, the Academy doesn’t allow for unmonitored communications back to your homerealm. In fact, only under extraneous circumstances or matters pertaining to an urgency of livelihood, statehood, or personhood, would a portal be opened for the expressed purposes of engaging in conversation and communication. What you talk of is… forbidden.” Thacea explained in a manner that *should* have sounded blunt, but was tempered by the polite, measured nature of her cadence. “In fact, such a device you speak of is unheard of in *any* of the adjacent realms.”

I should’ve guessed as such. It made sense though. Given the fact the Academy seemed hell  bent on shaping their students to their own ends, what better way to do this than to deny any and all contact with the outside world? It was step one of starting a cult, making sure that your victims had no lifelines to friends, family, and loved ones. This sent a shiver down my spine, but I didn’t let it bother me *too* much, given the fact that at least one of my *peers* seemed smart enough to not fall for those sorts of tactics. Thacea clearly had a good head on her shoulders. That whole spiel about *surviving* at the Academy together, rather than fighting amongst ourselves, cemented that fact.

She’d be an ally through and through, something I hoped only solidified further as time went on.

“There are many reasons behind this, Emma. The stated and practical reason is that the liberal use of portals beyond the threshold quota is inextricably linked to the uncontrolled expansion of *taint*, leading to the destabilization of mana-fields over time. This was but one of the reasons for the Great War after all. The unofficial reason is, as you might have surmised-”

“Because they want to control the flow of information. By having a monopoly over communication, they effectively control *you* **and** your realms.” I interjected, cocking my head, as it was effectively the only way I could convey a questioning gesture beneath the hardened layers of metal and synthetic weave.

Thacea responded to that rude interruption not with a look of royal disapproval, but a smile of understanding. “Precisely.” She responded curtly.

We stared at each other knowingly for a few moments, as I pondered the importance of my local guide into this alien reality. Thacea clearly had all the traits of someone who knew how to survive. She was smart, witty, she *knew* how things *actually* worked. She was a survivor, and she needed to be given her rank and the rampant discrimination she faced with her *taint* status.

*I really am living a fucking fantasy epic aren’t I…* I thought to myself. *All those years of reading intense fantasy politics are finally going to be put to good use.*

“There is a certain… danger with retrieving your lost luggage if you do wish to pursue it, Emma.” Thacea warned, her expression shifting to a dourness and severity that I hadn’t seen before. “The Academy prefers to play by its own house rules. There are victories that they will tolerate, and some they will not. They practice social *warfare* in a manner of back and forth escalation. A slight for a slight, a transgression for a transgression. Whatever you wish to win, you will have to lose in comparatively equal terms.” Thacea paused for a solid moment, as if pondering and considering what next to say.

“You need to know something before we proceed Emma. As a newrealmer, you may not be aware of how our society fundamentally operates. You need to understand that the Nexus, and by extension the Adjacent Realms, adheres strongly to the idea of saving face. One’s personal reputation, integrity, and *honor*, is all tied to this. I have reason to believe the loss of your luggage is intentional, and I believe that by pursuing it, you may incur further wrath than you already have.”

A wave of indignation filled me as I responded in kind, not so much frustrated at the princess but at the social institutions that underpinned *everything* here. “So what’s the danger in pursuing my lost luggage? Actually, scratch that, what the heck did I even *do* and whose wrath did I incur?”

“The binding ceremony.” Thacea answered promptly. “The fact that you not only resisted it, but caused an uproar within the faculty, is more than certain to have caused one or more of the staff to lose face. Even as we speak, I assume the Dean, the black-robed and blue robed professors to be in heated arguments over your resistance to it. It may not have been intentional, Emma, but you may have inadvertently caused a few of the higher ups to already lose footing amongst their own. This… loss of luggage as it stands, is a relatively minor price to pay given the humiliation and loss of face the faculty had to contend with in front of their own peers and the public.” Thacea finally removed her hand from my shoulder, taking a moment to address me with a deliberate austerity that reminded me of the Administrator's talks with her fellow higher ups. “It’s a warning, Emma. It’s a warning to accept this one loss, in restitution for the loss you’ve inflicted on the faculty. It is a token of peace, in a manner of speaking. If you leave it at this, then I can only assume that moving forward, they’ll have *forgiven* the whole debacle in the Grand Hall. The faculty will move on from this infraction of their unquestionable status, and you can move on with only a single article of luggage missing.” The princess seemed more at home now with this whole speech. This wasn’t just the skittish, submissive bird I’d seen in the Grand Hall. *This* was the mind of someone who had to survive the cutthroat world of court politics, and all of the nonsense it held.

I took a moment to gather myself as I assessed my options, and took a series of deep audible breaths in and out. “Alright.” I started. “Alright. I understand.” I continued, as I tried to wrack my head around this whole situation. “However, I have to disagree with you on a few particular points, Thacea.” I finally pushed back, garnering a look of questioning curiosity from the avian as she nodded for me to continue. “I don’t doubt your perspectives. You have invaluable insight into how things work over here, and I can’t thank you enough for that.” I gave the avian a slight bow in gratitude. “However, whilst your expertise may be in politics, mine is in the art of war. And at this point in time, an unconscionable threat has just begun with a clock that continues to tick down further and further toward a point of no return. Because this matter isn’t just a show of politics. It’s a palpable threat as the container in question holds technologies far beyond the capabilities of the Academy, and heck, perhaps the entire Nexus. We’re talking about the theft of technologies that would far outweigh any social restitution this may involve. As it stands, I cannot sit by and allow political acquiescence to trump strategic losses.” I explained in no uncertain terms.

“And what’s more…” I began to trail off, my heart once more beating out of my chest as I shook in place, debating whether it was worth it bringing someone else into this… but soon realizing that my chances were better with someone else with this level of insight into a place I had no intel on. “There’s a potential that if they try to open it, it might end up hurting a lot of people, Thacea.”

The avian’s expressions shifted dramatically upon this revelation, as she met my gaze with a single, plainly spoken question. “What do you mean?”

“The container… it… my people saw it fit to place a device within it. A device that has the ability to completely destroy all the contents inside. This device was designed in such a way that without my interference, it will activate within a set amount of time. In addition, should the container detect sufficient evidence of tampering, it also has the ability to activate this device. In normal circumstances, the container is capable of withstanding the destructive forces of this device. However, in the event the container’s structural integrity is compromised beyond a certain point, there is a possibility of the container failing and thus leading to unintended collateral damage to anything and ***anyone*** around it at the time of its activation.” I stated simply, succinctly, almost repeating verbatim what the logistics technicians had briefed me in preparation for this mission.

Thacea’s eyes once more sharpened, as she cocked her head, deep in whatever analytical thought she was busy tackling. It didn’t take long however before she’d reveal what was on her mind, and her response wasn’t what I was expecting. “Emma, if you’re worried about the Academy’s staff falling prey to a simple trap spell, then rest assured your concerns are unfounded. These are some of the most powerful, renowned, and accomplished magic users in the known Nexus. There shall be no losses aside from that of your communications artifice.” The princess announced resolutely, without a hint of fear or concern left in her voice. Her expressions shifted to that of a relieved sense of calm, complete with a reassuring smile.

“Thacea…” I spoke under an exasperated breath. “This *isn’t* something that you can just wish away using a spell or flick of a wand. There’s no dispelling spell or resistance magic or whatever that can get you out of this one. This is a *bomb*, Thacea. And no matter what these magic users do, there’s nothing that they can do to stop it.”

In the mid-size company, they’re paying half as AWS but the work is tailored towards data science and IT, which is something i’m interested in.

We covered the basic semantics of various languages and barely scraped the surface of software development with those languages. We glazed over topics and got quizzed on either basic knowledge that is easily guessed or trivial quirks. Even the course on algorithms I was excited most for was a letdown. We developed functional algorithms twice (once in ASM and once in a language of our choosing). The other assignments were either pseudocode or short-form questions. The ""algorithms"" were not binary search algorithms or anything similar. It was the same as the programming courses (variables, conditionals, loops).

Compared to the CS50 (introductory) course offered by MITx (taken many years ago), this program is a cakewalk.

I expect to graduate a year early (either by the end of this upcoming Winter or Spring trimester). My chief concern is that we need to be taught more to be successful in our field.

**My question:** Is this typical, or should I be allocating extra time to proper in-depth study? I prefer to avoid walking into an internship underprepared.

It's worth noting that I was previously self-educated in numerous languages and have over a decade of experience developing small hobby projects (games, desktop software, mobile software, web and database, some embedded)."

I also haven’t don’t have any research experience so I’m scared this will also weaken my application. The rest of my profile is very strong. 3.9+ GPA and solid work experience.

I recently graduated from a community college in Delaware with an associates in Information Technology. I did not pursue any of the certifications that the program encouraged us to get, did not network, or get a internship, study or build any interesting projects on my own etc.

After struggling to find a job in the field I decided to take my education more seriously. I realized I enjoy coding, have been going through the Odin project curriculum on my own and enrolled in Wilmington University for computer science. I start January 9th but im worried I made a mistake since its a very low ranking university. How do I make the most out of going to a low ranking school for computer science? Would it be more beneficial to transfer to a more well known school such as university of Delaware or Delaware state university if it means that I graduate 1-2 years later?"

I'm a 15 y/o (soph in HS) student who programs a lot and have set my mind on CS in uni. I mainly focus on ML/AI but do web dev when forced to, or sometimes discord bot dev for fun. A few questions to maximize both college placement and career opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I focus on getting internships this summer or future summers or instead focus on prepping for USACO and those olympiads? Or should I focus on precollege programs instead at big unis? What maximizes my college chances?
2. I received one offer earlier this year from a tiny startup to do ML/AI work, but I rejected it since I didn't have time and wanted to focus on schoolwork - was this a mistake? Should I have taken the opportunity to make quick pocket money (offer was \~$20-25 per hour) and experience? Would colleges care about that? Also is it true that companies don't care about HS internships?
3. Neetcode 150 will that be good enough to pass most technicals I see? Or should I pay for their course :(
4. [https://github.com/Necl0](https://github.com/Necl0) How ""professional"" does my github look? Too much or too little personal info?

100yxt1,13,2023-01-01,I failed a class in my first semester...,zallinator,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/100yxt1/i_failed_a_class_in_my_first_semester/,"I was wondering if I can get any tips or advice from other students to overcome this situation.

So this is my first year at Cal. I am a transfer student who started at Community College. During my entire life, I've never struggled with school and I always got As and Bs.

This semester for one of my major requirements I took MCB 102 (Biochemistry). I wanted to take it since I recently took Organic Chemistry and everything was so fresh in my mind. I was really excited about this course because of the possible applications I can do with it in my daily life. However, it turns out that this class was full of surprises. Our grades were only based on 3 exams and 6 quizzes (no multiple choice and only written answers. Not to mention that the difficulty on the questions was nothing in comparison to class exercises). I always felt like the questions never related to the content we saw on class.

My mistake is that I look for help late, before starting the second exam, I went to tutoring at the SLC. I also realized that there were moments during class that I suddenly got distracted, I had inner thoughts, started thinking on something else and at some point I just missed what the prof was saying in lecture. It did not help either the fact that there were not recordings of lecture. I also realized that rather than doing practices exams I spent more time on reading the whole content of the textbook, which made me waste time and energy.

I earned a D+, I was so close to pass the course. My current GPA is about 2.43. Not gonna lie, I feel like a failure and stupid, because I was thinking of applying for internships and research next semester but because of my low GPA, at the moment I am ineligible.

My current stategy is to take easier classes next semester to raise my GPA, retaking the course so I can replace that letter grade (it's a major requirement) I'm planning on retaking with the same professors since I know their teaching style. Going to the SLC on the first day and spend more time on practice tests rather than just reading the whole textbook and wasting my energy. I'm also thinking of going to a medical center since I realize that these episodes when my mind gets distracted severely interfered with my academic performance.

Any tips or advice?"

After the 3rd week, I was kinda left on my own and eventually given a few patients to work with. Ofc I continued to ask questions as there was a lot of things I was still unsure about.. My field instructor and I don't have the best relationship. They are usually busy with meetings, and we haven't had a time to really meet during the course of the internship. Ive been gone for a couple weeks for winter break and go back tomorrow, but I'm just incredibly anxious. I finish my internship in May. Any advice for me to stick through this?

**Income - l**iving below the poverty line, will be seeking aid

**Hooks:** URM (is being homeless a hook idk?)

**Intended Major(s):** Data Science, Applied Math, Statistics

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1500 superscored (710 EBRW, 790 Math); 32 ACT (32 E, 33M, 32R, 31S)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 95.92 Weighted (School doesn't give unweighted GPA and school does not rank)

**Coursework:** Senior Load**:** AP Chemistry, AP Psychology, AP Macroeconomics, AP European History, AP Calculus AB, Gym 

*Past AP Scores****:*** AP Bio (4), APUSH (5), AP English Lang (5), AP World History (4)

**Awards:** National African American Recognition Award, Honor Roll

 **Extracurriculars:** 

1. Foreign Exchange Trader since Sophomore Year - *Any ext*ra money during special occasions I would get from family friends would be put into a trading account that my Dad gives me access to and I would use it to pay some medical bills for my mother,  phone bills for my mom and I, and buy some food whenever the Food Stamps ran out. Basically emergency money and a mini college fund.  (spend 4-5 hours a night every weekday for most the year, excluding December and early January)
2. Black Student Union Member since Junior Year -  2 hours a week
3. Aerospace Club Member since Junior Year  - 1.5 hours a week
4. Remote Intern for this company during the summer after junior year and the beginning of senior Year (worked 40 hours a week in the summer and 15 hours a week when school started 
5. STEP Team Member since Senior Year - 4 hours a week

Red Flags: I have 2 Cs on my transcript. One C from the first semester of Physics in Freshman Year and Another C in AP Lang during the first semester of Junior Year. 

**Essays:** For my main Common App Statement, I wrote about how trading basically made me a better human being, changed my perspective on money, and changed how I see my current living situation. 

My supplements I'll give them a strong 8/10 because I pretty much did some hardcore research on them and did them to the best of my ability even though I did most them within the last week.

**LOR:** My guidance counselor is basically my best friend and he's told me on several occasions that I am probably one of the only students he knows fr so I give that a 9.5/10

Two of my best teachers, my AP Bio and my AP World Teacher, wrote my recommendations and they're also basically my best friends too. They know all my business so 9.5/10 

 **Interviews**: It was really awkward at first but once I told him I traded, the conversation flowed like honey so I give it a 8/10

**Extenuating Circumstances**: I am homeless and live 1.5 hours away from school so that kinda affected my EC participation because a lot of the execs and coaches from different clubs and sports wanted to do things late into the evening like 6pm which wasn't okay since my neighborhood is also super dangerous. I'm also homeless with my undocumented mother and the walls in our building are so thin, you can hear the convos next door which affected how much I could study for tests or how much sleep I got. So I have a lot of As but some low Bs on my transcript

I took admission in a regular pvt college for btech in cse a few days ago through management quota.

I am finishing my treatment check ups and therapy next month.
I  basically have about 6 to 7 months for University.
I want to prepare well for uni so that I don't struggle to cope after i start classes.

Please forgive me for my ignorance but what exactly does a computer science engineer do ?

What skills do cs engineers possess that make them employable?

What subjects are important among the core cs subjects?

What programming languages should i learn ?

What are the different domains in which engineers work?

I asked some of my family and friends the same and all of the advice theyve given me is overwhelming and incredibly confusing not to mention contradictory too.

Apparently,  an engineer could be a front-end Dev,  backend Dev, full stack Dev, application Dev, cybersecurity, data analytics,  ai and ml , SDE , SWE, Devops engineers,,   web developer, game developer, security developer,  SAP security consultant, AR Dev, Blockchain Dev, quality assurance engineer...etc 

The sheer volume of information available is making me want to crawl into a cave and never come back.

The most common one  SDE , SWE.  what does a software development engineer do ?
What does he learn? What does he work on and work with(programming languages)?

Also programming languages off the top of my head

C, C++,JAVA , PYTHON, SQL ,MYSQL,  PHP, RUBY , HTML, CSS JAVAscript , MATLAB, NOSQL, RUST, C# , TYPESCRIPT, SAP SECURITY , R , GO , kotlin , swift etc 

what are these languages? What is each one used for ?  What do you reccomend i learn ?

Which domain do you think will have the best opportunities in the next 10 20 years ? What will be all the rage in the coming future?

Everyone I asked gave me one common piece of advice.
That was to explore , find out what you like , practice , do projects, internships and look for jobs . And also DSA. Is DSA the only thing that matters for all domains?
Advice taken but how do I explore ? What do I explore ? How do I get into doing projects that hold value? 

If  you have any  advice for me about this or anything else in general please help me out.

I would be eternally grateful for your advice. Please please help me figure what on earth I should be doing.

DM me if you are not comfortable commenting under the post.

If I should post this in a different subreddit please let me know.

I also have skills in the backend which is my specialty (load balancing, frameworks like Spring, caching using technologies like Redis, Multithreading, system design fundamentals and more).

It’s not an official internship where I applied. They weren’t looking fir employees or anything.
The company is a small AI startup and I told them id be interested in working with them as an intern if theyd like that. So its more of just an unpaid position now with future possibility to become paid. I get to help with UI, and coding as i learn more (already learning on my own)


And should i add it to my common app activities list?

I realize i didn’t actually get any experience from it yet, but by the time i go to college i would have. is there any point in adding this then?

Note im planning to major in computer science."

I always wanted to study IT, but I really didn't know or understand what was IT about it until now that I am in college, and that I am doing  self-studying as well. I took 2 clases in college to try to decide what path I would like to take,  Introduction to computer science ( I learned Java Script), and Computer Networking 1 ( this class prepares you to present Compatia A+). But, instead of clearing my mind, now I am more confused because I like IT and as much I like coding (I don't that much about, but I study a lot to try to understand what is which one about).  Last year. I was studying some code HTML, CSS and Bootstrap because I wanted to do a coding book-camp, and it requires me to know now those concepts to enroll. Now, I feel ready for the boot camp, however I don't know if it is a good idea, or I should shift my path since I heard to get a job as entry level coder is pretty difficult,  the boot camps are expensive, and they won't guarantee you a job. 


While I was studying to get ready for the boot-camp, I found more information about other IT paths like Cloud and Testing, those courses seems easier, shorter, and cheaper as well the certifications. I just got the feeling that if I get an AWS certification, I would get a job faster and easier than if I do the boot camp right now. As well if I get ISTQB certification, it might be easier to get a job in testing. 

At this point I don't know what to do, because I have to keep it up with my work (call center), college classes ( for now my major is Information Technology, I like the classes and those are easier than compurer science classes), and self study to gain skills an attempt to get a job or internship in IT. I appreciate your comments and advise."

This is my third major so I will be 24. I did an internship over this past summer and it was terrible.

I get good grades for the most part, I have a 3.8 GPA, I think I am decent at coding, but it just seems like such a miserable, stressful career.

My internship was an easy remote internship and it still gave me this feeling.

The thought of having a client who has not idea what they are talking about, coming up with some new feature they want you to implement, where you will have no idea what they are talking about as they are talking about it, and then having to figure out how to do what they want within a certain time frame.

It is just hard and annoying. I don't want to be constantly stressed about having to figure new things out. I don't enjoy coding that much to be honest. My life will just be constantly worrying about my job that I hate.

Just waking up for my remote internship was brutal enough. Just thinking about the previous summer gives me conniptions. I don't know how the hell I will function in real life.

Not to mention, I just hate having to interact with and form relationships with people. I almost want to drop out because my school requires a 2 semester capstone project. The kids at my school are terrible to be honest, this is not my original school, I transferred here from a much better school to save money, and to put it lightly the kids at this school are terrible and the thought of having to interact with them in any way, let alone do a project where I will be doing most of the work, just really fills me with dread.

I feel this is a further extension of the awfulness waiting for me in my career, since in that setting I will be the dumbass and will need to constantly ask questions.

To avoid saying anything too dire, I will just say I don't see how long I would be able to live like this, to say the absolute least.

I just want to make 50k a year after graduation, I don't think that is too much to ask. Is there are career path in CS that does not make you want to kill yourself every day (and where you can be alone)?

Part of me just wants to work at an amazon factory after graduation, I feel that would suit me more than a CS career, the problem is I'd be broke.

I am on break right now and it is so nice to not have to think about CS. I honestly hate this shit so much."

I have completed 3 semesters. Here are my stats:

Demographics: 19 y/o male.

College GPA: 3 semesters 59 completed credits. 4.0 GPA (straight As).

High School GPA/Transcript: 3.3 weighted on a 5 scale, string upward trend (C's &amp; D's during my freshman year and semester one of sophomore year, B's and B-'s during my second semester, I finished semester 1 of my junior year with B's, B+s and one or two A's, I finished semester 2 of my junior year and both semesters of my senior year with near straight A's. I also frequented the Dean's List/ Honour Roll during each quarter AND semester from the beginning of my junior year through the end of my senior year.)

SAT: Attempt 1: 660 English &amp; 670 Math. Attempt 2: 710 Math &amp; 540 English. Superscore: 1370 with a 710 Math and 660 English.

ECs: Consulting/M&amp;A intern at a middle market consulting firm on Chicago's S LaSalle St. President of a Quant club. I am also the first student at my school for the class of 2025 to be the president of a student org. I'm on the executive board of two other finance clubs. I am also in the honors college and a business scholar. I was also invited to an exclusive networking event that the top 1-2 percent of each graduating class was invited to. Ongoing volunteer at FMSC to pack meals, and involved in a pre-law society as a regular fellow.

Rec Letters: Strong rec letters, My compu-sci professor attended Northwestern as an MBA student and received an MBA in Finance -- the exact MBA plan I plan on implementing at NU. The other professor is an accounting professor. Both are professors from my first and second semesters at university, respectively. Additionally, one from my family friend/therapist/career coach who has been with me though my low points in life through now and has offered to write a rec letter for me. He has helped me significantly and has seen me grow. Maybe another rec letter from my mentor at my internship as he transferred during his undergrad as well.

Essays: strong essays including a 650 word common app non-school-specific personal statement that doubles as a ""why transfer from your current institution"" essay. In regards to my supplemental essays and my ""why this major essay"", I was very specific about my career and why I am a finance major, the whole nine yards. That is, the whole nine yards for every other essay I submitted as well.

Misc: In the additional information section I wrote about how I went through domestic violence and bullying from 8th grade up until the 2nd semester of my sophomore year. In my covid statement I also explained to them why I didn't join clubs during my junior &amp; senior years of high school.

School specific misc: My professor didn't mention he was a Kellogg alum who obtained the same degree I plan on obtaining at the graduate level so I plan on uploading a ""other document"" on the NU-specific common app section purveying my gratitude for his teachings and time to write me a rec letter while mentioning that he obtained an MBA in Finance from Kellogg.

Those were my stats, here are the programs I am applying to. One note, I will be applying to the finance/business programs of each of these schools. However, some schools like Northwestern don't have undergrad business programs. So for schools like those I will be applying to their Econ programs. So here are the schools I plan on applying to for finance/econ/business:

UIUC Geis, Northwestern, washu Olin, notre dame, rice, usc Marshall, Cornell Dyson, uchicago, duke, vandy, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, Carnegie Mellon, emory, northeastern, boston u, boston college, uva, unc, tufts, NYU Stern, Penn Wharton, maybe Colgate

What are my chances at a lot of these top 25 schools including Urbana? Also, which tier of schools should I shoot for? Would it be worth it for me to apply to HYPSM? I would greatly appreciate your feedback. PM me or comment, which ever is easier for you. The more feedback, the better! If the information provided is insufficient in aiding your decision-making then by all means inform me on the matter."

Last month I graduated college with my Bachelor's in digital media production. I did an internship in the marketing department of a small TV broadcaster during my semester abroad, was involved with student media, and held an on-campus job. I also graduated magna cum laude and completed two minors. 

I have been applying to jobs for a few months now and have my first interview tomorrow out of easily over 300 jobs (looking for jobs is pretty much all I do). At first I was really excited about the interview, but the cost of living is really high where it's located in CO and I'm from PA, so it's not exactly a cheap move. I'm still going through with the interview for experience, but I've already decided that I'm not going to take the job if it would be offered to me. It's definitely a confidence boost for me after so many rejections. 

At first, I thought I was getting rejected because no one would want to hire so close to the end of the year, because again, I graduated in December and would have been able to start about 2 weeks before Christmas at the earliest. Now, I realize it's only the 2nd, so some companies are just getting back from holiday break and what not, but this whole experience has still been frustrating for me and I'm starting to loose some hope. 

The main point behind this post is to try and get advice. I'm already using most of the major job search sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Ziprecuriter) and well as more specialized ones (EntertainmentCareers and Teamwork Online). I also make an effort to look at various company websites every week or so. 

I feel like I've tried everything that I can think of, from trying to connect with people on LinkedIn to revamping my resume (I really don't want to hire a resume writer), and I don't know what else to do. Originally, I was looking at jobs in development and production management, because ideally I want to work in a TV writer's room. Recently, I've been applying to pretty much anything, social media marketing and content creation being the main one. I'm trying to be as open as possible to any sort of position in the media industry and basically anywhere in the country. My internship was in the UK so I've also applied to jobs there and in Germany (I can sort of speak German), but since I would need a Visa and sponsorship, that avenue seems to be a dead end too.

So, with all that being said, if anyone has any advice of other things to try or things I may have missed that could help me, or even just positive vibes, I would greatly appreciate it. And if you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini rant on my job search. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I'm a recent college grad and need advice on finding a job in the media industry after many, many rejections"

**LORs**:

CS Teacher: Expected 8/10, knows I built things outside of class and I was very active in her class too

Econ Teacher: Expected 9/10, he helped me with Econ Challenge and I always got the best scores in his class on tests/engaged a lot, I also was kind of the class clown haha. We texted each other about basketball sometimes, and occasionally discussed things like politics and the economy after school in his classroom.

Math Teacher: Expected 8/10, as captain of the math team always had a good relationship since freshman year

Counselor: Expected 9/10, I actually spent a lot of time with her and we had in-depth discussions regarding both school and non-school topics, she's also really sweet in general, I think she knew me well and would have put good effort into this

**Essays**:

I spent a lot of time on these and I'm guessing this helped tie my story together. I think my Common App was pretty heartfelt and Duke/MIT supplementals were well-tailored to each school. Common App involved personal tragedy which may have humanized me more to admissions, and I like writing a lot so that may have specifically made me stick out compared to the other CS applicants to MIT.

**Schools:**

**Accepted**: Duke ED, MIT EA, UMass Amherst EA!

**Deferred**: Northeastern...........

**General Notes**: I was deciding between Harvard REA and Duke ED/MIT EA. Ended up going with the latter because I was not confident about Harvard and really liked Duke anyways. I definitely did not expect to get into both Duke and MIT because I had a generic application in a lot of ways (high stats Asian without anything crazy or a clear spike), and for MIT specifically so many qualified people I know from Mass applied EA. All I can say is recommendations and essays can carry, because I'm assuming that's what happened with me. Happily stayed committed to Duke and don't regret it!"

She's Valedictorian by a long shot and managed to get 3 summer internships at multi-billion dollar tech companies. And on top of that took 16 APs (4.0 GPA unweighted) and the PLTW Engineering and Computer Science pathways and a few club participations and wants to lead a couple as well.

Do you have any recommendations?,savvyprogrmr,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/101vif5/im_mentoring_my_brother_who_is_completely_new_to/,"My brother works in an unrelated field and wants to learn coding to get into a career as a programmer. However, it could be overwhelming for a beginner, so I came up with recommended steps/routines he can follow to get started and eventually attain skills to get a job.

**What are your thoughts about my recommendation? Is there anything I can add/remove from the list? Appreciate your inputs!**

I intend to make it easy, achievable (and affordable) for him to start as a complete beginner.

**Here are the steps I'm thinking of:**

1. Review the *free* resource online. For example, Code Academy, Team Tree House, Khan Academy, Edx or Coursera
2. Sign up for one of the above and complete the first tutorial to get comfortable. I recommend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it's more relevant to the job market.
3. Practice 20-30 minutes daily for the next three months. The whole point is to establish a consistent daily routine. He might spend more than 30 minutes if he enjoys it, but the time allotted is *minimum*.
4. Join *Meet Up* groups for programmers, and attend once weekly for 3-6 months. It'll be great if he networks with other programmers and learns about their experiences. It can also allow him to get job opportunities in the future.
5. After 3-4 months, pick a different language (preferably for the back-end), such as Java and C#. Then find tutorials, and practice 20-30 minutes per day for the next three months to get accustomed.
6. In 6 months or so, he should have a good feel if coding is the right field for him and whether he should further his education. If he wants to pursue his education further, then research a community college where he can take courses on computer science fundamentals, and get a degree in 2 years or so. Many employers prefer candidates with a degree, so I'm thinking community college is a better route than bootcamp.
7. Once he gets a degree, he can look at Microsoft, Oracle, and Google certifications. Set a goal to finish one of them in 1 year.

He should have enough experience to apply for an internship (or even junior developer roles) in many companies after going through these steps.

If he's interested in *MANG* companies where he needs strong skillsets in algorithms, data structures, and system designs, then I'm aware the timeline would be too ambitious, and it'll require more time and practice."

I’m only 22 and it’s the first time I’m going to have a job. I’m doing a law internship (required to become a lawyer), so from what I generally see, I’m guessing it’s like a business professional dress code? 

When I went there for my interview they were wearing more casual outfits (for example my boss had suit pants and shirt but a vest instead of a blazer and there was a guy in khakis) but it was also the day after Christmas and the courts were closed, so I’m guessing they usually dress more formal? But at the same time my mom told me to calm down because this isn’t an episode of suits haha 

I was thinking it’s probably best to be overdressed than to be underdressed, but I also don’t want to over do it.

My problem is mostly my shirt. 

Like I was thinking just some black dressy/ suit type pants and a grey kind of checkered patterned blazer (that pattern that was popular this year, you know what I mean), but then should I go full on suit shirt or is something like a long sleeve thin wool v neck sweater ok? 

Should I go for a blouse since it’s slightly less formal than a shirt but more than a wool sweater?

Do I need to wear heels or high heel boots or are some loafers ok since it’s going to be sunny?"

I was and am a university student with banking major. But I am a lot inclined towards computer science from past two years. Since my parents were paying huge amount for my college and Its come to an end I cannot say that I want to quit also I cannot ask more to get another cs degree.

So I decided to learn by myself. At first i learned HTML and CSS from youtebe and built some websites with with just that technology.Then I thought to learn more and then I started learning JavaScript and applied to my dummy websites. Then I designed my own portfolio websites.

After that since I had no money I downloaded the ""Web Developer Bootcamp"" course by colt steel and learned about the front and backend of web deveoping. This was an enlightning course how programming generally works and how the web under the hood really works. I learned about databases, APIs, restful APIs, NodeJS, Embaded Javascripts, template engines etc...

While I was learning form Colt I had hands on experience on nodejs project. I built a campgorund website along with colt steele. I then also built a blog application for myself from scratch. I am comfortable making an nodejs web applications. I

Currently I am learning about microservises and also trying to learn ReactJS. 

Now I learn the fundamental of web development. I want to become professional at it. I want to get a internship paid or unpaid it doesn't matter I just want to build up professionalism in my codes and learn more. I am in a remote place where I am stuck and cannot really move out for 1 and a half year.

In this case can I find remote internships and if yes how can I find one."

I’m pursuing the degree because I want to make the career switch into data science and because I don’t want to be pigeonholed in tax. I don’t want to work at Big 4 ever again.

The thing that’s holding me back is money and being able to afford HCOL. I would have no job lined up. My plan would be to work at a restaurant or retail store that pays for tuition then in the off hours, grind away and prep for interviews to get an internship this fall then hopefully convert to full time.

My lease ends in July here in HCOL so I plan on moving back in with my parents and ideally pursue degree full time.

101ypc8,4,2023-01-02,Feedback? Am I on the right track? Sociology PHD International,Henry___99,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/101ypc8/feedback_am_i_on_the_right_track_sociology_phd/," 

Hi all,

I’m currently an undergrad student in the US, at a small liberal arts school. My current dream is to apply to several international Ph.D. programs specializing in sociology. I’m hoping that folks can read this over and offer me feedback, below I will provide an overview of my current application as it stands, then will follow with my worries and end with a few weaknesses that I have identified for myself.

I am majoring in Sociology and Social Work and minoring in Gender studies. **I hold a GPA of 3.8** and anticipate my **GPA to remain between 3.7 and 3.9.** Further, I have been accepted into the **honors program** and **hold an honor standing**, 

Additionally, I received the school’s **presidential scholarship** and an **additional merit scholarship**.

I currently have **co-authored a research study with some of the leading researcher**s in the field of social work. Via this opportunity, I **presented at a very prestigious conference** and a **less prestigious but still notable conference** that same year. Further, the study **utilized a covariate analysis of 80,000 participants**, and although I did not run the data, I presented it and antiquated myself with the larger data set.

Further, I have **presented my research projects at my school, via internal symposiums** in which students showcase their research. Although not very competitive, they **are peer-reviewed** and I did have to partake in a selection process.

Additionally, I am in the **process of submitting a few papers that I have written with some mentors to several journals**, ranging from undergrad journals to more competitive journals.

I also work as a **tutor** to help undergrad and grad students with their research skills, as a **supplemental instructor for high school youth**, and as a **course assistant** for the school's social research methods classes.

I have also completed a **90-hour internship** with my school's disability office where I researched on their behalf (a thematic analysis survey of consumer feedback) and **will complete a 400-hour internship** next semester working in an acute clinical setting, that has up to this point only hired masters students. 

I currently have identified **two professors that are willing to write me letters of recommendation**. I have been sure to build my relationship with both of them over time and communicate often with them outside of the university. One is a prominent scholar in social work whereas the other one is a well-connected scholar in sociology. I have several other people I could ask but I am confident that these letters will be the best I can get.

I have found a niche in my own research interests and would be able to give a presentation on what I want to conduct my dissertation on and with.

Further, I create a lot of art and photography. I have participated in **various political organizing**, **interfaith** and **liberal religious leadership training.** Some of these positions were fairly rigorous regarding applications and I was able to travel as a result. In my freshmen year of undergrad, **I founded a nonprofit.**

Finally, I don’t know how much affirmative action plays into international applications but I am a **trans woman**, **disabled,** a **previously homeless person**, and **very poor**. I was **institutionalized for most of my adolescent life** and when not being sent away I lived in a rather abusive household. Further, I’m in **long-term recovery from substance use issues** and have largely recovered in most parts of my life, **now only identifying as having PTSD and autism**. Finally. I am self-taught, I was unschooled and stepped into a classroom for the first time in my life at the age of 18 and received an equivalency to high school by taking community college classes. I know mentioning some of these things may hinder my application, however, I **understand the responsibility and the decision I made that may have affected my situation** but ultimately feel my socioeconomic status, if phrased right may strengthen my application.

In terms of my feedback/ questions, I often take people very literally. During Freshmen year many people told me that if I wanted to get a Ph.D. I had to do the things above. So I worked very hard to fulfill any requirement that people speculated might arise.

Now, people are telling me that I can relax and ride out my senior year (I have two semesters left), yet I still struggle with feeling that my application is not competitive enough. I know this might seem obnoxious but I worry because of my high output that I am not as well versed in topics of my degree. Further, due to my autism, I have a hard time understanding social nuance considering my peer's disclosure of their studies, many seem to relate to my intensity and often others seem to be doing similar things. I feel exhausted and although I know it seems judgemental I suspect that many of my peers may be over-reporting their accomplishments. 

The biggest issues I can see are some of my issues with people skills. I worry about leaving a disconcerting impression (I dislike eye contact, can be very literal, and worry how much my transness may affect others' perceptions of me). Further during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took two passes in two gen ed classes. I withdrew from a single course (historical theory of math) that I did not qualify for, and thought was interesting (my advisor wrote off the prereqs)  but found myself not able to complete. Finally, I failed a physics course when I was 18 when I initially attempting to qualify for university. 

Generally, I would love to hear some feedback and if you see any missing parts please tell me. I have two semesters before I plan on submitting applications, so I do have time to compensate for my current weaknesses.

1. Would it help to apply for competitions and try to win awards? I feel like it would be really difficult to win any, so should I apply to local competitions?
2. For personal projects, does it matter that much to companies? I've seen people say to take inspiration from existing projects and to implement them on your own with a few changes. Is that a valid way to do a personal project?
3. Any general tips on securing an internship for the summer? Is it really a numbers game? How many should I expect to apply to before I get an offer?

I'm not completely new to computer science; I've done computer science for about 3-4 years. Most of that time was just spent in high school classes and college classes though, so I was never really learning at my own pace.

(F22) Since I was 17 I decided that I wanted to be a 2nd grade teacher, the year after that i took a class in high school called “Teaching Academy” basically a class wear you learn about pedagogy and intern in a real classroom. I of course interned in a 2nd grade class and loved the experience! I even got to do a lesson plan all on my own which went okay surprisingly. 
Anyways, I began working at a daycare after graduating from high school and it was the most fun and exciting experience (for the summer) When fall started i went to a university to begin my path for an Elementary Education degree. WELLLL I got academically suspended during my second year and went back to working at the daycare. After a year there my director told me about this program where i could get a degree in Early childhood Development and they would pay for it. 

Fast forward to now and I’m currently in my second year of college working at a bright horizons center (Loving the heck out of it) the director is supportive, my co-workers are so nice and there is hardly any drama. I get to design my own curriculum and have control over a lot of classroom management. We are also accredited by NAEYC so you know it’s a good center. I’ve been enjoying working with my preschool class and it’s got me thinking if I really want to get into the public school system. It’d mean even more schooling and after reading many negative statements and things about elementary teachers leaving the field. I’m afraid it might happen to me too if I choose to pursue that. Are there any people on here that have gone through this or have similar thoughts?"

1021yhs,1,2023-01-03,Best major for good money while also having a social life MIS or CS?,Putin666,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1021yhs/best_major_for_good_money_while_also_having_a/,"I figure this might be the best subreddit to ask because you folks manage to have enough time for another job lol.

Making money is important to me, but I don't really care about being filthy rich, I however want a safe job with good work life balance. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

If you can really give good advice feel free to DM and I will pay you what I can. I'm a broke community college student, but I value a mentor.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: MIS will maybe give me more free time than CS with only a bit less money???"

I'm a second-year CS student who goes to a T10 school who joined the program a little late (literally during spring quarter last year). I'm studying data structures this winter and taking a computer systems class this spring, but I need some guidance on what I should be doing in order to get an internship for this summer + summer 2024. 

I don't have any huge projects under my belt. I have mainly built stuff for fun: some CLI programs, a small website, plus an exploratory data analysis project. I'm a course assistant for an introductory CS course (and I plan to be a course assistant for data structures during spring) and I just got appointed to being a project manager for one of the CS orgs on campus.

As a result, my resume looks hefty, but I don't really have anything crazy, and I don't really feel like I know that much in general, honestly. I'm kinda sad that I missed out on first and second year internship programs at the big companies, but I was too busy trying to figure out what I wanted to study +  make projects in the first place.

What should I be focusing my time on to most efficiently get a SWE internship (if I should be trying in the first place)? I have experience in Python and Golang, but I don't really know where to go from here, in terms of trying to beef up my resume or preparing for a tech interview.  In terms of internships, I have literally zero expectations, I just want some sustainable income, experience, and something to put on my resume (in that order).

I was also thinking of potentially joining a lab this summer, but numerous labs at my university require you to have at least junior level courses to be considered.

Any advice would be appreciated, since I have always been pretty zoned into academics and never really anything career-related. Although I've been watching a lot of CS-major content in general, I'm pretty overwhelmed on what to do (I have a LC membership, but I don't even know which problems to do!)."

The app will replaced their existing hand built CRM-type application. 

They've requested that all revisions to items to be tracked and be able to revert if need be. AKA an intern screwed up a contract that caused a major trickle down affect and they don't want to have to restore the entire DB just to revert back one item's history. 

They also want to log and track activities so they can audit user's actions. 

My original thought was to have each API End point have 2 actions, one to perform the CRUD operations to the item(s) in the DB, and another that will log the action. 

However, I don't want to slow things down because every single click is being logged to a DB, so I was thinking of using Redis or something similar as a cache then writing those to another DB later. 

And for the revision history, my idea was that every time a Create, Update, or Delete operation was performed, I would take the existing data, and write the change to a separate table in the database with a revision ID, who made the change, etc. Then perform the operation. 

Has anyone implemented such things before? What tools / database design did you use to accomplish this?

It takes me much longer than the average person to do anything numbers-related and it’s very frustrating and sometimes depressing, because I genuinely like investing and analysing companies. 

I’ve never told anyone about it or declared it because I don’t want to be a diversity hire or filtered out, but my most recent 6 months in PE has been really challenging, and I was anxious every day. I’m feeling really lost right now because I initially thought that I could just train myself to get better at dealing with numbers/on the spot estimations or calculations, but according to my doctor it’s an adhd thing that doesn’t just go away. I was only diagnosed recently, so before that I thought I was just bad at math. 

I can’t just take my meds either because they can sometimes make me very sleepy or jittery, which is obviously bad. 

Is there anyone else with similar experiences, and what did you do? Are there alternative roles that are less technical, like VC? Also feeling really anxious about the upcoming IB - is it stupid to forgo it and throwaway an opportunity like that?

I always wanted to study IT, but I really didn't know or understand what was IT about it until now that I am in college, and that I am doing  self-studying as well. I took 2 clases in college to try to decide what path I would like to take,  Introduction to computer science ( I learned Java Script), and Computer Networking 1 ( this class prepares you to present Compatia A+). But, instead of clearing my mind, now I am more confused because I like IT and as much I like coding (I don't that much about, but I study a lot to try to understand what is which one about).  Last year. I was studying some code HTML, CSS and Bootstrap because I wanted to do a coding book-camp, and it requires me to know now those concepts to enroll. Now, I feel ready for the boot camp, however I don't know if it is a good idea, or I should shift my path since I heard to get a job as entry level coder is pretty difficult,  the boot camps are expensive, and they won't guarantee you a job. 


While I was studying to get ready for the boot-camp, I found more information about other IT paths like Cloud and Testing, those courses seems easier, shorter, and cheaper as well the certifications. I just got the feeling that if I get an AWS certification, I would get a job faster and easier than if I do the boot camp right now. As well if I get ISTQB certification, it might be easier to get a job in testing. 

At this point I don't know what to do, because I have to keep it up with my work (call center), college classes ( for now my major is Information Technology, I like the classes and those are easier than compurer science classes), and self study to gain skills an attempt to get a job or internship in IT. I appreciate your comments and advise."

Background:
I've worked for this company since I was an intern. It will be 5 years next week. I can't begin to describe how amazing everyone has been, and how healthy the culture is. The health benefits border on unheard of, and since my wife has chronic health issues (and my own chronic mental health issues) losing this job would be devastating. Every review I've received has been very positive. I've always thrived here. I do take meds (vyvanse and bupropion).

Problem:
About halfway through last year I was reassigned to a different supervisor. My job stayed the same. Unlike previous supervisors, he's really not happy with my performance. I work in the tech industry, and while my tech work is good, he takes issue with the executive tasks that I struggle with. I'm frequently late on completing my credit card statements (which is frustrating since I never use it), I struggle to close out assigned tasks in our ticket system, I've struggled to actually document the work that I do, and similar things. I've never been good at these things, but my previous supervisors also never really cared about it. This stuff is *VERY* important to him though. For the last six months I've been struggling to overcome this and I feel like I haven't made much progress. 


I've tried setting up systems to work on this. I was starting each day by reviewing tasks, creating a sort of ""work journal"" on what I'd gotten done, and using a to do list. My problem seems to be that I can't make it stick. I'll improve for a few weeks, then slip back to where I was before. He's been pretty patient but has also made it clear that if things don't improve soon I could be put on a ""performance improvement plan"" which is pretty devastating career wise. I feel totally discouraged. I feel like I have a self-discipline problem and I don't know how to fix it.  


I'm willing to work as hard as needed to fix this, but working hard in the wrong way doesn't help anyone. Any advice offered is much appreciated!

Thanks"
102edi2,6,2023-01-03,My learnings/observation in flat search,newredditaccountqw,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/102edi2/my_learningsobservation_in_flat_search/,"Recently i have been searching a flat to buy and felt I can share my 2 cents if that can help someone.
Please note my search was limited to Pune, but most of the learning could be applied anywhere.

1. All the advertisers, real estate consultants are not your allies. Most of the times all they want is a visit.
They will not entertain you the moment you tell them you have visited it already. 
Always go to a visit with such person only if he is able to confirm you the availibilty on the phone instead of
generic thing like lets visit and check, multiple such people will reach for same project, only visit project with such people if they can confirm availibilty before the visit, otherwise dont
2. The advertisers, consultants will definitely tell that they will help you get bottom price, but what I have seen is the moment the visit form is filled, they are out of picture and go on phone for their next client
3. Be it nearing possession or under construction or even just launched project, the sales people always tell flats 
are not available. If you really want a particular floor/opening side, make them realize you are serious and ready to walk out. They will probably call in a day or two saying that it has become available because someone cancelled it
4. The sales person showing the flat or giving the gyan is most probably an intern and does not have any power/authority
to give any firm confirmation apart from hand waving. ANy doubts, get it cleared by sales closing manager which you will meet when finalizeing the deal
5. A single visit takes at least 1-2 hours based on where it is located - do not waste time visting projects which location is not at all convinient
6. Make sure the directions east-west are understood even if not following vastu because it will decide if you get sunlight in the house or not
7. Whatever I have talked to, almost every place is ready to discount at least 1 lack easily and if you push they will go till 2.5l. This is not discount but rather most of the times just waving off the floor rise - make sure you push for it.
8. When doing price finalization, please study the project and identify any negatives which you can mention while negotiating
	1. entry road is direct or requires a u turn which is not near
	2. long development time that it will take till all the future development is done
	3. Any canal going near/withing the project but is concealed
	4. actual possession date by builder vs possession date mentioned in rera - usually 1-1.5 year difference
	5. direction of kitchen - even if you dont believe in vastu, you can definitely use it in negotiation
9. Make sure the carpet area adds up - they will say because of walls it doesn't add up, ask them to show you their way of calculation to reach the carpet area - this is imp because I have seen sometimes it does not add up
10. Be ready to walk out if any lies are being mentioned eg there is public garden which you can use, metro is coming up etc, because of they can make such blatanta lies
11. Please do not buy any crap layout just because bank is giving loan for it - it just results in overall builders doing any crap layout and people are still buying it
12. Just because there is an IT park(small/big) near by, doesnt mean the area is good - there is probably a cement jungle around it, check the area first hand
13. no of lifts for total no of flats in building
14. water supply - boring supply means tanker supply in summer
15. ask where is waste management area if any - it will smell very badly in future near it if not maintained
16. Ask if any mhada building will come up in there - even though you can not do anything about it, you can use it for negotiation
17. Amenities are a must - I have so many friends regret the decision to buy the flat in stand alone building - the garden should be something that can be called a garden and not the size of 1-2 balconies. The children play area is a must too - that too something sizable
18. Swimming pool - I personally think this is completely unnecessory but I have seen most places with great amenities have this - I think this just add to the maintainance
19. Enclosed balcony - just another trick to include the balcony in carpet area - looks so dirty, use in negotiation
20. fire safety, rain water harvesting is not an amenity - most probably a gov regulation - ignore such things as amenities
21. solar - I have seen some places have connection of solar water in kitchen, never understood why would they have it?
22. Think of all the flats and avg no of people in the premises that will live after completion among which the amenities will be divided.

Hope this comes as useful for someone!"

I’m curious if you have any tips for interviewing for a tech role (cybersecurity internship), especially for someone who has never interviewed for a technical role before.

For reference I recently graduated with a liberal arts degree and don’t have technical experience but I’m trying to get into the IT field. I’m wondering if there’s anything I can study to know before the interview or if there’s any other way I can stand out.

Hope this makes sense!"

I'm taking a general IT internship this semester and later this year I'd obviously be graduating and need some general help on deciding where to go next.

First off, my mom's work is in severe lack of IT jobs and they are looking to hire me as a help desk worker which is nothing fancy, it would seem good to have a job right out of school but my main worry is to having to work with my mom &amp; her coworkers.

My school district also has had a job opening for a technical support specialist for about 2-3 months so I could also apply there with the downsides being obviously pay.

Which one should I go to, and if not should I apply elsewhere?"
102g9dn,1,2023-01-03,"Unrelated internship at prestigious place vs. desired internship at small, not known place?",inajobpickle,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/102g9dn/unrelated_internship_at_prestigious_place_vs/,"Using an example: let’s say I want to become a video game developer and am about to finish grad school for computer science. I have an internship offer at a company that everyone knows such as Nintendo, but it’s in an unrelated division like Marketing or Communications. There would be no opportunities to do any coding/etc., but I would have Nintendo on my resume and I’d make connections there for a possible future internship or something.

Then on the other hand, I have another offer to be an actual game developer/design intern, but it’s for a very small company in a small town that the average person would not recognize. Definitely not prestigious, but I’d actually get hands-on experience and work on relevant projects.

Should I choose the first internship just for the name on my resume and the connection, even if I won’t be doing anything related to my degree during the 5 months before graduation? Or should I choose the second where I’d have a chance to gain related experience, even if it’s not somewhere recognizable?

I’m in my early 30s and am in the middle of a career switch, if it makes any difference. I previously had jobs in the unrelated field (Marketing/Communications) which got me the internship offer, but now I’m trying to leave all that behind. Maybe it’s just in my head, and the networking at the first place would make it worth it in the end though?

I'm just worried a recruiter would look at the first internship and wonder why I chose a position that I don’t even want to pursue, or would they be able to see I’m just trying to get my foot in the door? I plan on interning somewhere again after graduation, so it's not like this will seal my fate or anything, but I just wanted to hear others' thoughts.

Also I apologize if the job comparison isn't accurate, I just tried to think of something similar. Thanks in advance for any advice."

I just had to call over the phone which honestly makes my voice sound a bit more mono tone and flat. I guess it really makes it sound like that over the house phone because the lady interviewing me she mentioned it twice. 

I don’t know I’m a little bit nervous about it now because of that 

Honestly, I do not like doing over the phone interviews or calls just because I feel like the audio is not as good as through like a video  chat audio call like through zoom 

I’m wondering if because I called over the house phone or something like that if it made my voice sound flatter or something? Because I was having a harder time hearing her over the house phone then like audio over zoom 

Like after saying twice that she said, it sounded like I was mad she said oh well we are a happy company over here??
It just caught me off guard because I definitely did not expect that


I’m now apprehensive because of that"

A few days ago, this [happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/zzczqa/im_sad/).

i was terrified and excited at the same time i didnt know what john had to say and what meant for me and for alex but i knew that i had to find out

so i followed johns advice and started my own investigation i dug deeper and deeper into my past and i discovered things that i never could have imagined i learned about my familys secrets about the people who had lied to me and about the true nature of my relationship with alex

john had contacted me out of the blue he said he had seen my story on reddit and that it had reminded him of something that had happened a long time ago he said he had a message for me and he asked if we could meet in person

i was hesitant at first i didnt know if i could trust john or if he was just trying to exploit my situation but something about his voice and his words felt sincere and i decided to take a chance

so i met john at a cafe bene in urbana he looked older like 25 but he had a kind face and a gentle demeanor he told me that he had known my parents years ago when he was in college and that they had confided in him about something important something that had been kept secret for a long time

john said that my parents had discovered something amazing something that had the potential to change the world but they had been silenced before they could reveal it to anyone they had died in a car accident shortly after telling john about it and he had never heard from anyone else about it

john said he had always wondered what had happened to the secret and he had always felt guilty for not doing more to help my parents he said he had seen my story and he had recognized the names and he had realized that i might be the key to uncovering the truth

i was shocked and confused i had no idea what john was talking about but i knew that i had to find out more i had to discover the secrets that had been hidden from me for so long i had to find out what really happened to me and to alex and i had to find out if there was any chance for us to be happy together again

so i agreed to help john and we started working together to uncover the truth we spent hours talking and researching and piecing together the pieces of the puzzle

and as we worked together i found myself getting closer and closer to john i had never felt this way before and i didnt know what to do i knew that i still loved alex but something about john was different he was kind and understanding and he really cared about me

i struggled with my feelings and i didnt know if i should follow my heart or if i should stay loyal to alex but i knew that i had to make a choice

in the end i decided to take a risk i kissed john and we ended up doing more than that i felt guilty and ashamed but i also felt alive and free i had never felt this way before and i didnt know if i could go back

i knew that i had to face the consequences of my actions and i knew that i had to tell alex the truth so i gathered my courage and i told him everything

alex was shocked and hurt but he understood why i had done what i did he said he loved me and he forgave me he said he wanted to start over and to build a new future together

i was relieved and grateful i had never felt this close to alex before and i knew that we could make it work

as i unraveled the truth i realized that everything i thought i knew was a lie i had been living in a world of deception and it was time to break free and find my own path

i confronted the people who had lied to me and stood up for myself i fought for my right to be happy and i fought for my right to love alex and in the end i won

alex and i were finally able to be together openly and happily we had been through so much but we had finally found our way back to each other

but then i realized that something wasnt right alex was acting strange and i couldnt shake the feeling that he was hiding something from me so i started to dig deeper

thats when i found out the truth alex was secretly jealous of my success and had tried to message people on linkedin to deny my internship he had also created fake reddit accounts and had been commenting on my posts just to make me feel bad

i was shocked and hurt i couldnt believe that alex would do something like that to me

but then something even stranger happened john and i ended up kissing and maybe something more after i realized what alex had done i was confused and overwhelmed but i knew that i had to follow my heart

i confronted alex about everything and we had a huge fight i told him that i couldnt be with someone who would betray me like that and he had to make a choice either he could change and be honest with me or he could lose me forever

alex was shocked and realized that he had made a mistake he begged for my forgiveness and promised to change he told me that he loved me and that he would do anything to make things right

i was hesitant at first but i knew that i loved alex too and i wanted to give him another chance so i agreed to give our relationship another try

we worked through our issues and our love grew stronger than ever we learned to trust each other and be honest with each other and we finally found the happiness that we had always been searching for

but our story doesnt end there i would still text and see john often because we were still researching my parents secret every time we met we ended up kissing and kissing and more eventually we found out the secret

the secret was shocking and unbelievable it was a discovery that could change the world and it was something that my parents had been willing to die for

john and i were thrilled and we knew that we had to share this information with the world we worked tirelessly to present our findings and to prove that what we had discovered was real

but not everyone was ready to believe us there were skeptics and cynics who accused us of fabricating the evidence and there were people who were threatened by our discovery and who wanted to silence us

we were scared and we didnt know if we would be able to survive the backlash and threats but we knew that we had to keep fighting for the truth

in the end our persistence paid off and our discovery is under the review this was a moment of triumph and celebration but it was also a moment of fear and insecurity

i was worried about what the future would bring i was worried about what would happen to me and to alex and i was worried about what would happen to john i continue to do more things with john more than i should have

i knew that our lives would never be the same again and i knew that we would always be in danger including alex john and me

but i also knew that we had each other and that we had found something special something that was worth fighting for

so we held on to each other and we held on to our dreams and we vowed to never let go

&amp;#x200B;

the review will be done in a week and if it goes well ill try my best to share but im scared for my life not sure i may have to leave campus before school starts

so yeah im happy but not for the reasons you might think"

I don't really have much work experience and I really want some. However, I am still new, I only completed my intro to cs 1 and 2. Which is python, Java, datat structures, etc. I also did linear algebra and discrete math. However, I failed intro to cs 2 and retook it this semester and passed!

This has me concerned though. Failing dropped my GPA and I brought it up a little bit this semester. I am at a 3.08. I really wanted an internship this summer, but it is seeming very unlikely. Over my freshman summer I worked on a couple of projects and went to one hackathon, which is what I have on my resume as of now.

What can I do this summer to still be on track to get a job offer by the end of my senior year? Am I behind? Is it too late to apply to internships?

Thank you!!"

Are you having a tough time finding tech or software engineering internships in Canada? Look no further! Me and my school's computer science society have created an active repository that tracks internships specifically in Canada. We noticed that other repositories out there weren't as active, so we wanted to make one that was more up-to-date and reliable.

Our repository includes internships in fields such as software engineering, data science, and more. We plan on updating it regularly to ensure that it stays current and comprehensive.

Check out the repository here: [https://github.com/Queen-s-COMPSA/Canadian-Tech-Internships-2023](https://github.com/Queen-s-COMPSA/Canadian-Tech-Internships-2023)

We welcome contributions from anyone, so if you know of an internship that isn't listed, please feel free to add it! And please don't forget to give us a star 🌟."

Note that packages have not been completely decided, I am still in negotiation. Also it's in Europe, so don't be surprised by the low salaries.

**My background :** Master's degree in computer science. Double major in Aerospace and CS, with a minor in Business and Finance to be more precise, internships in aerospace systems architecture and business development. Good background in maths, but I would like to develop my DS and ML/AI skills.

**My Goal :** In any case, I would like to work at most 3 years in any of the following companies, in order to negotiate a better salary. Might be tough but I would love to have a shot at a FAANG company in the future. Moving in the US is something I strongly consider, within 3-7 years.

**Offer A :**

\- Compensation : 44k+ bonus and equity (expecting alongside 45-50k TC)

\- Scale up in the insurance technology : fraud detection (in e-commerce, healthcare, insurance). The company seems to have a product that gets adapted to the client’s needs (Saas). Valued at over a Billion.

\- Existence of a US branch if I want to x3 my salary in the future.

\- C# programming for solutions (so maybe more of an hybrid DS &amp; SWE role), SQL data pipelines. Fraud detection algorithms. ETL algorithms implementation.

\- A little stats and maths for clients data analysis and see if the projects holds up.

\- Very little machine learning from what i gathered (depends on projects).

\- Lots of client interaction (insurance companies mostly) and stakeholder management.

\- More working hours (40-50 range).

\- A lot of freedom (full / partial remote when feeling like it, the results are what matter).

\- Young team, full of energy that seem very pleasant from the interactions I had with them !

\- Maybe not that important but it seems there are 4 times more competition for this offer rather than the other one.

\-Offer really appeals to me, but idk if I will like coding in C# that much, might want to give it a go to see. And I would like a little more ML.

**Company B :**

\- Compensation : expecting 40k-42k TC, in a less expensive city.

\- A big aerospace company, within a branch developing Data Science solutions for Satellites (10 or so DS).

\- Mobility on other branches of the Aerospace company is possible. Apparently in other countries as well, though going to the US might be hard considering this is relative to national defense.

\- Expecting ML/AI and optimization techniques review. Talking with the various engineering teams in charge of the satellites (thermal, electronics, …) and trying to build DS/ML solutions to help them out, for exemple, predictive maintenance models that are with low calculation time. Implementation in python using tools such as Tensorflow and other DS libraries. Side projects on digital twin technology with R&amp;D engineers in the national space institute.

\- Not that much pressure (35h contract, can easily have Friday afternoons off)

\- Partial remote authorized, 2-4 days a week.

\- Evolving within a team that’s quite young, but a lot of lengthy administrative processes due to the size of the company. The manager would want me to fight alongside him in a couple years, in order to push forward data science projects to get better funds.

\- Salary growth is really regularized at this company and you should not expect big jumps.

\- I like the Aerospace industry, but dislike the long processes, and I am afraid to limit my opportunities to Aerospace DS roles taking this offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Kinda torn, as I like to have business oriented interactions, want to improve on ML while still being curious about other fields of data science.

**Question :** which of the 2 offers should I consider to achieve my goals?"

\- Evolving within a team that’s quite young, but a lot of lengthy administrative processes due to the size of the company. The manager would want me to fight alongside him in a couple years, in order to push forward data science projects to get better funds.

\- Salary growth is really regularized at this company and you should not expect big jumps.

\- I like the Aerospace industry, but dislike the long processes, and I am afraid to limit my opportunities to Aerospace DS roles taking this offer.

Kinda torn, as I like to have business oriented interactions, want to improve on ML while still being curious about other fields of data science.

**Question :** which of the 2 offers should I consider to achieve my goals?"

I just got invited to the Developer Analyst internship superday (2x 45 min) and was wondering if anyone has some insight to the interview process as well as interning/working at Barclays for this position. Is it mostly behavioral or will it include some live coding?

Me, M(25) and I live with both of my parents. My dad is the “chill one” and i don’t complain about him. My mom on the other hand always have been the overprotective one, compared me with my little sister on every aspect,complains about everything i do, embarrass me in front of friends and public, always plays the victim, etc.

Im finishing my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and i got this Internship with a possibility to stay after it ( as a full time job)And i’ve been saving up from it (it pays 600€/month) if i get the job they salary will increase of course. I had a big discussion with my mother the other day and when i mentioned that i wanted to move out she made a “SCENE”. She started crying and calling me names, saying that im bad person for leaving them, screaming etc. 

I never been a problematic son, never did drugs, crashed the car, i never got drunk to the house after a party, etc. its true that when it comes to grades I haven’t been the smartest of the family (compared to my sister)

But after this fight with her, my dad took her side and the tension i feel whenever we are eating or just cross paths at the house is too much, to a point where i try to be out of the house every time i get the chance. Im getting really stressed, eating a lot of garbage, my work performance its not the same, i got finals in 2 weeks and i feel everything is falling over me.

My question here are two.

1. Am I a bad person if i move out and cut communication with my parents at all?

2. And the second one is not really a question, but you guys have any advice/tips for moving out for the first time, it will mean a lot.

If you made it this far thank you for reading this and pardon my english since is not my first language."

I've been at my university for a year and a half after transferring from community college. As a junior, it's been surprisingly hard to find an internship. I'm involved in ASME, I'm in a scholarship program where I do undergrad research, and I also mentor incoming transfer students (the undergrad research starts this semester).
    I wasn't able to intern over the past summer because I did not have many engineering-specific classes because I had just transferred from community college. I'm trying to get an internship for this summer, and I've applied to about 25, but I've only heard back from 3 of them and all three of them turned me down.  Basically, is it a bad thing if I haven't heard back from most of them yet, and if I haven't, what should I do?"

Why is the pay so low in Ontario or am I doing something wrong. I graduated last year and started my first job at 50k at a defense company as an external hire (contract) which is what I made as an intern in my 3rd year. 6 months later I accepted a job in automotive, again as a external hire but i got a pay bump (approx. \~ 20%). I accepted the job cause I was getting higher pay compared to my first job and the work was more interesting but I've found out that my coworkers who are direct hires and in same positions as me are getting paid much more. The company has no plans to hire contractors directly and given how other OEMs are laying off its only a matter of time before it hits us. I've been applying to direct hire positions now more and I recently got a job offer but the base pay was around 60k, which is significantly lower than my current job and when I tried to negotiate they said that I dont have enough experience and my market value is not what I asked for. I've been working for 1.5yrs now and have 1.5yrs of internship experience as well. I declined the offer and have been applying to other places but so far all jobs I've applied to are on average paying less than how much I'm making rn.  


how should I negotiate for a higher paying job or should I accept what they give and just work my way up in the company? for some of the more experienced people here, approximately how much do you make now and after how many yrs of working did you get there?  


for background, reason i want to leave my current company is because there's no opportunities for to move up as a contractor and no room for growth professionally or in terms of compensation. Basically once my projects go into production I will potentially be laid off."

102paa3,8,2023-01-03,Made it to 25... so now what? Am I having quarter life crisis?,blazedzen,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/102paa3/made_it_to_25_so_now_what_am_i_having_quarter/,"I've gone and spent a ton of my day today going through a ton of reddit threads and discussions in this sub.

I decided this is the only place where I feel like I can JOURNAL AND VENT in a community of people like me looking to improve and be better human beings.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start off with me a little..

&amp;#x200B;

# I just turned 25(M) last month in December. Here are a list of personal achievements I've made to date for myself:

* I've studied abroad in Singapore during college and had an internship with a global media agency
* Graduated at a University in Marketing as a first generation (first in my family ever to graduate college)
* Built up a local Hawaiian restaurant to become a huge chain nationally through Digital Marketing (shortly after they got bought out, became corporate, and let me go for no reason)
* Got a job in my city at one of the top 3 marketing agencies working as a social media manager for large brands
* My relationship with my girlfriend is going to be a big 5 years in seven days from this post
* Got to pay my parents back a little bit for what they've done for me
* Have friends/people who care about me
* Became really fit

&amp;#x200B;

# However... this past year in 2022, I took a breather for my mental health. I felt burnt out after having so much on my shoulders. I wanted a year to finally do whatever I want with my life without anyone telling me I have to live a certain way.

* I quit my social media manager job at my marketing agency (I took a huge pay cut to work something that gives me more breathing room for my mental health and now I have more time)
* I stopped working out as much as I used to, either I was lazy or just didn't care as much anymore
* I escaped my reality by mostly playing video games, smoking weed everyday, and watching anime/shows
* I quit social media, so that really hurt my social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

and now it's a brand new year, 2023. I feel like I'm having quarter life crisis. I felt like I took a big year for myself but feel like I haven't done anything. (Okay I know I'm still young and have a lot left to do to turn my life around)

&amp;#x200B;

But now I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Marketing is still cool to me, it's something I'm still doing in my current job, but only have enough money to pay the bills and life an average life. I used to make $52K a year (which is a lot to me) and now I only make around $25-30K. But I'm happier mentally and have more time. Is it worth the trade-off? I'm also interested in IT. I average 150WPM and love technology. (I feel like Digital Marketing can transfer those skills over to an IT job?)

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like I've could've gone down the route of working at my marketing agency and climbed the corporate ladder, but I felt like it wasn't for me. I'm very interested in financial independence/freedom and want to build something for myself in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing with me is that I'm genuinely interested in a lot of things so it's hard for me to pinpoint what I truly want to do into a career?  Should I even focus on my career? or just be happy and focus on what I love see where that takes me in life?  I'm like a ""Jack of all trades"" type of guy. I can be extremely into something and get bored of it later on.

&amp;#x200B;

Other things I'm interested in/love

* Music (I used to love music and produce beats and write songs, especially RAP)
* Entrepreneurship
* Anime
* Fitness
* Cooking
* Cinematography &amp; VFX
* Dancing

&amp;#x200B;

# TL;DR

I'm a lost and confused boy who did nothing for a year in 2022 to take a mental break and make time for myself and now I want to turn my life around and get back at it again, just not sure how or where to start. I feel like I'm starting on a clean plate, with experience/skills this time around.

I truly just want conversation, advice, and insights from people around my age or older on their experiences.

I guess my question is, did you experience something something similar to me? what sparked that inspiration or ""AHA"" moment for you to turn your life around or keep improving on yourself? What are some steps that you took to get there?

I'm genuinely interested in hearing your stories, advice, etc. please drop a comment below to start a conversation. Please enlighten me with your experiences.

I somewhat answered some of my questions while journaling/writing this but want to hear from you all as well.

Thank you and take care my fellow redditarians."

102tkva,5,2023-01-03,Microsoft Explore internship housing question,Neat-Capital8249,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/102tkva/microsoft_explore_internship_housing_question/,"hey guys, if any of you have done the Microsoft explore internship, would you recommend taking the 10k stipend to find my own housing in Redmond (maybe the Seattle area) or going with corporate housing? I can't drive so I would mainly be relying on Uber and public transportation if I take the stipend which I don't mind paying for. I'm conflicted, I would probably split the cost of housing with a friend and then possibly pocket the rest of the money. However, taking corporate housing seems easier than finding my own place. what do you guys recommend? any input is appreciated."

I applied for 3.5 months since my graduation to different junior and trainee positions (150+), but got either denied with a standart letter or due to not being able to have learned C++, Java, Python, all together, not doing SAP on the highest level (for an entry job) or because I dont haven't worked in the field for 3+ years, 

mostly finance related positions or in project management, as well in sales or distribution I applied, everywhere the same fiesta....



Does anyone experience the same level of shittery? I am so frustrated, also having to wait for 2+ weeks for jobs being denied I applied 2+ weeks ago...(p.s I am from Germany) or having to wait for weeks till I get a date for a job interview I then get the info the job pays only minimum wage....for a job requiring a college degree"

People of Reddit,

I hope you're all doing well. I am a 21-year-old graduate (June 2022) Computer Science engineer from India who wants to become a game developer. I recently got a game developer internship in a startup with a small stipend. I do plan to go for a Master's degree in '24, perhaps in some course that will help me a more efficient developer.

The company I'm working at does not seem to have much credibility, since I'm unable to find any information about it online. I eventually want to open an Indie game studio of my own in India.

So I have a few questions:

1. How do you suggest I approach this situation?
2. What are some good credible STEM courses I can do for my Masters's to help me reach my ambition?
3. Do you think I should continue looking for other jobs and internships? (since this company does not seem very credible)
4. What, in your opinion, are some courses I can do in order to get a more nuanced understanding of the world of game design and development?
5. Do you think I should learn about broader topics in general, even if I plan to be a game developer eventually? If so, what are these other skills I can develop?
6. If you do work in the video game industry, what are the steps you took to ensure that you secured a good career in this domain?

Any help regarding this situation would be appreciated. Thanks so much."

Did you follow specific video tutorials? Or read certain textbooks? I learn well from textbooks and could definitely go through one over winter break.

During my interviews whenever they saw that I have 5 years of gap before starting my btech they instantly rejected me. This happened to me many times even when I was interviewing to get an entry level job at WITCH companies.

5 years of gap: I got pretty good marks in hs so I got into a decent college(for bsc) and studied there for 3 years(the course duration was 4 years) but the subject never interested me, I am from small town and most of my friends didn't even take jee main at that time, so I was unsure how will be the scopes of getting a job after btech but in my college years some of my friends took jee so I did too and luckily got a decent college, couldn't take jee main or advance as my 3 attempts already ran out and I don't think I had the preparation to get into a IIT. I am not supergood student but still I have some experience and made some decent projects but still not getting hired. WTH!! What the freak am I doing wrong? Even students with lower gpa and less experience or projects than me getting jobs, but I am not getting any jobs although I performed well in interviews and the tests, they just hear that I got 5 years of gap before btech and boom no job wth!! I was actually preparing for neet ug in the 1st year after dropping out of college but got btech seat after taking state jee so took it without thinking about anything.

I really don't know what to do at this moment. I'm at my Wit's End. Please give me your suggestions, please help me."

I'm currently doing the equivalent of a CS master's degree and it requires me to get an end-of-studies internship which is going to start around February/March 2024.
I'd like to know when FAANG start to open their internship programs and when to apply. I'm probably going to start LeetCoding very soon because I heard you sometimes have to apply 10 months before the actual start date of the internship.
I mentioned FAANG because I'm trying to get the best career start as possible but of course the question is open for other companies as well, as I know a lot of companies are on a freeze.
I was thinking about the UK (mainly Meta London) but it's basically open for all of Europe.

Thanks!"

I graduated with an IT degree back in Dec 2021. I mostly took Software engineering/programming papers. I had two internships and an old permanent job that I lost. I got the internship quite easily. The second one wanted my work examples and asked some easy technical questions and my permanent job didn't even require anything. I was referenced by the company who gave me an internship as my senior co-worker was happy with my work but the company didn't have the funds for a junior.

As for the latest company that I got a permanent position (that wasn't actually permeant) I was supposed to start off with some ""training"" that was just tutorials and I feel like after working for 9 months for that company my coding skills went downhill. I was rarely ever looked after and I was mostly given css and even some user experience research. I wrote a few functions from time to time but I feel like as a frontend dev I didn't do as much as I was supposed to. And I never got any proper training with an actual developer so my coding habits became worse. Overall I have been in the work force for 1.6 years and I just feel like I declined.

After a while I got redundant due to the company's financial issues and also not having work for me anymore. I did get a few interviews maybe like 3 of them and I failed all. One that I failed the technical part, another that I actually passed the technical part but failed the second interview which was more about my experience and another one that I ended up not doing because my mental health was pretty bad at that time. There were a few more but I lacked experience for them... And now I lost all my confidence and a lot of my old skills. It has been three months and I only done a small amount of coding by myself just looking at coding questions just makes me feel very stupid. I've been trying to practice but I feel like I'm not getting far.

I'm starting to wonder if this path is for me. I feel like after this incident I struggle to enjoy coding apps anymore. I used to love it a lot. I don't know what to do and what path I should take. Any advice would be appreciated. I still wonder if I should just pull through and see what I can do or just give up and go towards something else. I can't tell if I actually lost the ability to enjoy application development or is there more to it. Should I just pursue something else? Any advice would be appreciated!"

A few specific questions:

* Any thoughts on job titles for the two most recent jobs? I never actually had an official title for either so I've kinda made these up. Any idea of something a bit nicer than ""Student GIS Assistant""? ""Geosciences Intern"" I kinda like though.

* How's the profile?

* I've had the undergrad studies abroad on there for jobs back home in the US and it helped, but now I'm job-searching in Europe and I can't decide if it really should be there. Leaning towards axing it and writing more about work experience.

* Are those undergrad awards too old?

* I've gotten some confusion over the ""skill bars"" in the past when I've posted old resumes for evaluation. I don't like them, they're a product of the resume builder I use and I would get rid of them if I could. However, I've never had an interviewer question them and I love the way the rest of the resume looks otherwise. If they're really that bad though I might consider finding a new builder.

My duties included keeping the lab clean and organized, observing and assisting my mentor with her PhD research, and I was also able to conduct my own long-running research project where I genetically designed a custom strain of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite.

* Founder and President: School Biology Club (Aug 2022-present)

Founded Biology club and now lead it as president. Organize labs, games, and activities to study for completion in USABO (United States of America Biology Olympiad)

* Treasurer and Member: Merced City Youth Council

I applied for and was voted into my city's Youth Council, where we serve as representatives to our City government officials to provide the unique viewpoint of the city's youth for consideration when important decisions are made. We also organize and lead city events to increase involvement and engagement of youth.

* Secretary and 3 time Competitor: Academic Decathlon

Train and practice for Regional Academic Decathlon Competition. The competition tests comprehension of 10 subjects (e.g Math, Science, History, art, etc) based on a yearly theme (e.g Cold War, American Revolution, etc) through super-quiz format and also includes an essay, speech, and interview section. We have been regional champions for all the years I’ve been a member. I’ve taken top three prizes for the essay section for the past two years

* STEM Tutor: School Avid classes

I am a Tutor for an Avid class at my school for struggling students to encourage them to set their sights on college. There I help students with predominantly Biology and Precalculus homework assignments and attempt to boost their understanding and comprehension of the subject.

**Smaller Extracurriculars (Might not include):**

* Member: Merced High Science Club (2020-present)

Compete yearly in local Science Olympiad competitions. No higher awards

* Member: Merced High Book Club (2020-present)

Compete yearly in Battle of the Books competitions. Our team has won regionals for the past 2 years

* Member: Merced High JSA Debate Club (2020-present)

Compete yearly in the California Winter Conference. No higher awards

* Member: Merced High Varsity Tennis Team (2020-present)

Compete yearly in the Regional Division Competitions. We’ve been grand champions of our division for all the years I’ve been a member

**Hobbies (Might include in “What you do for fun?” sections):**

* Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ran multiple campaigns for local kids
* Piano: Taken lessons since I was 4
* Code for fun. Mainly Javascript but also Python. Have made simple games

**Letters of recommendation**: APUSH Teacher, Biotechnology Teacher, Principal Investigator of Lab I interned at (Has told me he’d love to write me a recommendation without my asking so it might be pretty positive)

**MIT Essays**: 

* Describe the world you come from; for example, your family, clubs, school, community, city, or town. How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations? (250 words or fewer):
   * For this one I focus on how my parents and the work they did to build their careers in a new country starting with nothing and how much of an inspiration they are. I also discuss how their research on soil is centered around improving conditions for farmers in the region where we live and how that influenced me to want my career to help people as well.
* Pick what field of study at MIT appeals to you the most right now, and tell us more about why this field of study appeals to you. (100 words or fewer):
   * I talk about how Jurassic World got me interested in bioengineering when I was nine and how that led to an interest in general bio in high school, to my internship. From there I mention a professor at MIT who’s doing research similar field to the project I did for my research and how I want to continue my research alongside him through MIT’s UROP program. (Here I continue on the idea of helping people since the research the professor does has to do with finding a vaccine for toxoplasma, a parasite that heavily affects third world countries that aren’t receiving help from larger nations.)
* We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it. (200–250 words):
   * I talk about D&amp;D and how it’s taught me to think on my feet and be more comfortable with myself
* At MIT, we bring people together to better the lives of others. MIT students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way in which you have contributed to your community, whether in your family, the classroom, your neighborhood, etc. (200–250 words):
   * In this one I talk about the disparity in my town between lower income families and those associated with the University. That difference was deeply upsetting to me and drove me to tutoring less fortunate students in Avid, starting biology club, and finally joining the city Youth Council to increase exposure to career opportunities in STEM for teenagers
* Tell us about a significant challenge you’ve faced or something that didn’t go according to plan that you feel comfortable sharing. How did you manage the situation? (200-250 words):
   * Still working on this one

**Hopes going forward:**

* Am currently applying for the MITES summer program held by MIT this summer. Hoping I get in but not too confident."

So I’m currently a junior in college for comp sci, but I have decided to route myself in either WebDev or CyberSec. On my free time I’ve been focusing more on studies in relation to becoming a web developer, but was hoping to land a help desk job to help with the cyber security route.

I thought having experience in college from programming, and setting up networks in my class would have been enough to land a entry level help desk job, or even an internship but I’ve gotten denied to about 6 local jobs now.

1. STEM Club (4 hr/wk, 30 wk/yr, 9-12) —President (12th) and Secretary (11th) of a niche STEM competition club. This activity was related to the first two awards I listed in the Honors section.
2. Music (13 hr/wk, 50 wk/yr, 9-12) —Principal positions (11th &amp; 12th) for my instrument in two different youth symphonies in my area. Fairly competitive—and both ensembles are audition-based. In this activity slot, I also included information about soloing, invited to a semi-world-famous concert hall to perform, etc. I’ve taken private lessons and attended masterclasses for my instrument since 5th grade, but never got into NYO.
3. Community Service (3 hr/wk, 40 wk/yr, 9-12) —Co-President (11th &amp; 12th) of a community service tutoring NPO.
4. Math (1.5 hr/wk, 15 wk/yr, 9-12) —President (12th) and Secretary (11th) of Math Honor Society. I organize AMC stuff and host social events for fellow-math lovers. I never got to the AIME level or anything like that in competition math. I did start a community service project through this club, which my counselor knew about.
5. Legal Intern (2 hr/wk, 12 wk/yr, 10-12) —Hybrid (mix of in-person and remote) legal intern. Unpaid work for a Duke alum who is an attorney in my area. I assist with legal work, manage website and SEO, marketing, create content for social media, research for and write articles, etc. I received a strong LOR from the attorney.
6. Summer Math Program (35 hr/week, 4 wk/yr, 11)—Attended a semi-competitive summer math program (sub-50% acceptance rate? I’m not sure) - so much fun. It was a residential program, and the 35 hr/week is my estimate based on the classes, seminars, and other activities I participated in during my time there. Wrote about this in my Duke optional essay.
7. Ambassadorship (1 hr/wk, 12 wk/yr, 11)—Ambassador for an NPO in my area. It was a super short stint (just junior year). I just represented them at community engagement events (ex: neighborhood advisory boards and town halls), and I got to meet the Deputy Secretary of the US Department of Education once. LOL. Did not meet Joe Biden, though :(
8. Paid work (2 hr/wk, 20 wk/yr, 9-12)—I tutor English to international students through Zoom. I'm paid below minimum wage (did not mention this).
9. I interned at a hospital during my freshman year. Nothing eventful.
10. Nothing (I left this spot blank because I ran out of ECs). I strongly believe you don’t need to fill out all 10 spots (contrary to what my HS counselor said).

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. State Champion/National Qualifier in a CAD/3D-printing-related competition (11th)
2. Nationally-ranked debater in a niche STEM debate competition (10th). BTW, my first two entries in the Honors section are related to the activity I listed first in the Activities section.
3. NCWiT Awardee (state-level)
4. National {redacted name of the foreign language I studied in HS} Exam - Silver (10th)
5. PVSA Gold (9th) and Bronze (10th)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Engineering teacher: I LOVED his classes, and I took them in my sophomore year. It was probably decently strong; he’s the teacher sponsor of the STEM activity I listed first in the activities section. I (kind of) asked him last-minute though, but he seemed happy to do it. We’re very close now, but we were less so when I applied to Duke/when he was writing my recommendation. He definitely was able to talk about my personality, leadership, and experience in STEM.

AP Chemistry teacher: She and I are pretty close. She once called me her “most diligent student in my teaching career” in front of another AP teacher, but she’s also outgoing/friendly with most of her students. I worked really hard in her class, and was pretty disappointed about pulling a 4 on the AP Chemistry exam :(

Counselor: I LOVE her. She got me through high school and was probably able to attest to my academic abilities and speak about my personality. I don’t know what a 10/10 counselor LOR looks like, but I think mine was pretty close.

**Interviews,**

Duke: super fun, I learned quite a bit about Duke. We talked about her hometown (I mentioned in passing that I would be visiting), Duke basketball, and why we both enjoy engineering #womaninengineering.

**Essays**

(4/10) Personal Statement: I hated my personal statement, but most people (including a few HPYSM friends) who read it thought it was fine. I rewrote it at the beginning of October because no one liked any of the three-ish drafts I wrote over the summer. I’m not comfortable talking about/sharing the specifics of my essays, so please don’t PM me about them.

(9/10) Duke Supplements: I think my “Why Duke” was pretty unique because I don’t think anybody else could have written it the way I did. I only submitted one of the two max optional Duke supplements, specifically the “best academic experience one.” I started the supplementals in May, after AP Exams. Here’s why [I think you should write both optional essays, especially if you’re an RD applicant.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/102c0kf/comment/j2tnap6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* DUKE! #earlydecision

*Rejections:*

* NONE. Probably would’ve gotten rejected from the other T20s on my list, though (Ivies, Georgetown, Emory, CMU, etc.)

**Additional Information/Reflection:**

I did mention my AP Scholar award in the “additional information” section.

My Duke hooks: 1) I received a strong LOR from an alum and 2) I sent in an arts supplement for my instrument. I’m friends with the Duke professor for my instrument, and I think I received positive ratings from said professor for my arts supplement (maybe there’s an internal recommendation process for arts supplements?).

Also, I was not NMSF in my senior year, my SAT Math score is definitely on the lower end for engineering applicants, and I don’t think my personal statement was written well. However, I think my “hooks” balanced out with my weaknesses, and since I applied ED, it worked out.

To the juniors: honestly, if Duke is your first choice, go for it! I have no regrets about EDing, and I don’t think I would’ve gotten into any other T10 school or Duke RD. I talked with a Duke AO a few years ago, and he said that every year, Duke receives RD applications that would've been accepted had those applicants applied ED, not RD.

I’m just really blessed (and lucky!) to have finished the college application process so early. I’m not reviewing essays or anything like that, but here are a few linked advice things I’ve already commented on Reddit, and I still stand by these comments. Hopefully, it's helpful advice to any of you still in the process! Good luck :)

Theres only one issue. Sometime last year I had caught a criminal case for allegedly selling weed. I have trial at the end of this year where it could be dropped to simple possesion. How bad is a cannabis criminal record for future job prospects? I live in the UK (still illegal here) . If convicted i'm probably looking at community service or probation (first offence).

I (18M) am currently an intern at a local finance tech working with their software team (roughly 8 people, 40 person company roughly). The first two blocks of my schedule each day, I spend in their office collaborating. Some of my responsibilities include things like data analysis, archival scripts, and various other backend stuff. I am super thankful to be there,  I enjoy my position so much, and the opportunities that it brings; these past six months have been a blast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduate in six months. I want to attend college and study computer science. As much as I am learning naturally hands-on, I still feel like there is a lot of potential I still have, and I will need further time to study. I plan on studying at my state's public uni roughly \~150 miles away from where I am (no debt, thanks psat).

&amp;#x200B;

However, my supervisor mentioned to me that he'd love to find a position for me on their backend team immediately after I graduate.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to go. I understand that the hardest part of being in software development is just getting your foot in the door, and I am incredibly lucky to have surpassed that. But, I really feel as if I still have a lot to learn and college can help me improve.

I am 39/F with a AAS in Viticulture and Enology; a degree in winemaking.  I love gardening, and horticulture, and am currently in Master Gardener classes for my county.  I left my office job in September 2022 on FMLA, because I was diagnosed with ADHD.  Since then, I have listed a bunch of stuff on eBay (because I enjoy thrifting and reselling), but now that it is Q1 and sales have slowed down I'm a bit anxious (I made approx. $4K in four months- highly doubt I can sustain this $1K+ a month when EVERYONE else in my area also resells).  I did not go back to my office job once the new year hit, because honestly, I feel so much better being out of a toxic environment; since 2020 there were many things wrong with being in this office setting- which is a WHOLE other story for another day.

My question(s) to you all is, could you help me determine what path I could go down for gardening/horticulture so I could plug those search words into Indeed?  Maybe not go down the Indeed route at all?  I'm open to that.  Would there be other gardening sites I should seek out?

I enjoy sports, am almost 40 so the manual labor landscaping would not be great for my back, enjoy vegetables and herbs, soap making, research, propagation.  I'm not certified in pesticide applications, and again, I am currently in Master Gardener classes, and we have approx. 3 months left.  I love the idea of foraging, but am still a novice.  I spent MANY years in customer service, so I'm not too keen on getting a job in Home Depot or Lowes' gardening center- I'd like to just stay away from them.  I also am not forklift certified, and in my area it costs a couple hundred dollars to get certified- so that's probably a no go, as well.  I looked into Grounds keeping for a sports team, and the sports teams close to me only offer college internships for grounds keeping (yeh, go me!). There are a few golf courses around where I live, and their grounds keeping start of pay is minimum wage. Is there something in the middle of college/young/khaki wearing/gym-going grounds keeping boys and 50-60 year old grass mowing golf course maintenance crew dudes?  Is there such a career as research greenhouse assistants?  I used to work in radio broadcasting (I have a degree in that as well), the beer industry.. am I continuously trying out for ""male-related"" jobs?  Is that even a thing anymore?  It sort of feels like that still exists in my neck of the woods.

If you have a job in horticulture or a greenhouse I'd love to hear your journey to how you got to where you are now.  I would love to work in a greenhouse and do research, but I live in a state where everything is union, especially extension offices and university run research facilities- meaning, there are 1-2 professors who work there, the rest... are all volunteers or enrolled students.  With my Master Gardening classes, I have been emailing each professor after their lecture.  I introduce myself, and just ask if they know of anyone or any place hiring for entry level gardeners, with novice Master Gardener training.  None have followed back up with me, but one professor did say, ""Most greenhouse operations are not real sophisticated when it comes to recruiting.""  Not sure how I should take that, but my immediate reaction was sadness and dread.

Also, if you think ""hey get a job at grocery store stocking, until the gardening industry starts hiring..."" with some advice, I'm open to hearing that option. I do live in a cold state in the northeast.

I am not trying to find excuses, please, do not take this post that way.  I really am curious but with my ADHD diagnosis this late in life, I feel burnt out. I'm not a dummy, and could learn easily.  Maybe it sounds like I lack self-confidence? Yes, I have none of that.  I am also very worried, that I don't have much in my savings (roughly $20K, but I don't want to start dipping into that for daily expenses), I will be 40 soon, so I'm not getting any younger.  I also don't have investments.. so I'm not sure where to begin there if that's something I need to watch YouTube videos on, ask for guidance from a financial advisor somewhere...

From someone who has worked their whole life because they were told ""to get a job"", and it's just burnt them to the core.  I've jumped from job to job every 2-4 years.  Horticulture is something I've always stuck with, as well as reselling from the early days of Craigslist, to eBay now.  Gardening helps my brain and helps me find patience that I lack from ADHD.  Thrifting feeds the dopamine for my ADHD.  

Thanks so much in advance for any advice, leads, or constructive criticism (sure I'll read your /rant)..

For context, I am enrolled in an undergraduate software programming course in a university in Pakistan, but I *hate* attending classes and listening to lectures, and prefer to study alone, online and using text-based resources. I'll mention the reasons below:

* I learn best from self-study and text-based resources. Almost any lecture I listen to, I re-learn that lecture's topic from a book or some online resource. The reasons are:  

   * Most of the time, **the lecturer doesn't give complete or correct information on the subject** \- one reason is that there's simply not enough time to do so (at least in my course). In contrast, books and other sources like online text-based resources or extremely niche lectures, go into much more detail (which I usually prefer). And, if I don't trust a text-based or an online resources, I can quickly and conveniently gain and compare information from several other resources. However, I can't do the same during lectures if I don't trust the lecturer's explanation.
   * **Professors often don't have the most effective teaching style.** They tend to speak redundantly, make mistakes, forget details, don't recommend the best problems to understand a subject, don't give the information in the best logical flow, sometimes don't even choose the best and most relevant sub-topics for their scheme of studies, etc. The point is that I personally noticed that the teaching style of text-based resources, particularly a book, is more honed and perfected from every angle such as conciseness, providing the information in such a logical flow that the reader gets a good understanding, giving suitable real-life examples, suggesting the best hands-on problems, etc.
   * **I can't learn at my own pace during lectures.** Sometimes, what the lecturer might be teaching I might already know, so it's useless for me to regain that information again. Other times, the lecturer might teach a specific point that I need time to process, but don't get that time because the lecturer moves on to the next point.  

      * In contrast, if I were learning that point during self-study, to build my understanding, I would perhaps revise some previous topic I had learned to see how this new point connects to what I already know. Or I'd realize that this points connects to some other topic that I don't know about, so to better understand the point, I'd learn more about that new topic. I'd also take time to ask myself different questions regarding that point and try to find the answers using hands-on programming - during and even after lectures, in my experience, most lecturers are unwilling to give detailed answers to multiple questions (I understand this completely, there's simply not enough time (oftentimes, completely satisfying the understanding of just one student regarding one topic can take half an hour of an exchange of Q and As)). Plus, again, I don't trust the teacher to give the most credible answer to my questions as compared to more well-established resources like books.
      * During lectures, following the teaching pace of the lecturer also means that if I don't understand a point, no matter how well the lecturer explains it (sometimes you don't understand a point even after raising a question), I am forced to set aside that point at the moment. This means that any further points based on that previous point become difficult to understand. And also, I am forced to later re-visit that point after the lecture. In this way, my learning process is not natural - it's forced and ineffective.
      * Similarly, during self-study, I might take a break after learning a topic. This means that sometimes I study for maybe four hours straight without any breaks, while sometimes I study for half an hour, and decide to take a break (take a nap, a walk, eat something, etc.) if I feel like it would freshen up my mind. I might take a break and study a different subject, for instance. So **I prefer to personally manage my learning time in a single sitting and when I decide to take a break.** This has always been effective for me. However, during lectures, I am forced to gain continuous information for one and a half hour, even if I want a break. Or, if I want to continue studying a topic when the lecture has ended because I feel it'd more effective to not break the flow of learning at that moment rather than come back to topic at some later point, I can't do that in university because of the next class.
* Travel costs and physical exertion:  

   * The travel costs are too much. For one semester, my personal travel costs are equal to around one-fourth of the semester fee.
   * My total travel time to college is around 90 mins per day, and as I live in Pakistan, the roads here are rough throughout the whole route. It causes physical tiring to the point that my body is exhausted when I reach home, I constantly want to lie down and rest, and feel worn out for the whole day. Thus, **traveling decreases my learning and general productivity.**
* There's a pressure to socialize with others in class-based environments. As an introvert, this is very challenging for me. I need to invest significant mental resources to talk with others and do things that might come naturally to others (like laugh, engage in casual discussion, listen to anecdotes with other people). Sometimes, when there's no lecturer in the class and I want to study, I can't because I am forced to engage with my classmates. Thus, **learning in social environments (remember that I am learning computer programming) is not as effective for me as learning in a quiet, solo environment.**

Now, I realize that studying in a social environment has some unique advantages that solo learning doesn't. For instance,

* **Learning in social environments allows you to connect with people who can play a potentially important role in your career.** These can be teachers who can offer you internships, they can be senior students or even your classmates who (perhaps in the future) can professionally recommend you to others, or these can dedicated student societies. So, the more you socialize, the greater the probability that you'd make the right connections to find improve your professional career. (Building reliable social connections is also advantageous in general life and university is a strong opportunity to do so.)
* There are certain topics that are best learned from a teacher, rather than from a pre-recorded lecture or a book. This is because **sometimes your problem with understanding a point is so specific that it's hard to find resources that address the problem.** In contrast, teachers can understand your thinking, explain the problem solution in a personalized way, and recommend further relevant topics of studies. (However, I personally rarely face such specific problems. And if I do and need to talk with a person to understand the problem solution, there have always been people on the internet who can explain it. And even if I can't find anyone online, I would prefer to contact my university teacher specifically for that particular problem)
* **Learning in social environments builds your social skills, which are crucial in most professional fields.** These skills can include argument skills, managing emotions during social interactions (such as showing the right amount of confidence, learning to use humor, and in a team environment, communicating feelings with others), appropriately learning to show submission to authority figures or speak up to them in (depending on the situation), learning to understand the thought processes of others with respect to educational or professional tasks (e.g., ""do others understand this topic at the same level that I do? Where do we disagree? How do I communicate my understanding with them most effectively?""), etc.

So, for me, these are disadvantages and advantages, respectively, of learning in a class-based environment as opposed to solo learning.

Assuming that I choose to learn solo, but still want to earn my university degree (so I am willing to pay for the course and participate in evaluatory tasks like quizzes, assignments, projects, exams, etc., what's the best course of action for me? Are there programs/colleges where attendance is not mandatory and that provide degrees that are as credible as a university's?

For instance, an extreme suggestion would be to fake an illness and claim that I can only show up for examinations.

Any thoughts/suggestions are appreciated!

PS. If possible I'd prefer not to substitute my undergraduate university degree with another certification that might accommodate for my learning style but might not be as valuable/credible as a university degree at a professional level. It's actually a whole different topic that whether or not university degrees can be substituted by non-university certifications and give you the same career success (in a software programming career, in my case). But to be safe, I'd prefer to keep studying in a university."

Going to be a bit longer for you to make a picture about me before you answer.

I always loved playing computer games (and was hated for it by parents, friends, ex gfs etc...) and ultimately my dad made me to go to business school, in which I have masters now (completely useless, but it did help me to land a good job I have until now, in which I feel empty)

My uni was mostly studying and internship in Poland, UK, US... because that is how I was told the success of young people is measured and it give you boost at the beginning of career. So I had no time to do something I like and spend time with friends... and only focused on my future ""good life"" as a slave at the job that will be paid well, but not something I enjoy.

Up until know I have been Product and Price Manager in Automotive Industry for car OEM (in Europe) and I would say I did a pretty good job based on the feedback but I started to feel that this is not a job for me.

Right now I would like to get to the path of SWE development (but it could also be CIS/IT I need to try first), which i have been eyeing since my high school days and then see which way would be the best for me. Any advices on that would be also welcome, since I have to discover that would be right choice. For that purpose I would say that I love problem solving (not repetitive), creating something visible, that I could say that I was part of development team that create ""this"", I love storytelling, reading books, (used to enjoy playing games, for which I have basically no time), but since programming is also math I believe I must say I'm average in that. For now I just plan to learn basics with JavaScript (I read that this is the best introduction)

**Since I would like to avoid wasting my time in transition period I would like to ask you for an advice for which job I should go in meanwhile to get some different SWE/IT/CIS, which would be similar to Product Management to a certain extent in a way I could broaden my knowledge which could later support me on SWE/CIS/IT career path and also that would hire me with current 0 knowledge on IT/SWE/CIS, if there is any?**

Sorry for the long post, but there is way too much information on the internet about everything and I'm overwhelmed on where to start, what would be good, but also I fear that once I start it will take time and need to move quickly, given the life is passing by while I'm miserable somewhere where I do not want to be.

Making choices stresses me out. A lot. It's mostly choices that are social in nature, like should I go there with those people or not. It's related to FOMO and the fear of missing great opportunities and happines. (For context, I'm a 22 year old and live in Western Europe).

The last six months, I had the opportunity to go on trips with friends two times, but the situation I was in made me question if I should go. The first time it was because I was supposed to be working for uni and the second time I already made plans with friends at home. Both times, I felt depressed because I had to make the choice and I ended up not going on the trip with my friends. As going on trips with friends is something I love and always wanted to do when I was younger, but couldn't because my friends were not interested in that then, I felt like I was robbing myself from something I've longed for for so long by not going. After staying home, for multiple reasons that made me make that choice, I felt absolutely terrible and couldn't leave my bed for a long time.

One other time, I went on a trip with one of my friends and 3 friends of her that I didn't know. In that week, I didn't feel comfortable and didn't enjoy myself, even though I was on a beautiful island and life should've been great. This shows that even if I do go on a trip, it's not guaranteed that I am happy.

Now my friend asked me if I want to go to India with her in July. She is going in any case, and an other friend of ours is going as well. The travel agency has a limit of people that can go and that limit is reached now, but I can still join if I decide today. However, I just don't know what I want anymore. It's a lot of money to go there (+2000) and it would come from my savings account. I've been struggling with handling money recently and I try to spend as little as possible. It causes me to decide not to do things that are fun and make me happy. It also causes me to be a cheapskate and this has an impact on my relationships with friends. I buy the cheapest drinks and food and I don't do certain activities to save money. This makes it hard for me to justify using my savings for a trip that isn't my dream or plan.

If my friend hadn't asked me, I would not have thought about going there now because it simply isn't the time as I don't have a lot of money in my bank account. Although I do have the amount of money that I need, my savings, so it is possible to go.

It is also possible to go time-wise, as I am currently taking a gap year, trying to figure out what I want in life. I would like to do a voluntary internship but I still have to apply for one and be accepted. I would like to find an internship abroad so I can get to know myself better and explore Europe more. However, if I don't get a scholarship for this, I told myself I wasn't able to do it. Now this decision about the trip to India made me realise that it is still possible if I don't get a scholarship, if I use my savings. And this would be a better investement in my career and future than a trip to India.

But the two previous trips I didn't do, have traumatised me to the point that I can't think clearly anymore. I'm absolutely lost and I don't know who I am or how to act. On the one hand, I'm not that excited to go there so I don't know if I should. On the other hand, I might never have this opportunity again. I will never have this many days off and free to go this far with that friend. And I'm so scared of missed opportunities.

So after my classes from 8am to 1pm, I would go to work. It was an on-site job so I was expected to drive about 1 hour to the place. Everything was fine and I did what was expected of me, spoke to people about how things operate with their app, tried to gain as much info as possible and I constatnly asked for advice whenever I made mistakes. The people were nice and the boss would chat with me at times to make sure I knew what was going on with the startup and what direction it will take.

Fastforward to 2 weeks after starting the internship, it was Saturday (my day off) and the boss held a mandatory Zoom stand-up meeting for us to discuss what we've done and what we would do that day (I still attended the meeting to see how they talk). The boss tells me that he wants me to come collect the tablet from the office (for testing purposes) and that he's expecting me to come at around noon. I replied that I didn't work Saturdays and I'll be collecting it on Monday and to leave it in the drawer. Silence. And then he tells me that he'll call me after the meeting.

After the stand-up meeting, the boss calls me and tells me that he didn't like the attitude I use in the work environment. I apologized to him for it if I offended him and said that I still wouldn't be able to come on my day off because it was the weekend and I wanted to chill out after a week of classes and 5 hour shift. He then tells me that this kind of attitude won't get me far and he ends my internship.

Can someone explain to me why this happened? What did I say/do wrong?

Sorry for the long story but I need to know this so I can prevent this from happening again."

It kind of makes sense where I am though, because some people have no/limited access to computers probably until they get to their later years of college, so it seems like a way to help them, but I’m curious about experiences like these elsewhere."

Low income black girl from the south west.,Historical_Desk1696,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/1040pmw/what_would_you_rate_my_chances_now_for_ivys_low/,"Ok to preface… I’m a junior so this is as of right now so obviously things will be increased like community service but I’m not adding that right now. I also go to a very very bad highschool that’s ranked one of the lowest in the city 80% minorities, 72% on free or reduced lunch, and a graduation rate of 60%.  In my entire school of 3,800 there’s roughly 100 black students as well the main demographic are Latinos. 

Demographics: Mixed Black-Afro Caribbean and white

type of school, and hooks (URM, first generation,
legacy, athlete, etc.): First gen, low income, and minority. Also women in stem?

Intended Major(s): BME or bio chem engineering (I want to go into genetics)

ACT/SAT/SAT Il: haven’t taken them yet,  my two brothers both got a 35 though so I hope close to that, might go test optimal if not in range.

UW/W GPA and Rank: 1/832 (it won’t change by senior year my best friend is #2 and I’m far ahead of her)

Coursework: AP/IB/Dual Enrollment classes, AP/
IB scores, etc: I’ve taken 7 AP so far and 2 Dual Enrollment. I’ve also taken two semesters of sign language at the community college as my language credit + freshman year. 
4 AP world,  5 AP psych, college algebra, and Mythology. 

Current junior course load: I’m taking Ap calc AB, APUSH, biotech, student council, WRT102, AP Biology, and AP Human Geo because freshman year online I couldn’t. 

Awards: I have a lot of African American awards for academics and honor roll. 

Extracurriculars: Include leadership &amp; summer
activities:

1. Im apart of this very selective program in my state that helps low income kids get into college. They’ll guide me to write my essays and scholarships. They also flew me out to Duke this summer.

2. Part time worker at a VERY prestigious medical lab and manufacturing company, they’re one of the only ones in the world who do what they do and it’s only because they do it so well. I can’t say the name because it’s based in my city and everyone will know. It was very hard to get the position and it started off as an internship and I was the only one they asked to stay to work with. I work remote and in person.

3. Student council: Current student body rep and Vice President senior year. 

4. Varsity Track and Volleyball (also club vball) which I pay for myself.

5. Vice President of NHS, President next year.

6. I volunteer at the Cancer Research center a few hours a week if I have free time.

7. Very selective summer engineering program at Cornell, I don’t know how I got in.

8. Intern at a prominent IT and medical company through school for 4 months. Only 4 students were picked. 

9. Summer medical program at Phoenix College of Medicine

10. My current science fair project I’m working with a lab at my University, this year I only believe I’ll place 3rd or 2nd in state because the data isn’t completely finished, but it’s a year long project and we plan to submit the papers when we finish and we will be getting awards.

11. Very selective engineering summer program at ASU

12. Member of HOSA club, mildly involved right now. I just have so little free time.

13. Starting an initiative with my principal to help the black students and the other minorities at my school have access to resources. Still in the world but next year we hope to increase our fafsa fill out and students planning to go to college. (We have the lowest fill out in the city and low in the state) even thought we are statistically the poorest. 

14. I have a lot of family responsibilities taking care of my siblings and I work at a fast food company aswell taking a lot of the late night shifts.

15. Not really one, but I think I have a good chance of getting on the summer program MITES this year because I met one of the admission officers and we had a very lengthy conversation and she said to reach out to her when I apply to MITES.


I want people to be brutally honest. I’m first gen and I don’t know the college process. I look good against other applicants in my school and district but that doesn’t mean much when half don’t graduate. I can’t tell if I even have a chance. Tell me what to improve on and what I can do. I’m very nervous because my dream has been Princeton for as long as I can remember."

Hi everyone, I'm a third year computer science student. I wish to do some part time work whether its freelancing or internship but Im facing a problem.

My problem is that I am not focused in one specific field such as web dev or app dev etc. I am a really quick learner and I usually learn new stuff before doing a project that needs it. For example in these 3 years, I have made Java GUI desktop apps, games in C++ with SDL2, website with nodejs and SQL etc, some automation in python. 

Now how should I showcase my projects (since they're so diverse and not focused on one main area) when applying to opportunities.

Note: This isnt supposed to be my permanent job but I wish to make side money while studying. I also posted this in r/cscareerquestions but I dont meet karma req and I need help urgently :/

I am a fairly weak candidate:

- My resume contains 5 or 6 React and Python projects, but I have no professional experience. 

- My LC skills are weak; I was going through Blind75 but didn't get too far. I was getting low 700's on CodeSignals in Fall, which quickly lead to rejections. 

- My only benefit is currently being a junior at a T5 CS school; it doesn't really matter though, because I am a transfer and have barely any coursework outside of community college. 

I applied to most the ""big"" companies, and by now they have either closed apps or rejected me, so I presume my only option is to apply to smaller, local companies.

1045xx8,2,2023-01-05,Recommendation from UTD,mit122,MSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCS/comments/1045xx8/recommendation_from_utd/,"Updating-
I applied to UTD around 10th December.
CGPA - 8.81 from a tier 2 college.
GRE - 159Q 149V
No research papers.
No work ex.
2 decent internships (Not known companies/MNC's)
Decent projects within the college.

I got a reply back saying that they feel my application is more competitive for the SE MS program and I could consider shifting.

This probably means they did not outright 'REJECT' my application but they feel as they review more applications, they might prefer cases with higher GPA.
Which is basically the trend I observed.

Based on the rejects I am seeing currently I feel I should shift to at least increase my chances of an admit, even if it's for SE, rather than an outright REJECT.

What do you guys think?"

I will graduate in 2024 and until that time, I will try to look for soma more experience.

I just graduated in December 2022 with a degree in networking engineering, I'm also CCNA certified but I couldn't find a job that didn't ask for more than 3 years of experience.
I worked as a help desk analyst as part of an internship position for about 5 months.
To be honest, the salary expectation for a help desk position in my country is bad af and I was considering working there for at least a year to gain experience but then I got offered an IAM  analyst position for a US based company that is 100% remote. The salary is almost five times what I got offered here in my country as a help desk recent graduate analyst. 

I don't have trouble with changing career paths, tbh, I got interested in Cloud and Cyber security in my last semester of uni. 

I wonder what else can I learn (programing languages), or what certifications should I ace (In cloud, or Cyber security) to get an improvement after working as a  IAM analyst. Also, what kind of job titles should I be looking to after?

I'm super confused writing this and it's kinda hard to explain. Also, I've never dated anyone in my 22 years. 

So it started all one month back. I joined back office after a long vacation and there's this new intern who just joined our company for one month.
We somehow got close in short time and seemed to hit it off.

After her internship ended, we were in touch and kept calling each almost daily and we talked for hours. I'd also help her with her assignments for college. She would also suggest to meet up and have weekends together.
But couldn't as I went out of station for some work.

We were in touch, but one day I called her as we didn't had a chance to speak for some days. After speaking to her, I felt for some reason she wanted to end the call shortly. I decided give her some space.

We didn't talk much the following week. She stopped texting me entirely. I just had a hunch she's not interested anymore.

Read stuffs about texting, relationships. Realised I gave her too much of my attention. I was putting too much effort.

Followed some advice, I also stopped texting her, she started texting me after sometimes with low effort like ""ohhhhoo"" or ""enjoyyy"". I replied with the same energy as her.

On 1st January, got her text, check how I'm doing.

Last texted 2 days ago, I'm fully silent on all platforms, I feel she keeps sending me instagram memes as a sign of interest. I feel she wants me to put the effort. I just want to sort this or move on from this. 

What to do?

Tldr: There's mutual liking between me and this girl, after getting to know her and getting very close, she doesn't puts much effort in anything. I want to sort this out."

Company B

- a tech stack I’d like to work in after grad
- more project ownership
- alright pay

Both companies are local to my home. If it matters, I am a junior with a lot of student debt to pay off.

Google supposedly asks for your info for recruitment purposes after you complete 3rd level. My question is, given the current state of tech industry, should I be doing the 3rd challenge right now?

Would I get any interviews at all in this morbid state of Google? In whole of Canada there's like 30 postings and only 1 or 2 that I can fit as a current undergrad student (4th year).

I read that you can hold off on completing your questions for long times unless you started already (which I haven't for level 3).

I graduated from UChicago with a Masters in Computer Science in Fall 2022, and have been trying to get a job as a software dev since. I don't have much work experience and had a math undergrad, and I've done 2 internships. Been trying to apply all over the place for perhaps the past 5 or 6 months, but no luck. Feels like no one is hiring junior developers and everywhere I apply I keep getting told that I do not have enough experience. I've been solving problems on Leetcode and also trying to do a few solo projects on my own in my free time, and I definitely feel like I've improved a lot with my programming skills but it still doesn't feel enough to get hired.

I am pretty well versed a C++,C, and also Python and Go. I also did a course on web dev, where I learnt Javascript and how to build React Apps, and also have some experience using AWS. I was primarily looking to work as a C++ developer because that's the language I'm most comfortable in, however, the only jobs for C++ developers that I can find are at HFTs and gaming companies and I rarely ever see them hiring new grads, with an already competitive hiring process, although I would totally love to get hired at these places.

I've tried hiring on company websites directly, attending recruiting events, reaching out to recruiters on linkedin, applying on linkedin, and so on. Some statistics on my rejections - of all my applications, I never hear back from roughly 70% of them. I've been able to qualify almost all of my coding tests barring just a few. As for interviews, with the exception of 1 tech interview, I've been disqualified after the HR interview. Would you have any advice for me as to how to go about things ? As of now I'm just going to continue with the leetcode, and relentlessly applying. (I'm on a Visa).

If anyone on this thread is hiring a new grad as a software engineer and you think I would be a good match based on my post please reach out to me in the comments."

At my last job, I worked with cisco routers, switches, gateways so I could delete the cisco ios contents.  I had a internship at a hospital where I put computers together.    Then this warehouse starts laying people off, because it has best buy contracts for refurbishing cisco hardware, pcs, monitors, cables and such.

1048g48,8,2023-01-05,In early 40s have no significant employment history for last 14 years. Well qualified. What to do?,StFeargal,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1048g48/in_early_40s_have_no_significant_employment/,"Through a combination of poor decisions, burnout, alcoholism, depression and diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder I have not held a job for more than a few months at any time in the last nearly 15 years.  This isn't to say I did nothing, just no formal employment.

I graduated BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering with very high GPA having gone directly to college after high-school.  I subsequently worked in IT and software engineering jobs for a few years.  In the last 5 years, having experienced 10 years of unemployment, I thought I would try to rectify things and at least make it appear to potential employers that I am not a lost cause.  To this end I read for almost all of a BSc Applied Mathematics and ended up graduating taught masters in EE from a very good school, again with very high GPA - enough to go on to PhD.

After graduating, I took a position as an intern where I was used to free up my manager of some 10 years my junior so they could read theory while I did the work and in fact was used to train them in various aspects of the work particularly the use of test instrumentation.  Another person 12 years my junior was given a full-time job at the company while I was there, doing a job I could have easily done.  I left with some bitterness.

I moved continents and took a job where I was told I would be an EE for a startup company.  The company used me to do some work briefly that was related to some coursework and I was then thrown into some kind of project manager type role which I detested.  This was beginning of pandemic.

The pandemic destroyed my mind further and I moved continents again for a second EE MSc at a highly prestigious school which I am currently engaged with.  I applied for a part time student job, ostensibly to work on hardware, where, as per usual, I had been lied to by the management with the allure of one thing and once the ink on the contract was dry, shoved into some kind of middle-management/project management type deal.  I have since left the role as I no longer have faith in the people managing me.

I have addressed the alcohol and was never drinking in work time anyway.

All I want is to write my thesis and develop a specialism in EE.  Everywhere I look around me and including friends from a long time ago, I see people who were given opportunities and developed specialist skills.

Sure, I can, and do, technical things as hobbies and enjoy them.  Everywhere I end up, though, it seems I am being ridiculed by colleagues and management for not working for this length of time.  It's the same catch-22 situation as I had when I first graduated.  Need experience to get the job, can't get the experience without the job.  The last position I held I deliberately took a low-level training job only to not be given the training.  It seems like a self fulfilling prophesy.

Do I cut my losses and give up now and accept that I will never have a career and just have a job to pay the bills?"

Company A is a more well-known consulting software company, but the role I would be working on is not what I wanted, it's related to ITIL methodology, Service-level agreements,  I have to use Microsoft excel, word, and solve basic IT issues, It doesn't involve software development directly.

Companies B and C are smaller companies, not tech related, but they're looking for someone to build them or help them build a more robust web application with databases etc, basically related to what I want to work in, they mostly use SQL and PHP for development (I would have preferred to use Javascript or ruby, but I haven't got any replies back from other companies).

So what's better here?

I am an Intern at a manufacturing plant and was wondering how to use cell values as the parameters of a date filter.

Basically, whenever product is produced, we track how many parts they were supposed to make, how many parts they actually made, and the date that the work was done. My job is to create an excel sheet where the user enters the part # they want to look up, and the date ranges to look through. Ex. If they want just a week, they would enter 1/1/2023 in one cell and 1/8/2023 in another.

Then, I would sort our large excel database for only production values that are within that date range and that part #. (This would be by filtering the date column) But I'm not sure how to get the date filter to be based on values in a cell on the main workbook.

I'm writing this post because I could really use some positive experiences, success stories or even advice. I'm struggling to get other people to understand how I feel. I live in a country in Latin America, and I feel like most people I've talked to have this stereotype of ADD/ADHD that consists of people that are very restless, for example, are impulsive, or have bad grades. That's not my case at all, because I'm more of the innatentive type.

I am a 24 year old woman, and I have struggled with ADD my whole life. I could only realize this in retrospect when I had my first internship, because even though my assigned work (or lack thereof) would directly affect others, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I would take hours finishing small, simple tasks, because I'd always get distracted, or sometimes even if I wasn't doing anything else, I felt ""blocked"", like there was an invisible wall that I couldn't push past. Everything else was fine: I was in a very good place mentally, I was given clear instructions by my supervisor, and the tasks I were assigned were things that I could, in theory, accomplish. But still, nothing. It got to a point in which I had to tell my supervisor that I just couldn't meet the deadline in time and that I had no valid reason for it, maybe I was just tired, but I was behind. He was very understanding, but of course, this is not ideal. Fast forward to my second internship (a longer and more serious one) and the same thing is happening. 

More context: I'm an econ major, so most of my task require sitting at a computer, reading long documents (which I dread) and sometimes working with databases, which is the most bearable for me. I did decently at university because I never found it hard, but my grades weren't good because I always left assignments for the day before and I skipped parts, or sometimes I didn't even deliver them because, again, I couldn't bring myself to do it. I can only do things last minute, under pressure. Looking at my history, I realized that I've always done things this way: homework or studying at school, then at university, chores or even hobbies. Always last minute, and anxious. But nowadays, even that adrenaline doesn't seem enough, maybe because I've become a less anxious individual in general.

All of this has left me quite worried and a bit hopeless. I've started talking about this with my therapist, and I have taken medication before and it helps me tremendously. However, I still think that this is a problem that is too big for me to handle. I feel a bit paralized, and very scared of never being able to mantain a job to support myself and my family. 

So, I've come to ask you: what's your experience with this kind of feeling? What has helped you? Have you been able to get over it?

Thank you so much, and I hope everyone is doing well!

I'm a junior software engineer with no prior job experience and in this company I am going to work with a software I know almost nothing about (except what I've learnt during my internship).   


They are offering me a teilzeit job with german classes included and they are offering me only a bit more than 2,000/month (gross).

In the contract it says after I no longer need the classes (which are supposed to stop in 5 months) I will receive more and work 40h/week. What you guys think about that? There are lots of bonuses and other stuff involved once I can work full time tho."

I haven't applied to very many internships so far, and I'm a sophomore. Does anyone know how I can find internships that are a) still hiring and b) open to underclassmen?

Also, if anyone's got company suggestions, I'm very open to that too."

Saw some people sharing their new grad job search experiences, so I wanted to share mine as well.

**applications**: 119, used [this](https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023) Github repo to find all my jobs.

**prep**: blind 75, neetcode, and company specific questions w/ lc premium

**background**: cs undergrad @ purdue, 3 internships (2x JPMC, 1x Textron), teaching assistant, 3.8 GPA

I added a video [here](https://youtu.be/tz-3Ho29yN8) for those that don't want to read (mods lmk if this isn't allowed and I'll remove it).

**applied/ghost (51/119):**

Nothing much to talk about other than rip me thinking I had a chance to pass the resume screen for some of these companies. Some of the notable companies that I haven’t heard back from are Databricks, Google, Apple, Datadog, Netflix, Uber, Twitter (ty for ghosting me Elon in hindsight), Oracle, and PayPal.

**in progress (6/119):**

I probably got ghosted by all of these companies as well tbh

* Morgan Stanley haven’t reached out after their HireVue
* submitted a perfect OA for Blackrock &amp; matched with them on Ripplematch
* did mediocre on TikTok’s OA, so not surprised

**rejected (58/119):**

First, I declined interviews for 11 companies (IMC, Vanguard, Walmart, Gap, Hive AI, etc). This was because i wasn’t fond of the interview style (ehmm IMC's one way interview) or i didn’t want to commit my time for on-sites.

Another 11 companies rejected me because their headcounts were filled for the recruiting season (C1, Figma, Pinterest, Visa, Roblox, etc). I applied as quickly as i can for these companies, so I guess my resume wasn’t strong enough to get picked

Next, I got rejected from 13 companies after at least one round of interviews/OAs. I had an 813 codesignal score, but it wasn't enough for companies like Circle and ZipRecruiter. I submitted a perfect OA for Goldman Sachs and had a recruiter reach out to me, so I don’t know what went wrong there. SpaceX’s assessment was only offered Python or C++ and I use Java for my interviews, so that didn’t turn out well. For Palantir, DraftKings, FactSet, etc, I submitted terrible OAs, so I wasn't surprised getting rejected. Finally, I got rejected after my final round of Mathworks. I got asked a system design question, and didn’t prepare for that, so again, wasn’t surprised getting rejected.

Finally, i got rejected from 23 companies after the resume screen (Microsoft, Adobe, Scale AI, Zoom, Twilio, Doordash, Lucid, Niantic, etc)

**offers (4/119):**

Finally, the part most of you guys probably were interested in.

* First, I was able to get a return offer from my internship at JPMC. A pro with banks is that for the most part they are pretty recession proof. The compensation package was 110k base, 20k sign-on, and 10k performance. 140k 1st yr and 120k reoccurring
* Next, I got an offer from StubHub. Their process was a behavioral phone round, a technical interview, and a final demo presentation. I’d say the technical interview was trivial given that you know your data structures. The final was like me being on Shark Tank, so it definitely was a bit weird, as I was expecting a technical interview. After negotiating with StubHub, I was able to get an offer of $170k base, $320k RSUs split evenly across 4 years, and a 10k sign-on. The tc was 260k for the first year, and 250k reoccurring. Before you guys go crazy, the TC is a bit misleading, as StubHub is still a private company, so till then, the stock is paper money. Moreover, with the current state of the economy, i personally don’t think they will IPO any time soon.
* Next, I got an offer from General Motors. The process was 2 rounds, a hirevue and a final round that only consisted of behavioral questions. Their compensation package was Base: $87k Bonus: 10% of base Sign-on: $5k TC: $100.7k (1st year), $95.7k (reoccurring). So, if you guys don’t like technical interviews, make sure to apply to general motors. Their process also took around 3 weeks.
* Finally, my last offer was from Bloomberg. Their process was a technical phone interview, a virtual onsite consisting of 2 technicals and 1 behavioral round. For me, solving Bloomberg tagged questions on leetcode was enough prep for me. After negotiating, I was able to get an offer of $155k base, 30k bonus, and 10k relocation bonus. So, the tc was 195k first year, then 185k reoccurring. Their process took around 2 months, and this was apparently due to a lot of people applying.

**final thoughts:**

* Definitely apply as fast as you can, as much as you can. I hate to say it, but at the end of the day it’s a numbers game
* [Join](https://discord.com/invite/cscareers) cscareers.dev’s discord server so that you can connect with other new grads. They definitely helped me secure valuable information.
* Leetcode. I think getting lc premium for the duration of your job search is worth it bc it allows access to see specific company’s questions. Think of it as an investment to yourself and it’ll pay off when you get an offer.

lmk if you guys have any questions, and I'll try to answer as many as I can!"

I am a female planning on majoring in biology and going on to med school after undergrad. Money doesn’t play a big role since all of these colleges would be basically free because of scholarships. I know that what you put into a school is what you get out of a school, so I am not worried about reputation as much as I am considering what school fits me. I am a person who likes to be social and I look forward to parties, but I also need my space at the end of the day. I like to play basketball recreationally and I worship the gym. I want to be fairly involved in college.

I have heard plenty of stereotypes about schools, and I don’t want to base my decisions on those. I am probably going to dorm my freshmen year and I have heard that UF has pretty bad dorms. I visited UF, and I toured a friend’s dorm. Honestly, the building was horribly outdated, and the communal bathrooms looked like a nightmare. I also visited some FSU dorms of friends, and they seem to have a variety of dorming situations, all of which looked better than UF’s. I haven’t been on a campus tour of UCF (although I have visited for competitions) so I don’t know much about their dorms except it is apparently hard to get housing because of overpopulation.

UCF

**Pros**

\- I like the city, which is the main reason I am considering UCF.

\- Better job opportunities, which will come with high competition.

\- I like walkability and having everything at close proximity.

\- Tons of things to do in Orlando

\- MCO airport is nearby (I travel often)

\- 1 hour from home

I want to know more about their biology program and opportunities for internships and making a name for myself. I will likely stay in the central Florida area after my undergraduate, so it could prove beneficial.

**Cons**

\- I don’t want to see people I know from high school at my college. I know that the college is very big, but I hate the idea of seeing the same people after high school lmao.

\- I have heard a lot of complaints about the size of the college, and I don’t want to be stuck in a place where none of the professors know my name and I get lost in all the students.

\- Its 1 hour away from home which idk if it’s a pro or con lol

FSU

**Pros**

\- PARTYY SCHOOLL!!

\- Pretty women

\- Pretty school colors

\- Free football games

\- Free cinema

\- Strong sense of community

\- Beautiful campus gives college feel

**Cons**

\- 4 hours from home

\- Not in a big city

I don’t know much about the biology program here either tbh so if you have any opinions feel free to comment. Also, is there much to do outside of FSU. It seems pretty dead outside of college. ?? I applied for honors and if I get into the program how much of a benefit would it be? I know I get first pick on classes, but I haven’t heard much else. Would FSU honors provide me with something I wouldn’t get in UCF and UF?

UF

**Pros:**

\- Considered top rank (idk if this really matters much to me)

\- 2 hours from home

\- Pretty good STEM program from what I’ve heard.

**Cons:**

\- UGLY ASS COLORS

\- Gainesville is dead AF

\- From what I saw in the tour, the campus seemed very mid

\- Dorms are trash

\- I’m probably wrong, but from my experience with UF graduates (my high school IB teachers) they seem to have a sense of superiority over others which I despise

If you’ve gotten this far, thanks for reading :)

If anyone has any opinion on the **meal plans** at ANY of the schools I would love to hear it because I am considering a meal plan. How's the food?

To conclude, I have a theory and feel free to give your thoughts on it. If I go to UF (which is “better” than other colleges) I think it would be harder to be top of my class, which is based on UF’s overall highest average GPA (4.4) compared to FSU and UCF, and my thinking that classes are more rigorous. Would this mean that there would be fewer opportunities for me to be average in UF rather than top of my class at FSU or UCF? In that sense, would it be more beneficial to attend a college that is easier to get into (UCF OR FSU)? Again, this is just a theory and is based on speculation so if my logic makes no sense please tell me **😭**

All advice is welcome even if it's random"

My friends with MacBooks on a M1 and M2 chips watching on me with a tears on their eyes because they’ve had a stunning 10 hours of battery life with light/mid usage. 
I’ve decided to switch on a macOS. 
Need your help to choose a configuration, because there os so much threads and i still didn’t find a good review or so…

1) MacBook Air on M2, 256 ssd and 8 gigs of RAM . Basic config. Is it ok for a frontend development? JavaScript, React is my main stack. 

2) MacBook Air on M2, 256 ssd and 16 gigs of RAM. 

3) MacBook Pro 14 on M1 Pro, 512 ssd and 16 gigs of RAM. 

4) MacBook Air on M2, 512 ssd and 16 gigs of RAM. Makes no sense because of a price. It actually is the same as the MBP 14. 

So, what do you think guys?
Thank you!"

It's kind of depressing how 3 letter grades (I did the math) are between me and a 3.7. My weighted GPA is a 3.9.

Is there much of a difference between the 3.6 and 3.7?

My EC's include Varsity Mountain Biking, Varsity Debate, my school's professional studies program (have to apply/interview to get in), a software development internship with a fortune-500, self-taught in Java and Python, and taking online courses like IBM's Intro to Quantum Computing. I am a white male from Arkansas (edit: being from arkansas isn't an EC-- not sure why I put this here)

In October, I took the ACT without having studied. I got a 28, but a 36 on the reading section. I am extremely confident I can get a 34+ with some serious studying. I will be taking the test in April, and perhaps again in the summer.

I can write pretty good essays, I believe. I've also been working on networking with teachers for letter of recs.

I'm interested in a computer science majoring, and perhaps a double-major with business.

Feels like in terms of my stats, I tread the line between being able to go to great schools and having to go to mediocre schools.

Really not feeling great about what I did to my GPA over the past three years. Can anyone offer insight as to where I pragmatically stand?"

The internship I’ve had wants to keep me around for a while, so I could be here until I graduate in December 2023. I’m a CS major with a concentration in data analysis, and I’m mainly building automation systems for them with Python and Pandas, about to start using PowerBI. I also have the Google data analytics certificate. I want to pursue software engineering, as I have the most fun programming and working with data structures/algorithms.

As 2023 kicks off, management wants us to speak up about any training we want so they can get it budgeted for, and they want to increase the amount of training we have in general. It’s very open ended, and seems like a great opportunity to get pretty much any training paid for so long as it’s somewhat relevant to our position.

What would you recommend I ask for? What else to consider?

I’m in the manufacturing industry, working on business/data analysis in a bunch of different areas. I’m looking for something that would benefit me long term if/when I move on to something more software related. I don’t know what the future holds exactly, but after this company it’s probably going to be something in data analysis/engineering or software engineering.

For one thing, most of the local Taiwanese did not speak English, hense there was low demand of learning it, for the other, even if there were job vacancies, the pay was extremely low, to such a degree that I felt humiliating. In the end, I was offered a cram school opportunity that only paid minimum wage. I rejected it, and then began to think about learning computer science.

I don't even know what that means!! Another is, when asked what language? They said ""we do not require any specific language for the coding questions"". Anong ibig sabihin nun? I only know Python.

For starters, I'm not from a CS/IT program. I did coding but mostly for statistics. I did put out my projects on my resume and yes I am interested to data science, I was actually hoping for a data analyst internship but to no avail being ghosted till now. I know Python/R and basic SQL. I've done webscraping projects and been learning these for over 6 months now (not full time though). Some requirements from the job description actually matches my resume.

Can anyone manage my expectation or give tips? Will it also be ok if tanungin sila about sa coverage nung coding questions (ayoko sana mag aral ng random hehe may school pa ako)?

I am in my second semester of my junior year and I am feeling a lot of anxiety. I always tell myself that in the end it will be okay but I can't help but feel extremely anxious over the future. I am deathly scared I will not be able to get a job after graduation, I've read some horror stories about people not getting jobs 1 or 2 years after graduation and I don't want that to be me. I've been endlessly applying to internships and I've never gotten one interview. I've exhausted every single one of my connections friends, family friends, family of friends and if this trend continues im afraid I will be unemployed after graduation. I know I am fit to be an engineer, given any problem and time I have always been able to figure out a solution. The first semester of this year has been my toughest year so far. I took a C++ class, discrete math, probability statistics and vector calculus, and circuits 1. This coarse load was too much for me and it caused me so much pain and stress but I was able to actually pass all my classes with a 2.5. Given this immense challenge I was able to overcome it and come out on top. This makes me confident that I have what it takes to accomplish any task an employer were to throw at me. I just wish a company would give me a chance to prove myself. I wanna know that all my pain in school will lead to something I want to know that I am doing this for a reason and I will not end up getting one of the hardest degrees just to work in the restaurant industry the rest of my life. I just want a sign that there are good times to come. I am so scared I wont be able to get a job with the intense competition in the engineering industry right now."

104pm7y,2,2023-01-06,"Been Struggling to Face Reality, Work on Myself, and Chase/Manifest My Dreams/Goals/Ambitions",SpaceJunkieVirus,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/104pm7y/been_struggling_to_face_reality_work_on_myself/,"With the hate from the deepest pits of my heart, I fucking hated 2022 and it was the worst years for me. My GPA dropped like hell, I was not able to give time to my important side activities, am year behind my planned time to get into research and internship search, and just overall other fuckup. I have gained infinite wisdom and self-knowledge and emotional intelligence but I am really struggling to apply it in my life. Small example is being kind and loving and good son to my parents in front of others and my head yet fail to do simple gestures like offering them help or call them daily.

I have seen myself acting less on my life and wish to be this 'came in clutch' guy for others. Like I see myself less as a hero on a journey which I know I am and as someone who wants to be that ultra OP dude (think like Satarou Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen or Super/Bats from DC). A dude shows up and flips the whole victory for his team. It took me a year of depression to figure this out that I have this almost narcissistic tendency of being the OP guy (almost narcissistic cause I have heard narcissistic folks dont even think about it). And no, people dont even ask me for help or go out of their way. Instead, it's me who can pick up some cues and go out of the way to ask if there is something where I can help them. As I saw somewhere else on reddit (I think r/HouseMD) kinda like Wilson, with syndrome of super Nice Guy (not with ulterior motive other than feel good). Another example I can think of is of Batman and his martyr complex:- can't bring hope to my life, and can't die, and so will chase an empty career goal that merely sustains me, with primary goal of bringing hope to others. The thing is, I am not even that super good at it (like for eg I say I can help someone with HW1 but can only help with bare minimum of it). Heck, I feel like I am on an adventure when binging movies (not just TV series or anime but whole ass movies). Includes going on subs like r/offmychest r/premed to demotivate others knowing damn well I should be working on my own but have no wish to do. As if I have decided I wanna lose. I know I should complete mine first and then help other complete their goals/dreams but yet I can't. I wanna take others on the long walk of life/goal/mission/purpose. Dont know if it is even realistic to have people who share the purpose/goals with you and would want to work with you on it. This could be a sense of seeking fun in boring life but I dont know why I want so much adrenaline on daily basis. If not this, I might go on daydreaming sprees of what would happen next in life? I am struggling to understand why I do not work on my tasks and can think of other stuff I can do instead of just seeking thrill. And by thrill, I dont even mean parties, alcohol, or weed, etc. so no way I can be called cool by others in that area (which again I know can be dumb). I just dont find it hopeful that I can make the progress I want in the timeline I have set myself for. That is, I feel my peers have gone ahead with their career and lifestyle and dating and sex and pretty much everything else. I feel like I can never ever reach them let alone excel in what I want. So what the point in working when you can't even reach your goal on time? What if, God Forbid, am left in condition where I can't pursue what I want (u know all types of misfortunes) like lets say right tomorrow (that does not hurt that bad then lets say at the end of a semester)? Then, I will die like a fucking loser (not really since I did improve) but an improved dude with no significant achievements. This makes me so vengeful of the time I have lost and even if I dont wish to, I fell into the pit of victimization and always say 'why me? why did I lose the way and put myself in this hell of persistent losing?' What's the point when my self image project is not done before deadline? Heck it feels like I am being persistent on losing, convinced myself to do so, and not being persistent on doing let alone winning.

Could it be mere failure to muster up courage to take a decision and stick with it? It's not like I dont know my goal. My goal is defined but journey to some of them is so abstract that I am not sure if I am on the right way (again I am correcting this self-doubt too). Is it just mere laziness? Like I know I can do this (and I tend to sometimes forget my tasks) but just dont consider it life changing to act on it. And note this has happened only after February/March 2022. Before that, I used to fail but failed hard not of inaction (now that I see it was slowly creeping it = procrastination or my inaction or whatever I have described above). I thought it can be depression and anxiety but it is really easy to make me forget that and I still aspire to something in my life. It's just that the energy and ambition and drive and goal and purpose and service and belonging I had in me is gone. Everyday feels like a drag with no growth no progress no wish to go out and do out of comfort zone stuff. I feel like 45 yrs old middle-age crisis dude as a fucking 20 yr old bloke.

Worst part is I have a golden opportunity of full-ride at a T20 school for which people would trade my place in a heartbeat. Yet I have fucked my chance of having the most glorious career I could have. (will likely want to use my career money or skills for social service and that's why I am low-key pissed. the hero complex again). Heck, I sometimes feel that the school some of my mates think is so cool, gave them so good stuff, has pretty much killed my soul. But again, that is victimization. I dont think I am being hard on my self as others would say. If I dont do it I can't discipline myself, which well, I still I haven't done completely. Low self-esteem? Dont know. I even thought of getting a drop this Fall 2022 but could not tell it to my parents. Thought the tire I was feeling was temporary and I could overcome it. I wanted to stay up with deadline thinking I will push harder. I kinda did but got distracted and got really burned out since November (I swear this break feels like even longer than the ones I got for summer in elementary or middle school and feel like I am a little happy/relieved.) Worst part is I know some of my friends doing study abroad/break semester who encouraged me to take one too if I could afford to complete degree on time. However, I think ambition has taken hold of me again and I still kinda feel more energetic than last break to start the sem. Off note but fucked up my summer 2022 classes saying fuck I dont wanna work on it anymore (was pissed with it) and also in the Noenergy November (pun intended to lighten the post).

Will end this note with something I thought I have but I dont think otherwise. Since high School I think, mom used to say: 'if you act like this, you will die of hypertension at 25. I just want you to wake up, spend the day, and go back to sleep with a smile.' I thought I have dysthymia (or anxiety or depression) but that's defo not the case if I get my megalomanic daydreams. I also have some dreams of what if I become a homeless bum or what if all I do gets me no where lately (in 50/50 ratio). (dreams = daydreams).

I might cut out all outlets of escaping reality like TV and that includes Reddit. So please dont worry if I dont reply immediately. I am in no mood of dying. I still enjoy life. And God Forbid, if anything bad happens, I will try to let my parents know to update here anyhow lol (seriously an /s tho. I am an hypochondria so no way I wanna die).  In words of SuperMan, 'I am too stubborn to die.' I can make myself happy, I am just not contended with my ability to stay inactive and not go for me dreams. Perhaps, the biggest factor in my hesitation is not just overcoming the fact of being later than deadline (with biggest being reapplying for med/grad school multiple times/cycles). I will become truly proud/self-respectful when I see myself as achieved what I wanted. I know self-respect comes when you are taking action, which I know I can, I just can't go past the idea that there is no guarantee I am living at the pace of my peers, and will get the things they got earlier in life later in my own like a hand-me-downs.

I missed one more point I wanted to talk about but I even procrastinated to post this for like 3 months. just put it here in case. Thanks for reading this far.

Thanks for hearing. Hope you guys can give your fellow Guy some wisdom. Have a great day fine folks."

I am a junior studying computer engineering at a SUNY school and I'm starting to look for my first internships this summer. The only problem is I don't really know what computer engineers do, since its such a broad term. As a result, I don't know what I want to do after I graduate. I got into this major because growing up I loved building computers and being fascinated with the components such as the GPU and watching a lot of LinusTechTips. From my experiences in courses, I don't really like working with higher level languages (I like C and other low level languages), but enjoy working with hardware more. I enjoyed my digital systems class where we worked a lot with breadboards and integrated circuits and my embedded systems where I worked with a STMicrocontroller Nucleo L4R5ZI and different sensors. When looking for internships/jobs, are there certain titles/keywords I should be looking for that pertain to my interests? Sorry if this question is asked so much."

I've been looking for a place for a while and I can only find one assignment that I really like at a company that doesn't require me to travel for a long time.

The problem is that my partner of 4 years works at that company. 
I applied to the internship this morning and I messaged my partner about the application would
sent out. 
In this message I explain that I knows how he doesn't like me going there, but that it's also the only assignment I can find that I like. Finding an assignment I like is important to me, since I already started a graduation internship that I had to cancel because it wasn't the right place for me.
I also told him that if he really wants to, I'll withdraw my application, since he's more important to me than an assignment. 
My assignment would be at another department of the company, so we it's very unlikely we neer to work together or even see each other.  
And since it may be good to add, I didn't look at the company because he works there, I had a friend doing their internship there before my partner worked there and they had a great expierence. 

However, if I need to withdraw my application, there's a big chance I won't be able to start my graduation which means I won't be able to graduate next semester and that would really suck.

He messaged me back that he needs to think. He also stated that he isn't mad, but he calls it ""not a pleasant situation"", which I do understand .

I'm not sure how to handle this situation, maybe people here have some advice?"

Very open to feedback or criticism or thoughts.

# My background

Low technical proficiency

* Did some amount of modding as a kid but with games that had engines that were comparable to like scratch io
* I've tried at various points to do programming in university, internships and high school and always sucked ass at it. I really wanna try and make this stick this time purely out of spite
* I work an office job that involves a lot of planning and design work
* I immediately decided on doing 1 udemy course and that brackeys FPS controller video that I was ready to start work on my dream stealth horror immersive sim with every monster being playable, off screen monster ecology simulation (I like rainworld) and a dozen other things (I removed multiplayer from my features list for now, so I'm being reasonable with my expectations)

# General Thoughts

* **I have to be super tactical with my time.**
   * I'm really stubborn/pig headed and would love to just sit and mindlessly grind away at a problem rotating through solutions until I find something that works Its switching my brain off in the same way that playing a game is. I'm like this with everything, especially if I can see that I'm making progress. Giving that context just to say that this has been probably the first time I've had to just be like ""take a break or do another part of your thing"".
   * Like for this it feels like that is... not a good idea strictly just because if I'm doing everything by myself and theres so, so much to learn I'll never get anywhere. I've had holidays recently but past that I'll get like an hour or two here and there to work on stuff and I need to be really efficient with my planning and structuring (Trello boards help) to make sure I'm actually getting things done
* **Theres almost too much content out there to consume**
   * This is a really good problem to have but jesus christ theres like a decade of material to go through and a lot of incredible udemy and youtube courses. I have a problem and theres like six ways I could follow along with to solve it. How those ways actually mesh together over time though and if iI'm actually learning something vs just following along is another thing.
* **Everything is surprisingly doable**
   * I really like that (for the things im personally interested in) theres a ton of tutorials out there. If I want like stealth mechanics or for fire to propogate or AI theres an ungodly amount of resources on that.
      * This isn't necessarily a good thing and doable doesn't mean easy, and making the million different ways of doing things by different creators with different programming techniques work might be challenging, but theres generally tons of resources for anything. Like its cool that a lot of things have some foundation floating around on how to complete them.
      * Like example; the shit I said at the start. Its kinda memey as an expectation for a first dev but with the stealth stuff theres tutorials out there for that, and if I just make first person modelled versions of each creature I could kinda simulate being different monsters, and theres a lot of material out there for AI. I could probably find something for simulating events in the background as the player moves between different locations for the ecology thing.
* **Optimizing stuff is a black hole**
   * Example: I thought I'd make a character controller for my game, and as a part of that the design would be that I could use it for a variety of characters with different abilities. I like the idea of having a relatively easy pipeline for creating new characters where all I'm actually scripting is any unique abilities for them. How hard could that be right?
      * Optimizing this has been a black hole of time. Like I keep finding things I'd want to optimize or change and it outwardly looks like I've done nothing even though it has been me learning a lot.
      * Example: I want it that when you press space to jump, because your character might have different movement types (flight/gliding/double jump/jump) do I handle that with a switch or maybe look up that tutorial about abilities and abstract classes? Idk? This is rhetorical but theres always more thinking on diving deeper and I know so little that any one topic could open up a giant can of worms in a different direction.
* **Learning Blender has been painful but fun**
   * I used to use blender a lot for sculpting for tabletop shit, 3d printing. For this I dont really need to care about polygons or bones or movement or any of that shite as much, its just ""does it have holes or no"" - this lack of care for fundamentals meant that I had to actually relearn blender, but I'm glad I did even if it was a pain in the ass to do initially.
   * I'm complete ass at texturing (this comes from two random textures online ive gobbled into something)
   * Animating shit is surprisingly fun, if initially super fiddly
   * Animating shit and trying to make it work for a playable first person perspective and also for a monster in the wild is challenging and theres a lot of different ways to approach it
* **This has been unexpectedly fun**
   * I like the reactions I got when I showed people a horrific PS1 style version of a mutual friend running around and jumping. That was fun to me.

# What I'd like to do from here

* I feel like I learn best when I've got my big exciting dream project in mind, so I'll probably just keep doing that. That 'how to make dark souls in unity' tutorial and a ton of udemy courses have been good (and the brackeys stuff), so I'll probably just keep rotating through those.
   * I dont mind if I eventually start something smaller or build smaller games as long as I'm learning something, but I know what motivates me to keep learning.
* I'll likely try and stop focusing on optimizing stuff right now or even on meta stuff (like having a really fast pipeline to making new characters) in favour of just racing towards having a very basic prototype or game out there. Showing people more or less the same thing but with a slightly more optimized way of jumping isnt really interesting to anyone.
   * Resisting the temptation to fix things that are kinda broke but not really. Like my crouch right now is based on scale, and shrinks the fps characters model/hands. The alternative one I made to this is based on the gamecontrollers height, and shrinks the character into the ground (and since im using that fps controller from brackeys it also pushes it into the ground).
      * ATM my thinking is to just move on as long as its not deal breaking at the moment, the scaling thing is kind of annoying but not a deal breaker so lets move onto the AI or something."

Hello everyone. I am halfway done through college. It was an extremely rocky start for me, as I was in severe depression in 2021. The pandemic, a dispute with my school, loss of personal relationships took a heavy toll on me and I struggled a lot. However, I can proudly say that I am out of that dark place!

However, I do feel that it caused me to be behind some of my peers. Luckily, I got admission to a top college but struggled in my first year. I have managed to recover my academics, but I feel that I am not quite ""career"" ready or suitable enough to join the workforce. Internships feel either too basic, while others feel more specialized. 

I would love to know what can I do to be more workforce ready. A BA degree won't get me a good job, so I am looking for higher studies abroad. I am particularly interested in public policy and data science (although I made the mistake of not taking maths in 12th). I plan on learning skills, python and R.

Are there more suggestions for me. People who have the same degree or same ambitions in the future, I would love to know what you did and/or plan to do in the future.

Cheers, and have a great weekend ahead!"

I was a system administrator for the better part of 10 years, working for a small MSP. I got a little bored with it and went back to college to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I still work part-time for that MSP, largely because my employer treats me really well.

This is my last semester, and as part of it I am expected to take on a software engineering internship. My previous employer has tentatively agreed to let me do that internship with that company, with the mutual understanding that the work I do has to be in line with software engineering, and NOT system administration.

Now, my goal after college is to write software for system administrators and/or helpdesk personnel. Mark Russinovich is a bit of a personal hero. Therefore, I'd like to use this opportunity to take a step in that direction. So I wanted to reach out to a community of sys admins to ask: If you had a CS intern at your disposal, what kind of software would you have that person write to make your job/business either easier, more efficient, or more profitable?"

&amp;#x200B;

I had been on the team at Habitat 45 for a few months when I received the message. It was from one of my former teachers, Professor Web. She wanted to know if I would guide her on a mission into Hab 45. I had only been inside the forest a handful of times, and told her that I would need clearance to enter. I also asked why exactly she wanted to visit. 

At this response, she asked if she could speak to me verably. I tried to send her an audio-comms request but she denied it. She messaged me again and asked if we could meet in person. We settled on meeting at one of the restaurants--a common place for humans to have food--in the Inner Cylinder. 

It had been a while since I had left Cylinder 3 during the artificial daylight. I had spent most of my waking hours managing the Wanderers. The Inner Cylinder has much more cramped-feeling than most of the ship; and it is extremely off-putting since the vast majority of my homeworld is prairieland. If I tilted my head upward I could see the otherside of the Cylinder. There were people walking along paths and enjoying the day, but all upside down. In the main cylinders this is not possible because the inner walls replicated the skies of the various habitats. I began to get dizzy as I walked to the designated meeting place. 

I met the Professor and we made small talk during the meal of cut potatoes and synthetic meat. After we returned our plates, we sat back down to discuss the matter at hand, “So Professor, I was somewhat surprised to get your message.”   
“Why? I regularly check up on my former students,” she said, “I like to make sure they are fitting into the social order all right.”   
I sat silent for a moment, staring at her questioningly, “Yes. I appreciate that. I was more surprised by the content of your message, though. A simple search would have told you that physical visits into Habitat 45 are rarely permitted.”   
“I am aware.”   
“It must be an important mission then, why do you wish to go?” 

At this direct question the Professor leaned in slightly. My own ear is extremely sensitive, clearly the Professor wanted to ensure that the surrounding tables did not hear her, “Well, it is a personal hobby. Not for any research purposes. I am on a sabbatical, and as a high ranking member of the Ethics Council I am allowed to certain… privileges.”  
My four eyes closed in my sockets. She continued, “I understand that the Lovoca is one of the few apex predators aboard the Ark. There are only three or so other such species. I also understand that they are extinct outside of this vessel. Very few sapiens have ever had the chance to face one in battle.”

“Professor? Are you saying what I think you are?”

She shrugged, “You can think whatever you’d like. Look, you still have a lot to learn here. High ranking members put in a lot of work, it's only right that we get some special privileges to compensate us. It's all about trade-offs. You remember the lessons about utilitarianism.” 

I nodded. I did not ask much more. Clearly this was a test of ethics. A final requirement to pass her class, one I thought I was finished with already. I would report the ethical concern to my supervisors and they would congratulate me on catching the error. In a few days Professor Web would be congratulating me on passing her last test.

 Yet, when I reported this conversion to my supervisors later that day, they simply gave me permission to take Professor Web on a visit into Habitat 45. I reiterated what her implied reason for visit was, and they reiterated that she was to be allowed in. I then messaged her and we arranged a day and time to visit. She mentioned that it may take several days inside the habitat to hunt down what she was after, and she said that she would speak to my team so that my absence was excused. 

A few days later, the Professor met me at the main gate to the habitat. We would have to pass through an airlock chamber to enter it. The humidity in the Habitat was kept at an exceptionally high level. As we entered, water quickly condensed on the fur around my legs and arms. The door closed quickly behind us the moment our feet left the hard metal of the airlock and touched the soft ground of the Habitat.

“Well,” the Professor said, “better get to it.” I started to pull out a drone from one of the bags I was carrying, but the Web continued, “let’s hold off on any drones for right now. Those feeds are live streamed back to the Data Center. I want to keep this excursion private.”

I looked at her sharply. Just how far was she going to test my ethical strength? What more was I supposed to do? I couldn’t understand it. The humans had gone through so much trouble to teach the other sapients to value life, now she wanted to hunt a nearly extinct creature just for fun? 

We began the walk into the Habitat. It would take several hours of traveling through the thick forest in order to reach the area that Lovoca frequented. It was already the rewarming season, artificially induced of course, so there were many Wanderers scurrying about as we walked. The Professor grabbed them up whenever she could, placing them in a bag to use as bait. Each one she picked up was a reminder of how little she cared for the work I had been doing the last few months. 

 Habitat 45 is about 8 km wide, making Cylinder 3 one of the wider of the main sequence, and has a length of about 250 kilometers. The Lovocas are solitary creatures, and spend most of their adult life fiercely guarding their territory. It was unlikely that any would be so close to the entrance of the Habitat, but I still felt like we were being stalked. There was a presence all around us, like we were being watched by a million eyes. *Stalked* wasn’t the right word. The presence did not seem menacing. It felt like we were in the belly a great beast, but a generally peaceful one. In my lessons I had learned about the old human tale of Jonah and the Whale. I felt very much like the whale as we walked through the blue forest. 

 At around 21 hours ship time, we set up a small tent to camp. In the morning we would be in the territory of some of the youngest beasts. I began to gather some sticks to make a campfire. But then the Professor pulled an electric lamp from her bag so I stopped. 

As we set up the tent and retrieved nutrition packs, Professor Web asked, “Newyos, how are you liking your internship so far?”  
“I am enjoying it,” I said cautiously, “I have been able, of course with the help of my team, to quadruple the number of Lovoca in this Habitat. I see why you humans have gone through so much to protect these species.”  
Web smiled. I was starting to hate human smiles. They seemed so much simpler in the textbooks. “I am glad.”

We sat for a moment in silence, eating our nutrition packs. The sounds of the forest surrounded us. A myriad of alien flying and crawling things all around. In the distance I heard the faintest, morbid screech of a Volan Percher, one of support prey species kept in the Habitat. 

“Do you think that this is a worthy project?” Web asked, breaking the loud silence. 

“Of course,” I replied. 

“Hmph,” she eyed me sternly, “defend it then.”  
“What?” I asked. 

“Defend it. Surely now that you are on the ground, working in the thick of it, you know just how resource intensive this all is? Is the Ark a justifiable use of time and materials? Why don’t we humans instead spend that valuable currency on philanthropic endeavors to enrich the lives of the other sapiens?” 

She was correct of course, the Ark was a vastly expensive project. It was estimated that the whole endeavor cost more than the entire human species net worth when the had launched their first interplanetary mission. Despite how much work the humans had done, they never truly had a closed system. Heat was lost to thermodynamics. The Ark was in need of constant repair from asteroids. It costs energy to move the vessel into the new star ships. Workers had to be paid for their time and expertise. Certain rare and even dangerous elements had to be replenished and processed. 

“It had value in and of itself,” I said confidently. The Professor just looked at me. I continued, “I mean, without all this effort the Lovoca would have gone extinct millions of years ago.” 

“And?” Now I stared at her. “Species go extinct all the time. It's natural.”

Just then the Volvan Percher I had heard early swooped through the camp. It was a small avian creature. It had a long, crescent beek. It had a coat of feathers, beautiful greens and yellows. When it moved the colors seemed almost to blend together, camouflaging it into the surrounding sapphire trees. It perched, as its name predicted, on a branch just outside the light of the lamp. I stared at it for a moment. 

“That is why I think the Ark is important,” I said, “We are using all of these resources to protect the Lovoca, but in the process we also protect an entire ecosystem. The Percher is also extinct in the wild. This ship preserves something that has been lost, something more than just one species. In the pursuit of a singular goal, we who work on the Ark create axillary effects that benefit the whole galaxy.” 

We sat in silence for the rest of the evening. In the morning we put up our tents and continued the trek. The Professor had said that she wanted to go into the territory of the eldest Lovoca. She was a larger being, scared from countless battles. Her territory was centered in the thickest part of the forest. 

As we reached the edge of the domain, the trees began to tighten around us. The Lovoca of course were able to scurry along well known breaks, but I was not familiar with this section of the Habitat. We would have to cut our way through a part of the forest. I removed three machetes from one of my bags and began to hack away at the thick, blue limbs. As I was, I looked back and saw the Professor wince at each of my swings. What was her problem? She had no issue killing a Lovoca, not even an issue with capturing the Wanderers to use as a trap. But now she was getting hung up on some trees? *Humans may just be beyond my comprehension*, I thought. 

As we went further and further, the Professor finally brought out her rifle from one of her bags. It was a long, slender weapon. They were banned aboard the Ark for all but a select few security details. How she had managed to get one, I didn’t want to ask. 

“Just for protection,” she said. Oh, so that was how she would justify it to the other Ethics Council members? A thinly veiled claim of self defense. We will see about that. 

We reached a clearing. Red light from above, simulating the light of Betelgeuse, came crashing through blue trees. Some spots in the forest even looked purple, like large bruises on skin. The Professor set the bag of Wanderers down on the ground in the middle of the clearing. She directed me to clear a spot in the surrounding forest and arrange foliage so that we would be hidden from the Lovoca when it approached the bait. She even cut up some of the Wanderers so that the foul scent of their guts would attract the predator. 

We waited in the small hideout I had cleared for several hours. It was beginning to get dark, the red sky turning darker and darker by the minute. I was about to tell the Professor that we should call it, when suddenly a branch snapped on the other side of the clearing. Then the sound of six strong  mandibles breaking into the exoskeletons of the Wanderers. The Professor took aim through a small hole in the foliage. 

The Lovoca appeared, head first, into the clearing. Its long, white claws and mirage of green feathers raced from the edge of the clearing to the second bag of snacks, about 5 meters total, in just a few seconds. I closed three of my eyes, leaving one peaking open just in case. I felt my two hearts contract in anticipation for the explosion of the rifle. But it never came. 

The professor had a hold of my third arm, pulling me back further into the hideout. She was whispering to me, “Okay, while the Lovoca is distracted, let's get to the center of the forest.” She pointed and urged me to continue hacking away. I pulled out my other two machetes, I had kept one in hand to use just in case I was attacked, and began to make a path through the trees. Every few minutes Web would say, “go slightly left”, then “okay now just a bit to the right.” 

After about half an hour Professor Web finally had us stop. I turned around to see that she had pulled out a small device that showed a tracking icon. “Okay, look for a data beacon.” I began to search around the small area. There were beacons throughout the Habitat that collected data on the organisms. Why had she wanted this one in particular? 

After a few minutes I said, “Over here.” And she came over to where I was standing. Mostly it looked like an ordinary beacon, if a decrepit one. But then I noticed that its antinea had a large red cap on the top. That was unusual. 

“There we go!” the Professor exclaimed, “I knew they were hiding something.”

“What do you mean?” I asked quietly. The Lovoca would be through the bag of treats by now. 

“They have been using the Azulmadera forest to off-set the cost of computing.”  
“What are you talking about?”  
“The forest. It is one big, sentient organism. In the egg and Wanderer stage I don’t think that they are sentient. But the roots all intertwine with each other and form a giant nervous system. On the edges of the forest it appears no more complex than a simple nervous structure. But here, in the densest part of the trees, there is evidence of a much more complicated organism. Something analogous to a brain.”

Just then the Lovoca crashed through some nearby trees. The Professor swung around quickly but not before being knocked to the ground. I saw her lift her rifle but when the pulled the trigger the barrel exploded. I had created a blockage in the gun the night before, intent on protecting the Lovoca. Dark gray powder filled the space between the Professor and Lovoca. The giant beast reared back as soot went into its eyes and the breathing holes on its neck.

For a few moments it seemed that the Lovoca would give up, but then it turned back towards the professor, who was still on the ground trying to wipe the dirt from her eyes. As the beast raised a large claw  to swing down on the Professor's neck, I rammed two of my machetes into it. The thing cried out in pain and stumbled back. It collapsed a moment later. I finished it off with another blow, careful to avoid the still jittering claw-tipped toes. 

After making sure the Professor was okay, I removed the red cap from the data beacon. The Professor had been cut, not critically but it was bad enough that I was concerned. I messaged for an emergency aircraft to come and pick us up. Within an hour we were onboard, heading back to civilization. 

The data uncovered by the Professor led to the arrest of several high ranking members of the Ethics Council. They had been using the forest in Habitat 45 as a giant computer. Freed from the burdens of human-directed computation, the forest began to communicate with other sapients aboard the Ark. Its language had long since been discovered and translated, but it had been covered up to keep other Ark citizens from knowing that certain Council members had been enslaving it. 

Upon this discovery, humans also banned the commercial manufacture and trade of Azulmadera wood in their controlled regions. Most other sapient species followed suit. The ones that didn’t were ostracized until the whole galaxy had recognized the Volan Azulmadera as a sapien species, worthy of protection and rights.  

During the whole thing I testified this account to various governments around the galaxy. I soon became famous both on and off the Ark as a prominent protector of the species. Professor Web was not upset that I had nearly killed her, she in fact congratulated me on trying to protect the Loco. Elections for the Ethics Council came up in the months after, and I was chosen as the first non-human to serve on the board. "

So, pandemic begins in March and sends me home from college early. Having been only a freshman in the engineering field, my internship writes me a ""courtesy"" email informing me that my position waiting for me over the summer no longer exists. Valid. They probably laid off full-time staff as a result of the pandemic, like many places did to maintain profits, so I couldn't be too upset. After being home for a few weeks and doing some number crunching, I realized that I really needed a summer job to maintain being on track to return to college financially. One trip to the gas station/party store in my rural town, and I saw the ""NOW HIRING, $10/HR"". I applied and was hired within 15 minutes. The only operative I was interviewing with was that I didn't want to work any overtime. My manager informed me she would honor this. 

As soon as I was hired, I realized I was entering a very toxic work culture. For starters, my manager who hired/supervised asked me to ""don't mind the longer tenured people"" as they still made our state's minimum wage ($8.65) despite advertising the $10/hr that I was given. From my first day, I was treated very poorly by my coworkers, though I did not blame them as they were no doubt being shafted. Within my first two weeks, I was already beginning to feel disenfranchised with all the happenings. The building was gross, the bathrooms were moldy, and the kitchen surely wasn't up tp health code. We were constantly ripping of customers as well, my boss once encouraged me to move spoiled milk we had in stock to the front of the cooler in an effort to move the product rather than cut losses. The whole thing made me feel so disgusting, but I had no choice but to keep chugging along as someone who lived within walking distance and without a car. 

Things only worsened later into the summer. Hired in April, I had my one condition broken by the first week of June as I was asked to work overtime. During my first overtime shift, I took my 10 minute break (we were allotted two 10 minute breaks during an 8 hour shift, and another break for every 2 hours of overtime) and was asked to ""be a team player and come back in to help"" after 3 minutes. I never should have but I was a pushover and was only thinking of how much I needed the money. This then started a trend of never getting my full break whenever I was supposed to be given one. 

As the summer progressed, my manager began hiring again and a former classmate of mine from high school joined on (despite me telling him it was the worst idea). However, upon his hiring, he showed me that on his paystub he was making $15/hr(!!!!!!). Soon this trickled down the ladder at work and many of the ""original"" crew who was there since before me and were making $8.65 were not at all happy to learn that someone on staff was making nearly double what they were making. Just a nightmare in terms of justified toxicity and attitudes during the remaining days of work I had. 

If I had the work experience(s) or views I have now I most certainly wouldn't have worked a day after my first, but unfortunately I was just so desperate to be able to get money for college at the only place in my tiny midwest town that was hiring. 

My breaking point occurred when I was slated for a 55 hour work week, but then after my first day my grandfather who lived with us passed away. I decided to be professional and call work to let them know that I would be quitting to focus on myself before heading back to school. This got me a very verbose rant from my manager, calling me entitled and accusing me of being weak and feeble, even admitting that she hated my antics all summer (I wore a mask in a very covid-denying area). She even had the audacity to end the berating call with ""So, I'll see you tomorrow?"". 

With each passing year of hindsight I can't believe I put myself through all this for just a few grand..."

Is it really true that after data structure and algorithm classes, one can pass the technical interview?

I see some commonality between successful alumni in this reddit, and they have been studying leetcode on their own. Once they complete these two courses, companies are hiring them.

Perhaps, this additional self-study plus already having some career (albeit in different field) allows them to be hired?

I am starting this degree Winter23, and wondering I will be able to apply to full-time job around next year before graduating."

I am going for data analyst roles as well as various business roles. Yall have been helpful in making me see things differently than I was before. I'm coming from computer science, I have worked with a variety of coding-tools and am proficient in python. I don't know how to go about communicating everything over on my resume.

Should I just say: ""Python"" alone? or list out the libraries like (numpy, pandas, seaborn, etc.)?

I've worked with numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, pyspark, MRjob, scikit learn, xgboost, etc. and much more not related to data analysis. I'm leaving out the unrelated ones, but I'm not sure which ones I should highlight for this or if I should highlight those at all?

Same with SQL, I've worked with multiple flavors both RDBMS and not, such as other solutions like mongodb. Do I list all of them out?

Also, on the note of 'proficiency', having worked with something before vs being proficient in it are two different things I feel. I understand there's ATS word checker software out there looking for buzzwords, but I also don't want to misrepresent myself.

How did yall get around this as a job seeking new grad?

Just reiterating, this is me just getting a role somewhere on the business side, if I get lucky and it's data analyst, great. But if not, that's great too. The skills will be helpful no matter what. For 'other business' im thinking marketing / sales side. I need more practice communicating to people, not computers haha. I don't care about failure / rejection, I will keep going no matter what. 

More about me, I didn't have any internships, graduated with a 3.5 gpa. I have a lot of projects exploring data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, among other projects. Programming is a hobby of mine, I'm not worried about losing the skill, i'll practice frequently no matter what. I'm fixing to make multiple resume versions for the different roles I apply to, but this would be helpful to know either way. Thanks for reading this lmk.

For context, my grades were the following: 61a A-, 61b A-, 70 C. My cumulative GPA as a result is a 3.13, missing the 3.30 requirement. I am preparing for the appeal process and would like advice on how to approach writing my appeal letter and how to use my resources. I believe I do have a valid extreme circumstance, and I also believe I can contribute a lot to the CS department as CS is something that I am passionate about. With regards to my extreme circumstance, I was diagnosed in July with a mental health disorder that I don’t want to name because of the stigma. As a result, I went into treatment with some medications that have heavy side effects as well as needing to take lots of time to go to the doctor each week, as well as dealing with the actual symptoms of the disorder. I have good documentation for this, but I am aware that the review board may not see it as extreme. I also will not deny that I could have done better, I definitely had my part in this and that I will not throw everything on my illness. As far as what I can contribute, I was an academic intern in Fall 2022 for 61a, which I greatly enjoyed. Furthermore, I worked as a software development intern at Amazon during summer 2022, from which I hope to get a rec. letter. I know I am capable of succeeding in CS, but I will not deny that this semester has been difficult. All being said, I only have 3000 characters for my appeal letter, and would like any advice. Thank you! 

Tl;dr: 3.13 gpa for a 3.3 gpa requirement, have valid mental heath reasons (I think) and also believe I can contribute to CS community. Please help because I really want to get in!"

I want to quit before I start because I'm so scared I'll show up and look like a buffoon. It feels like they have these high expectations of me since I'm a junior &amp; are constantly using terminology I'm not familiar with and have to google. They gave me some resources to study and I've been googling different concepts for the past 3 hours just to get a decent understanding of it, but there's soo many concepts that my university courses haven't touched at all.

So I had applied for CBRE’s finance internship this summer. And I received a phone call/offer letter congratulating me for being accepted into the position. I signed the offer letter on 01/03/23 and since then I have been making living and work arrangements to accommodate this position.

Earlier today, I received a phone call from the recruiter saying that CBRE made an error in sending the offer letter to me (mind you it has my first/last name, email address, and address) and that my original offer had to be rescinded. That it was meant to be sent to another individual.

And now I’m feeling totally bummed. I had already told all my friends, family, and partner how excited I was to take part in this position (even posted it on LinkedIn). But it’s been really hard for me to keep a smile on my face ever since the “rescind” phone call.

With this, I’m hoping for any insight or advice as to what I should do. Any words are greatly appreciated. I honestly just really wanted to vent.

I originally studied Hospitality management and obtained my degree, but have decided to change my career towards something I am more passionate about which is branding/marketing specifically within the sports industry.

Two years ago I moved to Dubai to work in one of the cities most luxurious hotel's. Given the nature of my position in the hotel, some luck and handwork I have been able to save quite a good sum of money. As for right now I have about 30,000 euros and expect that to be around 40k to 50k in the next months. All of it in savings.

My original plan when coming to Dubai was to save enough money to pay for a master degree in sports marketing (20k) and from there start my career in what I want to do. During this time I also did an online master in marketing (ThePowerMBA) and have been working on personal projects related to marketing and sports on my personal time. This projects specially have proven to be what gives me the most satisfaction and peace. They combine the two things I like most: sports and creative work.

Now that my time in Dubai is coming to an end and the moment to move back to Spain and do as my plan originally intended, I have doubts. I have to add that during this time I have also helped my family through a financial struggle. Even if things are calmer now, I still feel slightly guilty of paying that amount of money for a master or anything else really.

The question now is: Should I follow through the ""right"" path and pay for the master degrees (20k) as it will bring me contacts, guaranteed internships and better insight of the industry? Or should I perhaps use that money to develop my skills in content creation by traveling the world, buying new materials (drones, cameras, etc), joining classes, volunteering in sports programs?

Just to add a few things. Before anything I will speak with my family to have a better understanding of the financial situation and see what is really needed. As for now my content creation is good in the sense of ideas, but the quality of the work can be brought to a higher level for sure. I will also be using the additional money to invest in a long term plan to take care of my future as well as having money on the side for emergencies and stuff.

If it changes anything, I am 24 years old and come from Spain. I would ideally love to work either for sports associations (Premier League, MLS, La liga, etc) or companies such as Nike or Adidas. 

I appreciate any advice or insights you might be able to provide me with.

Thank you"

I’ve been browsing on Google, LinkedIn and Indeed for internships and I personally don’t feel fully qualified for any after only one semester at JMSB. Part of it is that I’m probably lacking confidence/underestimating myself and am scared to begin the process due to my lack of experience/knowledge, so I really don’t know where or how to begin. 

First, are there resources offered by the school clubs? (I wasn’t very involved first semester and am now feeling quite out of the loop) Are there any online groups at JMSB that share work/networking opportunities?

Second, should I still apply if I only meet 60-80% of the requirements? 

Ex: A few posts that I’ve seen require G-suite, Adobe, Photoshop,ect. 

* I use the G-suite regularly
* Barely ever used Adobe
* Basic understanding of Photoshop (need refreshing) 

Third, after 1st year is it possible to apply for COOP and is it worth it? 

If anyone has any recommendations as to where to look or how to start, it would really be appreciated. I’m really PANICKING, my first year isn’t even done and I feel like I’m falling behind and feeling so lost.

105bb3x,2,2023-01-06,How do I politely reject return internship offer?,Al00Keema,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/105bb3x/how_do_i_politely_reject_return_internship_offer/,"Hello everyone, Im a junior in CS and I worked as a software engineering intern at a large automotive supplier during Summer '22. Today my former manager reached out asking if I would like come back this summer. While i'd love to, i got a software engineering internship at one of the ""big 3"" automakers which I'm really excited about because I want to work in the automotive industry. How do i politely reject my managers offer while still keeping the door open for the future  opportunities?"
105bgbj,7,2023-01-06,Pursing Data Engineering as a Computer Science Student,hcazj,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/105bgbj/pursing_data_engineering_as_a_computer_science/,"Hi all,

I am currently a computer science major about to go into my upper division classes next year and I recently came across this subreddit/topic this weekend. I currently do not know where I want to go with my degree atm; I was thinking backend dev/engineer but now as I learn more about this field I feel like this is something I would be interested going in too. Do you guys think  it's a good idea to pursue this field out of the gate or should I get familiar with more fields or topics before going into this. I've read it's common for people to go into data engineering after they've already started their career. My immediate goal is to secure a summer internship and I've noticed a lot of the internships in my area ask for more developer skills like: react, express, javascript, HTML...

Honestly I have just been overwhelming myself over this winter break obsessing about the future and I have been to impatient on trying to learn one thing at a time.

EDIT: Thank you guys for all the replies! I did not expect this many and I really appreciate it. I think I understand what I want to do in more detail now thanks to your advice. I've still got a few years before I graduate and find more things I think I'll just focus on school for now and try to sneak in some data electives and projects in while I'm going :)."

I’ve been on the grind applying for jobs since I graduated and accepted a job offer for a junior sql developer role. Compensation is 55k per year, which seems a bit too low comparing with levels.fyi.

My dream is to work at one of the Big Techs, so here are my current plans:
- the master of science in computer science for my previous university starts in March, but I haven’t applied yet
- I’m thinking of working as a junior sql developer to gain “real world experience” while studying for my masters
- while applying, I worked on some projects and looked into freelancing
- during my time in the masters, I’m thinking of an internship, but the offer letter stipulates that I can’t be working for another company

I have applied to many Big Tech and other companies, but either the application status still says pending, I’ve been ghosted, or I don’t hear back from recruiters. I don’t think my resume is an issue as I did get around 10 interviews over the course of these 6 months.

I also want to preface this by saying: I am the bad guy in this story. I was a creep. I fucked up. I did real damage to people. Through a lot of introspection and therapy over the last several years, I have made a lot of really positive changes in my life and in the way I approach people, but none of that undoes the damage that I did before. And now I have this new role at my new company and don't know how to do all the ethical calculus. The backstory is long, I'm sorry about that.

Okay here we go.

In my 20s, I worked at a community center doing programing and mentorship aimed at teenagers and young adults to help them plug into their community, learn life skills, prepare for adulthood, etc. I loved the job. I was good at it, I had a good relationship with the other employees and my bosses, and I had a great relationship with just about all of the teens and young adults that I worked with.

When I was 30, I decided that I wanted to pursue a different career path which required me to go back to school. I gave the center about 6 months of notice before I left. During that six months, I tried to set up a transition plan for the next person so that things would continue to run smoothly after I left. It was all going very well.

But also, and problematically, I also decided that since I was no longer going to be in a mentorship type role, that I might be able to transition from a mentor role into more of a friendship role with some of the young adults I got along with the best. It was a time in my life where I had very few friends outside of the center, and I foolishly believed that these mentor-mentee relationships could function as friendships. Nevermind the fact that I was 30 and these young adults were in their late teens (18-19) and early 20s . I thought it was fine (it was very much not fine).

There were five of these former mentees with whom I maintained regular contact after leaving the job. 2 young men and 3 young women, all college-aged students or older. For the young men and one of the women, those relationships stayed just casual and friendly, but with two of the young women, I allowed myself to get a little flirty in conversations with them, and eventually the conversations became fairly sexually charged. Throughout all of these conversations, I did not pursue a romantic or physical relationship with either of the women, but I did steer conversations into sexual topics. Not explicitly about things we might do together or anything and there were no pictures or anything sent, but we talked about previous partners, preferences, etc. At the time I rationalized this in my head as being perfectly acceptable, because after all, I was no longer in a mentor role and we were all consenting adults, so these were just fun conversations.

In hindsight, I recognize now that what I perceived as being fun banter between adults on equal footing, they thought of as being an uncomfortable sexualization of a mentor-mentee relationship. And they didn't know how to say no, so they basically just played along with it. And to be clear - that's exactly what it was. I was creepy. I only knew these people because of my position at the community center, and so even though I wasn't trying to be manipulative or abusive, I did abuse my authority and manipulate my position in order to even have the opportunity for this kind of relationship. 

Over the course of about a year, our conversations pretty much died out and everybody moved on. A few months after the last time I'd talked to either of them, my previous boss at the center called me and said he was very concerned because one of my former mentees had called him and told him that she had been made very uncomfortable by our conversations and hadn't known how to handle it. She'd wrestled with it for several months before deciding she needed to tell someone at the center, especially in the event that there may be other women with similar experiences. The center hired a lawyer and ran a whole investigation, including talking to all of my former mentees from my entire time there. The investigation uncovered nothing other than these two young women, with whom I'd only ever had these conversations, and only as adults, and none of which involved explicit sexual propositioning. The lawyer they hired told them that there wasn't really a legal case against me, but they did write me a letter basically telling me that I was no longer welcome to ever come back and visit, that all of my previous mentees are now aware of the results of the investigation, and that  I should never attempt to contact the young women again in any way.

I was horrifically embarrassed that I had spent almost a decade working in this community center, developing a great relationship with a lot of people, being a positive role model in people's lives and now all of it was tainted because of these conversations. I started therapy, which was a good choice and helped me to process through the ways I had abused my authority, had damaged everyone I had worked with before (especially the two young women). I resisted the word ""abuse"" for a long time, but that's what it was.

Over the last several years, I think I've made a lot of really positive changes in myself. My therapist has helped me recognize exactly what tendencies led me to make this series of horrible choices, I've changed a lot in the way I approach relationships with women in general.  I'm married now (my spouse knows about all of this), and I have female friends with whom I have very healthy friendships. And I have a much clearer understanding of how authority functions in relationships. I wish I could contact the two young women and apologize to them, but I also recognize how that could potentially set back their own healing process, so I just have to live with the fact that I have hurt these people and this community.

It was 5 ago now and I still think about it every day. I still go through periods of hating myself for this, and I think I probably will for the rest of my life. But like I said, I think I've made a lot of positive changes. And generally, I'm not the same person anymore. 

But now my new company wants to put me in charge of the interns and new-hires in my office. And like, honestly I would be really good at it. It's right up my alley. It lets me combine parts of my new job (which I love - lots of research, which I think is fun) and my old job (helping other people learn to be successful). And I really do 100% believe that I am fundamentally a different person now than I was when I abused my authority in my previous position. I'm much more attuned to how authoritative positions function now. But also like... I already fucked this up so badly once, there's part of me that thinks it might just be safer and better to never be in any kind of leadership position ever again.

I haven't told anyone in my company about any of this, because frankly, I'm embarrassed that I was a person who acted in that way. I'm also terrified that if I say, ""No sorry, I can't be in charge of the interns because last time I had authority, I abused that authority and also sexually harassed two people."" that I'll lose this job altogether, which I can't afford to do. My spouse says she thinks I should take on the role because she believes the person I am now would never do what I did then, and I want to believe her, but there's a part of me that also feels like I don't deserve to be able to move on like this into another position of authority when I fucked it up so bad last time.

So... What should I do? How should I approach this? Is this the kind of thing I can be rehabilitated from or do I show my ""rehabilitation"" by rejecting any authoritative position?"

But what do you ""code every day"" if you don't yet have a job on Software Development? Should I just repeat my website assignments? Is there an internship I can take on?

Should I tell him that I don’t have much experience? Should I keep applying to jobs even though I don’t have much experience with technology such as those listed above? Or should I work on getting those experience first before I apply? I’m a college sophomore studying cs looking to get an internship this summer.

I have previously done 2 internships in data science, and have a job offer for a junior data scientist role in London.

I was wondering what are the usual exit paths for data scientist. While I enjoy the job right now as it's great way to upskill technically and explore interesting data , I'm not sure if I see myself in the industry for the next 10 years. I feel the pay atleast in the UK is dog shit compared to work you do. 

Anyone transitioned to other roles what path did you take? I have to think about applying to different sectors if the exit opportunities are narrow.People in the industry for a long time does the work get dry?

Any advice is appreciated.

105p0yb,1,2023-01-07,Gap and other college resume advice,GravitysFallen,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/105p0yb/gap_and_other_college_resume_advice/,"Directly after college, I had troubles finding a job, went through 1 interview process that lasted 5 months with over 7 interviews and in the last interview fked up pretty bad (my fault), then directly after went through an interview process lasting 4 1/2 months and lost the job to someone who had done an internship with that company, including the time between finding the first and then finding the second I racked up about an entire year where I was unemployed. 

After that got a job that I could not stomach to go to, so I found a new job that I’ve now been at for 8 months, but the job itself is extremely dangerous and I would much rather have a safer job that’s easier on my body. 

Part of my question is do I not put a graduation date on my resume, so they maybe don’t see the gap or do I leave it out there point blank and just explain what happened. 

Next question, I’m looking for jobs currently in  the same field I’m in, except in an office instead, as well as jobs outside of the field I’m in that relate closer to my major, so even though I’ve been out of college for 2 years now, does it still make sense for me to put something like: 

Relevant coursework: programmable logic controllers 101  (not actual class name, but just an example) 

After reading advice, I will be posting my resume here once I go over it completely, but I still need to take a closer look at the resume guide on this sub before filling rewriting it"

I have been trying hard but to no avail. This has left me without any industry experience of any kind at the age of 26. 

I have decided to get into the mainstream IT industry with the advent of new year and have started giving time to DSA and learning python. I am barebones in terms of programming experience besides a project at my 2nd year internship on exoplanets which required basic python with a sprinkle of arrays, matplotlib and curve fitting. But it isn’t open source to showcase it anyone. I have no other experience whatsoever. 

What should be my approach to look for jobs (i have started on geekforgeeks and with time will switch to leetcode and neetcode problem sets) and how difficult it would be to get one after a massive gap of 4-5 years as a fresher in the industry?

Should i continue with python and learn django or switch to java and its web development tools?"

I've passed 10th and I'm currently preparing for my 12th boards exam 2023 (UP Board) and I've chosen BCA since I wish to go in the IT sector. I'm currently puzzled on should I go to a regular college or IGNOU.

I've read some articles about this and I'm not sure if I'm making the right choice. Some are saying it's not good with IGNOU and you'll face problems &amp; stuff.

Since I'm not financially stable, I can't go to a high tier college.

\-Is it worth it going to a regular college ?  
\-Is it okay to go ahead with IGNOU ? If not, why ?  
\-Will I face problems with getting a job after BCA from IGNOU?

I'm thinking of working a year or two after BCA and then go ahead with MCA from a tier 1 college.

What are your views on this and what should I do ? Please give me some advice.

**Edit:**

Thanks for the reply guys really appreciate it.After reading your replies and thinking about it, more questions arose in my mind and I hope you can clear my doubts and questions as well.

\-While doing BCA from a regular college, will I have time to learn a coding language ?  
\-In my 3rd year how can I get internship if I were to get admitted in a regular college or IGNOU ?  
\-Any tips I should give attention to while going to a regular college and doing BCA ?

**Edit 2:**

Again, Thanks for answering my question everyone. That helped me a lot and I've decided to give an entrance exams to get into a regular college and as for IGNOU, it will be my back up plan.

Feel free to give any advice that you think will be necessary or important for the future !

The issue is, my resume is quite weak as I have mainly focused on leetcoding over the summer to get this internship and just got lucky to get past the resume screen. My background is variable, I was studying medical sciences for two years and then was trying to break into finance and did a private equity internship, but that’s it. This background actually helped me during my interview because my interviewer was very interested in how I went from pursuing medicine to cs, but that’s about all the value it has. 

I have a single project on my resume that I built myself with react, and the other 3 are all small cs projects from my first year cs classes and are thus very weak and small. My resume otherwise is just my experience in retail and my private equity internship, and my GPA is strong (3.9).

Should I be focusing on building projects this semester until the summer comes around and new graduate application cycles begin? Or should I put lots of my time into leetcode and system design to prepare for the interview more because i’ll have a good internship on my resume? I just want to ensure i’m prepared to apply for jobs so that I don’t have to count on a return offer in this economy.

105y8af,2,2023-01-07,Toxic work environment or am I just impatient?,BansheeSlays,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105y8af/toxic_work_environment_or_am_i_just_impatient/,"I’m a 24 year old, looking for some honest advice on whether I’m in a toxic work environment or I’m just making things up in my head. Sorry this might be a little long, but I want to get some outside advice for my situation.

I work in the film industry and I started as a post-graduate intern in January of last year for a smaller film company in my area. While my location isn’t as large or supported as Los Angeles, New York, or Atlanta, we have a tight-knit community and the company I work for is renowned for non-union workplaces in my town.

During my time as a non-paid intern, the company got onto a commercial project with a very well-known name in the industry. Up until this point, this was probably their biggest client in the history of the company. Given the important nature of this project, they signed me on as an independent contractor for any time I spent in the office outside of my eight required internship hours. While the work I did for the project was very minor, mainly organizational stuff, I was pretty stoked to have my first big film project after graduation which actually paid me what I consider to be the minimum wage these days (think entry-level base wages from Target, Best Buy, Costco, etc). For the rest of the five months of my internship, I spent about 15-23 hours as a contractor outside of my internship hours, so I was working approximately 23-31 hours total per week. Along with this big project, I got trained on their workflow for different aspects of their commercial projects, got tapped into some major organizational things, and even spearheaded some very minor projects.

After my internship had ended, they kept me on as an independent contractor for the next three months where I worked off and on whenever they needed me. I had a discussion with my supervisor about them potentially hiring me full-time and they said that wasn’t in their cards for the time being. While I was disappointed, I accepted it and understood since I was still early on in my career. When I was an independent contractor there were multiple times where they would call me at the last minute, with up to 24 or less hours in advance. I put my life on hold in most cases to try and build a relationship with the company to potentially get hired. During this time, there were multiple other people, some interns I worked with who got hired shortly after for their specific departments but my department was never ready to hire anyone even though they constantly needed the help.

In September, I was approached about becoming a seasonal part-time hire where I worked 30 hours a week with a dollar raise. I accepted the position and was quickly trained on some programs for their biggest project they have ever worked on. I learned the workflow in about 2 weeks (programs that I had never used before) and was put onto a project which required me to work about 50 hours a week, mostly overnight for about a month. Shortly after, I went back to my “30 hours” and was asked to lead a group of contractors and be the head assistant for another important commercial project. However they did not have infrastructure or help in my department, so I worked 35-40 hours a week with no benefits to help guide this project to the finish line. My supervisor has said to me multiple times after these two huge projects that I have been incredible and have been doing everything right, but he unfortunately can’t hire me because the company owners don’t want to spend the money to get me on-board.

I was frustrated, but gave them a second (probably third) chance when they extended my seasonal part-time position into this new year. The owners said that I have been doing great and they have been impressed with me, but there is not a full-time position available. I am tightly intertwined into the company’s business and culture, I send professional emails on behalf of the company to high-end clients and represent them with the highest standards that I can, and am talked to within the company like I am apart of the long-term future of the team; yet there’s been no long-term commitment from them towards me. My contract ends in the next two months and there’s a possibility I might be unemployed (again) during my time with them. When my contract ends, I would have been a “seasonal part-time” for 6 months and 20 days and I would have worked as a paid employee/contractor for 14 months.

I love the team I directly work with in my department, the rest of the company is really nice to me and appreciates my help, and I’ve bought into the long-term growth and culture of this company for over a year now; but I’m just not sure how much I can handle the constant disappointment of not being in their future goals or how patient I need to be. They have the money to spend on other aspects of the company, but my department is always considered as an afterthought, where any problems are easily fixed by the small team they have which works tirelessly to make ends meet. My department constantly says they need help, but the owners never listen. I just want to be paid what I believe I deserve (I'm getting paid under half the national average for my position) and I have no benefits. Is this a toxic work environment and should I finally move onto something else or is this all in my head and I’m too emotionally attached to the situation?"

10639i9,3,2023-01-07,What is Bloomberg Like for Software Engineering?,Intrepid_Ad_6612,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10639i9/what_is_bloomberg_like_for_software_engineering/,"Hello all. I'm a junior in college and am considering taking a software engineering internship position at Bloomberg (NYC) for this coming summer. I'm grateful to have this opportunity, but I also want to make sure that taking this offer would be a good move for me when considering my future full time software engineering career, especially because Bloomberg likes to convert many of their interns to full time employees. I've heard mixed things about Bloomberg's software engineering reputation, and I'd love to hear some insights from anyone who may be able to provide that. Here's what I believe (based on things I've read) is some of the good and bad about software engineering at Bloomberg:

**Good:**

* Well known company with a ""big"" name, good to have on resume for future opportunities
* Large, well run internship program and company in general, stable organization
* Opportunity to work on a product (Bloomberg terminal) that has a large impact, which would be cool
* Very good pay and benefits
* NYC is a great city, although that is more personal preference

**Bad:**

* Have heard that Bloomberg uses lots of proprietary and outdated technologies, which may mean I wouldn't be learning as much as I would at another company and may find it hard to switch jobs. This is my main concern
* Have heard that there's lots of legacy code, meaning I could be doing boring work involving maintaining that
* I'm not too interested in the finance world, and I imagine a lot of the engineering is based around their financial products

My alternative to working at Bloomberg is to accept a position at a smaller software company (\~150 employees) which seems to have a lot of potential and is based in Palo Alto. Due to the fact that many interns end up working full time at the company they intern at, the decision between these two companies feels pretty significant. I don't know if some of my concerns about Bloomberg (older tech, lots of legacy code) are overblown or if they're accurate, and there really is no way for me to know besides by working there, so I would appreciate any insights or advice that anybody can offer. Thank you!"
1063o2v,0,2023-01-07,Was negotiating the right move? Still waiting,IGNGenerator,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1063o2v/was_negotiating_the_right_move_still_waiting/,"I am a freshman CS major and received an internship offer last week at a relatively well-known (not FAANG level or anything like that but household name) company. The offer was for $25/hr which for me sounded a bit low. The recruiter told me to decide by Monday over the phone, which I agreed to without mentioning my thoughts.

Then, that night (on Wednesday) I sent an email respectively asking for at least $30/hr based on market rate with the places I am interviewing and my past job salary yadayada. She got back to me on Friday night that she would respond to me about the increased rate ""ASAP"" by at least Tuesday.

However, now I am feeling a bit nervous that I didn't immediately take the offer as I don't currently have other internship offers (though I have some backup plans). Was it wrong for me to try to negotiate? I don't think taking back the negotiations now would be the right move, though I still have the offer documents available to sign.

Thanks Reddit - nervous freshman

EDIT: I think I pushed the freshman thing a bit hard. for more info I have essentially sophomore standing and previous internship experience which gave me the confidence to negotiate. someone with less experience was offered around $30/hr as well. 

EDIT2: sorry for not mentioning earlier but it's not really an internship, but a part-time SWE job.

Final edit: given a raise to $27/hr! So even some freshmen have leverage, though very small lol"

One more semester left. I have done really well in school and I did a project that I'm proud of in the summer between sophomore and junior year that further exposed me to a niche I am interested in. That led to a specialized internship, which then led to me accepting an offer I am very excited for this summer.

Despite this, I still feel pretty sad. Now that my final christmas break is coming to an end, I feel really sad and honestly a little depressed. This is the last time I'll have this much of a break from any kind of grind until I retire in many years. It almost feels like a part of me is dying. At least, one kind of life, my childhood, is finally dead. I hate that.

I'm excited for the job opportunity and all the amazing things I'll accomplish, especially given an impoverished childhood, but I'm afraid of the loneliness and just how consistent my life sounds like it will be after I graduate.

Like, up until now, its all been school. Go to school, have a little bit of free time (almost none in college), have a vacation, return. But now it will be go to job, have free time, repeat. For longer than I have currently been alive. Doing the same thing over and over again scares me. In addition, I don't feel like I have anything to look forward to. With school it was landing a job, and honestly I think the odds are in my favor that I landed the dream first job out of college. But, what now?

Maybe I just need to name my next goal, I'm not sure. But the idea of starting a new life, combined with my childhood and all the awesome shit I've experienced (that I can only experience as a kid) ending honestly terrifies me.

Anyone feel a similar way? It's really getting in my head since I'll never experience a ""christmas break"" again"

My resume has several years in the military, a university internship, two jobs in one year at two different public accounting firms and most recently several months in a governmental agency as an auditor. 

My first job in tax ended after the busy season when I thought it was going really well, I liked the work and the people but apparently some people were dissatisfied with how I did things and complained behind my back to my director and manager. I got feedback that I improved but months later manager calls me into a meeting with HR and says I didn't improve and my employment is being terminated. When the meeting ends I asked what could i do to keep improving and moving forward in my career and he says I need to work on my professional demeanor (looking back there were some times where I said somethings a little off, nothing too crazy or inappropriate but enough to have a conversation about better wordings).

Second job was in risk assurance. I thought I landed my dream job since I had a great experience doing internal audit in an internship at my university but I feel like doing Sarbanes-Oxley compliance ended up being very different than doing IA in a governmental setting so I quit after 5 months. Unlike the last job the whole thing was not going well and the writing was on the wall.

Most recently I did a federal auditor job. A number of bad circumstances affected my performance, namely my health was really bad due to bad Crohn's flare ups and my doctor was taking too long to do something about it, since then I've been prescribed a new medication and have seen an improvement in my symptoms and health. Other stuff I may or may not mention was that my masters degree distracted me and through that masters I've decided I wanted to do corporate finance hence that is what is making me go for FP&amp;A roles which I'm excited about.

How to do you guys recommend handling this? From what I've researched so far some are saying I should consider just being honest if asked. That people are more okay with terminations and that I didn't do much wrong anyway. I still hate the feeling that my resume as it stands screams job hopper and that being honest would mean admitting to two terminations even if they were a result of bad luck."

easy 1500 plus sat when i take it in march

ecs arent great too but mainly interning at ai start up (1 year +) + another minor ""internship"" + mentoring under data scientist with 3 startups for 1 year,  , compsci club (i might make it on the board next year), self taught ML python, did a longitudinal survey as a sophomore, lots of course certifications udemy/edx/coursera, volunteer over weekends. planning to do a summer course at rutgers or any other college nearby for math/compsci. will to shadow a lawyer and research about something related to cs laws (intellectual property theft maybe idk) . pretty sure i was top 5 sophomore year but it was a veeeeeery tiny private school. next year i will be on nhs too (i missed the email this year), idk if it matter but some more dumb clubs chess. unicef. no sports in usa but i played state level soccer back in india as freshman but pretty sure it doesnt matter. have a ton of personal projects and im working on a website portfolio to display. 

lors are going to be excellent because i practically grew up with some of my teachers at old school and they know me really well.

no hooks full pay

pretty sure i have to rely on my essays to carry - still brainstorming but will probably write something about calvin and hobbes

i reallly need to get into rutgers. you have no idea how bad it would be burdening for my immigrant parents to watch me get rejected from a state school. maybe the change in schooling environments had a far more detrimental effect on my grades that i thought it would or its just my school being stingy with grades. around 30 kids go to t30s each year idk if a 1600 population is a lot or little. all people do is talk about grades and tests and i hate it. im not used to a competetive env at all.

i would love advice about what i can start doing as i am willing to spend every waking moment doing it if it helps my case at going to a good college. i have time on my hands but i dont know where to invest it. its not that i hate academics im in classes that dont interest or inspire me i would have loved to be in ap stats and calc but schools said nah. there is not one class that i like except math.

if i cannot go to rutgers i was planning to transfer which could possibly work as it gives me time to work on my application (makes financial sense for my family too) 

i will go to any good school if i get in no matter where on the map, it literally does not matter to me (i cannot name more than 20 states) + old schools were residential so i know i wont get homesick and going to school instate means dinner with my mom every weekend which is nice. 

any comments/advice is welcome please dont hold back this really was more of a high school rant"

*****************



Hello,

Sa situation ko, mas madali kayang maging IT Helpdesk muna para maging Web Developer?

Quick background lang about me. I'm 30-year-old IT undergrad with only 6 months professional/corpo experience (CSR). Over the years, I've tried different ways to earn money without being employed, from data entry freelance jobs to stock trading to buy and sell to crypto and to most recently, small woodworking/cabinet business. 

In an attempt to 'fix' my life or career and have stability, step by step nag balik loob ako sa programming since pandemic starts. From Youtube to Udemy courses until last year, nag enroll sa bootcamp. Okay naman ang experience ko sa bootcamp, I would even say na isa ako sa mga top students based sa mga projects and presentations namin. 

Bumalik ang self-esteem ko kahit papano at nagkaron ng confidence mag enroll ulit at tapusin ang remaining units sa Uni. Pag naging okay ang lahat especially sa capstone, this May ang graduation ko. Although honestly, hindi rin ako ganun ka excited. Bukod sa online, siguro kasi alam ko rin na hindi talaga okay ang record ko sa school, kumbaga matapos na lang.

Puro apply na rin ang ginawa ko sa last quarter ng 2022. Pinalad naman na mabigyan ng offer ng 2 company, both startups. Pinili ko ung isa at dapat mag start na this month, unfortunately, postponed until further notice, so balik apply nanaman. Alam ko malaking factor din ang background ko kaya hirap makakuha ng trabaho.

So ang plan ko is if hindi parin makahanap ng dev role this month, try ko na maghanap muna ng ibang opportunity. Ang iniisp ko is IT Helpdesk/Support since based sa qualifications sa job postings, mas may chance ako. Tapos if ever, try mag apply ng dev role sa same company once may opening? 

Ang isa rin iniisip ko na option is mag apply as Dev Intern, kahit walang allowance, makakuha lang ng exp at chance ma-absorb. 

Ano po sa tingin niyo? 

Salamat."

As far as data science goes, I really only have a basic understanding in R and python with no real idea of how they tie together. For R, one of my classes taught basic stats concepts along with R last quarter. For python I took a class that had me program games like custom battleship, connect 4, and other simple two player games.

I’m a little lost on what I should be doing to gain more experience and ultimately be more competitive as an internship candidate."

A long-distance friend of mine (19F) is planning on getting married to her partner in the coming year. There are a few problems here from a logistics standpoint:


1.) My family does not know I have this friend, and for reasons I won't get into on this post, they would not react well to knowing I have this friend, especially with how long I've known her

2.) This friend lives in Tennessee, and not owning a car, my only options to get down there are by plane, bus, carpooling, or hitchhiking. If I get an internship for the summer, the only viable option would probably reduce to only flying

3.) My family has access to my bank account, meaning it would be nearly impossible to get a plane ticket or purchase anything while I'm down there without them being tipped off, and asking them to leave my account wouldn't make things any easier.

4.) My friend wants me to be her bridesman (if that's the name for such a position), and has said - depaite my protest - that she will postpone the wedding if it means I will be there for it


I know this is a sketchy question to ask advice for, but how do I travel cross-country to attend a wedding for a friend my family doesn't know about, without my family finding out about it?

I havent studied DSA since i took the class 2 years ago. I havent practiced leetcode. Only had one summer internship and it wasnt related. Dont have any github contributions. I am open to any internship entry level job. Ive been applying since the new year started. I am down to work for anyone at this point hopefully they train me bc i fr feel like i know nothing. Just applied to infosys, and Im hoping they accept. the WITCH companies sound like a good idea to me tbh. If there's more like that I am open to hearing about it. I dont even need it to be super related would just like to use my BS in CS in some way even though i have nothing outside of it.

TLDR; any input / someone who was in the same position please say how its going. this thread makes me feel very behind and that i am basically screwed idk. applying to internships and new grad positions gives me anxiety and idc much about pay as long as its maybe at least 45k usd for full time. not in a hurry to make more money than that. would like to get a CS related job/ something office and comfortable and need a bachelors degree"

Common app was about experiences attending underresourced school in india and new england private school and how that spammed my brain with questions about humanity, but on that pursuit i found so many social injustices existed. I was lucky to go through such significant life transformation, but everyone cant, so i talked with folks in my dads rural community, they wanted books, so i got it for them and established a small library. I concluded with a statement saying i dont ponder about oh how id be nothing without the opportunities ive had, but rather work to see how i can use every opportunity i get for something good. and that in the future i seek to collaborate with communtities to solve social injustices through their personalized needs.

I did my bachelor's in physiotherapy and I was interested in nutrition, so I am doing nutrition and biomedicine in TUM. While studying in Tum I studied basics in coding ( python) and some data analysis. Then we took a subject "" computational biology"" which I fell in love with. I searched for the bioinformatics groups in the university and did an internship in one of their chairs and I will do another one, followed by the thesis. 

My question is, do I have a chance to get a job in the bioinformatics field ? Having basically learned for only 2 years including the thesis work. 
Is a Phd out of the question ? 
What should I do to increase my chances in landing a job ?  
Can I get a job as a working student in bioinformatics ? 
What should I study or get better at ? 

Thanks in advance."

I'm 23 and just about to finish my master's (in Computer Science). Usually the next step would be to get a job as a software engineer, and that was my plan during my undergrad, but after having done an internship working as a developer it's dawned on me that I don't think I'm cut out mentally/intellectually for softeng as my career. Truthfully, although I did it for 5 years as my degree I don't think I can keep up with others in the field at a professional level. For example my undergraduate final project was a simple compiler and I found that very challenging, while by contrast it seems common for people younger than me to build full operating systems as pet projects (something that's just totally beyond me, ability-wise).

The problem I have now is that compsci has been both my main hobby and my field of study for all my life, so I don't really have any other interests or skills that aren't compsci-related. 

Are there careers then that are suitable for someone with a compsci master's, but don't actually involve developer work or other tech-related work?"

But I already accepted Yale’s offer of admission :)

Additional Information:

When I set out on my college search, I never planned on applying to ivy leagues. I thought I wasn’t good enough because I didn’t have a perfect SAT score, and I am nowhere near valedictorian. I only applied to Yale because my parents wanted to take me on a tour, and during the tour I thought they had a nice campus and great humanities programs. That’s all. So I applied REA, not expecting anything, and ended up getting in. So, my advice to juniors and underclassmen is that you don’t have to have perfect stats to go to your dream school. It seems like what these prestigious schools want are real, interesting, people who have goals and have plans to achieve them. Believe in yourself!"

I have a 4.0 GPA, I am at an accredited university, and I have applicable and in-depth research experience. Nearly everyone I know in Computer Science or an engineering field has had an internship at this point, many of them more than one. Throughout the past 3 years, I have applied to hundreds of positions, and I have had maybe one or two interviews and no offers.

I always write cover letters when optional or required, I have had my resume critiqued by my university's career center, peers, and contacts from the industry. I have done everything I can to both get experience and relay evidence of this experience while applying. 

I am not saying I want an internship at Apple or Google. I am talking about very attainable internships or jobs at local or regional companies. I nearly always select positions for which I am qualified. I am not applying to positions with multiple required qualifications that I do not meet. 

It hurts so much seeing literally everyone I know but myself have success in the job market, in computer science, in engineering, and in non-STEM fields. I cannot for the life of me figure out what can go this wrong. I have literally had zero success in nearly four years of college. Now, my peers all have valuable job experience, which I have tried to match with my research experience, but clearly to no avail.

Hey all! I wrapped my NG job hunt during these crazy times and I wanted to share my experience.

**applications**: 119, used [this](https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023) Github repo to find all my jobs.

**prep**: blind 75, neetcode, and company specific questions w/ lc premium

**background**: cs undergrad @ purdue, 3 internships (2x JPMC, 1x Textron), teaching assistant, 3.8 GPA

I added a video [here](https://youtu.be/tz-3Ho29yN8) for those that don't want to read (mods lmk if this isn't allowed and I'll remove it).

**applied/ghost (51/119):**

Nothing much to talk about other than rip me thinking I had a chance to pass the resume screen for some of these companies. Some of the notable companies that I haven’t heard back from are Databricks, Google, Apple, Datadog, Netflix, Uber, Twitter (ty for ghosting me Elon in hindsight), Oracle, and PayPal.

**in progress (6/119):**

I probably got ghosted by all of these companies as well tbh

* Morgan Stanley haven’t reached out after their HireVue
* submitted a perfect OA for Blackrock &amp; matched with them on Ripplematch
* did mediocre on TikTok’s OA, so not surprised

**rejected (58/119):**

First, I declined interviews for 11 companies (IMC, Vanguard, Walmart, Gap, Hive AI, etc). This was because i wasn’t fond of the interview style (ehmm IMC's one way interview) or i didn’t want to commit my time for on-sites.

Another 11 companies rejected me because their headcounts were filled for the recruiting season (C1, Figma, Pinterest, Visa, Roblox, etc). I applied as quickly as i can for these companies, so I guess my resume wasn’t strong enough to get picked

Next, I got rejected from 13 companies after at least one round of interviews/OAs. I had an 813 codesignal score, but it wasn't enough for companies like Circle and ZipRecruiter. I submitted a perfect OA for Goldman Sachs and had a recruiter reach out to me, so I don’t know what went wrong there. SpaceX’s assessment was only offered Python or C++ and I use Java for my interviews, so that didn’t turn out well. For Palantir, DraftKings, FactSet, etc, I submitted terrible OAs, so I wasn't surprised getting rejected. Finally, I got rejected after my final round of Mathworks. I got asked a system design question, and didn’t prepare for that, so again, wasn’t surprised getting rejected.

Finally, i got rejected from 23 companies after the resume screen (Microsoft, Adobe, Scale AI, Zoom, Twilio, Doordash, Lucid, Niantic, etc)

**offers (4/119):**

Finally, the part most of you guys probably were interested in.

**JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.**
* First, I was able to get a return offer from my internship at JPMC. A pro with banks is that for the most part they are pretty recession proof. The compensation package was 110k base, 20k sign-on, and 10k performance. 140k 1st yr and 120k reoccurring

* Their process was a behavioral phone round, a technical interview, and a final demo presentation. I’d say the technical interview was trivial given that you know your data structures. The final was like me being on Shark Tank, so it definitely was a bit weird, as I was expecting a technical interview. After negotiating with StubHub, I was able to get an offer of $170k base, $320k RSUs split evenly across 4 years, and a 10k sign-on. The tc was 260k for the first year, and 250k reoccurring. Before you guys go crazy, the TC is a bit misleading, as StubHub is still a private company, so till then, the stock is paper money. Moreover, with the current state of the economy, i personally don’t think they will IPO any time soon.

**General Motors**
* The process was 2 rounds, a hirevue and a final round that only consisted of behavioral questions. Their compensation package was Base: $87k Bonus: 10% of base Sign-on: $5k TC: $100.7k (1st year), $95.7k (reoccurring). So, if you guys don’t like technical interviews, make sure to apply to general motors. Their process also took around 3 weeks.

**Bloomberg (accepted)**
* Their process was a technical phone interview, a virtual onsite consisting of 2 technicals and 1 behavioral round. For me, solving Bloomberg tagged questions on leetcode was enough prep for me. After negotiating, I was able to get an offer of $155k base, 30k bonus, and 10k relocation bonus. So, the tc was 195k first year, then 185k reoccurring. Their process took around 2 months, and this was apparently due to a lot of people applying.

**final thoughts:**

* Definitely apply as fast as you can, as much as you can. I hate to say it, but at the end of the day it’s a numbers game
* [Join](https://discord.com/invite/cscareers) cscareers.dev’s discord server so that you can connect with other new grads. They definitely helped me secure valuable information.
* Leetcode. I think getting lc premium for the duration of your job search is worth it bc it allows access to see specific company’s questions. Think of it as an investment to yourself and it’ll pay off when you get an offer.

lmk if you guys have any questions, and I'll try to answer as many as I can!"

I used to have a source of income doing an internship that i had to quit because i wouldn't get permission for both the job and postgrad. now my parents won't even allow me to apply for part time jobs.
my dad started searching for marriage proposals from August right when my internship started, they tortured me for going and my mom saying things like you've gotten attitude since you're earning. i was earning bare minimum honestly i just started, i got blamed like hell for being unavailable to them. and they got a good proposal with a guy who was just 24 and they came to see me twice, somehow by God's grace that marriage got canceled. 
i have no voice, if i shout it wouldn't matter, they won't budge, if i express my views, i get emotionally manipulated and i wouldn't even recognize at the moment and then i would hate myself. 
somehow my friends always helped me stand up for myself, now my mom checked my phone to find out their emotional support for me, and they told me to runaway.. they now don't allow me to go out with my friends. I literally have to lie sayin that I'm going to college to meet them or my boyfriend.
my boyfriend and i are of the same age, now we're both not ready to get married, we plan to stay together but i can't introduce him to them because we're not ready and they wouldn't accept us to continue dating, and our life would be hell. 
I'm still getting emotionally manipulated every single day, i don't want to get married, i lied at my house saying i don't have a boyfriend as they'll take away my privileges like phone, scooty, and other basic bare minimum things.
I'm just trying to delay at this point. 
moving out is not an option. 
I welcome all suggestions, please feel free to say anything! 
thank you for reading."

Anyway, I trying to get an interview right now and sending my CV, but no one calls me back even though some managers I know went though my CV and it's great.   
I have a feeling my projects listed are not enough. since there is no explanation how to run them or detailed information (basically fun with Java threads and a Java server with sockets).  
I thought about building a C root kit, and a chest\\checkers\\Sudoku solver program \\ socket server, just for fun and I'm not sure if those are good projects for my CV? There is no specific niche I'm trying to get into, I just know that I don't really like dealing with web and web frameworks.

106rnoq,5,2023-01-08,Advice for international new grad with no offers,Pronoob_me,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/106rnoq/advice_for_international_new_grad_with_no_offers/,"Hola,

To start with, I've recently completed my Masters in CS from T1 university and I've Bachelors in Computer Engineering from India. I'm already on my OPT period (stupid me thought I can get an offer before graduation and took the earliest date possible for EAD). Not to sound arrogant, but I do consider myself to be better than average CS grad. This post is a combination of rant and seeking for advice. Apologies for the rant part - I just wanted to get it out.

I do not have industry experience - but I do have really great personal/ academic projects to provide evidence of my skill set. Additionally, I've done freelance work (during covid when my bachelors finals were postponed). My interests lie in Machine Learning, but I'm fairly open to Full Stack as well.

MLE: I've dedicated the last 4 years of my academia to Machine Learning - particularly Computer Vision. I can fairly say I can get into any vision related domain (Perception, Generative Models, Encoding-based problems) and do great in no time. However, the available positions took a big hit - and most of them require industry experience: as if they don't care that I can do as good as an mid-level experienced individual (if not better).

Software Engineer: I've been a Python maniac - started using 7 years back and it's been my major language since then. I've had my hands on scripting, Data Science, Full Stack. Additionally, I've had my great share in building frontends - React, pure HTML/CSS, Material/Bootstrap and whatnot. I've over 2 years of experience - or as seen by the recruiters: ""non-industry, non-fulltime fun projects/ side-hustle"", even though some of my stuff is live with decent (ten-thousands monthly) organic viewers.

Why do I get turned down here? Oh obviously, how can I have so many MLE based projects and apply for an SDE role? Even though my SDE resume has minimal MLE related information (only in skillset, nothing in experience) - they go through my LinkedIn and ask me about those projects rather than focusing on what I bring to the SDE role (which is also on my LinkedIn).

I won't lie over here - I do prefer MLE, but I'm equally good at SDE too. I do not tell this to the recruiters, but in the past few interviews - I was told you've a lot of background in MLE and we cannot move forward.

I've applied to everything I see - big firms, small firms, startups, for MLE, Data Science, SDE, Full Stack. At this point, 90% of my LinkedIn/ Indeed Job posts are the same repetitive stuffs. I've reached out everyone on WellFound (AngelList) and YCombinator with no avail.

I'm now considering all the available options to stop the OPT clock ticking. I'll be having a word with my professors at the university - but they're on a vacation and will be back after a week or two.

I'd like to know what other grads are doing - and what options I've. At this point, I'm down to accepting ANYTHING that pays me more than the minimal pay.

I'm pissed with the whole job search process - ""it's just a numbers game""

Is it just me or does everyone feels like all this is unproductive and you're much better learning something instead of applying and applying and applying?

A bit of back-story/ rant; feel free to skip through:

Now, why am I in this place? Why didn't I apply earlier? What about the big tech new grad roles?

TLDR: I doubled down on Autonomous Vehicle Industry, and it hit me hard.

Initially I wanted to get into Autonomous Industry as MLE - Perception. I had reached out to all the companies out there (Zoox, Motional, Nuro, Rivian, Cruise, Waymo - you name it, I got it). I approached them around Summer, and I was told that we'll get you on the interview process around Nov-Dec as they would be looking for immediate joining. With these many recruiters in touch and having soft interviews, I was certain I'd be making the breakthrough. I contacted existing MLE's from each company to understand how they work and what skills they value the most - I worked on everything I could to make sure I ace every interview. I'd spend most of my day upscaling myself - playing around all the AV related datasets, SOTA models, understanding every bit of the processes that occur in the driving; super excited to get onboard. And then, the layoffs started spreading like fire...

The companies didn't stop hiring, but they did stop offering junior/ new-grad positions all together (it pisses me off that they still hire Summer Interns - but hey, congrats on getting in if you're one of them!). Now, I was one month from graduation with no offers at my disposal. I didn't apply to other new-grad positions, so I was already late for the standard onboarding process.

And well, here I'm..."
106rsbs,5,2023-01-08,How to fix 50% of your problems.,Unfair_Horror_2759,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/106rsbs/how_to_fix_50_of_your_problems/,"50% of your problems are due to health issues, the other 50% are money problems.

Tackle both. Here is how.

Start with your health.

Drink lots of filtered water. Tap water is trash.

Exercise daily. You don't need a gym membership, you just need enough floor space for push-ups.

Commit to doing 5x the number of pushups you can do at one time within 24 hours. 

This is a dynamic goal because, over time, your strength and endurance will increase. 

Keep pushing yourself, it gets addicting and fun. 

You can add other bodyweight exercises to your workout as well.

Stop watching porn and if you are a dude, stop beating it. 

When you feel like beating it, do pushups instead. 

You can't be sitting there, with nothing to do, and expect to overcome the temptation. 

It doesn't work. 

Replace a bad addiction with a good one.

Make sure your diet is healthy. 

I am not debating red meat or vegan or whatever. 

Just cut out refined sugar, make sure carbs and/or wheat isn't more than 50% of your diet, and make sure your protein intake is high. 

Do what you can with the budget you have.

Once you have started the journey to fix your health, you will have gotten addicted to the results, and this will give you the necessary energy and drive to start fixing your financial problems.

Fixing your financial situation can take a little longer.

Start by picking a high-income skill to learn. 

That can be a community college, a mentorship program, an internship, an apprenticeship, or whatever. 

As long as it is going to make you six figures.

It is not important that you like the profession. 

It is much more important how much money you can make in that profession within the first 2 years.

If you are taking care of your physical fitness, you will have the mental fortitude to deal with the downsides of that profession.

Once the money starts rolling in, you will start liking that job a lot more.

Cut out all other options and only focus on being the best at whatever it is you've chosen to do.

As you grow, other opportunities will present themselves. 

Have the discipline to say no to those opportunities and carry through to your goal.

Learn to live within (at MOST) 75% of your budget. 

If you are making 100k a year, there's no reason why most of you can't do that.

Not everyone will take action. I hope some of you do."

106t4xb,2,2023-01-08,Does work need to be the centre of one's life?,Noroi_noshin,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/106t4xb/does_work_need_to_be_the_centre_of_ones_life/,"First things first: I am currently an intern in HR for a large company, and this is my first real job experience ever, so most of what I will say may come up as naive.
This job is 8,30 - 18 and I need on hour and a half to get to work and the same amount to get back from the office. Although I am just an intern, I always kept learning as much as possible and I always showed myself available for many different activities, and so I am achieving some independence and many people (tutors and the tutors' managers) keep assigning more and more ""autonomous"" work that piles up on top of what I usually do with my tutors. By no means I am directing the company by myself, but the amount of activities is heavy, as it keeps endlessly piling up. 
During this experience of mine I am also studying to get my master's degree, so my free time basically amounts to zero.
Long story short, I am getting to a point where my personal life and my mental health is being entirely sacrificed to everything I ""ought to do"" (work+study). 
My question is: will this be how everything will turn out to be from now on? 
The point is that I am not afraid to make effort and to work (I am thrilled at the idea to grow professionally and to learn about the HR world), but I am afraid that my whole life will be set around that. This is what I am afraid of, that a 40h/week job will force itself as the center of my life. Working is important as you can grow and (most importantly) one has to earn to sustain himself, but do I have to sacrifice my whole life for it?"

106tb24,3,2023-01-08,CUNY Hunter College (HC) vs SUNY Stony Brook University (SBU),williamiswill_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/106tb24/cuny_hunter_college_hc_vs_suny_stony_brook/,"**Background:** Junior student deciding whether to transfer away from Hunter College to SBU and planning to go on the pre-med track with a backup major that'll secure a job for me in case I am not accepted to go to a medical school (or lose the desire to become a medical professional).

**Schools:** CUNY Hunter College vs. SUNY Stony Brook University

**Intended major:** CS/Biochemistry (HC) or Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics/Biochemistry (SBU)

**Similarities:** Commuter school; limited social life; good schools for pre-health; schools located in NY (both offers in-state tuition)

&amp;#x200B;

**CUNY Hunter College**

Pros:

* In-state tuition (basically free college with financial aid) and housing isn't required (since I live at home)
* Located in the urban NYC area (decent amount of opportunities for jobs and internships)
* From what I heard, many students from this school go on to medical school
* Strong departments in natural sciences, computer science, education, and social sciences
* I founded a club at this school
* I currently hold an undergraduate TA position for general chemistry

Cons:

* Clubs/organizations are heavily focused on academia (mainly pre-health)
* Opportunities are mainly found within healthcare and research
* Despite many students going to medical school, many have done so without the help of the school
* Despite being in NYC my train ride commute is 1 hour and can most of the time be unsafe (due to some people being very unhinged in NY lately)
* The same types of things as above can be listed, except it should be things you dislike about the school
* Lack of connections outside the healthcare field (no tech companies or business companies are recruiting students)
* Lack of academic and pre-health advisement (since the school offers such cheap tuition, its resources are heavily limited and leave students to fend for themselves)

&amp;#x200B;

**SUNY Stony Brook University**

Pros:

* Great connections to tech companies as CS is very popular at SBU
* Great opportunities for research as SBU is known as a research-heavy school
* Many students mentioned that SBU aided them with plenty of resources for their career path and job search
* Offers a BS/MBA program, so if I graduate with a degree that's not employable for jobs or I'm not interested in, I'm able to get an MBA degree in 1 year
* Better name recognition for STEM research and tech companies (maybe business since their business school recently got accredited)
* Loads of clubs and organizations for all areas of interests
* Great school for pre-meds, but I, personally, haven't seen or heard much about students getting into medical school

Cons:

* My in-state tuition would be around $3k and housing is $5k per semester ($8k for 1 semester; $16k for 1 year)
* If I decide to commute (subtracting the $5k cost per semester), the commute is 1.5 hours drive and 3 hours train ride
* Located in suburban Long Island (not used to living in suburbs, will get homesick easily)
* Many opportunities will most likely be only found at the school or near the Long Island area (unless the opportunity is for winter and summer breaks)

&amp;#x200B;

Tiebreaking considerations:

* Is SBU just as successful at getting students to medical school just as Hunter College?
* How employable is the Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics degree and does the department have good connections for various jobs?
* For anyone that's currently attending or graduated from SBU, did SBU help you in your job search or graduate/professional school applications? Or were you mainly on your own?
* How hard is the CS curriculum at Hunter College? Is it doable with the pre-med courses?
* How likely are you able to get a professor and student connection for a recommendation letter at either school?
* What are the general class sizes at SBU?

&amp;#x200B;

Addendum:

* Prefer to live close to home (but if one school is objectively better than the other, I will be willing to adapt to the living conditions)
* Priority on the institution that'll provide me with a secure job and a good chance to enter medical school (i.e. school providing the best resources, guidance, and opportunities)"

106xfw8,5,2023-01-08,what courses should I take for last semester of CS?,DangitDon,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/106xfw8/what_courses_should_i_take_for_last_semester_of_cs/,"EDIT: advice needed asap due to waitlist quickly moving!!!

It's my last semester at UT and I somehow made it this far. Had an average performance in the standard core courses and have only taken SWE as my CS UDE.

Currently scheduled for Machine Learning I, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision. I chose these courses simply due to them being the only available courses at my registration time. 

I'm currently on the waitlist to swap out my Artificial Intelligence course for IOS Mobile Computing, but now I'm having second thoughts as to whether or not it would be worth it. I've heard many good things about IOS, but I feel as if I could possibly learn the same material on my own time. 

In the end, I just want to be more marketable by graduation. My experience at UT has been rough and I have zero internships or personal projects to show for it (hoping to address the project issue this semester). 

As for my career goals, I'd like to do either SWE or something in Data Science. 

Would taking IOS make getting interviews easier than A.I.? Unfortunately these two courses are registered for the same times so I can't take both. 

Any insight would be appreciated!

Currently I'm just letting luck take the wheel and let the waitlist do its thing."

1. I was a very good coder and hated studying it formally so I dropped out of undergrad to start my own startup in silicon valley   
2. The startup was doing pretty badly so I sold it for a token amount   
3. Got a product management internship at a decently prestigious silicon valley firm (think Zendesk, Asana, Slack etc)   
4. After that I worked as a Senior PM for a large enterprise company after that (Think Salesforce, Oracle etc)   
5. Moved to a unicorn startup backed by Sequoia as a senior product manager   
6. Recently moved to an Artificial Intelligence startup as a product lead.   
7. I got into a master's program in management from a top 50 American University (think UNC, UT Austin, UIUC, USC, UCLA). I was admitted based on my work experience and finished it.   


My compensation is around 250k at the moment which I'm happy with but I feel like going forward I'd need an MBA to break into the C-suite or pivot into venture capital  


My goal has always been to do an MBA from an M-7, part-time if not full time.   


I technically have a ""degree"" from a good school, just not an undergraduate one.   
My goal has always been to do an MBA from an M-7, part-time if not full time. 

Could I get into a part-time M7 MBA/T-10 MBA program based on my profile? I'm Asian if that makes any difference...  


Please don't roast me... while I know a lot about tech, I know jack shit about academia and the MBA process. This is part of my due diligence... And YES... I will of course go to admissions events and ask counselors as well."

STEM teacher: freshman year algebra 2 teacher, she’s literally my fav teacher ever and i found my love for math again through her teaching. i would always eat my lunch in her class in freshman year and go to her for homework and quiz revision help FREQUENTLY im talking like nutrition AND lunch. idk how to rate this prob an 8/10 she also wrote my rec letter for both MIT programs so must’ve been good i guess 

Humanities teacher: freshman year english teacher, loved her class in freshman year, she was a tough grader but i always received high grades, i got really close to her junior year since i always ate my lunch and studied for exams in her classroom. we talked a lot about school and life and college whenever i wasn’t busy, i love her sm 😭 she was also my advisor for the relief club. maybe like a 9/10?? idk she also wrote my rec letter for NASA internship and MITES

&amp;#x200B;

Since i applied to schools through questbridge, i ranked 4 schools, which were Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT. i only got interviewed for MIT, which went pretty well. it was in person and lasted about an hour. it was super casual, i asked more questions than the interviewer did 😭

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

oh man only questbridge kids will understand the struggle but i basically only had 2 weeks to complete the supplementals for these schools. honestly i believe my essays were the strongest part of my application, considering my lowest grades throughout high school were in STEM classes, i went test optional, and i applied as an engineering major ☠️ personal statement was about figure skating and how my work ethic in the sport applies to my school life. so corny but i guess i made it work 😭

This is my final internship, and I might look to return full-time. I'm leaning toward LinkedIn but not sure if Meta is worth the risk. I am an international student so definitely stability is a factor.

The pay is similar.

LinkedIn:

* Pros: Better work-life balance, more prestigious?, more stable
* Cons: Slower pace, don't get to choose the team

Meta:

* Pros: Faster pace, easier to get things going. Can choose team if return new grad
* Cons: Have more potential of growing (can go to 0 tho), currently unstable.

**final thoughts:**

 

1. Apply for lower paying companies

I absolutely applied to companies I knew I probably wouldn't take offers at. The main reason being that their interviews were good practice and kept my skills sharp, but also I was not taking any chances. At the end of the day I was going to graduate and anything was going to be better than being unemployed, but I had the advantage of going into applications knowing what I was worth. If you don't know what you're worth, just apply everywhere.

2. Get your resume reviewed by the right people

Usually the advice people give is just to get your resume reviewed, but this can totally backfire. There have been nightmare stories of incompetent career centers who give students bad advice. Rather, you want to get your resume reviewed by people who are truly passionate about the field and job searching. Look for computer-science focused clubs, and peers who have great names on their resume. Connect with them, offer to buy them a coffee, and get some real advice.

3. Make connections while you're still in school

In this job market it's unlikely that referrals will pan out but regardless of whether there is an immediate payoff to knowing someone, in a few years time, being on good terms with someone from college can absolutely pay dividends. I don't say this because I've been in the field for x years and have leveraged referrals effectively, but there are friends I've made that I will absolutely refer, and these were people that were open to making new friends and being a friendly face in class. You can do this in clubs, but my honest advice is just to talk to people in class, or at least reach out to them digitally. Show them that you're a good, dependable classmate, and optionally solidify that relationship by going to a football game together, or inviting them to something, or accepting their invitation! It pays dividends to become comfortable with being uncomfortable.

4. Make use of school resources while you're still in school

So many students take their studenthood for granted. While you're in school and taking classes, you're constantly surrounded by people most similar to you and who are in the best position to do you a solid. You're not going to get a second opportunity to be able to just make small talk with the person sitting next to you just because you're taking the same class, or share similar interests. While you're a student, usually you have access to Handshake or some other equivalent internal job board. The competition for those positions is so much less than if that job was posted online, and just gives you a higher chance of hearing back. Lastly, while you're a student you can take advantage of many student plans, like Jetbrains for example, gives students free access to their IDE's. Or Github Pro gives you a lot of tertiary development benefits.

5. Make sure you have stuff to put on your resume

(2) is useless if you don't actually have things to put on your resume. Put school projects on it. Attend a hackathon. Join a student organization that fosters development of your engineering skills. Even try building something yourself. The opportunities abound while you're still a student. This is by far going to be the hardest action item for those who are not passionate about or even dislike programming. In my opinion, this is one of those things that really sets people apart. Not everyone has the motivation or sanity to code on the weekends, debug an issue that's not on stack overflow, or see a personal project to completion. Not everyone cares enough about their code to understand why it works. By being relentless in developing your own skillset as well as seeking out those that you can learn from, you can really add a proverbial luster to your resume that others won't have.

6. Always negotiate

I think this kind of veers into a separate topic, but if you are not desperate and have a decent idea of what you're worth and what number would truly make you happy, it never hurts to negotiate. There's always the fear that you might endanger the offer by doing so, but in my opinion, the vast majority of rescinded offers happen due to extremely untactful negotiating, or the company is just a walking red flag. Do you know how services like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/) guarantee that your offer won't get rescinded? Because they'll tell you not to negotiate like a petulant toddler. As an aside, do not pay for those services. Negotiating is not nearly as complicated as they would have you believe, and you're better off just asking for advice here.

7. Stay organized

One of the most common things that happen to new grads and students in general is they get into final rounds with a meh company, and then don't know what to do because they have nothing else lined up to compare to or negotiate using. When you apply, sit down and spend hours applying. The less spread out your application dates are, the higher probability companies will get back to you at around the same time. Of course, it's a given that some companies will get back slower/faster, but generally speaking by the time any of your applications is in the technical screen phase or you're scheduling final interviews, you have the means to contact the companies you're in earlier stages for that you need them to expedite (like a recruiter's email). If you're proactive and transparent, companies will be eager to accommodate things like this. At the end of the day you want to be able to have more than one offer to reference, to the benefit of (6). Push back against unreasonable offer deadlines. A good company will give you two weeks to decide, and generally speaking this has always been enough time for my other companies to get me a decision. LPT, if the company in question has any connections to your school, they will be beholden to your career center's offer deadline policy. For example, UMD has an explicit [policy](https://careers.umd.edu/who-we-help/employers/policies-resources) that says companies should give their students 3 weeks, and any company that wants to stay on good terms with the university will respect that."

10773st,8,2023-01-09,"Started a new receptionist job almost 4 weeks ago, and I’m feeling depressed (needing advice urgently) 21F",paulaanddaisy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10773st/started_a_new_receptionist_job_almost_4_weeks_ago/,"So, I started this new receptionist job not too long ago at this medical office, I was so exited since this kind of felt like a step into my adulthood, before this job I worked and became a manager at a restaurant and I loved it, but I wanted to try something new, And so I got this job, there was another girl there who was also my age so that also made me very happy since I was new and basically it would just be me and her! 
My first week I didn’t really get an explanation of how to do anything, she explained me how to do something once (just showing me) and not checking if I was doing it the right way or basically did not seem interested at all, I tried to understand her since maybe she didn’t do well with other people, but it came to the point where she would just make me fetch her something from the printer, and respond to patients that were interested on coming in on Facebook, and that’s it, on my second week on Monday she put in her two weeks and she never told me directly, she told a patient in front of me and when I asked her about it she giggled (not in a nice way) and said to not worry, that I’ll be fine, I got so stressed because not only was she mean, she wasn’t teaching me anything,  I felt so frustrated and spoke with the doctor about it, he told me not to worry about it and that I would learn eventually, that I was good with people and that was all that mattered which helped but with the days going by it got worse, she still wouldn’t teach me anything and get frustrated when I asked her questions.
I ended up finding my own “how to” on the computers which a lot of it was outdated so I had to figure it on my own, the doctor didn’t really do anything about it except just tell her to teach me something not show me, which she would just respond with “I am” that’s how it was for her last two weeks, her last week a new intern started and she’s very polite, she’ll only be in the office for just three months since it’s just for her university degree, which made me more hopeful.
there were also details that the girl that I worked with gave me like that she was the longest to work there (7 months) according to the doctor because the other people that had worked there did not like it and couldn’t handle it, and that the doctor could yell sometimes and get very frustrated, at first I didn’t want to believe her since I thought she just said those things to scare me, but he is very strict, and I do feel like he’s gotten frustrated with me before, not only that, since she quit now I have to go to this trip to a seminar two hours away on an airplane with this doctor, I feel like I’m left with so much responsibility and only on my last week the doctor really explained stuff to me and seemed to be also interested in training me, I don’t blame him because he has patients and can’t do both at once,  but i feel so lost, I talked to him again last week telling him that I felt like I did not know anything about this job and that I had no idea what to do, that i needed someone to show me, he kept on saying that it’s the girls last week and that she’ll be gone, he didn’t tell her anything after him and I spoke.
I was very exited and happy for this job but I’ve cried so much already out of frustration and how alone I feel, I’ve questioned if I’m even fit to be a receptionist anywhere, I’ve really tried to learn but even going into work I feel so depressed and all I think about is getting out, my eyes water everytime i go in, and with this seminar trip coming up I’ll be gone for three days, away from family and friends and with my mental state right now I know it’s going to be difficult. He never really asked me if I wanted to go, he kind of told me that since the other girl is quitting that i have to go, which I understand because it’s my job, but I just started this job, I don’t know him that well, and with everything that’s been happening in the office at work I just feel stressed.
I wanted to stay at this job for at least a year, I really take pride in hitting at least a year mark at a job and that if I quit this one it’ll look terrible on my resume I know I don’t have to do that, but then it’ll feel like the sacrifice was for a waste of time. I’m scared of even telling him that I’m leaving since basically it will be just the intern and him, and also he paid for the airline and hotel stay, I don’t want to be looked at as a failure or that I wasn’t good enough for this job, but it feels that way. 
Im so sorry if this sounds scattered, and it’s so much text I don’t know if anyone can or will but please even if it’s small advice I could really use it, all my family and friends say to give it a week or a month and see how it feels but it just feels worse everytime I come in, my whole life and emotions feel around this job, I just wanted to do a good job."

I’m a penultimate year Econ student at Oxbridge/LSE. This summer I will likely be doing two internships - Corp Finance (M&amp;A) at a Big 4 and consulting at a T2ish firm.

I’m aware that FT IB grad roles are even more competitive than internships and hard to secure. 

I  was wondering if anyone had insight into how possible it is to do an internship in the final year of your degree? Some banks explicitly offer internships for final years, but others are more vague. 

For final years doing IB internships, would they still only start as a FT analyst a year after their internship (if they convert )? Would I need to say that I intend to apply for a masters? And if I am successful in getting an internship offer, could I then not actually do the masters, or would I have to?

Also given my education and experience, is IB still genuinely an option after not getting an IB summer internship (or spring week)? These upcoming internships will be my first real ones. At uni I’m involved in sports and some minor roles in societies, and I’m on track for a high first class degree (although I’m realising that doesn’t really matter lol)."

The problem is, they have allotted June for that matter and I want to complete the internship before that, so that I can prepare for GRE. But I have difficulties finding any, and any of the ones i find are usually too demanding for me as I have 7 hours of college. Is it the same everywhere? Should I risk my academics for this?"

I've received a couple of internship offers from tier-1 banks in London. I'm perfectly happy to go to London for a few months for this internship, however, I have no desire at all to live in London full-time when it comes to graduating (assuming I receive a grad offer).

Does anyone have any insights they could share as to whether any of the big banks offer remote or good enough hybrid working to not have to live in London (i.e. 2 days or less in the office)?

I know tech in banking is one of the more traditional parts of the tech industry, so that's why I ask.

Thanks!"

I was invited to an in-person visit of the two labs that offer an internship for which I applied. This is the final stage of the applicant process. The project will be focusing on RNA involvement in UPR of chloroplasts. The internship is supposed to last at least three months or longer upon agreement. As for my background, I only hold a bachelor’s degree and almost a year of research experience. 

I prepared some questions to ask the PIs and potentially the students in their labs and I wanted to present them here to ask whether they appear acceptable and to check whether I am missing essential questions that are good to be asked.


Qs to PIs:

What techniques would be employed?

Would there be a structured training or I will be required to approach people for explanations of techniques I am not familiar with? 

Would there be any computational work involved?
What are the experimental approaches of the project?

In terms of individual contribution to the project, what level of my participation for deciding directions for the project is expected/allowed?

What are your expectations for progression of the project for the duration of the internship?

Would the experimental work require my presence in the lab over the weekends, if positive would it be more often than rarely?
Who would I be reporting to/be my supervisor?
Do you conduct weekly lab meetings or Journal clubs?


Qs to the students:

What advice would you give to a student entering the lab?

How does the PI handle it when the project has setbacks or isn’t working? Does the PI react well to your suggestions for experiments or directions for your project? 

Is the PI hands-on or hands-off, moody or even-tempered, have favorites or treat everyone the same etc.

What’s the best/worst thing about: being a graduate student, your advisor, the department?"

reflecting on the last couple of months, i think i ignored the signs of me not liking the role as much, and it didn't reflect well on me as i was only doing the bare minimum at work.

however, being completely new in my position (HR recruitment), i did have expectations that i would be taught more things than what i was suppose to do in the role. of course there is always that ""go-getter"" spirit expected of new blood, they had given me feedback that i couldn't count on the team (1-2 other colleagues) to feed me everything and i would need to explore on my own (eg. other recruiting methods etc etc.) i did try, but i personally felt i was limited in what i could do also due to other circumstances (unable to hire foreigners, limited candidate pool). i wanted to learn more than just recruitment and more of the full scope of HR, but somehow i just wasn't taught much (eg. handling our HRIS, internships.. etc)

i can't help to think if they were already limiting my growth for the role, or if they simply just had different expectations of me. i admit that i didn't carry the right attitude for myself at work, could there have been more that I could do?

Open to thoughts and comments, just wanted to see what i can improve on."

Tl;Dr: I‘m currently a bachelor student who is attending a very well accredited business university in Switzerland. For personal reasons, I ,need to‘ move to Columbus Ohio, if possible within the next 8 months, or just asap. I‘m graduating in June. Is this possible? How?

I‘m sorry if I sound desperate, but I‘m very helpless.

I‘m a bachelor student at a well known university in Switzerland and, for personal reasons that are long to explain, I‘m in dire need of moving to Columbus Ohio.

To my qualifications: I will soon be graduating (on track to graduating with honors) from a well known business school with a Business bachelor. Pre-uni, I have completed a professional baccalaureate degree, which included working as a front desk associate at a hotel for a year. During my time at uni, I have both completed another internship in marketing for Philip Morris International and have founded my own marketing company with a few friends, which is doing very well for something that started as a ,side venture‘. I speak three languages fluently (bilingual in german and english, fluent with certification in french) and have a wide range of technological experience (Programming: Python and JavaScript with low levels of certification, no traditional training; MS Office suite: Word, PowerPoint and Excel with certification; Adobe CC suite: 3 years of working experience).

I know that the US has a somewhat different approach to applications to europe and i‘ve redone my CV, cover letter etc. to fit this.

I don‘t like boasting, but I feel like I am qualified for at least some levels of jobs offered. The problem is that I have been applying for dozens (if not hundreds, at this point) of jobs, and most of the time, I haven‘t even gotten an interview.

My question is three fold: Is immigration into the US within 8 months possible? What kinds of jobs should I apply to? Am I missing some sort of crucial step to get me a visa more simply? I‘ve started seeing ,this position does not qualify for visa sponsorship at this time‘ in a lot of positions, should I apply nonetheless or could that backfire?

I‘m thankful for any help, I‘m slowly starting to go insane."

I still live with my mother because I can't financially afford my own place. I don't have a car. I don't really have any friends or any kind of a social life. I can't save, financially, even while working two part time jobs because it's my ""rent"" money, which goes into buying food for my mom and I, paying my bills, helping her pay bills, or helping to pay for shit around the house. She's 69 years old, going on 70 this August, and has been ""retired"" for several years now and has balance issues, so her getting a part time job is not happening.

I'm in grad school, which is a plus, to become a teacher. The problem is that I have a year and a half, to maybe two years, left to attend. There's a portion of the program dedicated to ""fieldwork observations,"" which concludes through one of three options:

1. You're already a teacher, are just taking the program to earn your masters, and can just sign off on an ""internship,"" which basically enables you to not have to participate in the 2nd option...
2. You do a course in student-teaching. Substitute teaching - per diem or permanent - does not count, as you are not technically a full-time working teacher w/ X amount of hours under your belt. It's stupid, I agree, because I work as a substitute and even though I'm not designing lesson plans, I basically do all of the same thing as a teacher does in the classroom on a day-to-day basis (when I get a job). SO, in essence, I wouldn't be able to sub that semester and wouldn't get paid, five days a week, for fifteen weeks, and would be a glorified ""intern."" Which leads us to option 3...
3. I go through another year of schooling. In the spring, I would take an education seminar and in the fall, I would take the second education seminar, which would result in a fully-researched project coming to completion under the mentorship of an advisor...which would possibly put me into graduating from the program when I'm 36.

I'm trapped and don't know what to do. I have a year...but all of the job options that exist in my area are pretty much exhausted (I live in S.I, a borough of NYC) as it is very hard to get a job in teaching...though the governor has said that 180,000 teachers are needed within the next decade. But I don't feel like I am needed. I have a school that I love that I want to work at as a teacher...but I feel like that'll never happen, even if it does feel like home to me.  I can't afford to not work for a semester and basically ""intern"" five days a week and then only get paid for working two days a week (which is the weekend) at my retail job that I have been with for over ten years now...(talk about feeling stuck and depressed).

At my part time job, I work with young teens and twenty-somethings and all they seem to do is point out how old I am. I try not to take it to heart (especially since most people think I look like I'm the same age as my co-workers), but I do...because I'm not living the life I want, or imagined for myself, when I was their age or younger. I am not out traveling, I'm not meeting people, I haven't had a boyfriend since I was 18...I haven't adapted to where I live at all (having been raised in another state that still feels like home to me); overall, I'm not growing, I'm not fulfilled, and I'm not happy.

I keep waiting for change, but every time it comes around, it gets harder and more challenging. I'm lucky for what I have and I know that...but is it wrong to want more? To feel jilted or cheated in some way? I'm going to be 40 in less than six and a half years...and my God, I can't see the future I wanted for myself anymore. I feel like my father was right: I have no future. Suicide, or just not existing, seems to be a better and better option. I don't feel healthy physically and want to change my eating habits...but my depression is out of control. My sleep habits are shot; my stress and anxiety levels are through the stratosphere...and all I want is not to deal with this anymore. Any of it. Why was I made to exist if I cannot even live? What's the point?

All I see are people my age with settled careers, dating, getting engaged or married, and having babies...or going out and traveling and buying their dream home or fixing it up, DIY style, so that it becomes their dream. Why can't I have any of that? I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself. I'm so tired of everything...I want my youth back; I want a do-over. I want to go back and make different choices. What do I do? How do I get over this? How do I find joy again? How do I believe in the possibility of a future or have enough hope to keep pushing myself through each day?  How do I become more confident? How do I love myself? How do I gain better self-esteem and self-worth? How do I overcome the trauma and abuse (mentally, emotionally, and even physically) that I endured in my childhood due to my father and my mother's choices? How do I improve myself physically and start feeling more attractive? How do I start feeling less of a pathetic loser and more of a work-in-progress?

P.S. I closed down most social media platform accounts that I had (mostly FB and avoid IG if I can) because of how much worse they make me feel and I feel social media is a hinderance to human socialization, not a helping tool...despite the global ""connectivity"" it supposedly represents)."

Hi everyone. Just looking to get some advice. 
Some background: I graduated in December 2023 with an engineering degree but decided to go into the teaching routes 

Today was my (24F) first day as a HS teacher. Starting out second semester. I am not teaching quite yet as I don’t have a background in teaching. I’m going to be shadowing classes for two weeks and will then be given my own classes to teach. 

I am excited for this new journey and I’m excited because this is an environment I feel like I’ll enjoy. I like working with kids and I like to teach. I have a great support system and all of the teachers are super helpful. 

However. I deal with horrible anxiety. I had an internship (engineering internship) before I graduated college that was meant to be in person (cubicle job) and i hated it. Mostly hated the cubicle and feeling so alone. It made my anxiety crippling and it made me feel trapped and lonely. I have been struggling with the idea of the 8 hr work week 5 days a week for the rest of my life and it gives me horrible anxiety. Due to my anxiety, my internship allowed me to work from home which significantly improved my mental health and anxiety. 
However, I did not want to pursue a career in engineering as i fell out of love with it and felt like I could really enjoy teaching. 

But now I’m back to working 40 hrs a week monday-Friday and that anxiety is back. I’m not sure how to deal with it or how to manage it. The anxiety is horrible. Just knowing i have to be at work 8 hr ever day mon- Friday gives me so much anxiety. 

I don’t want to resort to working from home to get rid of this anxiety. I want to be a normal functioning adult. I’m afraid of wanting to quit weeks/ months in bc the anxiety will be crippling. I don’t want my only option to get rid of this anxiety to be a WFH job.

We go through two six month “rotations”, each with a different team in a different department before we select our final placement team. I’m nearing the end of my first rotation and I’m wondering if someone can offer some advice. 

I graduated with a finance degree this past May. I really never took programming besides one SAS course and an html course. I completely stumbled into this position thinking I was applying for a business analyst as an intern, but the salary was enticing and I had done enough tech to understand the basics. 

Fast forward to the end of rotation one and I’ve struggled. Luckily my position is very laid back and I’ve been able to rack up quite a good list of skills. I created a react app with a python backend, JavaScript front end. Utilized about 7 different API’s and challenged myself throughout the process. It’s now an application the bank is considering implementing. However, i did rely heavily on the other grad (who probably produced at least 70% of the work on the app due to my lack of knowledge). 

Recently I’ve been taking the university of Helsinki python course and am feeling better. Now comes the question: I can choose one team out of 37 for my next rotation.

My inclination is to go for front end dev with python as the main language because I can actually do that (kind of). But I could also choose a different team and learn completely different tech. For example - backend, Google cloud, machine learning focused positions. 

Do I stick with what I know and aim for a more specialized career or do I take this opportunity as a chance to expand my knowledge of technologies? I risk not knowing much about one thing when it comes for my final placement- which is when a team actually has to budget me in. Thoughts?"

I recently moved from being an intern to being the sole IT person at a branch of local government (~125 Users, ~300 Devices, 8 Buildings.)

I interned at a local school district in my area with a super amazing team of sysads. Due to the number of devices/users/buildings we were considered a small enterprise, all managed and orchestrated by 3 really talented sysads and 1 awesome director.

I have been able to learn a lot working with my previous team while getting my associates in IT. That being said, I am still very much a newbie and have so much more that I'm excited to learn!

The pressures of being in a one man shop are super immense, especially in a government setting where purchasing is a nightmare, regulations are everywhere, and I was left a little bit of a mess by the last sysad.

We run on prem Windows AD, Exchange, and some government apps. The majority of our networking equipment is Meraki.

The main problem I'm facing is that the previous Sysad left little to no documentation for me. The network has a super confusing design/naming/dhcp scheme. It feels like it takes forever to find my bearings when something needs fixed.

We have no remote support solutions either, so every ticket to an outbuilding requires quite a drive (agency is segregated across two cities). We are using on-prem Spiceworks for ticketing.

We also have many regulatory requirements for security (CJIS, HIPAA, DSAs with State Agencies) that specifically require that security controls be documented. Since I was left with no documentation, well, I'm up a creek without a paddle should we be audited.

I guess with all of that it feels a little like I'm drowning. I don't even know where to begin cleaning when every time I get a moment to take a look it's like five pairs of earbuds that got tangled up in someone's pocket.

Does anyone have any advice or wisdom for me? Especially the other people out there running one person shops?"

I want to ignore these things and just tell myself that I should just keep pursuing what I enjoy, but these things keep popping up in the back of my head. What should I do? I keep flipping back and forth between this and engineerings like computer/electrical, which I know I can do but dont think I can enjoy them as much. Im not sure if others have felt this way, but would appreciate some advice."

And then I got selected for interview where this guy told me to create 3 pages responsive design , he provided me figma file , then I worked hard and managed to complete the task within a day and send code to him. Then he was quite impressed and selected me for full stack developer role because I said that I was learning backend and gave me offer letter with salary 11k/month and will increase after i learn backend. it was a work from home internship and As soon as I singed the 6 months offer letter they said that their is project deadline so I have to finish a clients website as soon as possibe.

 I was hoping that I will work under an experienced developer where he can assign me tasks from which I can learn and complete projects together but these fuckers assign whole project to me . it was the same project that the recruiter told me to design 3 pages , so started working on that since last 4 days and my mental peace is dead , I spend almost all day developing that website and everyday they tell me to work faster . I do not know what to do now. I can't handle this workload , I need a senior/experience developer for help and guidance but they said that senior developers are busy in other projects .  And there are some complex features that I don't know how to implement . I don't know what to do now.

so I wanted to ask that what should I do now , the notice period is of 60 days. 

btw is it normal that companies assign these important projects with deadlines to new interns??"

(Esp for the girls in CS),[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/108c6ei/how_much_do_career_fairs_and_various_conferences/,"I never had an internship before but as a junior I got my first offer from a career fair company. I’m also in many of the Women in Computer Science and Society of Women Engineer organizations that organize so many conferences to network and meet other tech recruiters.

In February for example, my school is organizing a completely paid for trip to the Harvard WeCode conference in Boston where recruiters from Google, Bloomberg, etc are all there. Another thing I noticed is that I see many girls in these orgs at my school interning for many of the top companies repeatedly. Could this all be because of these conferences?

I guess my question is, how much do these events really help? Is it a pipeline into the company or just surface level networking."

I have some basic skills in Python, Java, Figma, and Tableau.

Didn't drink or smoke, the worst he did was probably stay up way later than he should.   
He was the kind of person that probably resembles a lot of us, wasn't easy for him to talk about his feelings, struggled with physical affection a bit,  those things got somewhat better over the years, maybe he would have even gone to therapy once he retired.   
Few months ago he had an anyeurisma and after being in a coma for some weeks, he'll never be able to walk, talk or do fuck all ever again, he seems to be mostly aware of what is going on around him.  
Most likely won't be able to stay arround for any grandkids, won't be able to enjoy a retirement and out of his coworkers, there is two that come see him once in a while.   
I am not saying this wouldn't have been worse if he was in a different field, that he didn't somewhat enjoy what he was doing, that things won't go different for you but in the end TC, your Faang internship and your hackerrank don't mean shit when for 3/7 days of the week the only people you see a doctors and people moving you around or using a tube to suck the thick saliva out of your mouth because you can't swallow anymore.    
   
What does matter is the family and friends that come around sometimes, massage his feet, put in a CD for a while, check in with the doctors and try to make this as bearable as possible while it lasts"
108e2vy,1,2023-01-10,Is web dev the right path for me?,RobertGM,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/108e2vy/is_web_dev_the_right_path_for_me/,"First, some background to provide context for my predicament. About nine years ago I got interested in programming as a hobby, and have been programming side projects on-and-off since. Most of this has been in JavaScript and other web technologies, but I used Java a few years when in FIRST robotics. In the not so distant past I also accepted a request from a client to build an e-commerce site, and got a summer internship doing frontend dev for Domino's. I'm now in the middle of my sophomore year studying CS at the University of Michigan, where course work has mostly been in C++. So, my experience has been [a mix](https://robbiegm.github.io/), but mostly it's in web dev. I'm curious what I might want to do with my career next, as it's about time to start applying to internships, but none of the options seem like a clear win.

* If I decide to continue accruing experience in web dev, I feel like my whole university education will have gone to waste. Just about none of this stuff has been or likely ever will be useful, should I go down this path. Linear algebra? Physics? Signals and systems? Hell, not even *data structures and algorithms* content would have been useful very often in prior side projects, had I known it before. I know a lot of developers have expressed this sentiment about how university didn't prepare them for the real world, but it's more than just the (half) sunk cost for me. For one, a good chunk of web devs have gone ballistic with overcomplicated tooling, and what's hot seems to change every 6 months. How can I expect that after leaving one job having used React, I'll easily find another when everybody's now using, `${coolWords[coolWords.length * Math.random()]}.js` and some applicants will have been using said framework since its inception? Perhaps some experienced web devs could weigh in on this; I hope I am wrong on that count. The field also seems to have a lower barrier to entry resulting in lower average (though still satisfactory) salaries according to the [StackOverflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/).
* Or, I could switch completely into something else, perhaps something that uses C or C++. Device firmware? Native desktop applications? Robotics? Back-end dev? I haven't looked at non-webdev career options much at this point, to be honest, and am open to any suggestions. Might this be a better path? So much for all that web-platform-specific experience, but maybe that university education will be put to better use, particularly if I do something involving physics or math. I'm looking at internships at places like Red Hat and KeySight that might satisfy my desire to branch out, should it be my best option.

My goal is to find a career that is:

* Interesting, as I'll be spending significant time in my life doing it. Subjective, of course, so I don't expect Reddit to be able to help me too much on this count.
* High paying, if possible. No surprise there, but I'd rather not move to silicon valley to do it. I have very little interest in grinding LC for its own sake but I'd be willing to do it if it's worthwhile to get a higher paying job.
* Impactful to real people. Writing code for new temporary promotional campaigns at Domino's to squeeze more dollars out of consumers didn't exactly give me a warm fuzzy feeling inside, for example. Unfortunately it seems that in many cases this directly conflicts with the desire to have a job that pays well.
* Stable enough that the tech landscape won't have changed so much after quitting one job that I'll have to spend significant time learning outside of work in order to get the next job.

I'd appreciate your input on what kind of path might fulfill these career goals for me, or what kind of internships I should look for these next 2 years to figure out what I like for myself. Thanks!"

Now, while I believe this is a very good opportunity for me as i wish to go into finance. I am worried and scared to tell my parents about it, primarily because I won't be able to give my best in my last sem exams because IB internships tend to have extended hours and late nights (the office is quite far, so traveling is also an issue).   


Also, my parents have paid a lot for my education, and they do have certain expectations from me, but all through my undergrad I was busy doing internships (remote) and extra currics. My experiences are also the primary reason I got IB Internships. We have had constant tussles as I wanted to work, but they wanted me to focus on my studies/grades (which i believe the BCom course is useless in the real world)

How should I tell them about the IB internships?"

I’m now working on fully designing a robotic machine with a PLC programmer and 2 mechanical engineers. I would call myself more of a automation engineer because I can do PLC, Vision, and Robot programming. 

Here’s my question, I’ve only been there 8 months out of school and I think I’ve set myself up pretty well for the future there but I don’t forsee myself being here more than 5 years but I also don’t want to travel as a typical automation engineer. Should I start to learn more in-depth programming like Java and python to do WFH software engineering or learn machine learning and do WTH data science/AI programming.

I have not yet made a decision on where i should get my master. Right now the i have the following options in mind.

* Going to a University(probably in Vienna) and getting my master there while also working like I do now.
* Or go to a University of Applied Sciences where you can choose a masters program which allows you to work full-time (or almost full-time).

The Pros and the Cons :

Going to a ""normal"" University would mean that i can only work a small fraction of a full time employment, therefore I would technically have less experience. But here in Austria I often hear that a degree from a ""normal"" University is considered better than one from a University of Applied Sciences (This is not a opinion i agree with. I think it depends on the person how much they can and want to learn).

On the other hand if by going to a University of Applied Sciences i would finish my masters with 2 years of full time and 2 years of part time experience (instead of 4 years of part time). 

In the longer term I would like to try to get a internship at a FAANG company and pursue a career in SWE. I would probably look for opportunities in other countries in Europe even if the internship doesn't work out. Depending on where there are good opportunities in the field.

What i don't know is which of these options are considered better from an international point of view. Is the amout of hours I am working besides university even considered that much? Will it make a difference if worked 2 years 30h/week + 2 years 12h/week or 4 years 12h/week? Will the reputation of a University maybe cover the differences?"

I want to apologise in advance for my bad english since it’s not my first language. 
I just wanted your advice/opinion so please leave comments!

This post is about my relationship with my mother which has caused many problems in my life and because of said relationship I also developed mental disorders. 
Since I was a child my mother would scream every time I did something not to her liking. I broke something on accident. She screamed. I got a bad grade in school. She screamed. I wanted to discuss something with her. She shut me down and screamed. 
She also hit me when I was in elementary school after I didn’t tell her about a bad grade I got. I didn’t tell her in the first place because I was scared. To this day I don’t feel love or admiration for my mother. But instead I feel anger, fear, frustration and sadness. 
We had a bad relationship as long as I can remember. I always felt fear when I was at home in my room and I heard her footsteps coming towards me. I felt guilty for playing video games or reading, since I was afraid she would scream at me for not being more productive. 
Skip some time to 2020/2021. I developed disordered eating, isolated myself often because I hated the way I looked and was afraid people would judge me. I couldn’t go to university because I didn’t want to leave the house. I was in a really bad place and cried every single day and also hurt myself. Every day I would tell myself how disgusting I was and that I should just end everything. This was close after I moved out and had no regular contact to my parents. I love my dad but I am afraid to tell him anything, because I am scared he‘ll tell my mother. I started university in 2019 right after graduating Highschool. I had no break in between and thought it was fine. I now realised I should have taken a break or something like that. 
But like I said I was in a very dark place and after my mother got angry because I didn’t contact her very often I wrote her a long message explaining everything to her. I told her that she is the reason why I don’t like myself and feel pressured 24/7 and I also told her that we both made mistakes and that I want to work it out since my inner child somehow wanted it’s mother. I wanted to repair that relationship. But she simply anderes very short and said something along the lines like „Oh I see.. I am going to look out for what I say or better don’t say anything at all in the future. You do you.“ I answered that I want to talk to her next time I visit them, but she completely ignored it and our relationship is still as bad as then. 
She also ghosted me after I couldn’t visit her for Mother’s Day because I was busy and had to look after my cat since my roommate was gone. She was very angry and ghosted me for like a month and after that she acted as if nothing had ever happened. 
I often cry and feel hopeless because I want to get along with her or cut her out of my life. I want to say that to her face and see her reaction. But I am so scared and I am in fear that I might just be overreacting. 
I could even Name more recent incidents of this year when I had to stay one month at my parents house because of an internship. She verbally abused me, acted like she was the victim, told me I was ugly and how my boyfriend can love me since I look so hideous. I could make a more detailed post about it if you‘d like to. I would love to hear your opinion on that one too. 

That’s it for now. 
I just would like to know if I am overreacting or if it’s normal and okay for a mother to act this way. I just feel so misunderstood and not loved at all and it bothers me for such a long time now."

I completed an internship last summer gone in software engineering/ web development (but it was very basic and focused on Javascript, html and css) and I am relatively proficient in python.

I want to secure a graduate position as a software engineer as quickly as possible and arm myself as well as I can, so here is my actionable plan before September:

- Complete Java course
- Project 1 in Java (and other relevant languages) primarily focusing on online banking/ budgeting/ something like that.
- Project 2 in App development (already underway) in swift, simple meditation app
-Project 3 in Java, much smaller scale and simpler in idea.

With this plan, I will be heading into my masters with three projects and some Java knowledge already, on top of my internship. 

Is there anything else that anyone can recommend? I also come from an arts degree (English+film) background, and play around with code visualisers and old tech in my free time.

108llpf,1,2023-01-10,Marketing major adding a minor: CS or Engineering Sciences?,andyh735,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/108llpf/marketing_major_adding_a_minor_cs_or_engineering/,"Hey guys! I'm a second-semester third-year Marketing major at Ohio State. Through my time here, I took a class for an Entrepreneurship minor called ""Product design for Entrepreneurs,"" coded as a Mechanical Engineering class. I loved the entire creative process. I then pursued this more through networking with my professors, and even was a TA for a product design class.

As a Marketing major, I plan to eventually move into product design. (also important, I have a summer internship at a materials science company (would love to eventually work in industry) doing sales, but its internship program is known for a very high rate of job offers after internships and moving employees across divisions. I also have a co-op right now working in marketing for a DEI company, where I really find social media, video making, etc tedious, bur market research somewhat interesting.) Coming up now, I've realized that I want to add something to differentiate me as a marketer.

I have two options to pursue:

1. I can pursue a computer science minor. This would really put me ahead as a digital marketer. I can absolutely use it as well in almost any field - and also be differenciated. However, I'm not sure that I want to pursue digital marketing (questioning things in my current marketing co-op). I do love working with computers, and think this would be really really cool!
2. I can pursue an ""engineering sciences"" minor. This minor does the following

a) Take the first class that engineering majors take. This class focuses on learning the engineering creative process, working with a team, etc.

b) Take one class in a field of interest. This could be electrical, industrial, etc.

c) Take a technology diversity class

d) Take a year long capstone class as a ""collaborater."" This course is a year long, in which you work with an engineering team on their capstone, contributing ""your area of expertise."" **This is what I think is perfect**. I've always heard marketing majors see things differently from engineers. I believe that this minor would absolutely allow me to pursue a product design route (and potentially dabble into engineering, should I find a passion for that) as I can see the process from both sides-a definite edge I believe.

This is the minor's decription:

This minor is designed for non-engineering students with an interest in learning more about technology’s important role in today’s society; and who may be working with engineers and technology based opportunities in the future. Specific learning goals include:

• Develop a basic understanding of the engineering design process

• Understand the capabilities and limitations of technologies and engineered systems

• Be able to make informed decisions about engineering activities and technologies

• Be able to work effectively as a member of a team including technology experts

The only downside to this is if I don't end up in product design, this degree may potentially not be helpful (your thoughts?).

The CS degree would allow more stability, versitility, and digital marketing opportunities. But I really enjoy product design, and would love to pursue it into the future. Thanks guys!"

Options are health informatics, biostatistics, and computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! I graduated from my bachelor’s in Biomedical Sciences this past spring, and have been exploring career options since then, including working at a clinical job, a research job, and self-learning programming/advanced math. 

I’ve come to realize I enjoy specific aspects from each experience:

* Data visualization: I enjoy analyzing and communicating research visually, pulling from background courses in biostatistics and graphic design. 
* Research methodology: I noticed that the subject matter didn’t matter (ranging from cell biology to public health), but rather I take interest in how research is structured and designed, and how other computational methods could be applied (e.g. drawing from my science background to see how predictive machine learning can be used in biomedical imaging, epidemiology, etc.)
* Clinical component: I’d still like to have a clinical/healthcare approach to things, e.g. not closing doors on the (pipedream of an) idea of being a clinician-scientist of sorts

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, an ideal career of mine would consist of collaborating with various physicians and research groups. This includes working on designing research projects, applying statistical and computational methods for data analysis, and ultimately visually illustrating and communicating the results of the research (e.g. for the public and/or to other researchers).

Does such a career exist? I’m looking into Masters’ programs to explore the subject matter further, but it seems to be an intersect between computer science, biostatistics, and health informatics. What seems most appropriate from my experience/interests, alongside finding a job afterward?

&amp;#x200B;

Some side thoughts/notes:

* Health informatics was the first thing I came across. Programs I’m looking at are 2 years with internships included. However, they seem more focused solely on management and policy of electronic health records (versus software development or data science), and I’m not too sure how this would translate out to other data science industries in the case I’m needing to pivot fields? Plus, a fair amount of the job descriptions also consider candidates in statistics and CS, but not the other way around
* Biostatistics programs are 1-2 years long and some also have internships. They focus more on statistical theory alongside other public health concepts. However, I’ve also read that pure statistics might be more theory than I actually need, versus the software skills which data science employers look for?
* Computer science programs are 2 years long, but I’d be finding internships on my own. Computer science is the least familiar of the fields to me, so I don't know how relevant the skills are in this program to my interests."

108lqd1,1,2023-01-10,"Computer Science, Biostatistics, Health Informatics – best for biomedical data science?",itsmarq,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/108lqd1/computer_science_biostatistics_health_informatics/,"tl;dr – Trying to choose a master’s program to do research in data science, in a biomedical/clinical context. Options are health informatics, biostatistics, and computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! I graduated with my bachelor’s in Biomedical Sciences this past spring, and have been exploring career options since then, including working at a clinical job, a research job, and self-learning programming/advanced math. 

I’ve come to realize I enjoy specific aspects from each experience:

* Data visualization: I enjoy analyzing and communicating research visually, pulling from background courses in biostatistics and graphic design. 
* Research methodology: I noticed that the subject matter didn’t matter (ranging from cell biology to public health), but rather I take interest in how research is structured and designed, and how other computational methods could be applied (e.g. drawing from my science background to see how predictive machine learning can be used in biomedical imaging, epidemiology, etc.)
* Clinical component: I’d still like to have a clinical/healthcare approach to things, e.g. not closing doors on the (pipedream of an) idea of being a clinician-scientist of sorts

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, an ideal career of mine would consist of collaborating with various physicians and research groups. This includes working on designing research projects, applying statistical and computational methods for data analysis, and ultimately visually illustrating and communicating the results of the research (e.g. for the public and/or to other researchers).

Does such a career exist? I’m looking into Masters’ programs to explore the subject matter further, but it seems to be an intersect between computer science, biostatistics, and health informatics. What seems most appropriate from my experience/interests, alongside finding a job afterward?

&amp;#x200B;

Some side thoughts/notes:

* Health informatics was the first thing I came across. Programs I’m looking at are 2 years with internships included. However, they seem more focused solely on management and policy of electronic health records (versus software development or data science), and I’m not too sure how this would translate out to other data science industries in the case I’m needing to pivot fields? Plus, a fair amount of the job descriptions also consider candidates in statistics and CS, but not the other way around
* Biostatistics programs are 1-2 years long and some also have internships. They focus more on statistical theory alongside other public health concepts. However, I’ve also read that pure statistics might be more theory than I actually need, versus the software skills which data science employers look for?
* Computer science programs are 2 years long, but I’d be finding internships on my own. Computer science is the least familiar of the fields to me, so I don't know how relevant the skills are in this program to my interests."

I currently have two internship offers this summer and I was wondering if you could help me decide which company would end up being better for me in the sense of gaining more valuable experience. 

One offer is at Liberty Mutual as a part of their TechStart Intern program. At Liberty they said if I accept the offer then in mid February they’ll send out surveys asking what software engineering team I would like to be a part of, whether it’s front end development, back end, or something like cybersecurity.

The other offer is at a smaller startup company that does software consulting. They’re a fairly small company and I know that in the team I will gain experience with tools like Angular, Python, PostGres, Rust, Go, Typescript and a lot more. In addition, I will gain experience with sprints and Jira and agile environment experience.

Both companies are about the same distance away and pay difference is only slightly higher at Liberty than the startup so neither really play a huge factor."

Where to go from here?",ButterscotchNovel463,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/108naz4/lost_unemployed_and_depressed_7_months_after/,"I was a lazy, unmotivated student who wasted away my college years, and now I am paying for it. I didn't pursue internships hard enough and now I have I have no work experience, which has hurt my job search significantly. I graduated in May 2022 with a degree in Finance. I feel like a loser when I see my peers have great jobs and big companies. I was a great student academically, but too anxious and lazy to put myself out there for internship opportunities.

The strengths I have right now are a perfect GPA (idk how much this matters), and school related projects that I can use as experience. I took two courses where they had us working with real non-profit companies on a consulting project. I got to experience working in a team, and managed real clients. It basically operated like a real-life consulting project and our team successfully implemented our solution for both courses. Now I know its not a job, but its something. It’s all I have really.

The cons are that I have no actual work experience besides an odd tutoring job I did my sophomore year.

I know I probably wont land a job at a big company but I am okay with starting at a small, or mid-sized firm to get some experience. The problem is even those are ghosting me. I feel like my life is ruined, and I have let my parents down. They made so many sacrifices to send me to college, and I wasted it. The longer I am unemployed the worse it looks because now I have this 7-month gap on my resume where I did absolutely nothing. What are my options here? 

This post may get lost in new, but I need any help I can get. Hopefully someone reads it and is able to give some advice :) Please let me know. Thank you!"

My college was offering students internships but the pay wasn't even close to what I was making from my work. I was already living paycheck to paycheck. I looked for internship on Indeed and LinkedIn and all the ones I have seen were only offering it to current students. 

Do anyone know the best way to land an internship? Is there any other website I could try? I have no luck finding an entry level job.

My SO got a phone call on an offer by a big University. He's been out of a job for a year or so after his coding bootcamp and was laid off a few months ago from an internship. He finally got a call from a big University in NYC to join their software engineering team. Of course, he wanted to negotiate salary and they said they would get back to him on this. This occurred before Christmas and the University was off for a few days after Christmas. He did get a follow up before New Year that he will hear back from the team soon. Their offices were closed 2 days last week after new year. What is the possibility of them retracting that offer or just simply ignoring him altogether?

He is still looking and applying. I have worked in acadamia before (for 6 months, and hated it) so I understand things are VERY SLOW. 

Any insights from anyone would be helpful!"

I've noticed engineering and comp sci students, even as freshmen are expected to rush around and stack their portfolio, do projects, get internships, avoid even a sip of alcohol, and just overall leave it all out on the field. Maybe I'm not paying attention, but other majors, especially students in the humanities, seem to pay much less time than that. 

[Considering that job outlooks for engineering graduates are better than those for humanities or even pure sciences graduates](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/business/t012-s001-best-college-majors-for-a-lucrative-career/index.html), wouldn't this all make sense the other way around? Why do engineering students, who already have strong degrees, seem to do more professional stuff outside the classroom than humanities students, who could actually use the extra experience to back up a degree with less demand?"

I am planning on attending the career fair, but I am somewhat apprehensive. This is mainly because I feel as though I don't have enough to brag about on my resume.

Another reason is because I don't have the CompTIA+ certificate. I know that's something a lot of employers like, and I'm planning on taking this semester to study for it and earn it.

But would cybersecurity internships in general expect a certificate like that? Or are they fine without one as long as everything else is decent?"

I started my first ever proper IB internship nearly a month back, with the mindset that I'll have to grind for 70-80 hours per week, but was surprised to learn that I was only expected to work &lt;40 hours. 

Now, I understand that I joined the firm during the holiday season, but even after a month, I've been having ""slow"" days. In fact, I've been sitting idle since the last 3 days, which has got me worried about my performance.

I did mention that I was up for new tasks yesterday, but haven't gotten a response as yet. I don't know if I should ask again today as I don't want to come off as pushy/annoying. It's a WFH internship, so it's not even like I can look for more work on my own.

Moreover, i am only in contact with my reporting manager, who is a Senior Associate, and hence, really busy. There's little to no communication with other employees/interns, so I don't know if they are also facing the same thing.

My reporting manager is extremely sweet and helpful, but I don't get enough feedback to assess how I'm doing as an intern. I made a lot of mistakes while preparing my first pitch deck. Even though I made the changes he asked me to, I fear that I've created a bad impression, mainly due to the fact that I am not getting a lot of work, if that makes sense. 

I sincerely want to do a good job. I've always been an over-achiever, so the fact that I might potentially be a bad intern is a bitter pill to swallow &amp; is making me extremely anxious.

Am I overthinking this? Any advise would be helpful. Thank you! 

P.S. I have terrible anxiety, just in general, so if some/most of it seems like I'm spiraling, I apologize!"

108xdvd,1,2023-01-11,Enrolling at a coding bootcamp as a Frontend Development Intern - Should I do it?,siomairicesquad,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/108xdvd/enrolling_at_a_coding_bootcamp_as_a_frontend/,"Hey all! This is my first post to this subreddit looking to find guidance as I am currently in crossroads of my dev career

A bit of background about my learning journey:

March of last year (2022), I decided that I would like to become a web developer and found this free resource named “The Odin Project” that teaches web development for free.

While I was learning, I made it a goal to myself that I would get to work in the industry before my 20th birthday on December of that year.

I am overjoyed that I had reached that goal of mine reached on November, where I was employed as a Frontend Development Intern for this startup

It’s an unpaid internship but the work experience is too valuable to have, being a self taught developer

Here’s the dilemma that I am having right now:

My family wants me to enroll to a coding bootcamp, seeing as we know someone who underwent it and now earns $80k a year.

I, however am quite apprehensive as I feel like I have learned quite enough and worries that what they will teach at the bootcamp is going to be the same material that I am already familiar with. (HTML, CSS, JS, Git, React, etc.) 

On top of that , I am starting to teach myself backend development as well (the MERN stack) in order to become a full stack developer.

Should I still enroll to a coding bootcamp even though I have “work experience” through my internship already for that promise of guaranteed job position at the end of the bootcamp? 

Thanks for the taking the time to read and the guidance you will give me

TLDR: Self taught developer now working as a Frontend Intern wondering if going into a coding bootcamp to land a job is worth it"

The guy in charge of helping/teaching me, I guess realized I won't be any use where I am now, told me to make a to-do list app using the stack they use. I'm not sure if I should feel bad about this, but to make it worse, I've spent hours on it and still can't get it done.

I have always wanted to work at a Big-N company. I planned on attending a state school and securing a very high gpa. However due to family/personal reasons my life got completely derailed and I ended up with a 3.3 gpa so far. I know everyone says that gpa doesn’t matter and that anything over 3 is good. However I can’t help but think that only applies to target schools, as the only people I know who have gotten good internships at my school have very high gpas. I have applied to almost 200 places (Big-N and local) and am barely getting OAs and when I do I pass them only to get ghosted. I’ve been grinding leetcode and codeforce for multiple hours a day because I enjoy them and I also want to be able to capitalize on any interview I am able to get. Should I focus more on personal projects to compensate for my gpa? I started going through the Odin project to learn full stack development. What should I focus on for next internship cycle so I have one next year? I have had research experience in ML/AI since freshman year. However my projects are fairly weak. Is there still a path to a new grad big-N offer? Or should I set my sights lower? Sorry for the rant/vent I’ve just been super upset getting constant rejections."

I am a sophomore in college and my degree I am working on is bachelors of computer science. 
I am quite interested in giving myself a leg up and making my journey through school easier, and I am also quite worried at what to expect when getting close to graduation and finding a job.
1.  What books or resources can I use outside of my classroom that provide good knowledge and practical applications to problems? (I don’t have a specific one in mind as I have never coded or anything before.)
2. I currently work as an Electrical distribution designer, and programming is far different than what I do now. Will I still be able to find a job working remotely? Could any of my skills as a engineering designer carry over?
3. What should I expect in terms of salary and possible benefits once I have graduated from college? 
4. What is the job market like? Mainly how long should I expect to take applying for jobs before I actually get one? What metrics do most companies use to find their candidates?
5. What are the different job titles should I be looking for when applying for jobs?
6. Is it a good idea to try to find a job in the programming field while in my second year of college? Is that something feasible or would I have to be an unpaid intern?
7. What is the potential employment growth over the next 10 years or so?
I know these are a lot of question, but I would be very interested to see what everyone has to say and their answers. I have been looking through this sub-Reddit for some time and felt this maybe the ideal place to ask these questions.
Thank you for your time!"

Idk what i should do rn cause I am in college should i turn into a man whore after i lose my vcard to the most random chick  and rip it like a bandaid or should i just wait for the right one cause I'm in college bro this is the highlight of my life these are the years where i should be making love to multiple girls cause everytime i think of becoming a whore i thinl of how in the future when i meet the right one I'll regret being a whore in my college life and not waiting for her.

Till today there has only been one girl only one that i was fullt confident i could lose my virginity to and not regret it but of course she doesn't like me back but now i know what it would untimately feel like doing with someone i love like just imagining me and her being face to face where i could feel her breathe on me would turn me on and even during post nut charity i was sure she was the one i wanted to lose my vcard to

Yesterday my college bestfriend told me how he has had sex with 3 different girls in the same month and all of them work at the same place he interns at while he was askinb me advice on if he should or shouldn't break up with his girl who has a bad rep for being too friendly....bro this guy was legit so uncool when we become friends he litetally changed in college and has turned into this fuckboy and I'm just sitiing there a virgin and being brutally ignored by the only girl he likes like👁👄👁

I've had days where u am like fuck i should fuck this girl already but then in the morning I'm like it's not worth it but i also think if i save myself for a girl oneday and she breaks my heart after i lose my vcard to her I'll regret all these years saving up for her

The reason i am asking for advice rn is cause i matched with this girl on bumble and she asked me if i was a virgin and i said yes and and today i jokingly asked if she wanted to come over and she said ""tomorrow?"" And i kinda awkwardly changed the topic to which she asked ""why are you on bumble then?"" So this girl is literally over here giving me and here i am overthinking shit 

People have always told me i was attractive and are shocked when i tell them i am a virgin and my cousin keeps joking about how i must be a whore in college but i am here knowing i am a virgin loser 

But i think i have the potential to be a whore just not the balls ....i am confused cause this shit makes me super insecure in college there are so many beautiful girls out here and i feel like i am missing out.


I just needed some harsh and real elder sibling advice just let it be genuine cause this will affect my entire life."

I have a background in biology and a little organic chemistry (final semester in my bachelors) but realised I also appreciate math and programming during my internship and final year project. (I went through almost half of the chapters in linear algebra and its applications by David C. Lay, completing 80% of its associated problems and felt like it was as fun as playing Monster Hunter World or Guild Wars 2.)

However, I am unable to find any placement statistics for the masters, is this considered a red flag?  Additionally, MH6211 Analytics Software I and MH6212 Analytics Software II cover SAS which according to some, is not really used in industry? I was also unable to find any reviews. I googled the degree on linkedin and found that some alumni who had the degree are still data analysts 4 years after the degree while others are data scientists. Are data analysts considered entry level positions compared to data scientists? Can someone point out anything that stands out in the curriculum?

Am I better off with Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMS Analytics)? I do have some basic knowledge of linear algebra, programming with python and introductory classical physics and do prefer learning on my own. Then there is also the [masters in data science by the same university](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/graduate-programme/master-of-science-in-data-science-(msds)) but that seems to be too competitive for a non-CS major to get into. Or is the data science field too saturated right now for non-CS majors?

Hi everyone. 
Hope all is well. I am a CS undergraduate ( 20 y.o, female). Next Monday, I will be starting my new internship. I came home from uni since it will be face to face. 
İ was really hyped up about this. İt is my first internship. But my dad (electrical engineer, 55y.o) kinda brought my mood down by saying I would probably do no real work and carry everyone's coffee or tea.

İs that true?
What should I say if I am asked to do something irrelevant?
How to behave around the company? 
Also, what should I learn about the internship before I go, like what should I ask the HR person?
I already asked about the working hours, İ know that I will be getting no salary. Should I learn my mentors name by asking it to the HR?
Should I bring my computer?
Least but not least, what to wear? İ don't think it's important but anyways.

You will be helping a anxious undergrad in CS. Thanks everyone."

United Nations Building: New York City

One of the most important places on Earth was the United Nations Building in New York City. Doubly so for the Security Council chambers. The massive wooden desk, shaped as a horseshoe, dominated the room. The shape chosen both to convey a feeling of equality and so a speaker or presenter could stand in the middle. The furnishings, the lighting, everything in the room placed emphasis on that table and those seated at it. It was one of the most influential places in the world, and right now, it was one of the most aggravating, infuriating, and frustrating.

""The Peoples Republic of China has been more than patient up to this point, but further posturing by the Americans will not be tolerated! Recall your carrier groups from Taiwan and your Orbital Strike Groups away from ""Tiangong IV""!"" Ambassador Lao Jian Yi was practically foaming at the mouth.

The American Secretary of State, William Erikson, scoffed. ""The United States must, again, refute your claim. According to the 'DOC,' an agreement YOU reaffirmed four years ago, the South China Sea is to be shared by China and the surrounding nations! Furthermore, we, once again, refuse to recognize your claims to the Taiwanese Republic of China. We hereby call for sanctions against the PRC until they rescind their blockade of the region.""

""You dare call for sanctions against us? We are the victim here! The United States should be sanctioned for their blatant, warmongering and imperialist actions in this conflict! They continue to oppress the weaker nations of--""

""Ha! You may have been able to claim you were a victim back in 1945, but the fact is, you don't get to play the ""poor victim"" card when you have the largest army, navy, and the most nuclear weapons! And what about the human rights violations in Hong Kong last year?""

""The situation in Hong Kong was regrettable--""

""Regrettable?! You killed them! Students! Children! I'll bet you sat in your ivory tower and laughed you--""

""GENTLEMEN, PLEASE!"" Alvis Vogt, representing the United Federation of European Nations, and chair of this meeting, slammed her gavel down hard. She pinched her nose. They had been at it like this all day. ""Ambassador Lao, your country did indeed reaffirm and renew the DOC back in '43. You agreed to a peaceful sharing of the South China Sea with all neighboring parties. Your country does not have the right to search and seize cargo ships passing through international waters. If you continue to press the issue, I will be forced to call a vote to remove China from the Security Council. We are here to lead by example and keep international peace. What message does it send if a member of the security council violates treaties whenever it suits their interests?""

Alvis gave him a pleading look. She liked the man. She even considered him a friend personally. Alvis understood his love for his people, and the two had bonded over a shared vision of a peaceful world where the interests of humanity as a whole took precedence over matters of pride, prestige or short-term quarterly gains. Unfortunately, ever since the shift in Beijing's administration two years ago back towards the Xi Game, the man was caught in a vice: his ideals on one side, and the current Party Leaders on the other. This made him politically difficult to deal with, not that she blamed him.

Ambassador Lao was silent for a long moment, and Alvis watched him go through a variety of emotions in rapid succession. Shock, pain, rage, and finally, resignation. The motion to remove a permanent member from the Security Council required a unanimous agreement among the other members. While Russia would surely vote in China's favor, having such a vote called at all would cost Lao more than just his career. He couldn't push too hard here. The man sat down his eyes staring at his pen.

""About damn time."" Erikson muttered, not quite under his breath. Alvis felt rage rushing to the surface. Jian Yi was her friend. He lost his nephew in the Hong Kong protests. While he was a student, and he did oppose China's renewed expansionism, the young man new that anything he did could have repercussions for his favorite uncle. After the PLA starting shooting, Jian Yi had stayed up for days making phone calls, sending emails, and watching the news. When he learned his nephew had been killed saving a child from a burning building, Jian Yi had sunk deep into the bottle for the next six months.

""As for *you*,"" Alvis Vogt shot him a glare not bothering to mask her venom, ""Your attempts to provoke the Chinese ambassador are blatantly obvious. If you continue to do so, I will be forced to conclude that you are deliberately sabotaging these proceedings and motion to eject you from this meeting.""

*That* got Erikson to shut his damn mouth. *Why did* ***he*** *have to be here?*

The current American President had a clear Anti-China policy. While the shift in Beijing's leadership was an issue of legitimate concern for any democratic nation, the President's Anti-China stance wasn't based on trade disputes or concerns about military buildup. The man lost his wife and daughter in a drive by shooting. LA was experiencing another wave of gang violence at the time, and the gunman happened to have Chinese parents. Even if his bitterness was understandable, he continued to blame an entire country of nearly two-billion souls and who knows how many more of Chinese ancestry for the deaths of his family. Of course, this meant that he appointed a Secretary of State who also held anti-Chinese views. And that's what lead to her sitting at the same table as *him*.

Erikson was the polar opposite of Lao. The American Secretary of State was often, politically, easy to deal with on most issues. The United Federation of European Nations (UFEN) and the United States both tended to value individualism, democracy, free trade, and the right of nations to govern themselves. On most issues, their governments had a habit of agreeing which made agreements relatively easy to hammer out. Personally, Erikson was an asshole and a racist. Every member of his senior staff, without exception, was white, and his two closest staffers both had blonde hair and blue eyes. There were rumors Erikson was descended from Nazi leaders that fled to Argentina after the Second World War, a rumor that made Alvis's skin crawl. The idea that she had to shake hands with, what was most likely, a Nazi, deeply unsettled her. As a Deutschlander and Franconian, she wanted nothing more than to write his name in a little black notebook and watch him die of a heart attack. Even so, the man was a shrewd negotiator and excellent diplomat...well, usually.

The Brazilian representative Agueda Cruz raised her hand. Alvis nodded. ""The situation is a complicated one, and emotions are high. Brazil motions for a recess so we can all return more refreshed.""

""Japan seconds the motion."" Yamajiro Goro was normally very good at masking his emotions, but even he was showing signs of exasperation and...anger?

""The motion stands. We will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:00 A.M."" Her gavel came down. Alvis waited to be sure the cameras and dictation machines were off as she packed up her collection of notes, files, and pens. Anything electronic could be accessed remotely, hacked, or infiltrated. With physical documents, you had to get eyes, or, at least, a camera on them. Everyone in these meetings relied on physical paper, typewriters and pens. Once she was sure the records were closed for the day, she stood and walked to where the Japanese and Chinese Ambassadors were talking.

English was the language typically used in the United Nations, but both Ambassador Yamajiro and Ambassador Lao were speaking Chinese.

Goro was speaking. ""--isn't worth your energy. I've never met a bigger asshole in my life. And I've met Admiral Becker! He shouted at his aide for using the wrong tea set!""

Jian Yi cracked a small smile at that. ""Oh, I know. If you recall, I was on that same tour you were. I seem to recall helping a certain Japanese ambassador after he slipped on a puddle of oil.""

""I'm still upset that the suit was ruined. It was my favorite suit. Ambassador Columbo had it made for my 25th wedding anniversary.""

Alvis joined the duo, speaking in perfect mandarin. ""How is your wife these days? Would you two care to join me in my apartment for dinner?""

""She's doing well, although she wishes I were home more. Nothing new there."" Goro laughed at his own joke. ""I'd love to join you. Jian?""

""I'd like to, but I really should get back. I have a lot of work to do tonight.""

""A shame. I just happened to pick up a couple bottles of Irish Whiskey during my recent visit to Dublin. 10 years old."" Goro smiled like the Cheshire cat.

""Oh, alright."" Despite himself, Jian Yi smiled. He did love a good Irish Whiskey. Being a diplomat exposed him to many foreign cultures, and he truly did love his fellow man. ""What time should we all meet?""

""Why don't you both come by my place at 7? That should give us all time to file any reports or updates we need to before then."" Alvis turned to see Agueda Cruz standing up to leave. ""What about you, Agueda? Care to join us for dinner and drinks?""

The Brazilian turned and smiled. ""Sure, why not? I'll see you all at 7.""

The four ambassadors each made their way out of the room and towards their offices. Politics aside, the four were good friends, and it promised to be an eventful evening.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9:40 PM Ambassador Alvis Vogt's Apartment: 48th Floor

Dinner proved to be a lively affair. Alvis's wife, Constance, had prepared a lovely French onion soup, Schnitzel made with pretzel crumbs and peanut oil, and a fresh baked loaf of rosemary bread. The group of diplomats enjoyed dinner and conversation with Alvis, Constance, and their children. The patient and warm Goro and Jian Yi contrasted with Agueda's uproarious laughter and Constance's bubbly-ness. After Constance put the children to bed, the group moved out to the balcony. The group discussed everything from the finer points of their favorite coffee, a key piece of survival kit for any diplomat, to the newly completed Gibraltar mass driver.

Constance Vogt, while not a diplomat, was an American polymath with PHD's in theoretical physics, linguistics, 19th and 20th century history, and MD's in both human and veterinary medicine. As a result of her differing perspectives and experiences, the group loved debating and discussing aspects of policy and current events with her, even if it technically skirted the line for what was and wasn't classified.

The topic eventually moved to the American-Chinese Cold War and the effect it was having on space exploration and exploitation. By this time, the group had finished off both bottles of Irish Whiskey, a bottle of premium Californian Red Wine, and were half way into a bottle of Cachaça that Agueda had brought with her from Rio de Janeiro.

""While the new Cold War has been a major headache diplomatically, you've got to admit its done wonders for our understanding of space exploration and exploitation."" Constance took another sip of her wine. ""Tiangong 4 isn't so much a station as it is a city! What your people have accomplished is quite impressive, Jian.""

""That is true."" Jian Yi took sampled the cachaça that Agueda had provided. It was sweeter than he preferred, but he still enjoyed it. ""We are lucky enough to live in an era where we can vacation on the Moon if we so wish."" He paused and took a another sip. ""Even so, I can't help but think of a curse so often misattributed to my people: May you live in interesting times. While my people may not have coined the phrase, these are certainly interesting times.""

""Indeed they are. The current tech booms we are seeing may be a boon to economics and space resource utilization, but it is a direct outgrowth of the ongoing series of crises we find ourselves in."" Agueda chuckled grimly. ""Do you know why Brazil is spearheading the Martian Terraforming project? It's because we need that technology to reclaim the Amazon desert. The blasted tycoons and officials of the late 20th century cleared out the rainforest to make way for farms and industry. Then the rain stopped. You know why? Because the forests retain water and re-emit it into the atmosphere! The rain fed the forest and the forest fed the rains! Kill one, you lose the other!""

Goro nodded. ""True. I am fortunate that my people took such proactive steps. If it wasn't for our joint efforts with the Federated European Nations, the sea levels would be much higher than they are. As it stands, the tide walls are keeping much of our population safe, but if they fail, then half our population drowns."" A small, sad smile graced the gentle man's lips. ""My children saw snow for the first time last New Years. It was the first time I'd seen it in...probably twelve years.""

""Oh!"" Constance perked up suddenly. ""Speaking of world saving eco-projects, have you two seen the Atlantis proposal?""

Goro nodded and Agueda shook her head. ""I've heard of it, but don't know the details. Jian?""

""I seem to recall one of the interns babbling about it, but I was so absorbed with the prep for today's meeting, I didn't really pay attention."" A sheepish grin graced his features.

Alvis rolled her eyes. *Here it comes.* Constance's eyes gleamed. They were the eyes of a dreamer, an optimist. Someone who still believed in all the potential for good in humanity even with the constant specter of mutually assured destruction. As a career diplomat, Alvis Vogt found her optimism replaced by cynicism long ago. Trying to get people to stop genocides and mediate religious wars tended to do that to a person. Constance's bubbly, illogically humanist perspective on the world was absolutely maddening at times. It was also why she deeply loved her wife. Even if she couldn't bring herself to believe in the good of humanity, she loved that her wife could.

""So!"" Constance punctuated this simple word loudly setting down her glass. ""You remember how the royal wedding last year right?"" The group all nodded. Everyone remembered. The wedding of Prince Olivier James Windsor to Princess Yamato Sakura (Sakura is her given name) was a media extravaganza. There were very few monarchies left in the world. Royal weddings were rare enough. But for a prince to marry a princess in the mid 21st century? That was a major event, even if both royals were last in line for their respective thrones. The joining of a Prince of Britain with a Princess of Japan was a charming blend of the contemporary and the traditional with two (abridged) ceremonies: one Anglican and one Shinto Buddhist. The reception immediately after was every bit a modern party. It just happened to feature Prince Olivier's favorite J-pop band and Princess Sakura's favorite Punk band. Suffice to say, you'd have to be living off grid to never hear about it.

""Well, The Atlantis Project is a proposal for a massive experiment. Imagine a city sized geo-climate stabilizer the size of a small city with geo-thermal power, a surface to orbit mass driver, and enough housing for fifteen thousand people. They want the community to be a combination of engineering and support staff and their families at first, but will eventually expand into a full scale, sustainable, self sufficient city."" Constance's eyes shone with excitement.

""Okay, that sounds good in theory,"" said Agueda skeptically. ""But the resources required would be astronomical and I can't imagine any country donating land for it."" Jian Yin nodded his agreement.

""That's the thing! They want to build a floating city! Tether it to the sea floor near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in international waters. Since it would be outside the range of any country's exclusive economic zone, there wouldn't be any territorial disputes either! And they've already got most of the funding they need!""

""How in the world did they man--""

**Brrrrrrr! ... Brrrrrrrr!** Alvis grimaced and looked at her watch. Only three people could get a call through when her phone was in Do Not Disturb mode. Her wife, Constance, her mother Anna, and... ""Scheise...I have to take this."" She stepped away from the group to the edge of the balcony. ""Klaus, das sollte besser wichtig sein. Ich bin mitten in heiklen Verhandlungen...Was?! Sie sind sich sicher? Okay. Ich werde in einer Stunde zurück sein."" Ambassador Vogt of the United Federation of European Nations turned back to her guests and her wife. ""I'm sorry, I've been called into the office, it's urgent."" Then to her wife, ""I'm sorry, I won't be home tonight. Don't wait up.""

""Is everything okay, dear? Klaus sounded--""

Just then, three more phones began to ring in rapid succession. Dread filled the hearts of everyone present as the phones of Ambassador Lao Jian Yi of the Peoples Republic of China, Ambassador Agueda Cruz of the Federative Republic of Brazil, and Ambassador Yamajiro Goro of Japan all began to ring. All of them were recalled to their offices effective immediately. Constance held her hand to her mouth. ""Is it...?""

The Ambassadors all looked at one another, then back at their friend. ""We don't know yet. But pack a bag and try to get the kids to your mom's in Buffalo, just in case. I'll call you as soon as I can."" Alvis gave her wife a kiss as the four ambassadors hurried to leave.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9:12 AM Tuesday, August 20th, 2047

The members of the UN security council had all been seated ahead of schedule. Everyone except for Secretary of State William Erikson. Alvis couldn't decide if she was more relieved or annoyed. She loathed the man. But they couldn't well start the meeting without the American delegate. Looking around the table it was clear that the other delegates had similar thoughts on the matter. Suddenly, the doors swung open and in stepped not Erikson, but a woman in a suit flanked by another person in a crisp uniform, and a man with a NASA badge. ""Sorry to keep you waiting, folks."" The woman gave a polite smile and nod. ""My name is Isabella Miranda Hernandez, and I'm the US Secretary of Defense. Behind me are General Kristopher Torres III of the Space Force and Tyler Newman Jr, Director of NASA. Normally, I'd be happy to make pleasantries and shake hands, but I think we'd all rather get down to business. Any objections?""

The British delegate, James Pentecost, raised a hand. ""Just a question. Where is Erikson?""

""Certain members of the Pentagon believed he is too combative given the nature of what we are to discuss today. The White House."" Satisfied, Pentecost lowered his hand. ""I suspect those of you with your own space agencies are already aware of this, but at approximately 21:21 last night, Eastern Standard Time, NASA detected a cluster of several large objects passing through the Kuiper belt on a trajectory towards the inner solar system. NASA quickly contacted other space agencies to confirm their sightings, and JAXA, the ESA and Roscosmos all confirmed the data."" Hernandez gestured to Director Newman who stepped forwards.

Director Newman spoke with an accent that simultaneously reminded her of the Upper Midwest and West coast of the US. He seemed like he would have been as at ease at a wild bachelor party as he would working furiously in a lab. Alvis had heard that Dr. Richard Feynman was like that, he commonly worked on quantum physics papers in strip clubs., Newman, however, had his energy suppressed by clear signs of fatigue. ""Esteemed colleagues, first, I must apologize for my appearance. I just arrived on a red eye flight from Huston, and haven't slept in a few days."" He took a deep gulp of his coffee. ""The reason why I'm here, the reason this meeting's agenda has changed is because of these objects.""

""So, are we going to be hit by an asteroid strike? We have space combat ships now. Not to mention we could change their trajectory and mine them for resources. Why are you wasting our time?"" The Argentine representative was clearly annoyed. Dr. Newman was unfazed.

""Normally, sure. But these objects are anomalous. We found them because they were emitting heat. More than they should have. A series of 13 objects, each roughly nine cubic kilometers in volume, all of them moving towards the inner solar system, emitting heat..."" he paused and took another gulp of coffee. ""...And *slowing down.* Ambassadors, it doesn't take a genius to understand the implications here.""

""You're telling me that you think these are flying saucers?"" The Argentine Ambassador scoffed in annoyance and disbelief.

""No, they're flying tetrahedrons."" Newman rolled his eyes. ""These are 13 perfectly proportioned triangular pyramids in space. They're emitting heat and they're *slowing down.* If slowing down when you're falling towards a star doesn't scream space ship, then what does?""

""This...this has to be some kind of joke."" The Indian representative this time. ""You expect me to believe your claim that aliens are inbound?""

Ambassador Lao motioned to speak. ""It's true. My government's military and space observatories have confirmed it.""

""As have mine,"" Alvis chimed in. The other ambassadors, those without developed space agencies or assets were stunned. Vogt, Lao, Yamajiro and Cruz had all night to digest the news. Alvis felt bad for her counterparts who hadn't but she pressed to move on. Time was limited. ""The reason we are bringing this up is because we need to formulate a plan of action.""

""You mean what to do with the aliens."" Atony Pavel had made a statement, not a question.

""Yes, but there's a more pressing issue: what do we tell the public?"" Hernandez's face was grim.

""Why do we need to tell them anything?"" Pavel asked. ""We can keep this classified until we formulate a response. Control the information.""

""No, we cant."" Newman finished his coffee. ""These objects are large and producing a lot of heat. Anyone with a decent telescope, any civilian with a telescope and a cell camera mount, will be able to spot these things soon. I expect the internet will be abuzz by the beginning of September. We need to preempt this if we want to avoid panic.""

The meeting went on for the rest of the day and into the next, and both the US and China were cooperative during this process. Anyone who could build ships that big, and send them into another solar system...who knows what else they could do?"

I loved the frontend work I was doing there but after 8 months the company laid off a ton of orgs. and I was impacted.

I've been applying places since the fall of last year. Over 200+ applications for entry level positions, and I was able to get to On-Site stages for companies like Yahoo, Google, IBM, GoDaddy, Turo, and some smaller companies. I never got an offer from any of those interviews and I'm currently feeling a little stuck, since the majority of the feedback I have gotten is that I was great, but they went with someone with more experience.

I think since I was able to get a good amount of interviews, I am thinking my resume may be good enough, but might need to relook at it.

(remote work options, job hopping, pidgeonholing, and other such concerns)",Schwanz_senf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/109c6hn/5_year_plan_for_a_soontobe_grad_with_an_uncertain/,"Hello! I'm having concerns over my short term future and career progression and would like some advice on what my general plan should be.

**TL;WR:**

* I am graduating this December
* After graduating, I expect 3-4 moves within the next 3 years
* Most of the remote work I'm finding online is web dev and .NET
* I don't think I would mind doing that for a couple of years, but I don't want to make a career out of it, and I don't want to pidgeonhole myself this early
* If I do find local work instead of remote work wherever I move to, I will have to job hop, and I'm worried that multiple 1 year stints looks bad on a resume
* I'm interested in pursuing my masters through the OMSCS program (for my own edification and not to increase my salary, strictly speaking) and I'm wondering if that will open doors for me/negate any potential pidgeonholing from doing something like .NET development for 3ish years.

---

I am graduating this December with a degree in computer science from a state school in a middle-of-nowhere state. My Fiancée is graduating from pharmacy school a couple months later in May, and we are getting married shortly afterwards (and ideally sooner rather than later starting a family).

&amp;nbsp;

After Pharmacy school, she plans to do two 1 year residencies, which is where my troubles and concerns stem from. Because of the way residencies are assigned, we won't know where we are going to end up until some time in March. Even when we do know where we are going to end up, we are only *guaranteed* to be there for a year. She may hate the program and apply somewhere else, or not get the residency she wants and wants to move, or it may be a rotation that doesn't offer a second year residency.

&amp;nbsp;

So I am going to graduate in December, move six months after that, maybe/probably move a year after that, and then probably move a year after that again.

&amp;nbsp;

This summer, I am doing an internship with a sizeable corporation. They generally extend part time offers into the fall semester to interns who do a good job over the summer and hire those interns when they graduate. It's a hybrid WFH/in office job though. My fiancée and I have been doing the medium distance relationship thing for a while now, and I would really like to fully move in together right after I graduate, which would prevent me from accepting a position there after I graduate. I also don't know how much they would appreciate it if I accepted a position after graduating only to move six months later.

&amp;nbsp;

With the amount of uncertainty about my physical location, remote work seems almost imperative for my short term future. Most of the remote work I'm finding is for web dev and .NET type stuff, which I'm not interested in making a career out of. I'm worried that if I start down that path, I'm gonna be stuck doing that sort of thing.

&amp;nbsp;

Any and all advice appreciated. Thank you."

Looking for advice.,Tydalj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/109dvy8/new_grad_having_a_very_hard_time_finding_a_job/,"Some details about me: I'm in my late 20s. Prior work experience in a technical but non-SWE field. Veteran. Just finished my CS degree.

I've applied to a ton of jobs over the past 1 year plus (previously internships, now full time jobs). Have had a decent amount of interviews, but zero offers. 

I know how to code pretty well. In my coding interviews, for over half of them I answered the question without issues (whiteboarding) or passed all of the test cases (hackerrank-style OAs). 

I understand that right now is a pretty terrible time to be looking for an entry level job. Companies seem very picky. I'm not one of those people who can't do fizzbuzz or just started coding 3 months ago. I can code quite well.

Should I continue applying? 

Alternatively, I have been accepted to a top MS in CS program, so I could put the job search on the side for awhile to pursue it. I could also attend a coding bootcamp to get more projects/ practical skills for free, since I'm a veteran.

My main concern is that I don't want to sit around an accomplish nothing if I don't get a job for months. I also don't want to focus on school if the market will be even worse in the next few months to a year.

What's the best way forward? Thanks in advance for the advice."

then after saying my expected salary, ive gone through with the technical interview (more on questions abt my internship experiences and what projects ive done before) and had a final interview with one of the executives in the company earlier. i thought it was the last one but after the interview, i got an invite for a scheduled interview at 3am PST tomorrow with the head of operations. 

id like to get your opinion because im thinking of asking for more compensation because of the time difference since my working hours would be around 10PM to 6AM PST. they said they’re kinda flexible but employees are expected to attend meetings within the working hours. 

also, do i have the right to ask for the rate in their region which is in other country? im also thinking of asking for more compensation considering ill be sacrificing my normal sleeping schedule, health, social life and academics. i support myself so i need to have an active source of income. altho, aside from this, ive got an internship offer from a PH based company for 12k/month only (8-hr commitment too)

what do u think? i think it would be hard for me to get this kind of offer from international company because i set my mind that there is a high possibility of having difficulty in applying for job once i graduate because of competition. there will be some jobs available but i think most of them will offer below my expected salary. this is why i want to leverage this opportunity of working with the international BPO company for future job hopping plans.

(Is a Product Manager actually the job that I want or is there something adjacent that I should be aiming for)

Background: 
I graduated in 2021 with a CS degree. This is my first real job. 

I accepted a position as a PM at a tech start up/company I worked part time for (as of now, I have worked there now for 4 years total: 8 months internship, 1.75 years part time, 1.5 years full time). I was originally hired there as a intern doing minor tech support/client projects, I started scripting out a lot of their manual work and they decided to keep me on as part time when I went back to school. Long story short, the PM before me left and they asked if I wanted the position. I’ve done some more coding there (internal php tools that others use and a php endpoint — nothing too major) and I really enjoyed it. 

Why I want to leave: 
Bad management and no company culture.  not sure if I’d rather stay 100% remote or do hybrid (I feel alone everyday in my apartment just working by myself)

I am still doing the same tasks (for the most part) that I did as an intern. I’ve talked to my boss about it and he basically said I will never be let off of these tasks (which takes up about 40% of my time, so he doesn’t put me in any more development/software projects since I don’t have time to do them). 

The other PM stuff I do:
- write all spec docs for front end and backend devs (also answer their questions about the feature, if I’m not sure I ask around but I’m the point of contact for new feature development)
- report/record bugs (I also figure out if it’s FE/BE, which dev is best to fix it, etc) 
- run scrum (not a real scrum I think, I basically go around the zoom screen asking each person about their tasks and any blockers)
- assign all tickets/tasks to FE, BE and designer
- go through backlog 
- go to design meetings and approve/give feedback on designs for new features
- “approve” changes (I’m the product owner , so I sign off on the FE and BE tickets before they are pushed)
- create/organize/tell devs about next releases, which tickets are needed, etc (I do a final QA right after they release to make sure it went well)
- organize all feedback from sales and clients and put into actionable tickets items (if deemed necessary at a monthly review session) 
- write release notes 
- work with my boss and other PM to outline/present quarter goals (basically me and the other PM advocating for certain features/major bug fixes because of client feedback or asks from sales etc)

Im pretty good at python and have fair understanding of Java, SQL, and php.

I like the problem solving aspect of my job a lot and love writing little scripts. I don’t mind writing spec documents but hate answering the little questions that don’t matter (eg “which of these two very similar icons is better”). I don’t love directly managing people but can put up with it (onboarding and interviewing people is stressful right now). I hate having to answer to sales immediately (every problem is urgent). 

I just wear so many different hats right now and I’m not sure if that’s part of being a PM or just this company. I also feel I’m not THAT creative when problem solving (especially when it’s a technical problem that I have no understanding of what the problem is). 

My questions: is this a normal PM role? Is there a different job that does only the tasks I like (I’ve gotten recruiter emails for product ops and data manager roles)? Do you have any advice for someone like me?

Thank you!"

I‘m currently in an internship in RPA. Due to personal reasons it was the only internship I could find. It’s not what I want to be doing. Actually I think it’s quite far from what I want to be doing, but I didn’t really found an alternative.

I already had done a lot of coding. My undergraduate had programming courses which did give me many chances to learn Java, Kotlin, C++ and Matlab. In my free time I also learned a bit JavaScript and Python. So the whole RPA thing is pretty easy. And I kind of dislike it. I think I don’t really learn anything from this internship on a technical level and that I’m wasting my time. That pretty much destroys my motivation and my self-esteem. I‘m already 3 months into this internship and there aren’t even 2 months left till it’s finished. I felt empty the last few months with no real interest or passion about the job. 

Next week I need to present my internship to the other students and I’m nervous. Normally a presentation isn’t really a problem for me but presenting something I‘m not proud of and showing that I wasted the last few months. 

I just wanted to ask what you guys think. I‘m most likely overreacting about this and should just continue. It’s only an internship after all"

It was pretty extensive with a lot of different parts and new technologies (SPI, shift registers, PCB design) I had to learn to make it work the way it does. However, I wrote the code in probably the worst way possible with so many global variables that you don’t know what is for what functionality as a person reading through my code and barely using pointers and instead passing everything by value into functions, even a few structures which I know now is not optimal. I just graduated so I’m looking for a job working with embedded systems preferably but I wouldn’t mind just software. Would it be better to rewrite the entire code to demonstrate I can write clean code that is easier to understand, or move on and start working on some side projects I’ve been wanting to for a while(building a small digital piano that uses capacitive touch sensors)? All of this is mostly to put on my resume since I have no other experience (no internships, no revelant job experience) and am having a tough time finding a job at the moment."

Because I’m older with a family and work PT while going to school FT, I don’t really have time to pursue a research internship unfortunately. I have applied for a few research internships but I’m assuming that I’m not a very favorable candidate due to time constraints. At this point, it doesn’t seem likely that I will be able to gain research experience before applying and transferring.

For those who’ve gotten in/completed either program, do I even have a chance of being accepted if I have no research experience but maintain a highly competitive gpa? I’ve been told by multiple advisors that my chances of getting in w/o research experience will be difficult. One of my priorities when/if I get in is to work my way into a lab position somehow…but I have to actually get into one of these programs first.

In 2020, I enrolled in an online Computer Science BS program. and I am set to graduate in spring of this year. I already have a BA in political science and history. 

I recently interviewed for a position for an accounting clerk role at the property I work for. It seems like I might be offered the role (they're calling to discuss tomorrow).

In the last 6 months, I've been applying for tech roles that I'm theoretically qualified for.  Ideally, I'd like to become a full stack developer, or really just a java developer. I like the idea of getting into the game industry as well. I could also do IT, but I'd really need to be trained for it. 

Anyways, my dilemma is this:

If I take the accounting clerk role, my salary would be between 41k-51k USD a year. BUT, if I wait for a software development, or IT role, I would be set to make more, even just starting out. Additionally, a lot of the tech roles are work from home, better work life balance, etc. 

Additionally, my work wants a 2 year minimum commitment for the accounting clerk role. I'm not sure how punitive this would be, but it was one of the things they really talked about in the interview. 

On the tech side, I've heard that getting one's first gig in anything tech is quite hard. I've spent my entire college experience not even able to find an internship. Additionally, I've seen news report after news report talking about layoffs in the tech industry.... i.e. experienced people entering the market en masse. 

But most importantly, I don't know how confident I really feel in my demonstrable current technical ability. I spent the first 2 years back at college learning the fundamentals, and I'd only say that I've just now gotten to the point where I'd be confident to really produce anything. My github repos are pretty bare, and I really don't have much to ""show off"" in terms of things I've done. It's not that I'm not able to develop software, it's just that between a busy life, burnout, and a barebones program, I've been slow to really get any projects finalized. I'm hoping if I take the accounting role, I could build out a portfolio in my spare time. 

My last consideration is this. I'm so burned out. I've spent the first half of my 20s working absolutely crap jobs, and I'm not sure if the Accounting Clerk role will be much different. The pay isn't much better than what I'd make doing full time now (37K USD), and while the role seems decent, I don't know if I'd be able to really work on personal software projects if I took then position. 

So, it really comes down to this for me.  Do I take the accounting role, or do I try and hold out for anything in the tech industry when I'm fairly certain I'm a subpar candidate for anything there?

Any advice from software developers, accounting clerks, or people in similar positions?"

I have been dealing with social anxiety since I was 12. I was the girl in class who people thought was mute. I’m now 24 but it only started getting better for me a few months ago. I was in a very dark place where I was feeling extremely lonely and depressed in early 2022. I was in therapy but my anxiety still got so bad that I resorted to medication for help in the summer. I was scared and doubtful but did it anyways. After a few months of treatment, I am now feeling and doing much better. I’m now in a relationship after being single for 3 years. I applied for an internship in September at a very big company and did a group interview, and I was selected. I started the internship this month and it’s going well. It’s constant social interactions but I’m able to handle it. I was able to confront my sister/bully when she made negative remarks about me. I actually believe that I have self worth now. When I compare myself from one year ago, I feel so so different and I’m so much better. If you are like me one year ago (I.e. staying home, being on social media all the time, and going days without social interaction) please at least consider medication or any other treatment that you can get, you deserve to feel better."

Company B: 6 months - internship 

Company C: 1.5 years  

Company D: 1.5 years 

Company E: 1 year 

Company F: 1.5 years (current)

Does it look like my trend is 'job hopping' and hence a red flag for employers?

In actuality, only Company F and Company E had a permanent employment contract with me. The other companies had given me fixed term contracts for specific projects and i was technically working as an independent software service provider. However, if i separate my clients into different positions, i think it looks like I'm job hopping on my CV

Will my CV look better if I consolidate Company A to Company D into one 'Software Development Contractor's and list them as my clients, with the total period being 4 years?

After the change it would look like this:

Company A: 4 years

Company B: 6 months internship

Company C: 1 year

Company D: 1.5 years (current)


The name of company A will be 'Indendent Software Contractor' or something similar.


Another idea is to just remove Company A to C all together, if the negatives from it looking like job hopping is greater than the positives derived by additional experience.

What do you think?"

i know that since it's my first real experience in the job market there is no really bad choice but i got the impression that if you start working in SAP ERP you are stuck there and if you want to change you got to start from scratch and that the pay is not really that much better sometimes worse in the long run.

so my questions is Are the two really that much different and if i want to switch i will lose time? and is it worth it to even start in it.

Scotiabank, BMO and HSBC. Of the three, HSBC stand out due to its lower amount to waive fees and lower monthly fees. 

However, what these (or another option no mentioned here) will be good taking into account: CC, GIC, Loans, Insurance, etc.

And in regards to CC, they will be used to pay bills, food and trips to the hospital (newborn blues). Not sure if getting Cashback or Miles will be the better thin to look for (as international student with hopes of staying for the long haul).

Actually I'm working in a multinational company as intern and I decided to make my work here as the object of the my master's thesis. 

However, after the first weeks here in which I was the newcomer everyone was interested in and there were all small things to do, the workload dropped dramatically. I've spent some days literally watching the screen in the office before talking with my supervisor and ask for more work.

That resulted in me getting a task that I could resolve in like 20 minutes. The problem persisted, I asked again some other times but no significant task was assigned to me. To be honest, I don't think this is because the quality of my works was not ok, as I've always reached for feedbacks after them and never they were bad.

In the end, I got to the point I'm not asking for tasks anymore. First, because I prefer staying without doing anything rather than getting a very easy task just to keep me occupied, this giving me almost a little bit of hope for things to get better, but they never do. Second, because after several times I think it's a little bit humiliating: you hired me when you were looking for an intern, I suppose you need someone to do something, right?

As now, this thing is getting me so nervous I don't even feel like calmly confronting my boss about this. At the same time, it is overall bringing me down, I can feel myself shutting down more and more in the office and i can see me not being the best presence there, but damn, how can I feel in a group of workers while I'm literally just googling things of my interest?

Last, because of the thesis situation I mentioned at the beginning, I feel sort of tied to the internship until I'm done with the thesis, which will result in some months at least here.

I feel so frustrated and I'm literally talking about this with everyone I know. What do you think about this? How would you react to this situation in a mature way to turn it into a positive experience?"

I’m in my last year of uni, and to pass the year I need an internship to prove I have learned and can employ said learning in the professional world. I started looking at job offers pretty soon, right now I stil have 4 to 5 months to find one, so I’m not under a lot of pressure.

But still, I started looking pretty soon, and recently got 5 interviews in 5 different companies, and all of them made me an offer.

One of them I had as a backup plan but didn’t feel it from the start so I refused their offer after an interview that confirmed my choice. But the others…2 of them are not as close to what I want to do with my career and there’s no real opportunity to get a full job after the internship, so I wanted to decline too. (Haven’t done it yet, I'm still considering my choices)

The last 2, were the ones I had pretty high hopes and expectations in. They were exactly what I was looking for as a job, and the companies are pretty well known in the industry the operate in. So good names to have on a resume. I was hyped, and so happy to even be considered as a potential candidate. To me it was big, I don’t come from a big school so that kind of opportunity is huge, in theory.

But then, the interviews happened. And my whole perspective shattered.

Company A was offering a nice job on paper, but when they explained it to me in details, it wasn’t living up to the theory. It felt like it was mostly staring at a computer blankly, like I couldn’t get what they were actually doing all day. And the person I talked with felt very immature, she spend more time talking about how everyone was nice and how they were hanging out than what the job actually was. When I asked how she felt in the company, if she was happy there, she once again focused on the after work activities and parties. Also, the pay wasn’t great (for the real job promised at the end of the internship). So I didn’t think I would actually evolve and get a good work experience going there. I declined without guilt. I wasn’t feeling it. So that good opportunity wasn’t as good as I thought. I was already feeling pretty down.

Then company B. This time the job is a real job. Real missions, and responsibilities, even for the intern. Great ! The interview goes well, the guy is happy with me. So we go on to more casual talking, and once again the dream fades. The guy was very nice but started to be less nice. He told me how his colleagues had no back bones, that they were quitters and bad at team work. Why would you say that to me ? I asked once more a question about how the person feels in the company, with his job, and if he was content with it. He doesn’t say yes, instead he goes on to tell me that not everyone can get along with the manager. That a lot of people leave the company after only a few months, and that he even thought about leaving himself, more than once. So that’s not a good sign. He then proceed to tell me that he was working almost everyday until 7, and he though that you could only make it if you shut up and keep you head down, about how it's because he didn’t say anything and let people leave (so he could get their clients and missions I presume).

And ok I get you need to be resilient in the workplace but still ? If people leave so quickly it means there’s an issue, right ? And he ends it all by saying that his goal was to make money with nft and crypto (you do you) and that he doesn’t know if he’ll stay there long. I appreciate the honesty but that doesn’t make me want to accept...Especially since choosing this company would mean move to a new city, far from my family and where rent and living costs are extremely high. It kind of feels like a lot to sacrifices for a company that doesn’t sound that great.

So here I am, with 5 job offers and not one that I want to accept. I still have time to look for something else but I feel like I’m ungrateful ? Or entitled ? I have the chance to have those opportunities. I get to pick but am I allowed to say “none of them please” ? I know I might regret it, if I don’t find anything better but I feel like even if I accept I’ll end up regretting it. And if I regret my choice then I prefer to regret it in a place where my support system is, and where I can afford to live. I don't know how to feel.

It is in person and I would have pay 400 a month for relocation (money doesn’t bother me much when it comes to internships because i think the experience is a lot more valuable) and I would also have to fly back home for a few days for my cousins wedding which is inconvenient. I really liked the team and it seems pretty interesting. I think the biggest selling point is the fact that it’s in person. They also said there is a chance at a return offer if i do good. 

The second offer is at a small (500-1000 ppl) fintech. I think I would really learn a lot from them. They emphasized the good mentorship program they have and said there was a big learning curve for the cloud stuff. The biggest downside is the fact that it’s remote. I heard it’s a lot harder to make connections and network at a remote internship and it’s harder to ask for help and stuff. A lot of my other intern friends said there’s a really big difference in what you can get out of a remote vs in person internship. But I also really like the team and they seem like they really want me. My recruiter told me that out of all the prospective interns, I got the most votes by the people that interviewed me. I am so scared this means that the expectations will be high and my imposter syndrome is telling me I’m not good enough. But if I do good, they did say they give 40 percent of their interns return offers and that sounds pretty high. 

Should I just take CNH and try to push the remote one to a fall co op? I know that the chance of success for this varies by company, but they seemed to want me a lot for the summer, will this increase my chances of being able to push the internship? The recruiter also said she had to chase people down to get this approved for me early since I had a competing offer and I told them that they were my first choice. I’m scared that because of this, they may be annoyed or take back the offer if I try to push it.

Some of my academic activities:
Blue Origins Flight Project: In this project, our team did research on the growth of liquid crystals and their behavior in microgravity and different G forces that are experimented on during launch. The final goal of our experiment was to create a payload that would be carried in a Blue Origins flight and then examine the results. Unfortunately, our group did not reach the final milestone which was for only two experiments.

NASA TechRise Student Challenge: For this experiment, our group proposed the idea of using the D layer of the ionosphere as an electromagnetic medium and charging its high concentration of ions and free electrons, then using a vector network analyzer, measure the efficiency of the D layer as a medium and the production of ozone as a subproduct. We hope to determine the efficiency of the ionosphere for future research on the possibility of using it as an energy medium. As of right now, we are waiting for the selection of Nasa.

Bright Minds, Fresh Ideas (Entrepreneur research internship): For this project, we had to confront a social issue and do research on it to then create along with a business case, an entrepreneur business idea that would help to alleviate the phenomena while at the same time would attract investors and make a rentable business. At the end of the internship, we shared our project with an important group of people that were experts in business and would see our proposal, and even invest in it if they saw it viable.  

I was wondering if for make this stronger it's completely necessary to me to do a program like the Florida state university scholars (6 week in campus program), or MITES.
Otherwise I would probably try to find a program at the University of central Florida, and work over the summer
My goal is be able to go to a really good university, something like Columbia"

I deliberately chose a pretty broad major and I've done pretty fine (B-ish average overall, B- in my engineering classes).  I had an internship last summer with US Cellular in telecomm and I really enjoyed it but I pretty much fell into it as it was my only internship offer.  Now I need to find a full time job and I've been applying to many industries.  I have several months until graduation but I only have one offer on the table.  It's Mortenson Construction on the Solar/Renewables team.  It will have significant amount of travel in like 12-ish month chunks at a time.    I don't have any solar experience though I'm taking a class this spring in solar/led's.

I feel really confused about how my path will look if I accept a job and then decide I don't care for that industry.  Or what it even means to accept a job in a particular industry.  Does my telecom internship lock me into that path already?  (is it pure luck I got an offer in another industry?) Does taking a job in solar with a construction company lock me into that industry?  What happens if I'm unhappy with my job?  Can I get a job in another industry later or will my experience pigeon hole me in something I may not like?

the only other thing i can say is that I also have a business minor and I really enjoyed all those classes and I think it's about a 50/50 likelihood I pursue an MBA at some point.

I recently switched jobs (2 months in) to a more traditional marketing-based role (360 marketing + PR + comms role) and I came from a tech background (specialized social media marketing role). The switch has been hard and I've also been feeling like:

1. My talents in social media marketing is not really appreciated or growing at the current moment 
2. The culture of the working environment is SO OLD SCHOOL (e.g Shamed for taking MC, formal wear, no work from home or flexibility) I don't know if I can take it 
3. Boss is a bit of a dictator, a lot of things is dependent on her mood and what she feels like. Also I don't get clear direction in my work or what she wants out of me, a lot is figuring it out on the go and I believe I seek more mentorship/collaborative work &gt; being a one man team at the moment. 

At the same time, I do feel a bit burnt out/tired from the speed of tech but yet at the same time the current role feels a bit too slow for me to develop my career. Am pretty upset cause I did get an offer from a big tech company that I rejected for this role as at that time, I was hired by a friend - who was going to be my mentor but shortly she left due to some company restructuring. So these is also some disappointment in that.

Am unsure of how to move on from here and also am waiting for offers from a similar tech company that may be a bit more fast-paced, with also the potential of becoming overly fast-paced for me to manage. This is currently my second job. One of my fears is that if I continue staying here, I may not eventually be able to jump back into tech. 

Pros of staying:

* High paying for a traditional role
* Corporate discounts (think hospitality group)

Cons of staying:

* No career growth? Unsure about this aspect but tbh work feels a bit too painful or a dread daily, feel a bit more like a glorified intern at this point

I graduated from the University of Miami (I'm from California) with an Economics degree back in 2013 with hopes of landing a role in IB, which was quite a lofty goal coming from a non target, but I was quite young and naive at age 23 and I thought that it was possible. At the time, I thought that with proper networking, I could potentially weasel my way through. Consequently, I thought that my completing as many internships as I possibly could, I'd manage to eventually land a full time role; however, my parents, at the time, were pushing me into medicine, and I gave in and listen to them. 

To give you greater clarity into my situation, my time line is as follows:

May 2013: I graduated from the University of Miami with a degree of Economics.

July 2013- August 2013: I attended a three week long course on financial modeling and valuation through the Investment Banking Institute in New York, as I had thought that it would straighten my candidacy for a prospective role in IB/Management Consulting. 

August 2013-December 2013: I approached an internship placement company by name of Dream Careers- now defunct for obvious reasons- with hopes of the internship turning into a full time role; however, I turned out to be massively disappointed to find that I was cheated out of my money. Before I had made the payment of $7K, I was lured in by false promises of placement into a prestigious role as an analyst at Expand Research, a consulting firm; however, when I arrived to New York, I was dismayed to find role had already been filled and that I was placed into a securities firm that failed to provide me with adequate experience that I needed to progress in the Finance industry; i.e. they did not sponsor me for the Series 7 exam. 

December 2013: I returned back to L.A. and did an extensive search of finance firms with hopes of eventually landing an internship which I did at a boutique investment bank in Santa Monica. 

April 2014-June 2014: I was forced to work 80 hour work weeks without pay all for the sake of networking myself into the finance world. 

August 2014: My parents pressured into medicine, so I eventually undertook a post-bac program at Columbia where I took the requisite coursework for medical school. Two weeks into the program, I was robbed at gunpoint and I flew back to LA.

January 2015: I rejoined Columbia 

July 2017: I finished the program at Columbia.

July 2018: I sat the MCAT.

August 2020: I was accepted in Georgetown University School of Medicine, but didn't attend because my parents dissuaded me from joining, they kept using COVID and medical school debt as excuses to keep me from going, so I let the admission slip away from my hands. I know I was a massive idiot for listening to my parents, and now I'm paying for it. 

February 2022- August 2022: I completed the necessary coursework and passed the state exam to become a licensed real estate agent in the state of California, not that I think that it is a commendable feat in its own right because anyone with a pulse can pass the exam. 

January 2023: I find myself in a massive predicament, which I need to find a way out of because I cannot continue living my life like this. I have chalked out a timeline to keep as many doors of opportunity open so that if one shuts on my face I'll have the other one open, which is follows: 

January 2023: I enroll in WSP FP&amp;A bootcamp and receive the certification by the end of February so that I can list that on my resume, although I really don't know what my prospects are of landing an FP&amp;A role. 

March 2023: After I've attained my WSP certificate, I register to sit the MCAT for May 2023. I figure I could give medicine one last shot, and if it doesn't work out then at least I will know that it isn't for me. I purchase all the study materials for MCAT and spend the next 3 months studying for the MCAT. 

May 2023: I sit the MCAT and wait a month for my scores to come back. 

Granted that I do get into Georgetown University Medical School, do you think that becoming a doctor would even be a worthwhile investment in this day and age?

Do you think that I could eventually land a role in FP&amp;A with proper networking? I know that it is too late for IB at this point, as I'm too old and that ship has already sailed for me. 

While I do appreciate constructive criticism, I respectfully ask that you refrain from any abuse."

I have a bit of a unique situation here – I'm a senior at a well respected U.S. university studying a major that incorporates both humanities and computer science – took courses up to discrete math and data structures. I'm also fully funded for as long as I am in a ""bachelors"" program with roughly $50k left in the bank that I can only apply to tuition and housing. After I graduate this semester, I can no longer use that cash. Might be able to be a bit cheeky here...

**Should I take another year (fully funded, 2 semesters,) of school in a CS post-bacc if it's fully funded, or should I take an online masters while I work ($8000 out-of-pocket, 2 years-time)?** I'd be forgoing a decent salary next year (TC: \~90K) but I know I want to be more technical down the line and I'm sure I could break into a better role if I had another year of school, either in engineering or product management. 

My background:

My major is mostly a pipeline into law school, and I decided I didn't want to go to law school a bit late. When I made that pivot, I took on a product management internship and really enjoyed my time, I'm taking another product internship this semester. I also have a job lined up as a cybersecurity consultant at a tier-2 consulting firm for the upcoming fall with decent work life balance. I also might be able to push the job a year out, but I'm sure I could find something better in that time. 

My end goals: 

I've enjoyed coding quite a bit, I'm not excellent at it, but I know I could improve if I fully applied myself for a year. I could probably get a part-time job in the area as I only need 8 classes for my post-bacc. I absolutely wouldn't mind being a software developer, but I'd rather be a technical product manager because it plays better into my strengths. I have experience so I could break into a start-up. My end goal is to be a technical co-founder. As a consultant, I could build domain knowledge while doing the graduate degree as well, or just find a better job this semester. I'm really at a loss and my career center is utterly useless. Would love all your help! 

Thanks so much!"

My tech stack is Django, DRF, MySQL. I often require help from my senior to understand things. I also haven't understood the entire codebase properly just few things which I have worked on.

I am a slow learner. I want to ask is it okay to continuously ask for help from senior or peers?  I often feel bad while asking help because I'm interrupting them from their work . I am trying my very best to understand and perform well yet I suck. So how do I improve myself? Also, how do I feel less bad for sucking and more focus on myself?"

I have made Dean's list every semester and have a 3.5 GPA. On Christmas day, she decided to yell at me that I'm only allowed to have one beer. It was 4 in the afternoon and I hadn't had any drink that day. It was my first beer. Later that week, I was getting a physical to see if I could donate plasma. She decided to yell at me about how it is unhealthy and not safe even though I researched it heavily and did 2 hours of tests and paperwork to make sure I understand everything. She just yelled at me and would not let me explain. Then she called me lazy for no reason the other day. I have been sleeping in late all break. I guess she decided it was not acceptable, and she barged in my room and proclaimed that I am very lazy. She made me rake the leaves in the yard even though there were very few leaves and it did absolutely nothing. That same day she lashed out on me about an internship I was applying to. She yelled at me that the application was taking to long and that I am not going to have a summer like last summer. She was referring to the fact I didn't have a job over the summer. She acts like I didn't do anything. I did two summer courses and was a facilitator for a retreat. It is so frustrating to be treated like a child when I'm very responsible. It is also like I am not living up to her expectations even when I'm doing so well in life. I need to have a conversation with her about setting boundaries and reminding her I'm an adult.

TL;DR I am having lots of issues with my mom and I don't know how to handle it. It makes me not want to ever live here again."

\- Why did you pursue this pathway? Wanting to know your thoughts on the financial and personal aspects.

2. Your career trajectory in general (from junior to current role considering years)

Trying to gauge how people have navigated their career. For example, I personally don't do much software development after work, if at all. So I'm not expecting to move up the ranks very fast. But I'm interested in seeing what people have done with their lives and careers.

A sample response might be like:

John Doe - I personally haven't be driven to climb up the career ladder. I tried management and could have earnt a lot more money than being technical, but it wasn't my cup of tea.

As the title suggests, I have been struggling to find an internship for the past few months now. Before I get into the details, I'll provide a bit of background.

I'm currently a second and final year MSc Biology (2 yrs) international student in the Netherlands, and the way my program is designed, each year I am supposed to find an internship in order to progress and eventually graduate. The university recommends us to do the first internship in-house, meaning under the Faculty of Science and your respective department, only then for the second/last internship you get to choose to do the internship in a company or another university (company or university can be locally or internationally, students have the option). 

I successfully completed my first internship already back in September 2022 and ever since then have been stuck in a hole trying to find an internship here in western Europe. I have tried companies locally and several neighboring countries as well as universities (across the Netherlands) but my efforts have proven to be fruitless thus far. Companies either do not reply or that they are not hiring during this period. In the meantime, I have just been calling and sending emails on a daily basis, even spoke to my program/study advisor who gave me useful advice and suggestions but still nothing to show. Hell, I have even tried approaching/connecting with potential employers via Linkedin after receiving such advice but apparently for some I require the premium package, which I do not have, in order to send them a message

I feel like a failure because it's now January 2023 and due to my internship being a mandatory 6-month period in order to get the credits, this all means that I will definitely be graduating late. That, in turn, means more burden on my parents to financially support me. I just don't know what to do when the companies and the people I send my emails to do not reply at all."

10awtyh,0,2023-01-13,How do I negotiate a pay raise as an intern?,sulliops,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10awtyh/how_do_i_negotiate_a_pay_raise_as_an_intern/,"Hi folks, I'm a longtime member of this community. I've seen y'all give out some great career advice, so now I'm the one asking.

Basically, I worked a *fantastic* Helpdesk internship this past summer and both I and the company I worked for are interested in me returning. They reached out this morning and set up an interview with the new recruiting manager for next week.

I worked for $20/hr last summer, and, by the end of the summer, both the members of my team and especially my direct manager grew to know me, trust me, appreciate my work, and (very clearly jokingly) ask me not to go back to school. My manager claimed I made myself indispensable and specifically asked for me back with a potential pay raise.

Now that it's time to actually start negotiating that pay raise, I'm wondering about how not to oversell myself as an intern without underselling my worth. Now, I'm by no means the most experienced person around, but I do have an extensive IT resume for someone my age (20) and I'm fairly confident I could land a high-level IT/SysAdmin position if I weren't a full-time college student. In fact, I've been unofficially offered three such positions for after I graduate (two at this same company, one by the same manager). But, I'm well aware that they're hiring for an intern and that's different from a commitment to a long-term employee.

My idea is to value myself at between $28/hr and $30/hr, then negotiate down to $25/hr at bare minimum. The primary motivation for the 25% increase floor is that I'd be having to live in the city where this company is with my family for the summer, while still paying rent for my house where I go to school for 3 months. The higher bound comes from a valuation of myself as highly skilled for my age, as well as the fact that they know &amp; trust me and I'm already trained and familiar with their systems and procedures (minus anything they've added in the past \~year).

Am I selling myself short, or am I asking too much? How do I go about negotiating this raise without shooting myself in the foot and losing my chance to go back? I'm well aware that they're looking for the cheapest labor possible, and I could probably do fine just about anywhere else, but just assume for the sake of argument that this is the only option I have for the summer.

Thanks, folks!"

However, it is a small company that is using old tech stack such as jQuery and PHP. I am considering to reject the internship because of it, and apply for companies that uses more novel technology such as react, etc. Will that be a wise choice? However, I have this fear that I will not be able to find one after rejecting the offer, and become jobless next summer. I'd like to also check with seniors whether talent connect will populate with lots of internship openings in feb (time they ask us to apply) for atap and sip. I would like to gain some perspectives on this, please."

I also have a couple other stuff, like a couple of investment challenges and social work. Should I include those as well?

10b01bn,1,2023-01-13,Early Career Burnout + Feeling Lost. Any advice?,slothmodezzz,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10b01bn/early_career_burnout_feeling_lost_any_advice/,"Hello everyone,

Hope you're all well. I would like to ask for any advice or guidance from you all. I recently resigned from my job and is feeling a little burned out and lost at the moment. Any advice, suggestion, or personal stories on how you overcame similar issues are greatly appreciated! 

To try to sum things up as best as I can, since my college years I've been a bit laser-focused getting into the field that I was in (Psych grad, working in HR field). After graduating amidst the pandemic in 2020 and struggling to find a job for some time, I eventually landed an internship, which then continued to be a full-time job. I was in the company for almost 2 years, but after a while I realized that the job is not a good fit for me. I tried to hold on thinking I might just need time to settle in, but it led to burnout and it started to affect my personal wellbeing as well. Eventually, coupled with some unforeseen circumstances, I had to resign from the job earlier than expected, without any job offer on hand or even any idea on what else I want to do next. I honestly feel quite defeated and lost at the moment. And while I try to keep my mind positive, I can't help but feel anxious as well about finding a new job amidst the current economic situation, and a bit scared that I won't be able to find something that speaks to me too.

I guess I'm keen on learning from you all, especially those who might have experienced feeling lost after a career ""fail"": 

* How did you get out from that ""lost"" feeling? What were some of the first steps you did to find a direction to go to?
* What kind of exploration process did you do to find your next career? 
* What did you do to ensure that your next career actually aligns with your passions/purpose? (context: upon reflection, this is one of the reasons why I don't feel my previous role was a good fit for me)

Thank you very much beforehand for your advices, I really do appreciate them!"

10b0fl6,1,2023-01-13,How do I break into Equity research and Junior analyst roles?,Sadoksad,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/10b0fl6/how_do_i_break_into_equity_research_and_junior/,"I'm 21 at the moment. I did my undergrad in Business Administration and I had signed up for the Level 1 CFA exam and I was super close but I failed. Not an issue I'll be giving it again in May. However, there is this constant pressure from my parents to get a job and I personally do not want to waste my time doing jobs that have nothing do with portfolio/asset management or Equity research. The country I live in, the amount of experience you need even for a good internship in these fields is astonishing. They require an MBA at the very least. The ones that don't are atrocious in my opinion. Its impossible for a graduate to get these roles especially from my non finance background. I just don't know how to go about my situation.

Could I do a course that's less intensive than the CFA program meanwhile? I was thinking of building a few reports on random securities as a project to help boost my resume and my chances of landing a worthwhile internship. Would that help or is it just a waste of time? Another problem that arises from that is I have no idea how to even go about building a report. I'm willing to learn if someone could guide me in the right direction to a book, video or a course. I'm hoping for someone to guide me on this one. I'd really appreciate some clarity. "

10b2vz7,1,2023-01-13,Would a minor in stats or comp Sci help with data science career?,EmbarrassedDiamond47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10b2vz7/would_a_minor_in_stats_or_comp_sci_help_with_data/,"A bit stressed out recently and didn't have anyone to vent to so hopefully someone could help me out.

I've been in school for quite a while, graduated high school in 2014, and I'm looking at graduating next fall '24 with a BS in business analytics. I was considering minoring in statistics or even comp sci but wasn't sure if it was worth extending school for another semester.

I understand I'm probably more set up to go into analytics more immediately but I'm hoping to get into data science in the long term. 

The past summer and this winter I've been working on completing the Google data analytics certificate which I should have finished in the next few weeks. I'm planning on trying to get an internship this summer and in my off time complete some other courses on coursera such as the machine learning course by Andrew Ng and various python &amp; deep learning course.

Would it actually be beneficial to get a minor and stay in school the extra 6 months or continue to try and work on skills outside of school and just finish up my bachelors? I realize it's pretty subjective whether the extra time in school is ""worth it"", I'm just trying to figure out if getting my professional life going sooner than later would be more helpful than a minor. Thanks

-also if anyone has any recommendations on other things I should be working on that would be fantastic."

Its not that I have none, but looking at some online examples and some of my friends' resumes I see that there's a larger focus on projects. Should I work on adding more to my projects list or would I be competitive enough with what I have?

Also, on a related note, how important is it to have an up to date GitHub account?"
10b3niv,1,2023-01-13,Is it normal to take a while to understand a code base?,ComradePruski,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/10b3niv/is_it_normal_to_take_a_while_to_understand_a_code/,"Last summer I started as an intern at my company and there seemed to be very little documentation and I started working with multiple languages and things j hadnt before like JavaScript, HTML, requests, SQL, back to front end communication, etc. There wasn't a ton of documentation for my area but my mentors were always glad to lend a hand. I'd say it took me a couple months working full time before I really understood where stuff was. 

Now I got hired in a full time roll on a different team at the same place (but only 12 hours a week while finishing up school) and I feel pretty lost again as it works with an almost entirely different set of stuff. Much more backend oriented. 

My new mentors told me they are more strict about the frequency that I ask questions so I've only asked a couple the last couple months, but now that I'm graduated and starting full time again I'm worried I won't really live up to their expectations. During those 2 months I really only managed to get one ticket done on my own (overhauling a +2000 line JavaScript and HTML file and breaking it into smaller modules where I didn't ask any questions. I'm pretty terrified of asking questions to my new team but also don't want to take too long

My biggest issue is figuring out where stuff is located in the code. Is it normal to take a month or two to really get your bearings with a code base?"

Apologies ahead of time for spelling and formatting.

I work in a semi-niche field within the theater industry. I was previously working for a local midwest company doing installations, programming, and training of theatrical equipment all over the US, but mostly around out local region of the Midwest.

I have a BA in theater, and have worked several summer internships and jobs at summerstock companys before I graduated. This was my first real job right after college however, and not what I saw myself doing forever, as I had wanted to really pursue working with IATSE or a full time production house possibly.

I ended up staying at at this company for 3 years working full time. During this time I went from a starting wage of $14 and hour, to $16 and hour after about a year. 6ish months before I left said company, my pay was once again increased, after me and the only other tech discussed our pay and both went and requested raises. At this time also, I went and interviewed with a rival company, and was offered a position that I turned down at $25 an hour. Both me and my coworker were given raises to $20 an hour.

My coworker soon left two months later for a position at a local performing arts center, and I was left holding the bag on a huge project that went sideways almost immediately. Due to this, I actively went job searching and got hired at a college as an instructor for similar pay but salaried. I however made an agreement to stay on as a temporary employee for $30 an hour with the old company. They have since given me a consistent weekly 5-8 hours of work a week. Which has been nice additional income for me and my wife.

It's been 6 months now and I'm unsure about my new job. I'm nervous as I'm teaching my first class starting next week and the hours and travel involved have not been great.

My old company now has asked what it would take to get me back. They have stated they recognize that I'm the only technician in the state who knows how certain software functions/programs, and that their current hiring of new techs hasn't gone well.

There are a number of personal and worked related reasons that I'm reluctant to even consider going back, that range from the stress I was under when I was there, to the lack of communication in managment. The fact that they seem to want me rather desperately, and the money would be a huge help to me and my wife must be considered.

I'm happy to talk in the comments more about the personal reasons, but I need advice on what to request if I do make an offer to go back? 

My old coworker who left said I should request $35 an hour with an increased match on 401k (previously at 3% with end of year profit sharing), but I don't think they would agree to that hourly. I'm unsure what I could request that would match that worth to me however, or what number lower then that I would trually consider worth it. Another stipulation I believe I would mandate would be that I must be given and trained to be a project manager, as I do not want to be a technician forever.

Please help, and thanks in advance!"

I'm so sorry if this sounds dumb but I am just so confused and am looking for any advice possible. I am currently an undergrad with a major in computer science and minor in biology. I am really interested in bioinformatics and would like to pursue my masters in it. What type of experience / opportunities should I be pursuing at this stage? Is there any specific type of work / internships I should be doing as an undergrad that a grad school will expect? For example, should I focus more on gaining lab internships or coding ones? What experience would make me more suitable  as a candidate for a masters in bioinformatics?"
10b7xb4,1,2023-01-13,Should I switch jobs for higher salary but less space for creativity?,Fanny-24,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10b7xb4/should_i_switch_jobs_for_higher_salary_but_less/,"I have an offer lined up, and let's just say it's a lot better than my current salary.

Not only that: the company is bigger, they say there's room for growth, it has a lot of other benefits beyond pay. I would have to move to a different city, though, so it would be a big change in my life. This new city has a lot more job opportunities than the city I'm in, though.

I don't think my old company would have enough money to make a counteroffer - not that much, anyway. I don't completely dislike my current job, although I have some moral issues (the company's political views are completely opposite from mine) but I always did my job professionally.

I was also recently promoted for my effort, and I was assigned three interns over time - the last one hasn't started yet. Overall, I do have a lot of autonomy, I can pretty much choose when I want to work on a task or the other, I can create new things to do for myself without having to wait for others to tell me what to do, and I do follow different and various activities, with a good degree of creativity.

I'm afraid in the new position I wouldn't have as much autonomy, and that the tasks assigned to me would be less various. I can't really know beforehand, though.

Also, I'm having a really hard time with the thought of leaving, thinking about how my boss would blame me for ditching her company after their faith and time spent on me, placing her in a pinch to find someone else to replace me while they're facing a hard time, and how irresponsible they would make me feel for agreeing on a new intern and bailing shortly after their arrival.

Should I switch jobs? How do I cope with my boss blaming me, in that case?"

A bit of background on this.  We are a very small non-profit media center that partners with other non-profits on the regular.  

Last year we had a contract with one of these non-profits to shoot a series of training videos for their intern program.  

I had a member of staff approach me saying that they didn't want to do that shoot because they heard from a friend of theirs that one of the staff at said non-profit had a reputation of sexual harassment.  I wasn't about to force the matter and at the time I was out of town so couldn't take over the shoot and it led us to a breach of contract and a small loss in profit.

Now, a year later the same non-profit is asking us to edit the footage we shot last year and my staff member is saying that they can't do the work because of how it makes them feel and that it's illegal for an organization to make their employees feel uncomfortable.

Are they right or are they being too sensitive?

🙏Thanks in advance 🙏"

If anyone here has been in my shoes please pm me as I may have follow up questions. 

I am currently graduating this upcoming may as a chemical engineer however cs has been pretty fun for me as I’ve been utilizing python and SQL in some of my projects during my chemE internships and left me wanting to do more. I’m currently curious how I should transition myself into cs through these options:


Go back to school and obtain a post bachelor for computer science 

Go to school for a masters in computer science (but will need to take a semester to take prereq classes)

Go to a boot camp (any recommendations where a boot camp will attempt to put you in touch with recruiters/have historical success will be greatly appreciated)


Thanks I’m advance!"
10b9b2u,1,2023-01-13,The debate: Can you skip helpdesk?,tbross11,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/10b9b2u/the_debate_can_you_skip_helpdesk/,"  

I have seen a lot of people posting on here asking how to skip help desk, if its possible, or the quickest way out of help desk. In short, MOST of you won’t be able to skip help desk. Now, this does not mean it is impossible, plenty of people do it going into software dev. and getting lucky with some cyber and cloud internships. 

For those who had to and will have to endure help desk, here are some tips to avoid getting stuck there and getting out asap. Also, my career path will be posted below for those of you who care to read. 

So since you will likely be stuck in helpdesk to start here is how you can leverage it the best for your career.

1. First tip: If you are in college and pursuing a degree in IT in some format; TRY TO GET A JOB or an internship while in school. A lot of people think you can graduate with a degree and go straight into a six-figure salary, and they are kidding themselves. (Yes there are outliers, but that’s what they are, outliers). Getting a job while pursuing a degree will prepare you to make the jump out of helpdesk when you graduate. You will be able to pair your degree with experience to make that jump. Many people think the degree or certs will be enough to skip helpdesk, when in reality its usually a mix between education and experience.  

2. For those trying to get into the industry, understand that entry level is that: entry level. So expect entry level pay. But it does not have to stay that way. 

3. Once you get into the industry, keep goals in mind so you stay focused and don’t blink and find yourself a decade into helpdesk. Speak with your supervisor or team lead and see what ways the company supports you in personal and professional development. If the company does not have stuff like this in place, get your experience in and start looking elsewhere immediately. 

4. Pursue certs while in helpdesk to make yourself more marketable 

5. Use hepdesk as a positive and find out what you have interest in. Hardware, networking, software, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**here is a snapshot of my journey if you care to read below.**

Me in 2020 at 26 years old.

March of 2020 decided to get into IT.

March-April of 2020 earned full A+ cert and in May earn some Microsoft MTA certs.

Get a PC repair/refurb job at a depot in June 2020. Learned a ton (my favorite job to date but just entry level pay). Work that job June 2020-October 2020

November 2020 get a remote help desk job. work that from November to 2020 to December 2021.

Earned additional certs while working my help desk job.

In December 2021 Get a 2nd level position on the network team (still same company. just got a promotion with them). Still working remote. I never take any inbound calls now. Just a few outbound per day.

While working my remote IT job I used my certs and old gen ed credits from my early 20s to start my bachelor's in May 2021.

Graduated with My Bachelor's in IT in November 2022.

\- I now have my Bachelor's and 12 certs. Mix of Comptia, LPI Linux, Microsoft, AWS, and ITIL certs.

Starting my Masters in MBA w/focus in IT Management in March 2023.

Got my eye on a promotion this spring and hopefully more beyond once I get my Masters.

Less than 3 years in IT at this point with 12 certs, a Bachelor's in IT and doubled my income. Was only in help desk for a tad over a year."

I am debating which course should I pick after CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. I really enjoyed working in clean Python and then its framework named Flask, so I think that's the way I'll try to explore. I want to learn Django and React as I want to be a fullstack developer (anyway I'd lean more towards backend).

Also, I have an upcoming internship opportunity in both of these technologies. It's only 4 months till the internship starts and I'd like to learn as much as possible (6-8 hours a day) before I'll start working in the company. So far I know that I need Django, React, SQL (basic understanding of databases) and some python testing environment. 

Which course would you recommend?

•CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

•Some Freecodecamp path (which would be the best?)

•Some Udemy course (again, which do you recommend?)"

I was initially hired as one of the seniors of an IT company/software team. The hiring process was crazy. Of course they promised the stars, the moon and I will be able to do what I want to do in the company. 
 
Fast forward 1 year, I ended up not doing what I was hired for, because project demands. My boss is always distant and never wanted to know what I'm doing but I've always deployed software to the clients and never got the credit. 

Anyway, my boss presented a career ladder and asked where Am I in the career ladder. I told him that my responsibilities were aligned in the senior level. Then he ignored and said i think you are right beside the intern. I told him I am experienced. I have 11 years of experience and definitely a senior. But he kept pointing me to the 1-2 yr experience career ladder and flat out told me i have to show him data of what I was doing.then he said he doesn't really know what his employees are doing. Then proceeded to not raising my salary and told me because I am working remotely, i am not eligible because I earn more than the average. 

I told him, that they hired me on the senior Role, and because of a crazy project, the career ladder tells me that i need to work on the senior role again. 

I am taking my master's degree and I am having a hard time finding a role that is remote. My area isn't hiring as well and this is why I am only open for remote role. :( I don't know what to do as I need money, but my mental health is compromised:(."

I am an international student (non EU) in Germany and I am currently in the process of transitioning into a career in computer science. My main experience in the field comes from my master thesis where I am working on a deep learning project. I am however, painfully aware of the fact that I am lacking in industry experience in this field. I am planning to extend my thesis just so that I can still be enrolled as a student and eligible for internships.

1. Has anyone else done a non-mandatory internship as an international student (non EU)?

2. I am confused about whether I should aim for internships or Werkstudent positions. Any advice would be appreciated.

3. For those of you who have transitioned from a student/job seeker visa to a work visa, how long did it take you after getting the job offer?

4. I am almost eligible for German citizenship and having a ""unbefristeter Arbeitsvertrag"" (permanent work contract) would really help my case. I am aware that most companies give a probation period of 3-6 months. Does anyone have any advice on what sort of companies I could aim for that are more likely to give me a permanent work contract after the probation period ends? This is of course assuming that there are no hiccups during my probation period.

I have been hoping to secure some work like internships related to this field, but I want to know how realistic it is. I see many postings online require diploma or degree, so is there no way for me to try? How much knowledge do I have to display for me to have a chance?

For those in the CS field, do you guys have any alternatives to what I could do in this time? Any online resources that I can use to prep? I finished CS50 and have just been solving some leetcode problems on my own but thats all.

Also, what exactly should I prep before delving into this field? There are so many resources online its a little dizzying to try and make sense of it all."

&amp;#x200B;

“Wake up Gojow,” A cruel reptilian voice said. I rolled over still feeling groggy but jolted up as a shock went through me. “Now your up and at’em, you feel that? That's standard issue on all prisoners class 2 and above” I looked around and met the eyes of my captor who was standing just outside my cell. He was an especially ugly Hateose with dark gray scales.

I was in a small cell with two beds, one of them occupied by what looked like a Mu or Charalhara with a strange helmet on his head. *It can't be one of the Imperial mice, they have a completely different justice system, with their own prisons no matter the crime.* But as I fully awoke it was clear that the creature must be either a Mu or Carahalra.

“Your friend over there is the first class zero prisoner we’ve seen, a real tough cub, but he won't be here too long, his owner is coming to pick him up.” The guard said pointing at the cell behind him. I moved to get a better look. Jason was chained to the wall by his neck wrists and ankles, leaving barely any room to move. *Owner? The Shepard himself liberated all the children from that horrible place.*

“That human is not owned, whoever claims him has lied,” I said getting up. “And where is my mate?”

“Mate? The only other person on your crew was a male Linrin” The Gaurd said pausing. “Oh, you sick ceez” I fell onto my back in agony gripping my collar. “He is a class four prisoner and is kept separate from you lot. Poor thing he must have been kidnapped” I heard these words but I could barely understand them, the pain in my neck was too much, and they made no sense anyways.

The guard ungagged Jason who quickly turned to say “Whatever you're being paid here, we can pay you ten times that. You know the Linrin banking guild does not care if they hold money for criminals or if it is used for bribes. Please get us out of here and 1,000,000 credits can be yours” Jason said before his collar lit up bright blue. He screamed and looked to me.

“Ha, they'd have me in here with you lot in no time. Besides warrior, you'll be leaving here soon. Your master probably misses you” The jailer said with a laugh.

“I'll give you my account information if you kill me,” Jason said struggling.

“That good of an owner eh?” The guard said with a smile. “How long did you sell yourself for?”

“My parents sold me for life, please sir I am begging you,” Jason said falling back from pain again.

“You should have had better parents, slave,” The jailer said giving us one last shock before leaving. As I recovered I noticed a quiet banging sound coming from the bed next to mine. A mallet on the mouse's helmet whacked his skull nearly causing him to fall from his bed.

“Listen Hateos, if you help me I will get you out of here,” The mouse said in the nearly adorable squeaky voice of the Mu and Charalara.

“Who are you and what are you doing here?” I asked with genuine curiosity.

“I am lord Snufflebottom the rightful pariah emperor of the universe, free me from this contraption and I shall use the powers of greater cognizance to get us both out of here. You shall be a great sovereign, no an emperor-” The ‘emperor’ was disrupted by the largest mallet banging into his head.

“You so much as touch his restraints and your collar will administer a lethal shock automatically.” A guard called from across the hall.

“You are not Snufflebottom, I saw him on the news just last week,” I said squinting my eye.

“You have seen a lie, they took me from office after I failed to deal with the Shepard, and put me in here to rot. They didn't even have the courtesy to kill me, they had to for my people. Show them what happens to Mu failures.“

\*“\*Failed to deal with the Shepard? I thought the empire gave him a position of power equal to that of the emperors, to make that Galaxy more just, well after you pardoned him” I said coming closer to the Mu.

“Ha, you Gojow eating up our propaganda. You know I had the idea to make it look like we had done that. But the Shepard survived and we had to give him the power he was promised. Now I've been rotting in this pen for 15 years. Listen, the guard lies, release me from this and I will save you, don't you trust me? You know you can always trust a Mu or Charalhara?” He said squeakily. I had heard that phrase before, in Jason's horrible movies, but none of the new ones said Mu.

I turned away from the mouse to look at Jason, *maybe he would have something to say about all this.* But when I looked at him he was shaking and had his head bowed. *He stares down a terrible fate and there is nothing I can do for him.* I thought slumping my shoulders and bowing my head.

I was all he had and he is just a cub. It was a great cruelty to bring him on this mission, let alone have him kill. Jason seems a great warrior but that was forced on him. Just like Shrek thinks he likes being alone and hated, Jason was tricked into thinking he was ready to fight. But he isn't. Someone should have stopped him. Someone should have told Jason that the humans that enslaved him were wrong, the Truth guild was wrong. I should have told him. If I had told Jason the truth he may have escaped his life of slavery, but I have trapped him in it.

I was interrupted from my thoughts by the sound of a deep human voice. “Did you miss me, Jason?” I looked up to see two Hateos and one human step into Jason's now unlocked cell. The Hateos had normal guard uniforms but the Human had the ‘New Earth Spacing Guild’ officer's uniform, a synthetic fur cloak with a feral wolf insignia on the back. “You seem to have continued your training without me. Class zero criminal, quite a feat even for a human. You were working with a crew, right? Did they train you?” The human said turning to me. His smile seemed to stretch unnaturally wide as his eyes fixed on me. “Hello there, my name’s Julian, I’m the one who taught your friend here everything he knows. Thank you for helping to take care of him for the past, what was it, three years? A three-year *internship* and now he is ready for school again.” Julian with that horrible smile.

“He is not yours, the Shepard himself liberated all your slaves,” I Said walking up to the bars and standing tall. Julian was short but something told me that the long curved blade at his side was for more than show.

“Ah but he is mine, the Shepard was nothing more than a renegade when he stole my property. 49 belongs to me.” Julian said standing close enough to smell his minty breath.

“His name is Jason Lintex, you do not own him” I said with fury

“Jason Lintex” Julian said. “Jason makes sense, it's a common human name, but Lintex. It's a Linrin surname, you had a Linrin pilot didn’t you? The guards said you called him your *mate*” Julian nearly spat the word mate making the jailers smile. “Do you think that boy is your SON, that you and your mate adopted *Jason*?” I stayed silent at his question. “Let's ask 49 then, see what he thinks of his parents,” Julian turned to Jason. “What of it 49, this Hateos and his Linrin your *daddies,*” He asked almost laughing.

“No they are just some smugglers I work with,” Jason said before clutching at his neck in pain.

“Come on now Jason tell me,” Julian said as Jason writhed.

“He is no one, just leave him alone” *Even now Jason cares for my safety*.

“Come on Jason it doesn’t even have to be true, I want an excuse,” Julian said leaning into Jason’s writing form. “No matter,” Julian said after a pause. “I think we are going to pick up your training right where we left off, devotion to the guild. Even if the Shepard does *rescue* play the hero again you will just come crawling back ready to serve like a well-trained Dax.” Julian said as Jason began to sob. He looked at me his red eyes gazing into my mind.

“Please” was all Jason said before the gag went back in. I knew what I had to do, even if it killed me.

I looked at the Mu with fear only a parent could know. He studied me with his big brown eyes before I said  “If I set you free, will you save my son and mate?”

“On the empire, it will be done,” He said before I ripped the contraption off his head. I had no idea if it would work but they had that thing on him for a reason, even if he was crazy. Instantly my collar began to shock me harder than it ever had, but despite the pain, I still had hope, hope for my cub.

The Mu looked at me for a moment considering his options before saying “Kiss my tail” I looked at him in shock. “Do it, it's the only way to save Jason’s life,” With, effort I did as I was told, and my collar stopped.

“How did you do that?” I asked with awe.

“It would take one hundred lifetimes to explain the science of probability manipulation fully, so let me simplify. There is approximately a 1 in 700,000,000 chance that you would kiss my tail, it was a little more likely that your collar would short-circuit. Probability is a property of matter, and when a person who can see the future changes the probability of one thing something else must give. With precision, a trained greater cognisant can do many things you would find *unnatural*.” The Mu said.

“What the hell are you doing?” One of the guards yelled turning away from the struggling Jason.

“Quickly tell the bars of the cell they are your favorite children then punch them right in front of the guard.” The Mu said hopping onto my shoulder.

“I love you more than all my other children?” I said confused before I punched the bars in front of the approaching guard. The bar shattered like it was made of glass and hit the Hateos in the head. I didn't weight for the mouse to tell me to finish off the guard and grab his weapons. A blaster, blade, and hand shield.

“Tell the blaster that the world is ending then shoot Jason in the chest, his bindings will fall right off him,” The Mu said squeakily.

“The world is about to end little one?” I said still confused before shooting Jason. Julian who had been watching slack-jawed shut his mouth and looked at the creature on my shoulder with confusion.

“How the hell did you do that?” Julian asked with rage. I shot the other guard then threw the blade and shield to Jason, not caring what the slaver had to say.

Jason’s blade and shield ignited, casting the room in a violet-red. Julian was quick to remove his blue-edged blade and took a stance against the younger man.

“A quick sparing match with your teacher, eh 49? After we are done here I think I’ll bring your *daddy* back with us. You can kill him once you finish your training” Julian said with a smile.

Jason stuck first and with ferocity, his blade being met just in time by Julian’s. When the older slaver tried to counter it was met by a hand shield. Instantly Jason was attacking. Julian tried to counter but every time he lost ground. Jason swung his shield into his former master and a brilliant white lit up the room and both shields went down. Jason cut off Julien’s hand and kicked his knee with brutal force.

“I will cut you down before you can hurt anyone else,” Jason said raising his blade.

“STOP” I roared. “Son I know he has hurt you but his blood should not be on your hands, you are a cub who has already been through far too much” Jason looked at me his eyes red.

“He can't be allowed to walk away”

“He won't, I will finish him hear and now, but please my cub you don't need to kill anymore.”

“Won't we keep killing as smugglers?” Jason asked wiping his eyes.

“You are a smuggler no longer. Please son let me end this”

“Hold on Jason I could tell you where your parents are, I could make you rich, you would never need to work again, let me go and I can give you anything” Julian pleaded. Jason shook his head and I pulled the trigger.

“I’m going to get you out of here, but first we must find Linta, I could not bear to lose him”

“Nether could I, you two are the only family I’ve got dad,” Jason said embracing me.

“I am sorry I have not done what was needed as a father, but that ends today, we have more than enough to live in luxury and so we shall,” I said looking my son in the eyes.

“It's ok, you were learning,” Jason said hugging me. I hugged back. “Let me get Linta, you get us a ship,” Jason said letting go and grabbing his weapons.

“Alright but try not to kill anyone,” I said sternly.

“I’m a class zero criminal, I can do this without killing,” Jason said dashing off with human speed.

“Wow, your one lucky dad, my son was the one who came up with the idea of this prison, I think he may have been the one to take my throne, little shit. Eh, I would have done the same to him” The Mu said with a chuckle. “Now the loading docks are closer to us, but the guards' parking lot is closer to the Linrin section, and it will be easier to run into Jason and Linta, so go right and go fast my fine scalie friend” The Mu shouted with joy. I did as I was told shooting any guards I saw along the way. *They seem woefully unprepared for this sort of thing.* I thought as a shot an unshielded guard.

“The empire was probably planning for someone else to break out of here in a little bit judging by the lax security. They would probably start some little war that would break down a guild or Sovrin that had become too powerful, you know standard universe domination stuff” The Mu said idly.

It was a long jog and by the end, I was nearly exhausted. As I saw an exit and ships out a window, more guards started to arrive around me all shielded. There was no way I could take them on, even with the Mu’s help.

“Stay the fuck away from my son you Gojow” I heard my mate saying as blasters fired. Jason came plowing through the crowd with Linta on his shoulders, holding two blasters and firing in all directions. *Class four my ass.* I thought rushing to meet them.

“We will have time for love once we survive,” I said leading the duo to lot.

“Get into the Red model XT cruiser, its security is disabled, it's fast and it has many places where a mouse might feel at home.” The Mu said with a smile. Linta looked at the creature but said nothing. We did what we were told, guards close behind as we entered the ship. My mate got it up and running, putting us into the air. Linta activated hyperdrive before they had a chance to spot us.

Linta got off Jason’s shoulders and gave him a big hug saying “Jason I don't think I can do it legally, but I’m adopting you. You'll get the best education, the best career, and the best everything we can provide” He said holding my hand. “As a family”

“You don't have to worry too much about being fugitives like I told your mate this prison was likely planning to have someone else break out soon, so its records department is in shambles. Standard imperial policy,” The Mu said as Lintin gave him a hard look.

“You look a lot like the *real* Snufflebottom,” He said leaning into the small creature.

“Did my replacement look different enough that you could see it wasn't me?” The Mu asked with disgust. “Imperial standards have dropped since I left”

“I never saw a difference in Snufflebottoms appearance,” I said scratching my head. “But my Linta has sharper eyes than most” The answer seemed to satisfy the Mu.

“How about we watch a movie before we decide where to go,” Linta said wagging his tail. “Maybe Rise Of The Shepard,” The Linrin said with a loving smile.

“Naw I don't think I want to watch any Mu movies right now, how about something human,” Jason said happily.

“Come on don't you love all those hot alien-on-human scenes? I bet they found some real cute Linrin and Dax for that one” The Mu said with a wink.

“It's all human on human stuff,” Jason said quizically.

“All gay right?” The Mu said nervously.

“No the Shepard has like five women throughout the movie, most of them just throw away characters,” Jason said slowly as if he didn't understand.

“Please tell me they at least showed Malthusian practice in the

the movie” The Mu said with horror.

“What's Malthusian practice?” Jason asked.

“What is the current human population?” The Mu asked in hysterics.

“About two million,” Linta said puzzled.

“What?! That's enough to take over the universe. I always planned on culling the human population to around 10,000, 50,000 at most. What is the empire doing… unless… Oh god, I think they are trying to *win”* The Mu said with horror.

“Right ‘Emperor’*.* I said rolling my eye. “Well, Jason now that we are a family and not on the run I think a celebration is in order. How would you like to go on a vacation? Something perfect for a cub of your age” I said with a smile. “How about wonder world?”

“He’s not a toddler,” Linta said wagging his tail.

“And we should probably stay away from any Mu-owned business for now,” The Mu said nervously.

“Fine how about a trip to Talax,” I said.

“Oh, a beach planet that would be lovely,” Linta said hugging me. “What do you think Jason?”

“That would be amazing,” My son said crying a little. I gave my cub and mate a big hug.

“Maybe we could stop to get some good cheese first, Talax food doesn't agree with me,” The Mu said.

“Well, there is only one place in the galaxy to get good human food, set a course to A Slice of Earth!” I said holding my family close.

I still managed to get a few internships at graduated with a great GPA. 

My first job out of undergrad was a contract position lasting a couple of months, a sick-leave replacement. I was unemployed for about a year afterwards and moved back with my parents, where I still live. I had another job that lasted a year, which I semi-liked. I was laid off. I then had a full-blown mental breakdown and was unemployed for a bit more than a year and got into debt.

I started a new job outside of my field last summer, which I really hate. The salary is not great but it is helping with my debts (I have about $21k in personal loans + $22k in student debt). I have about $20k in my bank account. I am not doing well in my job, my manager wants to meet with me next week. This job provides me with a great deal of anxiety and I am depressed every Sunday because I have to work the next day. I have been looking for a new job, but without success. Not even interviews. I dream of having my own small business one day.

Every day I have anxiety because of my job and I am really miserable. No friends and never had a relationship. My health is not great either. I'm stuck and don't know what to do.

I went on tours across the country to different hbcu’s at 15. I was flying across the country going to coding summer camps with all of these smart people. I was in dorms having fun before I even graduated. College was supposed to be when everything changed. But after I graduated, it’s like all of my hopes were crushed one by one.

I found out on move in day I did the FAFSA incorrectly and couldn’t afford my dream college

I ended up in community college in an unfamiliar town in an abusive home

Mental health absolutely tanked by age 18, almost dropped out entirely after taking a semester off

Now I’m 21 and a senior at a cheap in state school. But I still feel like I failed somehow. I watched all of my friends go on to get these crazy successful internships and job offers and have fun in their dorms that I couldn’t afford. I live with a friends family with no car or relationship or social life. They’re traveling all over the world in their relationships with their sorority or fraternity friends. I know jealousy is an ugly emotion but I can’t help but feel it. 

Even people who made life harder for me in high school seem so happy. It’s like I’m proving all the terrible things they said about me right.

Every winter or summer break I stay in my room alone and code so I can somehow be as successful as them. But college is over now. Everything I dreamed of in middle school and high school is long gone. I get there’s decades of life ahead, but it’s a terrible feeling seeing your dreams die over and over. 

On the bright side, I have no debt and am set to graduate with a cs degree in the fall. But its  hard to shake this weight of hopelessness and sadness I feel on a daily basis."

10c9oai,0,2023-01-14,Advice recruiting from a non traditional post mba,BarnacleZestyclose65,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/10c9oai/advice_recruiting_from_a_non_traditional_post_mba/,"Hey guys and girls going through recruiting. It sucks out there, it really does. And companies are not going to take as many risks on placing people for experience and aspirations as corporations tighten their belts (I’m jn tech and work with f500 enterprises). 

Companies are cutting experienced head count, why would they waste a spot on a new mba pivoting into role with 0 experience? The answer is most won’t. For those struggling with recruiting, you really need to leverage your previous experience, craft a story on how that experience matters for xyz role and have the decision maker believe that you will be value add to their company. 

For everyone who was consulting or bust, especially those getting little traction take some time to take stock of what you provide and sell the hell out of it for an opportunity. 

From a tech standpoint, everyone is holding on for dear life and no one is leaving willingly. The natural churn from before has stopped and is going to reduce open headcount. Positions are only open for business essential positions. If I were in your shoes, I would land a position that is going to 1) be attainable and 2) be a selling point for the position I want. Once you get into role you can jump around. I’ve seen customer success become pms with the right level of networking and value add. This storm is probably here for at least the rest of year and possibly into 2024. Don’t benchmark against 2021, we are in a new day and age.

Don’t be the person stargazing and forced to have your school fund your bs internship in your town. That will be a hard I’ll to swallow."

I just graduated with a Bs in math and stats (double major). I thought that this would prepare me for a future in some sort of data analytics, but with recent interviews— it seems that much of this is more computer science based things (tons of coding and developing). 

I’m not opposed to learning, but don’t even know what direction to go in, especially independently. 

I am open to more of a business realm too (but see that it’s kind of difficult without having a finance/business degree). 


I’m begging for some advice, I’ve been applying all over, but any outside direction would be really appreciated. Even finding an internship for people who aren’t wanting to attend more school or is in school has been difficult. 



Note: I graduated with a 3.5 and feel like the knowledge in those fields are pretty good, but entry level statisticians are unheard of and masters are required (holding off till absolutely necessary). Also I have zero relevant experience/internships due to a major change and it was too late."
10cc0pj,2,2023-01-15,What tangible outcomes are from being an overachiever in a non-academic business/engineering career after college?,Apple_Butterflyz,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/10cc0pj/what_tangible_outcomes_are_from_being_an/,"Going into my 2nd year of college, I am currently the top one of my batch and was also the top one of my batch in high school yet being rank one has made zero difference in my life.  

I also joined and lead lots of orgs to build my network but found no use in it whenever I was looking for internships. So now, I'm wondering are all the sleepless nights for spearheading projects, working on performance tasks, reading 200 pages of assigned readings, and studying for exams even worth it. When I graduated high school I didn't care about my awards I was just happy I graduated and got to celebrate it with friends. Now in college, a 1.04 GPA has left me with no pride or joy and orgs just feel like a chore or a repeat of high school. So will this just keep repeating of working but feeling nothing?

The more I think about it and wonder, ""Ok if all of us will graduate with the around the same grade and the same latin honors and the same skills of programming and etc. then what will make me any different from the rest of the batch?"" The answer is our connections and right now my connections aren't bringing anything to me as I actively search for opportunities. People keep saying ""look how far you've come"" well the only difference is me being in college which is the traditional trajectory in life that every other person is in. However, the state of my life does not translate to the work I have put out. I have nothing advancing my professional experience, zero opportunities received, and 1.0 that means nothing to anyone and myself included.

So now I just want to know if all this overachieving will get me anywhere and if the honor students or overachievers out there found their efforts met with their goals which could also have been found later in life. Right now I just feel like nothing I have done is worth it and maybe I should just call it quits."

I have been home since December 17th on winter break. It has been so hard being home that I never want to live here again. The issue is that I don't think my mom understands I am an adult. She treats me like a kid. When I'm at school, she constantly berates about my grades she always overlooks the good grades I have. She just sees the bad assignments or stuff I didn't do. I have made Dean's list every semester and have a 3.5 GPA. On Christmas day, she decided to yell at me that I'm only allowed to have one beer. It was 4 in the afternoon and I hadn't had any drink that day. It was my first beer. Later that week, I was getting a physical to see if I could donate plasma. She decided to yell at me about how it is unhealthy and not safe even though I researched it heavily and did 2 hours of tests and paperwork to make sure I understand everything. She just yelled at me and would not let me explain. Then she called me lazy for no reason the other day. I have been sleeping in late all break. I guess she decided it was not acceptable, and she barged in my room and proclaimed that I am very lazy. She made me rake the leaves in the yard even though there were very few leaves and it did absolutely nothing. That same day she lashed out on me about an internship I was applying to. She yelled at me that the application was taking to long and that I am not going to have a summer like last summer. She was referring to the fact I didn't have a job over the summer. She acts like I didn't do anything. I did two summer courses and was a facilitator for a retreat. It is so frustrating to be treated like a child when I'm very responsible. It is also like I am not living up to her expectations even when I'm doing so well in life. I need to have a conversation with her about setting boundaries and reminding her I'm an adult. I am leaving for school today and have yet to have the conversation. I was also looking forward to FaceTiming with my best friend, but she had to cancel. I get she is not feeling good from the medication she is on. I haven't seen or talked to her in a month and I really need someone to talk too. It all makes me sad and I'm in a bad place right now."

* Asian male (anotha one)
* Applying from a small international school in China
* No hooks

Moved to China in middle school. Severely blamed the lack of research, competition prep classes (fk AMC), and internship opportunities on my move + my mediocre Chinese. But, it was this world outside my comfort zone that was the source of my interests, growth, and essays (so I'm bing chilling now)

**Intended Major(s):**

* Computer Science
* Computer Engineering

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

* 1560 SAT (800 M, 760 EBRW)
* No ACT

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

* 3.992 UW (Thank you, online 9th grade PE)
* 1 out of... FOURTEEN (bruh)

**Coursework:** AP/IB/Dual Enrollment classes, AP/IB scores, etc

* 16 APs, 3 College/Dual Enrollment
   * 9th: Calculus BC (5), Physics 1 (4), Human Geo (5)
   * 10th: Chemistry (5), Stats (5), Lang (4), World Hist (5), Chinese (5)
   * 11th: Physics C: Mech (5), CompSci A (5), US Hist (4), Micro (5); Calculus III
   * 12th: Biology, Macroeconomics, Physics C: E+M, Lit; Diff Eq, Linear Alg

Took every AP offered by my school except Music Theory, Art, and Psychology. Had to take CSA and APUSH online due to scheduling issues, and took advanced math from online universities for college credit. Honestly surprised I was able to power through and get decent grades with so many classes in online format, along with \~200 SCHOOL DAYS OF ONLINE LEARNING (government restrictions...). Maybe CS:GO, Osu!, and LoL have some intrinsic healing powers... 

**Awards:**

* EARCOS Global Citizenship Award
   * Given to 1 junior in school (in various international schools in Asia)
* AP awards (Int. Diploma, Scholar with Distinction, etc.)
* Many school awards in classes

**Extracurriculars:** Include leadership &amp; summer activities

* Volunteering: led 12 international volunteers to build web app, managed web domains and servers, taught English and STEM classes weekly, recruited through school-wide presentations
* Student Gov Vice President: spearheaded fundraisers (various events, \~35K+ rmb raised), orchestrated assemblies and house events, giving presentations, coordinating with school IT and administration
* Business English Teacher: taught English to 25 workforce professionals, creating lesson plans and engaging activities in professional work environment
* Coding: USACO Silver (Bessie best cow btw), built python webapp to track progress (web scraping), reverse engineering and finding memory offsets for C++ League of Legends cheat (lmao), used JavaScript to analyze microphone audio for cheering/loudness competition at StuGov events
* NHS Secretary: Coordinated some events, took meeting notes and tracked volunteer hours, nothing special
* Saxophone: 5 hours a week with Korean Orchestra (I don't even know Korean LOL), 1st saxophone, with solo piece, most improved award
* Chess: 1459 USCF (before moving), 1st place in U14 citywide tourney (in China), coached and tutored members of school chess club
* Sports: Varsity Basketball, Volleyball (captain?), and Soccer (less competition due to small school), many tournaments canceled due to COVID

I feel like my ECs fall into that ""asian male in CS"" cookie cutter mold - a lot of it was what was available to me. No spike, no research, no internship, no competitions. However, a lot of ECs were filled with learning experiences as well: developing my growth and most specifically my interest in connecting and communication (hopefully expressed through my essays)

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

* Common App: (7/10) wrote about chess and moving to China, castling my king into another region, finding the next best move to impact the board (decently well written, but cliché community essay, oops)
* Essays: (8/10) I liked them even reading through them weeks after submitting, written around the arc of ""connecting"" (between academic subjects, community, people, languages, etc.) Earlier ""Why Us"" essays randomly name-dropped profs, oftentimes not enough ""Why Me"" - definitely could have been improved
* LORs: (7-8/10) 
   * Worked with my counselor a lot due to my accelerated courses (had to resolve many scheduling conflicts and requests for online courses), developed a pretty solid connection, helped the counseling dpt. with Microsoft forms related issues
   * Physics teacher: took Phys 1 and Mech in his classes, was also my academic advisor. Could have reached out to him more inside and outside of class, but paid attention to his lectures + asked questions
   * English teacher: Took English in 9th and 11th grade from her classes, actually looked forward to English classes due to the fun environment she built. Didn't have a great personal connection, though.

**Schools:** List of colleges, ED/EA/RD, etc

* Top of the backboard:
   * CMU (ED reject), MIT, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn, Duke, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, UCLA
* The rim:
   * GATech, UIUC, UCSD, UCI, Purdue (CS mad tough), Northeastern, UMich, UVa, UWisc, UMaryland, UNC

(I can't even touch the rim though)

**Why I want to turn back time:**

* Video games. I played... WAY TOO MANY video games during high school. Low 5 digit in Osu!, Diamond in League and Apex, MGE in CS:GO, Plat in Val, etc. Thousands of hours going into mindlessly clicking pixels on a monitor. 
* The process of writing my essays. I learned so much about myself reflecting, writing, and just trying to pour myself into words. CS transformed from ""I like games so I like CS"" into a genuine passion to connect and communicate. Although I liked my earlier essays, I really wish that I could have written them with my current knowledge in mind.
* Competitions. I attribute to my lack of AIME to a girl (was up all night making her a gift lmao), and a general lack of motivation. I also missed USACO gold by like 50 points rip. All in all, just my selfish desires and not enough effort put in compared to what should have been done.
* Research. Planned to apply to RSI, completely forgot about it and remembered only because my old friend got in and told me (I probably would have been rejected lol). Never even considered the possibility of cold emailing professors at local university due to lacking Chinese.

I’m under the interpretation that if you are entirely new to CS and start in the spring or even the fall that the given time you have to prepare with what you are taught at school is not enough enough knowledge to go forward with an interview. Did you grind and teach yourself while learning etc etc.

10cn6rw,2,2023-01-15,Had to move back in with my parents after a complete breakdown. I am a failure.,0106lonenyc,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10cn6rw/had_to_move_back_in_with_my_parents_after_a/,"I have a history of mental health issues that I've been treating with therapy and medication, but they go in waves.

After two M.Sc abroad, lots of time wasted, and lots of money spent, I finally landed an internship at a famous UN agency in NYC last year. I moved there, fighting through the anxiety and loneliness and fear, and stayed there for a few months, managing to do a good job.

In the end, my colleague and I applied for two remote consultancies. I was so happy. I'm from Italy and you don't find good jobs in my country. I thought - finally I'll manage to stay home while earning some decent money. It's finally my time to shine. I'll be able to properly address my issues while STILL building a career. This is amazing!

I got shortlisted immediately. It really seemed like the job was mine. My colleague also got hired in a matter of days. Just out of extra safety I accepted another offer from Switzerland, but there was some time between the acceptance and the first day of the job, so I told myself I had plenty of time to turn it down when the UN offer would come.

Only that it never did.

A few days before I had to start my job in Switzerland, my colleague let me know that there was a new consultant in the department. Clearly they had found someone else for my role and they didn't even tell me.

My dream was shattered. And then I realized, I hadn't prepared anything to move to Switzerland. No ticket, no place to stay, no ""mental setup"". I only had a couple days and I rushed through everything in complete panic. I didn't wanna leave again. I hadn't even thought I'd have to leave again. It just hadn't occurred to me, or better put, I didn't wanna think about it.

I did leave, crying and shaking. But when in Switzerland my mental state just crashed. I called my mom telling her I'd comm it s*icide, and then crawled into bed and cried for a few hours straight, unable to reply to any calls. She was so worried she called the police on me because she thought I had done it. A friend here later told me she bawled her eyes out the entire day because she didn't know what had happened to me.

The second day I quit my new job and came back home. It just wasn't feasible. I was no longer functioning.

I'm now here at home and don't know what to do. I don't have jobs lined up. I'm no longer 19, not even 25. At my age, people have kids, savings, houses, job promotions. And I have nothing. I spent most of my savings in NYC and now I'm penniless and dependent on my mom. I'm too old to make this kind of mistakes. My mom clearly sees me as ""that messed up son"" and a burden who's not able to build a future for himself. My life is ruined and I'll never have money, or a career, or anything else.

On top of that, a dear friend of mine is going through chemo and everyday I wonder why it's happened to him and not me, and why should I even be here and whine while he's having serious issues and I'm not even able to properly help him. I'm a terrible person and if I wasn't here the world would be a better place."
10coieb,3,2023-01-15,For those who were accepted into university with Coop and want to switch to C-Edge,Lumpy-Excitement7734,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/10coieb/for_those_who_were_accepted_into_university_with/,"Hi, just going to lay out my experience in switching to C Edge for other people and to see if anyone has had a similar experience. 

After my first semester in engineering, I decided I would switch to Career Edge, as it is one internship and not three. When doing this they warn you that you will no longer be in coop, which was what I wanted. What they don't tell you is that they don't let you have summer internships with C-Edge despite being told and confirmed last year that my work term was for this summer. What's more, they can also withdraw you from C-Edge without even sending a proper email, I only found out that they removed me the other week, and put me back into coop for a fall internship. Don't expect timely assistance either. 

I'll explore my options, maybe I'll do an internship without the whole coop thing. I probably could have noticed this earlier, but they really didn't make it clear on Compass. Am I the only one to have had an experience like this with the coop institute? 

TLDR:  Got into C-Edge and without warning got placed back into Coop with a different schedule"

To be honest i didn’t think i was going to get in bc it’s selective so on the application i put im willing to work full time in the summer for one of the questions cause i wanted to increase my chances of getting in plus i didn’t think it was going to be that serious anyway. 

During the interview they brought up it’s important to work in the summer as that’s when most of the research aspect of the club takes place. I voiced my doubts about working full time but i’m not sure they understood me right because they selected me. 

During the summer i wanted to focus on networking with other startups across the nation and do internships outside of my college. If i accept the club offer that means i cant do that and have to work with the lab full time. 

I really like this club and would love to work w them during the school year but not over the summer. I don’t know if I should tell them now that i can’t work over the summer or wait till summer. 

During the interview they said that if you don’t participate when required it can result in getting kicked out so i don’t know if not participating over the summer can get me kicked out.

I also don’t have an internship lined up yet for the summer so if things don’t work out for me i like to have working full time for this club as a plan b option plus they give a nice stipend. But i also want to explore opportunities out of my college and gain good network connections. So i’m stuck in this dilemma about what to do and when it’s the proper time to tell the club."

*Q:  What are the different types of trading firms?*

A:

There are several different types of trading firms, each with its own focus and approach to the markets. Some examples include:

1. Investment banks: These firms typically engage in a wide range of financial activities, including underwriting new securities, providing advice to companies and governments, and trading securities for their own account.
2. Hedge funds: These are private investment partnerships that use a variety of investment strategies to generate returns for their investors. They often employ complex, high-risk strategies such as leverage and short selling.
3. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms: These firms use advanced algorithms and high-speed computer systems to execute trades on behalf of clients or for their own account. They typically focus on trading a large number of shares in a short period of time, and make profit from small price movements.
4. Market Making firms: These firms act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of securities by providing liquidity to the market. They make a profit from the bid-ask spread.
5. Proprietary Trading firms: These firms trade for their own account, using their own capital. They use a variety of strategies and may focus on a specific market or asset class.
6. Retail Brokerage firms: These firms execute trades on behalf of retail investors, and make a profit from transaction fees.
7. Asset Management firms: These firms manage investment portfolios on behalf of institutional and individual clients. They may focus on a specific asset class or use a variety of strategies.

These are some examples and there are many more types of trading firms, each with its own set of characteristics and strategies.

&amp;#x200B;

*Q:  Describe what a software engineer might do at the types of firms you listed above*

A:

As a software engineer at different types of trading firms, the specific responsibilities can vary depending on the type of firm, but here are some general tasks that a software engineer might do:

1. Investment banks: A software engineer might work on developing and maintaining systems for pricing and risk management of financial products, as well as building and maintaining systems for electronic trading and market data.
2. Hedge funds: A software engineer might work on developing and maintaining systems for portfolio management, risk management, and algorithmic trading. They might also work on building and maintaining systems for data analysis and quantitative research.
3. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms: A software engineer might work on developing and maintaining low-latency trading systems, optimizing algorithms for high-speed execution, and building and maintaining systems for market data and order management.
4. Market Making firms: A software engineer might work on developing and maintaining systems for market making, including systems for pricing and hedging, as well as building and maintaining systems for market data and order management.
5. Proprietary Trading firms: A software engineer might work on developing and maintaining systems for algorithmic trading, building and maintaining systems for data analysis and quantitative research, and creating and maintaining systems for risk management and position monitoring.
6. Retail Brokerage firms: A software engineer might work on building and maintaining systems for order execution, data management, and customer portals.
7. Asset Management firms: A software engineer might work on developing and maintaining systems for portfolio management, risk management, and performance reporting.

In general, software engineers in trading firms work on building and maintaining systems for a variety of functions such as trading, market data, risk management, and portfolio management. They often work closely with traders and other stakeholders to understand the requirements for these systems and ensure that they are reliable, efficient, and scalable.

*Q:  What programming languages and educational background would I need to work at a financial firm?*

A:

To work as a software engineer at a financial firm, you will typically need a strong background in computer science and programming. The specific programming languages and educational background that are required can vary depending on the firm and the specific role, but here are some common requirements:

1. Programming languages: Common languages used in financial firms include C++, Java, Python, and C#. Knowledge of these languages and experience in developing and maintaining large-scale systems is important. Some firms may also require knowledge of SQL and other database technologies.
2. Educational background: A bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, mathematics, engineering, or a related field is commonly required. Some firms may also consider candidates with degrees in other fields if they have relevant experience and skills.
3. Knowledge of financial markets: While not strictly necessary, having a basic understanding of financial markets, financial products, and investment strategies can be helpful.
4. Strong problem-solving skills: Financial software is complex, and software engineers at financial firms need to be able to solve problems and troubleshoot issues quickly and effectively.
5. Good communication skills: Software engineers at financial firms often need to work closely with traders and other stakeholders, so good communication skills are important.

Keep in mind that depending on the type of firm and the specific role, the requirements may vary. Some firms may place more emphasis on specific skills or languages than others, and some roles may require more specialized knowledge. Additionally, some firms may also require relevant certifications such as Certified Financial Engineer (CFE) or Financial Risk Manager (FRM).

*Q:  how do i get a job at HFT*

A:  High-frequency trading (HFT) firms typically hire individuals with a  strong background in computer science, mathematics, or engineering. A  degree in one of these fields and relevant experience in programming,  data analysis, and financial markets would be beneficial. Additionally,  HFT firms often look for candidates who are familiar with low-latency  systems, high-performance computing, and network infrastructure. If you  have experience in these areas and are interested in HFT, you should  consider networking and reaching out to HFT firms to express your  interest in working for them.

*Q:  Can I get a job at these firms right out of university?*

A:

It is possible to secure a job in a trading firm right out of university, but it can be challenging. Many financial firms, including trading firms, typically prefer to hire candidates with a few years of experience in the industry or relevant work experience.

However, some firms may offer internships or entry-level roles to recent graduates that can lead to full-time positions. Additionally, some firms have graduate training programs specifically designed for new graduates, where they can gain the required skills and knowledge before joining the company as a full-time employee.

It's worth noting that competition for these roles can be intense, and many firms receive a large number of applications from recent graduates. Therefore, it's important to have a strong academic record, relevant skills, and experience, and to be able to demonstrate your interest in the industry and the specific firm you're applying to.

In addition, networking and building relationships with people in the industry can be beneficial. Many financial firms prefer to hire people they know and trust, so if you can make a positive impression on someone in the industry, they may be more likely to remember you when a suitable role becomes available.

So, while it may be more challenging to secure a job in a trading firm right out of university, it is not impossible. With the right qualifications, skills, and experience, combined with networking and persistence, you can increase your chances of getting a job in the trading industry.

*Q:  I have a low GPA. Can I still work in these firms?*

A: A low GPA may make it more difficult to secure a job in a financial firm, but it is not necessarily a disqualifying factor. Employers in the financial industry are primarily interested in your skills, experience and qualifications. If you have relevant skills, experience, and qualifications for a software engineering role, your GPA may be less important to some employers. Additionally, if you have relevant experience or have completed relevant projects, it may help to highlight that in your resume and during the interview process.

It's also important to note that some firms may place more emphasis on academic performance than others, so you may want to consider targeting firms that are less strict on GPA requirements or have programs for candidates with non-traditional educational backgrounds.

Another option is to look for internships, apprenticeships, or entry-level roles that may be more forgiving of lower GPAs. This way you can start gaining experience and skills that will help you in the future to get a better chance to land a job at a financial firm.

Keep in mind that you should not let your low GPA discourage you from pursuing a career in the financial industry. Instead, focus on developing the skills and experience that are relevant to the field and demonstrate them to potential employers.

*Q:  Where are most of these firms located, in Europe?*

A:

Many financial firms, including investment banks, hedge funds, high-frequency trading firms, market making firms, proprietary trading firms, retail brokerage firms, and asset management firms, are located in major financial centers around the world.

In Europe, some of the major financial centers include London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Zurich. These cities have large and well-established financial industries, with a wide range of firms operating in different sectors of the market. For example, London is considered as one of the most important global financial centers, with a large concentration of investment banks, hedge funds, and other financial firms. Frankfurt is home to many of the major European banks and is also a center for trading in bonds and derivatives. Paris is another important financial center in Europe, particularly for asset management and insurance. Zurich is known for its strong banking sector and is also a center for commodity trading.

However, it's worth noting that many financial firms have offices and operations in multiple locations, so you may find opportunities in other cities across Europe and beyond as well.

It's also important to note that many firms have moved to more flexible working models and have a significant number of employees working remotely, so location may not be as crucial as it used to be.

*Q:  I don't have European citizenship. How difficult is it for me to secure a job in one of these companies?*

A:

The difficulty of securing a job in a financial firm as a non-European citizen can vary depending on the specific firm and the country. In general, many financial firms have a global presence and recruit employees from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities. However, some firms may have stricter requirements for work visas and sponsorship, which can make it more challenging for non-European citizens to secure a job.

That being said, many financial firms are based in countries with a relatively open immigration policy, such as the UK and Switzerland, which makes it easier for non-European citizens to secure a job. Additionally, some firms may be more open to sponsoring employees for work visas or providing assistance with the visa application process.

It's important to research the specific firms you are interested in working for and their policies regarding work visas and sponsorship for non-European citizens. Some firms may have dedicated recruitment teams for international candidates that can provide more information about the process.

It's also worth noting that some countries have special programs for highly skilled workers, such as Tier 1 visa in the UK, which may make it easier for you to secure a job.

Additionally, you can consider starting your career in a country where you have citizenship or a valid work permit, and then apply for international opportunities with the company once you have gained some experience and have a better chance of getting sponsorship.

Keep in mind that work visa requirements and sponsorship policies can change over time so it's always best to check with the relevant authorities and the company.

*Q:  What's the work/life balance like in these firms?*

A:

The work-life balance in financial firms can vary depending on the type of firm, the specific role, and the location. In general, many financial firms are known for having demanding and fast-paced work environments, and some roles can require long hours and a significant amount of time spent on work-related activities outside of normal working hours.

For example, in Investment banks, in particular, working hours can be long, and employees may be expected to work extended hours, including evenings and weekends, particularly during busy periods such as year-end and quarter-end. Similarly, in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms, software engineers may be required to work extended hours to ensure that the systems are running smoothly.

On the other hand, in some firms, work-life balance can be better. For example, in some Asset Management firms, working hours can be more regular and there may be more of an emphasis on achieving a good balance between work and personal life.

It's worth noting that some firms have implemented more flexible working policies, such as remote working, which can help to improve work-life balance. Additionally, some firms may offer additional benefits such as paid time off, parental leave, and sabbaticals to help employees manage their work-life balance.

It's also important to keep in mind that work-life balance can vary depending on the specific role and team you are working on. Some teams may have more demanding workloads than others, and some roles may require more travel or be more client-facing.

It's always best to research the specific firms you are interested in working for, and if possible, try to speak with current or former employees about their experience regarding work-life balance to get a better idea of what to expect.

*Q:  Can I work remotely for these trading firms?*

A:

Many financial firms, including trading firms, have implemented more flexible working policies in recent years, including the option to work remotely. However, the availability of remote working can vary depending on the type of firm and the specific role.

For example, in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms, where low-latency and high-speed trading systems are critical, it is less likely that software engineers would be able to work remotely. The same applies to market making firms as they require constant monitoring and maintenance of market making systems.

On the other hand, in some firms such as Investment banks, Asset Management firms, and Proprietary Trading firms, remote working may be more feasible, particularly for roles that do not require direct access to trading systems.

It's worth noting that remote working is becoming more common across the financial industry, and many firms are now offering more flexible working arrangements, including the option to work remotely, at least part-time. Additionally, some firms may also offer hybrid working models, where employees can work remotely for some of the time but are required to come into the office for certain periods.

It's always best to research the specific firms you are interested in working for and check if they have any remote working policies in place. If the firm does not have a remote working policy, it may be worth inquiring about the possibility of remote working during the interview process.

*Q:  How much can I expect to earn at these trading firms?*

*A:*

The salary and compensation package that you can expect to earn at a European trading firm can vary depending on a number of factors, including the type of firm, the specific role, your qualifications and experience, and the location. **However, in general, salaries for software engineers in Europe tend to be slightly lower than in the US.**

In general, base salaries for software engineers in Europe can range from €50,000 to €100,000 per year, depending on the level of experience, qualifications, and location. Keep in mind that this is just an approximation and compensation package can vary widely depending on the specific firm, role and location.

In addition to the base salary, many trading firms in Europe also offer performance-based bonuses, which can be a significant percentage of an employee's salary. This can be usually between 10-40% of the base salary. Some companies also offer benefits such as health insurance, retirement savings plans, and other perks.

It's worth noting that compensation packages can vary widely depending on the specific firm, role, and location, so it's best to research the specific firms you're interested in working for and check their salary and compensation package information.

*Q:  Whats the difference between a software engineer, a quant, and an algo developer?*

A:   

In the financial industry, a software engineer, a quant, and an algo developer are all roles related to technology, but they have different responsibilities and focus areas:

1. Software Engineer: A software engineer is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining software systems. They typically work on large-scale systems that support a variety of functions such as trading, market data, risk management, and portfolio management. They often work closely with traders and other stakeholders to understand the requirements for these systems and ensure that they are reliable, efficient, and scalable.
2. Quant: A quant is a quantitative analyst, who uses mathematical and statistical techniques to model financial markets and securities. They typically develop and implement mathematical models, algorithms, and other tools to help traders and portfolio managers make better investment decisions. They also help to design and implement risk management systems.
3. Algo Developer: An algo developer is a software developer that specializes in developing algorithms for automated trading. They design, develop, test and maintain trading algorithms, which are used to execute trades based on predefined rules and market conditions. They typically have a strong background in computer science, mathematics and programming, and they also have a good understanding of financial markets and trading strategies.

In general, software engineers focus on building and maintaining systems, quants focus on developing mathematical models and algorithms to analyze financial data, while algo developers focus on developing and implementing algorithms for automated trading. While the roles may overlap and share some responsibilities, each role has its own specific focus and set of skills."

My goal is to eventually transition to a data science role in a couple years. It is my first job out of college after graduating with a BSc in Economics. I didn’t have any relevant jobs or internships in college, so I didn’t really have a clear picture of working as an analyst. Instead, I built a GitHub portfolio during my junior &amp; senior years on top of working various odd jobs. 

My job looks good on paper, given that I’m involved in two research projects related to the crime and education space. In reality, my daily work is comprised of 

- 80% data processing (writing a pipeline to organize &amp; validate the research data that we receive from our data partners, cleaning &amp; aggregating crime data from online public portals, etc);
- and 20% data visualization + basic analysis (power analysis, regression, qualitative analysis of survey data, etc).

**The only “skills” I’ve developed so far—that I didn’t necessarily have before—are project management and being able to follow coding standards,** on account I have to document my work through GitLab. 

I used Python and SQL in my last 2 years of college (with a little bit of R in my econometrics classes); and **I feel like my technical skills have stagnated because I have to use R exclusively for the sake of code review.** In that regard, the personal projects I’ve done in the past were more complex and/or interesting: spectral clustering, decision trees, regularized regression, a little bit of time series work, most of which I have become rusty on because I don’t use them as much—albeit I still understand them intuitively because I have published them on GitHub. 

My job nonetheless has great work-life balance with 5 weeks of PTO every year. **However, if and when I transition to another job, where exactly can I go from here?**"

After months, they told me that they can't offer it due to budget issues :( Time to start applying now",Bipal,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10csbyv/after_completing_my_internship_last_summer_was/,"Hello everyone,

This is mostly just a rant on my situation. If you do decide to stick around and read, thank you for your attention.

I'm a 22 year old international student in the US about to graduate this April. Apologies for any grammatical or spelling errors, English isn't my first language.

Last summer, I had an internship at this company as a software developer. I absolutely loved the work that I was doing, my colleagues were kind and friendly, and my supervisor (let's pretend his name is Max) was a great mentor.

I learned a lot throughout the internship program, and was actually able to contribute quite a lot. Max and my team members were all very impressed by my performance. I actually remember being proud about contributing the most on one of our agile sprints, and enhancing our project with a step that no other team in the organization had implemented yet.

After the internship had ended, Max actually informed me that he was willing to hire me once I had completed my degree. I actually immediately agreed to it since I really did like the culture at the company, and believed that I was contributing in a meaningful way.

Fast forward to January, and he informed me that due to budget issues, he is unable to offer me a role right now. I'm not gonna lie, I was really looking forward to this role, and my heart immediately sank. I never realized how invested my mind was towards this job of the future, and when it disappeared right before my eyes in an instant, I felt a rush of sadness. 

Now, I don't really think I am upset with Max or the company. I mean, the economy doesn't seem to be doing too well, and there very well might not have any need for a new developer at the time. I understand their circumstances, but nonetheless, I am pretty bummed out by it.

And now, I actually am feeling a little scared as I now have to search for another job within the next 4-6 months (I believe that international students need to leave the US if they don't find work within a certain time period).

My game plan is to start applying to roles, maybe modify my resume slightly according to the job description, reach out to my professor and use any resource my college has to offer (professional coaches, career fairs, handshake, etc.) to secure an offer.

If you think there's anything else I should be doing, please do let me know. Any advice is appreciated.

If you read it til here, I thank you for your valuable time. Have a nice day :)"

Ma plimbam linistit pe LinkedIn si am primit add de la acest element, tip care mi-a si dat deja endorsemenets la toate skills, vreo 10 secunde dupa ce i-am dat accept. Probabil se astepta ca si eu sa ii dau inapoi.

Habar nu am cine e tipul, insa i-am urmarit profilul si am observat la experienta ca dupa 3 luni de internship, el deja era Senior. 

Poze mai jos (cenzurate ca sa nu planga nimeni), daca e curios cineva cine e, discutam in privat.

In poza cu experienta puteti vedea ca el are ""8 ani"" de experienta (din Iulie 2018 pana in prezent), deci aparent conform lui suntem in 2026. 

Am vazut de asemenea acolo pe profilul lui cateva pattern-uri ce ies in evidenta, pe care le stiam de dinainte si de la alte personaje de pe LinkedIn.

Am presupus ca TOTI fac parte din armata ""dascalita"" libertate.init deoarece:

***-toti au titlu de senior dupa maxim 6-12 luni de la inceputul carierei lor***

***-toti au adus contributii de milioane de euro pe proiectele pe care au lucrat si si-au satisfacut clientii cu un procent de peste 185,33%***

***-toti au facut google-ul sa mearga cu 0.49secunde mai repede***

***-toti au poza de directori desi ei lucreaza pe pfa si au varsta intre 18-23 de ani***

***-toti sunt prieteni intre ei si cu Cristian Dascalu, toti fac postari cringe de marketing generate cu chatGPT si isi lasa comentarii intre ei, toti isi dau endorsements si recomandari intre ei***

Pana la urma 9000 de euro pe mentorat nu suna atat de rau, m-as baga si eu, de ce sa raman fraier. Voi ce parere aveti?

Five months ago, I had signed my full-time return offer from company A that I had interned at this summer. Recently, I received an verbal / unofficial offer from company B that I like more and is located in a better location; however, I have not received the official offer letter or any official offer documentation yet. Additionally, to proceed with the opportunity at company B, I would have to risk my current signed and official offer from Company A (as company B would need to contact  company A to confirm my summer internship in order to move forward with the hiring process and, as such, Company A would likely know that I have been recruiting behind their back and could rescind my full-time offer).

Given that I have not received any official offer letter  from Company B and also would be risking losing my current signed official offer from Company A, do you guys think that it would be worth the risk of moving forward with the hiring process at Company B or just play it safe and stick with Company A?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, 

I'm graduating this summer (probably) and I have applied to a few new grad jobs but more so internships for winter and summer 2023 (was trying my luck with faang). 

I noticed that I'm getting more rejections this year for the internship positions than last year even tho I have more experience. I even applied to a few that I interviewed last year and still got rejected. Although I applied less this year the numbers still don't add up. 

I am worried that there is something wrong with my resume if I'm having a hard time landing an internship interview how will the new grad search go...

I'm currently a student working towards a bachelors in computer science and minor in German. I won't graduate until 2026, so won't be moving before then, but I hope to study abroad and intern abroad in Germany within that time.

I'm interested in the increased quality of life, workers rights, and abundant public transit found in Europe compared to the US. I've been reading that Germany is experiencing a population decline that will only worsen over time. From what I've read it seems like several European countries are looking for foreign workers to fill openings.

I'm hoping a bachelors in CS, some experience, and a basic fluency of German will be enough to land a job opportunity over there. I'm looking for any advice and sources I can use to find more info and make moving a reality.

Thank you!

Edit: If more education is necessary, I would be very interested in earning a masters at a European university."

Essays - Probably 7.5-8.0/10? I wrote on my parents' separation (common topic), but I focused on the impact and new responsibilities I got and how I became more compassionate and open to helping others so that they didn't have to study/work independently.

My short answers are probably an 8/10. I made sure to focus on why UT/McCombs and how specific professors (I mentioned some names) would give me the best opportunity to succeed. I also focused on my experience in the financial and business sectors (coursework, fundraising, and independent investing) to show fit for major.

I wrote my BHP answer on Ethereum's relation with the Blockchain Trilemna (scalability, decentralization, security) and how I hope to work with UT's resources to find solutions to Ethereum's high transaction fees without sacrificing decentralization. Application of my solution to the reminder of finance could then result in a more streamlined, efficient, and practical financial sector.

LoR - 7.0/10? Nothing too great here either, kind of standard. One was from my Kumon math teacher, and the other was from my Business and Professional Communications professor at my community college.

Other: I skipped two grades, so I didn't have the same type of opportunities (internships, jobs, etc.) as others might have had due to my age. Also, my parents separated, so I had to deal with increasing family responsibilities at the same time (as hinted by my essay).

Thank you very much!"

I like my job and it pays well, but my wife and I want to relocate to be closer to family and it’s unlikely I’ll find something similar to what I’m doing now in the specific area we want to move. 

My brother-in-law is a software engineer and introduced me to coding. I’ve been learning for fun for a little while and really enjoy it. I’m still in the nascent stages — I’ve done Python for everybody, a little bit of Unity training with C#, and now I’m about halfway through CS50.

Anyway, I think I would really enjoy going the self-taught route for full stack and making a career change. I imagine I would be more likely to get a remote job in software that would give me flexibility with location than pharmacy. The problem is I have a family, house, cars and all that jazz. I would of course be starting as a junior developer, I don’t think an internship would even be a possibility financially. 

I’ve crunched the numbers, and the lowest I can comfortably go down from my current salary would be $90k without making some significant adjustments to our finances (I still have student loans). Regardless whether or not this would be a wise thing to pursue, are there even entry-level jobs that pay $90k and, if so, what are the odds of getting one without a CS degree? Also, would the non-CS related doctorate degree I have help me at all with getting through the initial HR algorithms or with a salary that a company might offer? Any advice is appreciated and sorry if I messed up any jargon."

I'm currently a senior student majoring in Finance, and I unfortunately don't have any work experience in Finance yet. 

I'm considering double majoring in Information Systems Management as I'm very interested in tech and it seems like a lot of companies want people that are more familiar with tech.

Plus, if I choose to double major, I'll graduate in Dec. 2024 instead of Dec. 2023, so this would give me more time to land an internship before graduation.

Would this be a good move?"

Hi again guys, would just like to make a follow up post to this previous post

[https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/zxsvvo/unsure\_of\_how\_to\_continue\_on\_with\_my\_life/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/zxsvvo/unsure_of_how_to_continue_on_with_my_life/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Firstly, Mods, I would like to apologise for making a duplicate post. My previous one had really vague information on it and I wanted to give more details so that commenters can better understand my situation and advise

Secondly, thank you to everyone who commented on my post. I really appreciate the kind words that you had to offer. There were some common questions that were asked which is also why I decided to create this update post.

Lastly, I have a confession to make. I…lied a little about my situation back in my previous post. I know my siblings use Reddit and I don’t want them to know that I posted here asking for help as I’m not on good terms with them. I understand that some of you might feel cheated and scold me for lying and dramatizing, to which I understand. I do not deserve the kind words that people have given me, but I still choose to make this post in an effort to correct it and let people know my true situation. I sincerely apologize for twisting my story. Henceforth, I will be honest about my situation but instead of saying something that is not true, I’ll try to keep specifics as ambiguous as possible to avoid it being traced back to me…

The story starts when I was in Uni Y3. Prior to this, I had obtained a diploma. I did well enough there to be admitted into one of the Big 3 Unis in one of the most prestigious courses in SG. So I started in Uni about 2 Years ago. Just FYI, I didn’t get the direct year 2 option as my diploma was unrelated to my course of study in Uni. Anyways, by the time I was in Y2, COVID was starting to peak and classes starting turning to online. It was during this period that I earned my first mental health gym badge. I got diagnosed with OCD. It was OCD of a confessional kind. I went around confessing left right center and long story short, it almost got me expelled. But I sort of got off with a warning. With that I completed 1 more semester with this OCD and progressed to 3rd Year. This is when it all gets derailed.

It started when I was in Year 3. I’m not sure what triggered it but I suddenly found myself throwing everything into my study but not getting any results. I would spend hours watching a half an hour lecture, repeating it over and over again as I did not understand its contents. Not understanding contents is not anything new to me, there were a lot of concepts I didn’t understand in Year 1 and 2 but I kind of rolled with it. But I’m not sure why this particular year was such an issue. Long story short, I burnt out, crashed and out of desperation I took a semester of LOA. Subsequently, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. For about a few weeks I wandered around the house like a ghost and had nothing to do. I slept from 8PM to around 3PM the next day. Everytime I never felt like I had enough sleep. I felt tired all the time, I wasn’t eating and I wasn’t taking care of myself. My parents could only watch as their son descended deep into depression.

Then comes the next phase of my life. I requested to bring forward my credit bearing internship. Before my LOA, I had secured a credit bearing internship with a company that I liked and have always dreamt of working there. So I thought bringing it forward would give me something to do while I decide what to do with my life. It was a terrible mistake. I didn’t learn anything, wasn’t taught anything (my mentor was a fresh grad himself). I really tried my best to ask around for things to do but I found myself doing exactly what I did at home, walking around like a ghost with no purpose. This is when I started having suicidal thoughts. I was eating lunch one day and it just slipped into my mind, how wonderful it would be to take my own life, to end this suffering. I alerted my counsellor of this and he told my father to admit me to A&amp;E but at the end of the day we just let it pass. I kept thinking about it all the time though. Things got worse when I declared to my supervisor that I had mental health issues. I had to. I was seeing the psychologist once a week and disappearing from office for an afternoon is getting harder. They didn’t immediately terminate me but they put a lot of restrictions on me. They said if I needed to go into the workshop, I had to be accompanied by someone. They relocated me away from the team and they fucking told the whole team about it ! Eventually I decided to end the internship early as I felt it wasn’t doing me any good.

Now I am back to square one. Wandering around the house, sleeping 18 hours, plus suicidal thoughts. It got so bad that I would sit on the edge of the raised platform and stare down. I never got the courage to jump though. In the end I decided to overdose on anti depressants. However, I was intercepted by my psychologist who immediately wrote a letter to admit me to a psychiatric ward and off I went.

When in hospital, my medicine regiment was overhauled and I slowly began to get better. I even begun watching lecture videos of other universities in preparation for going back to school. But after I was discharged, that excitement died down. This was around November. I had to make the decision whether to go back to school or extend my LOA. I really didn’t know what decision to make. I subconsciously started to apply for random jobs on the internet, probably in a way to escape going back to school. Lo and Behold, a small SME company got back to me and I took another semester of LOA.

So here is roughly where the story ends. I’ve been with this small SME for a year now and I feel super fortunate that I found this place. The boss is nice and I enjoy my work. Like I seriously do enjoy my work. Unlike in my internship place, here I have a responsibility and when people want something done, I am proud to say I can help them with it because I am familiar. Unlike what I claimed in my previous post, I actually have no debt and still am staying with my parents (they didn’t kick me out). I understand this is one major lie, so I apologize again…

However, in the past few months, a few major events have taken place… My LOA is expiring again and I have made the decision to end this once and for all. I submitted my withdrawal application and it was approved. The school didn’t contact me or anything to convince me otherwise. Doesn’t matter anyways as I already made up my mind. Now I’m truly only a diploma holder…

This is where the story ends and I ask for advice. I really do not know what to do with my life at this point. I see no light at the end of the tunnel… I can’t go back to school as I have nightmares of uni regularly that have not been resolved… People keep telling me stories of diploma holder success stories but come on, lets be honest, they are one in a million… Just to clear things up, I’m not actively suicidal anymore, lets just say passively suicidal, like I wouldn’t mind if I just died tomorrow.

I guess…that’s the end of my post. Thank you for reading so far. I would appreciate if you could give me some advice or your thoughts on this matter…

**FAQs**

Are you able to go back to uni, perhaps in the future in another Uni ?

Ans : As I am currently, no, I have recurrent nightmares with regards to school and have not been able to get past them...

Are you able to switch to public ?

Ans : I could... but I've experienced public healthcare before and am not too impressed with the waiting times and quality of service for it. Moreover I have always hesitated to change psychologist / psychiatrist as its always a back to square one kind of thing... I am looking into changing psychiatrist though as the only thing I do is go there, chit chat 15 mins and he gives me the same medications...

Why did you lie about your situation in your previous post ?

Ans : Once again, I apologize...I really did not intend to lie. I wanted to throw off the trail but realised no use to do so... I don't blame you if you feel betrayed...

Thank you all"

I am feeling overwhelmed about what to do after I end college. Specifically in what work field should I specialize.

I've seen a lot of stuff in Mechatronics but the thing that passionate me the most its programming, I love writing code and getting that dopamine hit every time something works.  The thing is, I genuinely don't know in which programming field I want to develop myself. 

I have a few options in mind like Test Engineering or Embedded Software. 

Currently I work as a Quality Engineering Intern, and I'm using a lot of Python to get data scattered in multiple files to do Statistical Process Control and other sort of data analysis/recompilation, and they want me to do a Database for all the Quality department files. So right now, I'm learning SQL, and Power BI. 

And that also kind of opened the possibility to specialize in Data Science.

The thing is I really don't know what to do or in which area specialize.

Do you have any recommendations of areas of work as a programmer, where I can take advantage of my mechatronics engineering degree? 

Also, what about a master's degree? I'd like to start one as soon as I end college. Thank you in advance."

 I've been looking at potentially working at Best Buy, although I'm not sure if I would be doing anything technical or if I'd just be a retail rep, which would be fine I guess.  I would love to do something related to EE / IT, as I know a lot of Python and a decent amount of Linux, and I like working with electronics.

I do a lot of signal processing in MATLAB/Python through courses / research, I don't really know anything about web development.  I can't get paid for research and I already have an internship lined up for this summer, but I need to work this semester so I can actually afford housing for when I move.

I would be very interested in doing electronics repair, but I have no idea how you learn that kind of stuff.  I've done a little bit of repair (fixing and building a small game console, doing troubleshooting with Arduino/RPi and stuff) but nothing like actual consumer computers.  I'm assuming you have to get certified or something and there's not just like a track or position you can apply to and they'll teach you as you work?

If I can't find anything I might just go down the Linux rabbit hole with that time instead.  I'm doing fine in school and with research and technical skills, I just need to get paid.  My school doesn't have any open jobs that aren't either work study or have very specific requirements (like being a certified referee for intramurals or stuff like that)."

I will get around $5,000-7,000 in housing stipend and hourly wage is ~$50. 

San Francisco:

Pros:
- Biggest pro = Headquarters location (maybe more interns here, some of my team is here and the rest are remote)
- More friends in CA
- Flights home will be cheaper 

Cons:
- Doesn’t seem to be in the nicest part of city
- Won’t have a car, may need to commute by train?

NYC:
Pros:
- Biggest pro = walking everywhere
- Might be warmer than San Francisco?

Cons:
- housing might be more difficult to find
- nervous about visiting less familiar place (never been to NY, don’t know anyone)
- Office might be smaller and less established - not entirely sure

Edit: Ahhhhh thanks everyone. I think I’m going to NY!!

Maybe, I should take internship and if I get better offer just leave?"

When I was an intern a couple of years ago, I used to work with a team that had a DQE. Since I was an intern I was not really exposed to what they were doing but I remember that every time we ingested a new data source, they ran a quality check script on the data (guessing its freshness, schema check, and other qc stuff).

I also know they had a testing dwh with a copy of 3 day old prod data, where they ran daily QC checks and I’m guessing trying to catch any anomaly or error. 

Do understand the first type of testing, but don’t really know what they are doing in the second one. Why 3 day old data? is that data refreshed daily? How will they catch anomalies? Are those tests hardcoded to the most minuscule detail to catch anything that’s different? 

I came upon a friend working at a unicorn that did something like this with 2/3 day old data. He told me that they did this at every level of their data lake. Is this best practices for qc then? 

My company severely lack QC in data and there is no real expertise. Trying to learn best practices to implement in our data products"
10daran,62,2023-01-16,Things I want to share with young undergraduates,Rumi94,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/10daran/things_i_want_to_share_with_young_undergraduates/,"Specifically for engineering undergraduates.

I first enrolled in UNSW in 2013 and yes, it has almost been 10 years since then. At the moment, I am still in UNSW as a postgraduate student. (had worked at a company for several years though) Several things I wish I knew or I did at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

1. GPA or WAM does not really matter unless you are pursuing postgraduate. 
2. Do internship as early as possible. Without the field experience, it is hard to understand why you are learning this topic and how this topic is applied to the real industry. Even with minimum experience, you will have better understanding in what you are studying.
3. Get close to the lecturers/professors. You will need referees or recommendation letters very often in the future.
4. If you are pursuing postgraduates, try to participate in the lab and beg for putting your name in the publishable paper. If your name is included in the published paper, your life becomes easier.
5. You and I are just normal guys but there will always be genius people getting full marks all the time. Just let them be and do your best.
6. I admit I hated socialisation. However, it is really important. You do not need to do things that will let you post on LinkedIn everyday, but just try to attend at least events in your faculty.
7. Everyday I realise how important CS is. Yes, everyone is doing CS and all the reddit posts are asking what CS courses to take in the first year. Still, I find it very essential and I am preparing for masters in CS. Consider double majoring in CS, if you aren't too late and affordable enough. 

Enjoy your life and study hard!"

I don't know how I made it through high school, I did exactly 0 my entire school career and still passed. So my mom was like ""Right well next step is University and I was like uh yes ma'am"" and off I went to university with a government bursary, 5 months later I had dropped out mainly because I was not that interested in it and I had fallen behind (First time living alone was not helping the situation)

So then my mom was like ok that's fine then lets find something you are actually interested in, so we find a college nearby to my ex university that offers a software engineering degree, I had said to my mom I am interested in development but was not sure if I wanted to do it as a career, I was good at it in HS but wasn't certain it was for me. But anyway I agreed and it went as well as you would expect, I stopped 2 **weeks** later for a variety of reasons but mainly because the classes were 4 hours long, the content was outdated as fuck and I hated the environment, and lastly the place was really far away and I had no transport, thank god my ADHD had my back and I had been forgetting to sign the enrollment papers, so we got a 100% refund. 

Then my mom was like bruh, but she still wanted me to find something good for me, so she found a different software related course that was 100% online, and it was way better than the previous one, and I agreed, but uh yeah its been 5 months and I have completed 15% of it, the course is 6 months long and to extend it I need to pay more money, I am really upset with myself but I physically cannot bring myself to sit down and do it, I just don't find it interesting. I feel really bad for my mom and my granny who paid for it (1200 USD), I am of course going to pay her back but I feel bad for letting them down. 

At least I have figured out that what I really want to do is network engineering, I got a job at a ISP as a technician intern and I am really excited to start in February, I want to gather experience and certificates and work my way up the ladder, but I feel bad for giving up the course. Should I try and chow lots of Ritalin to force myself through or just disappoint my mom and my gran but go on to do network engineering? I feel like all these blunders would never have happened if I had just sat down and worked but I really physically feel like I cannot sit and work, not matter how hard I try. I love my ADHD but also hate how it's affected parts of my life and how I have been gaslit into thinking it is just an excuse.   


Any advice or stories from you guys?"

I’ve been making many phone calls lately and for about a year I felt as if it would never get easier but I think I have reached a point where it takes me a little less time to prepare. I used to sit on my chair for half an hour trying to calm myself down before I could finally impulsively just click the call button because i knew I would never feel prepared but now it only took me about 7 minutes of actually sitting there. I think I am actually making progress for once. Last week I also went to two job interviews and I have a small internship at one of those places tomorrow so I am extremely terrified of that but once that is over I am done with the awful anxiety for now. I was also scared about the driving lessons since my driving instructor was a little harsh but I’ve made progress and she even told me I‘m doing really well.
10degvw,21,2023-01-16,How can I most effectively spend my last semester to steer myself towards an embedded related job?,Elfgoat_,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/10degvw/how_can_i_most_effectively_spend_my_last_semester/,"Hey everyone, looking for a bit of guidance on where to steer myself and how to most effectively maximize my time in order to prepare myself for working in this field or an adjacent field after I graduate soon.

The basics of my situation are

* I'm coming up on my last semester of school getting a standard CS degree.
* I have a solid foundation of C, C++, and C#. Also logic programming with something like Logisim
* I've discovered more throughout my time in the program that I enjoy lower level programming and problem solving more than high level web dev, machine learning, A.I., etc...
* The school's curriculum hasn't been the greatest, and we have no EE department. It's covered a lot of the basics but it's felt very sporadic and the department is quite underfunded. I only took one remotely hardware-esque class that was Microcomputer Organization and basically just taught the basics of circuits and logic in Logisim up to registers, counters, adders, etc... I really enjoyed this class but that's about where it stops in that direction.
* I did, however, do an independent study with the same professor where I chose to learn the basic ins and outs of an MSP430 (In ASM and C, dealing with registers, I2C, UART, IRQs, etc...). I also, during this class, built an 8 bit CPU from scratch in Logisim that can (very limitedly) be given instructions to add, subtract, etc... which is probably my most attractive project that I've done. I also have a small algorithm project that I wrote for a class once that multithreads a binary version of radix sort. I don't think it's necessarily anything impressive to show off but that may show more of what areas I have interest in.
* However, I don't have any actually physical projects using the MSP430 or anything else otherwise.

So that brings me to this upcoming semester. I have another research-type class that I plan on taking where I can basically run free with whatever idea I pitch to my professor, but I also want to take time aside from that this semester to start brushing up on and filling in any holes of my foundational knowledge in Embedded.

So all of that being said, I have a few questions

* Given my independent research class, what would be the best use of this class? Should I delve deeper into the things I already know a bit about? Expand out to learn more about some other things? Do more projects?
* How much should I focus on more projects / Is there some kind of ""embedded leetcode"" that I should use to practice for interviews, or are normal coding interview questions to be expected? Of course I plan on doing both projects and interview questions, but unsure if I should prioritize one over the other.
* How common are embedded internships? Should I try to land an internship and then work my way up in knowledge, or is it more of a ""We'll bring you on and bring you up to speed quickly as we go"" type thing?
* What do interviewers look for the most in your experience?
* I've been reading a lot about Rust, and it seems like a language that I definitely plan to become proficient in. What's it's place in Embedded? Should I prioritize it if I want to work in embedded or should I spend more time filling in holes in C / C++?
* Aside from C, C++, ASM, and potentially Rust, is there any other crucial kind of language or methodology that I should pick up to expand my options and make myself more attractive for internships? Is there anything unexpected that I should learn more of us as Python, Java, web dev knowledge, networking, Bash, etc...?

Anyway I hope that this isn't too similar to a lot of other posts that I imagine come through but I really just want to gather some opinions on how to do things, as my university doesn't really have many resources that I can consult with on this. Thanks in advance."

I did look this up on Google or on a few subreddits about it, and while it seems that the BA vs BS does not matter, I am unsure about the courses needed to pass and how important they are. In my major, We do take pre-calculus, business stats, and Discrete Math/Structures, and I did pass these classes with an A. However, I am unsure as to how it will affect me when finding a software engineer job or even my performance in one. I am pretty weak when it comes to math, however I am trying to learn it on my own time. 

I'm just worried I won't be able to find a software engineering job at places such as google or whatever since my curriculum isn't math intensive, and my academic advisor is against me taking them as a part of a minor since it might take longer for me to graduate. 

In my situation despite having a 3.8 GPA, I don't think I have any time to pursue an internship since I work almost full time and need to do so to support my mom and family. Am I screwed in this situation or at a disadvantage? What can I do to ensure I have a better future in software engineering?

Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted...I think it's a pretty valid question."
10dfkn7,29,2023-01-16,TIFU by getting drunk and losing a tooth.,shakyfoot,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10dfkn7/tifu_by_getting_drunk_and_losing_a_tooth/,"So this is currently still ongoing and is making my life a living hell. I’m not quite sure what the moral of this story is, maybe one of you can make that out for me.


Flashback to this last 2022 New Years Eve night, my partner and I are celebrating by playing a drinking game at home, eating charcuterie, listening to music, all fun stuff. It had been a long time since we had drank together, and even longer since we had made it past the 2-3 beer sleepiness that typically sent me off to snooze land.


This night we had made it our mission to drink as much we could and just truly let go and enjoy our night together. Fast forward to 4 or 5 beers in and some cherry bombs, I was feeling pretty good. We were goofing off, I was dancing to a Pixies record, just enjoying ourselves. 


A few moments later, a wave of nausea hits me. I stumble into our bathroom and sit down on the ground in front of the toilet. I knew I wouldn’t be leaving the bathroom without spewing. I start to prep myself mentally for what’s to come.
Before I know it, one after another I projectile vomit into the toilet at least three times. All of the beautiful salamis, cheeses, and nuts we had put on our charcuterie had left my stomach in an instant.


My partner had stood behind me rubbing my back and flushed the toilet a few seconds after. I stand up ready to return to the bedroom, when all of a sudden I sober up very very fast.


My body enters a state of panic, my heart rate triples. The sick feeling of doom and despair throws my heart into my gut. My tooth is missing. 


You see, I unfortunately inherited a missing adult lateral incisor on my top row of teeth. As a teenager I had received a flipper/ partial to fill that tooth through my insurance (medicaid).


If you don’t know what that is, it’s basically a temporary tooth that is removable. It sit flat against the roof of your mouth, and was the only option my insurance would cover/I could afford. 


We had flushed it down the fucking toilet.


This had never happened before, but apparently the vomiting was so intense, it flee out of my mouth and neither of us had even noticed.


I’m a college student a semester away from graduating and have an internship coming up in two weeks. There’s absolutely no way I can go missing this tooth.


I frantically start calling every dentist’s office within a 50 mile radius. After ten different phone calls, only one office gives me a date for a month away.


So, I begin my internship wearing a mask. They have no scheduled lunches so I end up going 8 hours without eating from embarrassment. I only have to get through a week of my internship before my dentist appointment, I can do this.


Fast forward to present day, Im eagerly awaiting my appointment at 4pm today. For some reason I’ve had a bad feeling something wouldn’t go as planned. 8am this morning I get a voicemail.


“Hi, I apologize but our dentist will not be able to come in today. He will be out of the office for a month. You’ll need to reschedule.”


So that’s my life right now. Feeling like things couldn’t be much worse. Hope if you’re dealing with something bad in your life this makes you feel a little better.

TL; DR: Got drunk and projectile vomited. My partial came out and was accidentally flushed. Haven’t been able to get a replacement for over a month."

We'll just clearing L1 doesn't guarantee a job but it might 50-50 chances. 

Before I apply to a B-School I need to have a career path and should show progress towards it, I just can't apply abroad without a work-ex in similar field.

If i start from March I'll give the exam in Feb2024, also the GMAT is valid for 5yrs

In April of last year and after a miserable experience at my last job, I decided to quit and dedicate more time to perfecting my Front-End Web Dev Skills. I had studied already, but I needed more experience as I wanted a complete career path change. Yet I had hope since I know programming or IT in general is a very blooming field.

I have tried, after more studying, to get an unpaid internship or ANYTHING that will just allow me to put one foot inside this World. I know how it works and to get the wheel spinning, you generally need some experience. I have not found a single job post that didn't ask for 2 to 5 years of experience, even min wage. I don't know if I am looking in the wrong places, or haven't curated my profile enough.

I think one issue is my LinkedIn. Because I worked with a couple of CEOs directly they have added me, along with all subordinates, to their network. I would say this probably expanded my network significantly, because I've had a *rain* of offers to go back to being an Executive Assistant. The thing is I still hate the job as I did when I quit last year, and I feel if I take it, I will become permanently stuck in this career path. 

During these months I've been also handling other stuff I needed to such as health issues and getting a driver's license, even started writing a book which has been great. I wouldn't want to reach the 1 year without a job mark, though, and I'm starting to feel my chances in the IT Industry might not be so many after all. I don't have applied knowledge/experience and that's the main problem, but I do know how to code using HTML+CSS+Javascript+Angular and I am learning Typescript plus potentially another framework alternative to Angular just to have more skills.

What would be your advice in this case? Am I just doing a poor job with my applications, or looking in the wrong places? I am VERY used to interviews/resumes in my field, but I am a rookie with no one to give me some orientation when it comes to Front End Web. Thanks."

I'm currently a student at the University of Edinburgh and I am very intrigued to hear of your opinions of transferring itself. I am very much happy with my experience here as a student but I just feel like I'm missing out on a lot (especially when I compare my experience with my brother who is currently studying at Columbia). I have listed a pros and cons list on my intentions to travel and I would love to hear your opinions as well. 

Pros:
1. Epicenter of the Scottish Enlightenment Period ( David Hume &amp; Adam Smith come to mind) - lots of important history within the university and Europe itself

2.Student Lifestyle is quite good for me - just a perfect sense of busy and peaceful - dark academia vibes here as well - holidays to other European countries are just super cheap as well

3.Not a bad ranked university - certainly a well known and highly reputable institution by its own merit (15th in the world as of 22/23 but rankings are bogus anyway) - as a student studying PPE, their department is not the worst good enough

Cons:
1.Most of the social work/societies/ I'm involved in only go as far as well as the Scottish context - compared with my brother who has been doing internships and work for the UN itself (I'm not Scottish at all btw) 

2.Arguably not as well reputable as any of the T25s here - definitely not as well regarded as all of the Ivy's - not too sure about others

3. Networking and opportunities -  really important for me as I am heavily into/interested the startup scene - my brother is the one who has been helping me a lot through his own involvements - my Unis own entrepreneurial scene is not too great

Would be happy to hear any and all input."

I'm in my final year of a Computer Science BSc at a good University in the UK. I get my degree results in early or mid September 2023, so I guess that's the earliest I can start a job.

I haven't applied for anything yet due to some personal issues. These issues also interrupted my studies a bit, and so I've been very busy with preparing for exams. Things will ease up in around a week though.

I haven't done any internships. I have done a lot of coding on my own. Though I don't have many ""polished"" CV-worthy projects, as I often move on after I feel like I've explored something well enough.

I also haven't really done any interview preparation such as Leetcode. I’m not really sure how common those kind of interviews are here though.

All of this has made me feel like I'm not really ready to start applying for jobs, even though I want to. Particularly as I want to work in Bristol, so I'm worried about ""wasting"" applications when there isn't a limitless amount of positions. I'd be okay with working remotely, but would prefer somewhere hybrid that's based in Bristol.

I'm just not really sure what to focus on now. I'm very confident in my programming ability when it comes to building things, though less so for Leetcode-style interviews. I have some quite large coursework projects, and it wouldn't take that long to polish up a personal project or two. But I think I'll still struggle a lot to figure out when I'm ""ready"".

It's important to me to have something lined up if at all possible, as it would take a significant toll if I have to live with my parents for a while.

I'm quite worried that I am already a bit late, though. So I would really appreciate any advice or general guidance.

Thanks :)"
10dqavp,15,2023-01-16,Feeling stuck in small boutique IB firm. Few lateral opportunities and concerned about exit opps.,Throwawayforfeenance,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/10dqavp/feeling_stuck_in_small_boutique_ib_firm_few/," *(Just want to preface that I'm grateful to be in the situation I am now, with a well-paying role and for having had the opportunity to join investment banking straight out of college. I'll do my best not to make this too ""woe is me"", but be warned, there is a lot of me bitching and whining or lamenting past mistakes...)*

I'm currently an Investment Banking Associate (recently promoted) at a small US, tech-focused boutique IB. Very unstructured, between 20-30 people. I joined this firm in early 2021, put in some solid reps with my seniors for the last two years and was recently rewarded with an early promotion around 2022 EOY. This boutique firm is a solid place to learn (although it's pretty much Analysts teaching themselves the role, with not much oversight or guidance), with the caveat that we work on smaller deals so there is almost no modelling to speak of (financial forecasting, DCF, LBO, etc.). Typically dealing with $30M-100M EV clients. I have some other gripes with the firm but irrelevant for this post.

As for why I joined this boutique firm... Due to a variety of reasons (international student with unusual visa situation, weird course structure - can describe further in PMs), I was not really eligible for a summer analyst internship in my junior year and thus never applied for those. Come graduation-time, I had a few off-cycle internships with similar boutique-level IBs on my resume but couldn't really catch the attention of MM or BB IBs (that and my international status was enough to get me dinged at most places I applied). Eventually, I connected with my current firm via networking and was lucky enough to receive an offer from them.

Anyways my recent promotion has spooked me a bit. It sounded the 'alarm bells' for me that if I don't step up my game in trying to lateral somewhere, I'll be ""stuck"" here (either stalled or moving up the ranks to VP then Principal over the years, etc.). I'm very worried that the more time I spend in this unstructured environment, only interacting with smaller clients (no modelling needed), the less ""transferrable"" I become. I know that expectations for Associates and VPs ramp up in larger banks and I don't feel that I am anywhere close to a BB / EB / MM Associate at the moment... I'm probably behind most 1st-year Analysts when it comes to data analysis / modelling / transaction structuring, although I can drive a basic sell-side process with little to no supervision.

The problem is that I just don't see a lot of lateral opportunities. If anything, I missed the boat during the 2020-2021 hiring frenzy and we are now plunging into a recession (GS / CS employee cuts are telling of the recruiting environment). I blew a lateral process with a MM IB last year (after 4 rounds, messed up my final round with the head of this coverage group) and have been offered nothing serious since. To top it off, my visa issues aren't resolved yet so I'm an even less hireable candidate.

**Here are my options as I seem them. Curious if people could weigh in and opine if my fears are justified or not**...

* **(Lateral)**. Stay in my current role, grind out technicals and train my modelling chops on the side. Hope that the market has calmed down in 2 years' time and make the jump then (selling myself as a 2nd-year or 3rd-year Associate willing to join as a 1st-year). Network like crazy until then.
* **(MBA).** In other words, sink $200K on an MBA in the hopes of being recruited as an MBA Associate in a prestigious BB / EB 3-4 years from now. My career path isn't particularly unique but I can grind out the GMAT and hope I land in a M7 / T20 school. Not the most financially-savvy option.
* **(Recruit for buy-side).** Some recruiters reach out to me for buy-side opportunities so that gives me some hope. But I pretty much never hear back from them after the first touchpoint. And don't really fancy my chances going up against other BB / EB / MM applicants.
* **(Switch industry).** My long-term goal would be corporate strategy + corporate development type role, in a specific industry. But I think that it would be much easier to recruit for these roles if I was coming from a recognizable / prestigious IB.

After reading all this, you may be asking yourself, ""but why [u/throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway/) why go so through much trouble just to join a BB IB or something similar."" Answer is really stupid and immature. I just derive a lot of my self-worth from my place of work. I'm not particularly invested in IB but I can't leave without having proven to myself that I can ""make it"" by joining a firm that my friends and family might recognize. Fair game to those who want to clown on me in the comments."
10dquum,1,2023-01-16,How to apply to multiple jobs,EGTB724,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10dquum/how_to_apply_to_multiple_jobs/,"I will be finishing my Master's in computer science in May and am trying to job shop for my first full time job. 

I have a lot of anxiety about sending out mass applications. From what I've heard from friends, most companies give you little time to make a decision once given an offer. However, if I want to apply to several places to maximize my starting salary, how do I line it up so that I can actively make decisions on multiple offers (if I even get any haha) if I'm only going to get a week to make a decision on any individual one. 

This has been on my mind quite a bit lately, and is making me nervous to get the ball rolling. The main reason is because I worked an internship last summer and it seems highly plausible that they will give me a full-time offer. Unfortunately, that specific application doesn't open until next month. Another company that I am highly interested in just posted openings this week. I've applied to some positions there, but I'm nervous that they'll get back to me before my internship company gives me an offer, forcing me to make a decision before I have everything on the table. 

Am I overthinking this? Is it okay to ask for more time to make a decision? Is there any advice anyone has on how to handle this scenario?"

I am a Canadian citizen and my entire family is Canadian with a property in Florida. I am seeking to move to the USA (preferably a WARM state) for health and happiness reasons.

I have researched every visa, and I plan to start applying to American jobs after I graduate. I believe my only option is to secure a job offer and a sponsorship from an American employer that would fit into a TN visa category position. There are several categories I could pursue with a business degree, so if any particular titles are known to be approved more easily I’d like to know. If anyone has any experience or advice related to this, please tell me!

I am also researching the J1 visa and securing an internship in the USA before I graduate or shortly after. This visa appears to be easier to get and although it is very temporary, it would provide me with an opportunity to live and work in America.

I have no ties to Canada, I am not concerned about living far from my family and I am single. I have a place to live freely for as long as possible in Florida to find an employer and speak with local officers if it would help.

I know that there is a popular consensus that Canada is superior to the USA but everyone’s life is different, and my living preferences are much better suited to America. I am open to anything, but keep in mind that I have spent a lot of time in both countries and I have extensively researched this plan.

Let me know what you think, I am aware that I am optimistic but I truly believe in myself. This is my one and only priority after I graduate.

Thank you!"
10ds6wi,1,2023-01-16,Next Step in Data Analytics Learning Path?,itsdatmanjb33,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10ds6wi/next_step_in_data_analytics_learning_path/,"A bit of backstory... I just recently graduated from college with a Sport Business degree and, after spending 5 months working a sports internship, I do not want to do that anymore. I decided that I wanted to get into data analytics / technology consulting and so for the past 6 months I have been teaching myself basic technological skills commonly used in these industries. My skill level with Microsoft Excel was already fairly advanced, so all I have done is brushed up on pivot tables. Starting from no knowledge whatsoever, I have taught myself SQL and practiced writing queries using the Northwind database to the point where I cannot come up with a business case that I would not know how to solve using query. I initially learned everything using PostgreSQL and am in the process of transferring that syntax knowledge to MySQL. My tableau skills are more reserved due to my limitations of using Tableau Public, however with any given dataset I can create any basic graph and have it look all pretty and presentable with labels and colors and whatnot. Definitely still more to learn but I am about maxed out without being able to connect Tableau to a SQL database and being limited to Excel spreadsheets. 

Now to my question... what next? I have been talking with various consulting firms like Slalom and KPMG and am hearing the same feedback which is that I am doing all the right things, but I am just at a significant disadvantage with a non-technical degree and no actual data analysis professional experience. I plan on putting together a GitHub portfolio showing my SQL and Tableau skills, however am unsure as to whether obtaining any certifications would be worth the trouble as some businesses may not care about certifications. I am currently learning basic cloud principles and plan on obtaining my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification next month. I also have heard some people mentioning R Studio as a good foundation for data cleaning and data preparation, and will likely look into that within the next week or so.

I am not sure what to do now though. With a non-technical degree and no professional experience, I feel that despite my best efforts to become as skilled as possible by teaching myself stuff like SQL and Tableau, there simply isn't enough there especially considering many places are toning down their hiring efforts due to the recession. I am posting here to gauge what you all have to say about my situation, and if there is anything in particular you think I am missing from my skillset that would drastically improve my chances of even just getting an interview from a consulting firm or the data analysis department of a company. I will be trying to respond to every comment, and I look forward to hearing what y'all have to say."

I’m in my early 20s, have been in a cushy office job for some time now via internship in college converted to full time role that I’ve been at for about 3 years. It actually hasn’t been a nightmare, occasional long days and stress but I enjoy spending time with coworkers my age, feel like I’m learning a lot, getting paid nicely (albeit still underpaid IMO) and otherwise am progressing well.

The only problem occurs when I’m dealing with managers, executives, and other leaders around the firm who seem to have dedicated their lives to work. Consistent sacrifices of anything from time to family to health to all of the above and frankly, that isn’t for me. I have a rich life of hobbies, outside passions, and a wonderful friend group and support system and I’m not about to take a heavy step back from any of them in the name of upward progression. 

I’ve shared this fear with my one older colleague whom I trust immensely and they assure me that it won’t happen and that they are an example of that but for every case I see where it doesn’t happen, I have ten+ zombie managers that may as well have “property of XYZ Company” written on their foreheads.

What tips and tricks do you have to maintain this separation while still being committed to a job you enjoy? TIA."

10e2njp,1,2023-01-16,"Applying to my last comp-sci internship, what should I focus on next?",StupendousTurtle,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10e2njp/applying_to_my_last_compsci_internship_what/,"At my university the coop program helps you find 3 internships before you graduate. I took my first internship too early and wasn't able to find a coding-related internship. 

I am currently taking my second internship and so far I work as a data marketing intern. I develop and maintain ETL with python and sql as well as a lot of smaller projects where I can technically use any language I want to complete a task. 

I am now able to apply to my 3rd and last internship right before I graduate and I am wondering what I should do. Ofcourse this depends on my interests as well as experience.

Experience wise, I am very comfortable with Java, Python, SQL and HTML/CSS . My secondary langauges that I have some experience in but would need a few weeks of practice to get back into would be C#, C/C++ and Javascript. I have taken courses for other languages but I still consider myself a beginner in those.

Interest wise I don't know! I am really interested in machine learning and ai but most job listings I've seen require a masters, which I do not want to do. I want to avoid web dev because it seems like a very static job with little diversity in tasks. I also want to avoid python and sql to get more diverse experience so that data scientist is not the only job I won't have trouble finding post graduation. 

I am curious in game dev and I also see lots of postings with C++, so I am prioritising C++. I am also prioristing java but not so much as java is my most profficient language, so I am not eager to back it up with experience, whereas C++ I would need to do some practice which would force me to up my profficiency in it before applying. 

If I should consider other languages based on my profficiencies please let me know! What language(s) should I learn next that could pair well with the languages I know already (like how sql pairs well with python for data scientists)?"

I have officially signed an offer with a tech company after waiting on them for more than a month.

I'm making this post to shed light on my journey and how difficult it has been even with experience, but with a little bit of luck and hard work.. it does pay off. I have 3+ years of experience as a software engineer and had a few interns under my wing at previous companies. I am offering my help to anyone who may need it.. whether it be resume reviews or just general advice. My DM's are open. It has been very hard for me mentally these past few months being without a job and a stable income.. and I feel for anyone who is going through a recent layoff and is on the job search right now. I have had countless final-round interviews only to be told the position has been eliminated due to budget cuts.. (one company even strung me through 5 rounds and stated they'd give an offer and then bam 20% layoffs and stopped hiring). It was demoralizing. It is not your inability to interview or even get interviews, the economic climate is just not the best, but keep your head up. Everything will work out. It just takes one person to believe in you and extend an offer. Again please reach out if there is anything I can do to help."

10e46ty,3,2023-01-17,My future as a therapist feels far away.,Signal_Situation6914,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/10e46ty/my_future_as_a_therapist_feels_far_away/,"Hi everyone. First, I’d like to say thank you to everyone who shares their experiences on here. All of your posts have been enlightening and very helpful. 

I live in FL and I have BA in psych. I work at an organization with people who have intellectual disabilities &amp; mental illnesses, in the psychosocial department. My boss is awesome and I love my clients, but it’s extremely stressful because of their behaviors. I often dream of working somewhere that I can get more experience with mental heal, instead of DID being the focus. Or maybe get a less stressful job while I get a masters. 

I’ve applied to a few cmhc programs, and not gotten in due to my gpa. We only have a handful of colleges for in person programs where I am. A lot of programs also interfere with my work schedule anyways, because they are all day, 2-3 days a week on campus. Online programs are difficult for me. Then, there’s the idea of paying $50,000 for tuition. I’m already $30,000 in debt from my BA. I know everyone is in debt, but still. 

When I imagine owning a private practice in the future, I feel happy. Really getting into building a clientele, the stability of being done with school, the freedom of making my own schedule, and lastly the improved income. The interim of 2-3 more years of school, unpaid internship hours, making hardly any money under a provisional license….it discourages me. I’ll be 37 before I can go into private practice. That’s 6 more years of financial hardship. 

I’ve looked into life coaching as an alternative, but I worry that clients won’t feel as comfortable with me not having extensive training. Plus, I love the idea of billing through health insurance that people already have, as opposed to expecting OOP payments. This economy makes it hard to do that. 

Everyone tells me I am meant to be a therapist. My friends joke that they should pay me for my advice. It feels good to help people feel empowered to heal and solve their own problems. Maybe I have imposter syndrome? Lol 


Has anyone else been through anything similar? Should I find another job? Apply to more schools? Perhaps look into becoming an lcsw so I have more school options? I just need some direction from people who have been there. 

Thank you so much."

1) University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

4) University of Denver
5) University of Northern Colorado
6) University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth



Can anyone please tell me which universities out of these I have a shot at getting in at?"

This OSS aims to simulate the security and privacy risks of Machine Learning. This tool allows users to experiment with various combinations of attacks and defenses against ML/DL models, such as Model Inversion Attacks, Poisoning Attacks, BackDoor Attacks, Differential Privacy, Encryption, K-Anonnymization, and Federated Learning. I have implemented these algorithms with Python and C++. I use black, isort, pytest, and codacy to check the quality of codes. I also generate the documentation with sphinx, but the quality is not high. The coverage of test codes is around 70%.

Since I do not have much experience with OSS projects, I don't know the best practices for OSS management and development. For example, I guess I should do the following:

* Improving the coverage of test codes
* Making documents more informative and clearer
* Writing blog posts (in many languages)
* Implementing more algorithms
* Unifying APIs for different algorithms
* Create some good-first-issuesfor new contributors
* Gathering contributors, etc

How should I prioritize them? How do you keep motivated? Some people demand a lot without gratitude or contributions (of course, most people are really lovely!). I will be a senior in April, so I must also prepare for MS or Ph.D. applications. I also have to work for my tuition. How much time do you usually spend on OSS? Should I focus on other things like research internships or competitions like Kaggle?

Any suggestions are really welcome —many thanks for considering my question."

I am an intern and in my current position I work from home. Also I have very few tasks so I can often work on my post-grad's thesis instead, which I will be completing in a couple of months. I'll even be moving soon to another european country but my boss said there's no problem  and I can keep working from home. He also added that soon there'll be a lot more projects coming our way.

A few weeks ago though, just out of curiosity, I decided to send some resumés in the country I'll be moving to, and some folks have replied asking to set up an interview. Problems are that:  
1) I don't feel like I'm good enough for the positions, as there have been very little projects and I don't know some programming languages very well, and  
2) I fear it will be more stressful to start a new position in a new company, where they'll rightfully expect me to work full-time and even go to the office, and I'll have to once again postpone my graduation.

So, after consulting with my family, I decided not to pursue these new job opportunities so that I can complete my thesis. However, I talked to an older friend who pointed out it was a bad idea not to pursue these job opportunities as I can graduate anytime and the whole point of graduating is to find a job.

I don't feel ready, and I really want to graduate so that I don't have to think about it anymore, but maybe I'm just scared. Am I stupid for giving up on these opportunities?"

Despite loving my college and informatics as science, the moment I graduated and asked myself ""what's next?"" I came to realize that my current skillset will not even land me an intern position in my country, for reasons there is no point in discussing here.

So I tried to get into Back-end development alone at home in order to build my own portfolio and become capable to start my job hunting experience. Using my current knowledge of Java I figured that Spring boot is a good place to start. The thing is that despite spending several hours in watching courses and online guides, I struggle terribly at configuration. Configuration basically never stops and problems never stop coming. I am having the struggle of my life connecting a bare-bones application to a database and launching it that it would have almost been comical if not as frustrating.

I figured that back-end programming is a very hard task for somebody to get behind without proper real time guidance, and after trying for quite some time I am finally ready to give up on this ambition which saddens me deeply but it doesn't look like I have another option.

I am thinking about trying my luck with front-end development utilizing my knowledge in javascript and learn to use a framework technology such as React...

Now here is what truly concerns me and by this point I think it is obvious... CONFIGURATION.

Is Front-End development as simple as running an HTML file in a browser and combining it with CSS and javascript? is any configuration whatsoever required? is it as straightforward as learning to use a framework well and learning how to host a website online? I think at this point this might be my only choice..."

When she moved in, her dog went ballistic the first day and I immediately reported it to my landlord who takes things like this really seriously. My partner and my friend who was living with us both thought it was extreme, but I didn’t want to get looped into a situation where I have to wait until I’m getting so irritated to report it for the first time, and then have my landlord wonder why I never said anything. We’ve lived in this house for 3 years, and I did NOT move in knowing there would be a dog howling and barking constantly since she moved in about a year ago.

For the first few months, our housemate did a really good job keeping her under control. She treats her anxiety, exercises her regularly, etc. Over the summer, she was gone for an internship, and the dog was elsewhere with her family. Now she’s back, and the dog has been taking weeks to adjust. Her adjustment consists of her barking constantly which wakes me up almost every morning. She also lets the dog run around in the yard while barking to play as early as 7am.

I have told her in the moment that her dog is barking, but now I’m keeping a list and it’s happening multiple times a day in excess of half an hour for each interval. I’m so fucking sick of it. We also have 2 cats and it’s disturbing them hearing this loud dog howl and bark constantly.

I want to approach my housemate about it, but understand that she will probably say her dog is adjusting from being gone for so long and is doing all she can. What should I do? Should I set a deadline with her? How long is reasonable for me to expect her to adjust, it’s already been a month and it is not improving. I don’t want to go behind her back and report her to the landlord, but let me know advice for how to deal with this.

Please don’t tell me “this is just how dogs are they bark sometimes” or smth to the effect of suck it up and deal w it. I have a work from home job as well and it’s making it hard for me to be in meetings when this is going on audibly in the background."

Since the layoffs, I've been told I don't have anything to worry about and for months have been in the dark about what's going to happen. I feel like I'm doing two jobs and being taken advantage of.

I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow to talk more about this. In a month my current position will be obsolete (outsourcing) and I have no idea what's happening. I understand they can't tell everyone everything but a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel would be great.

**I understand that this time period is fast approaching, but I want to put my trust in the belief that there are still miracles in this world and professional contacts. And perhaps some of you who reside on the other side of the internet may have some contacts.**

I have been researching opportunities to complete an internship on my own, but I have come to realize that it is quite difficult to secure an internship as without any established contacts as nursing trainee.

(1) Due to Brexit, I am facing a significant obstacle as my clinic and my Erasmus coordinator has no connections in the UK.

(2) Some hospitals may only provide clinical placements for nursing students from institutions that have a learning agreement with their own institution, however, my hospital is still keen to establish partnerships with institutions in the UK.

Nonetheless, I am able to undertake my internship in the UK as my Erasmus+  permits me to do so, should I be able to secure a placement and some clinics may be willing to take me on as an intern as I only received my practice approval in December 2022.

I am eager to learn more about the role of nurses in the UK and how they work alongside other healthcare professionals to provide the best care possible.

During my year of Nursing training, I have proven to be highly competent during my training rotations in Internal Medicine with Palliative Care, Neurology, Orthopaedics, Trauma Surgery, and Sports Medicine.

For the most part this is bc 2020 ruined the year that I planned to go for co-ops and internships. I finished my engineering degree and was proud to have made it out. 

Someone how I landed an amazing opportunity with a really big company that manufactures pulp and paper. Going into the position with a completed curriculum but no real world application on how to use that, I struggled to find my footing and it showed. With everyone busy taking care of their own projects, I often had to scrounge up help/resources on my own. So did everyone else though. About 5 months into the job, I found myself sitting in HR’s office with my supervisor who told me I was being let go. This was devastating. 

At the time of my termination I was working 55-60 hours a week, renting hotel rooms bc the commute to work was 65 -68 mins, and I housed my dog at my parents place until I could to a stable routine at home. I had some pretty rough moments in college when I failed a class but nothing was more defeating than this moment. 

Fast forward to the end of 2022. I applied for jobs and gotten numerous interviews. Unfortunately, I’d been rejected from a few jobs i thought i stood a chance at. During this time, I reflected and thought I was doing everything I could. Needless to say, I struggled to maintain my confidence in getting back in the industry. 


****END OF BACKGROUND**** 


FINALLY, I’ve found the most ideal position at a private consulting firm located in the same town as my family and they’ve decided to push me through to the next round of interviews. I want so badly to get this role but I don’t want to make the same mistakes I’ve been making that prevented me from getting any of the other jobs in the past. 

The first round covered a bit of my skills and my personality match to the company. I think both parties are a mutual fit. 

The next interview is supposed to last half as long and with someone of a higher authority in the company. I thought maybe I would prepare to showcase my skills and working knowledge but I’m not sure how to prepare and share my skills/ experience/ how I can add value to the company in a 30min interview, as that is a very short amount of time. 

Is there any advice on how to prepare for this second interview?"

I'm a Tier 2 Helpdesk Support Tech making **$26/hr** and have 1 year and 6 months of IT experience. My 1-year mark with the company is coming up on Valentine's day and I'm going to request a raise/promotion. I currently possess 5 entry-level certs, work full time, and attend WGU majoring in Cybersecurity. I'm currently studying for Net+ (estimated before February 14) and will take Security+ afterward.

I've seen a few posts stating to attend internships to obtain experience mainly for people who do not have ~~experience attending college~~. I'm mainly contemplating this to attend Cybersecurity internships and to obtain experience in Cybersecurity to hopefully transition into a full-time role within the field.

My gut is telling me to just stick with my current role and do Cybersecurity projects to show my interest while also gaining work experience, but I'm unsure. If others have any suggestions, feel free to state them and maybe provide useful links/projects for me to look into.

Thanks!

10ejyvo,5,2023-01-17,"Inceput de cariera, salarii, ethical hacking, firma proasta, probabil pivotare in cariera spre programare, recomandari",Adorable-Account-148,programare,https://www.reddit.com/r/programare/comments/10ejyvo/inceput_de_cariera_salarii_ethical_hacking_firma/,"Salut!

Sa incep putin cu o descriere. Am 23 de ani si sunt junior penetration tester/ethical hacker intr-o companie din Iasi de aproximativ 6 luni. Inainte de acest job am mai facut un internship pe Java, Back-end Spring/Spring Boot. In vara am terminat si politehnica.

Eu am invatat in timpul liber din curiozitate si uite ca s-a tranformat si intr-un job, insa consider plecarea. Nu din cauza domeniului ci din cauza firmei: nivelul tehnic este de la praf in jos (nu se foloseste programare si linux spre exemplu si astea sunt cunostinte necesare de baza in penetration testing), de multe ori se gasesc greseli tehnice in raportele livrate catre clienti si astea facute de oameni cu ani de experienta, atrag atentia si nu se face nimic, se da putin timp pentru testare (undeva la 1-2 sapt, iar testarea se face de o singura persoana, iar aplicatiile sunt huge), de multe ori ajung extenuat acasa pentru ca incerc sa livrez munca de calitate si sa testez cat mai bine, colegii mei vad ca testeaza superficial, prin urmare nici rezultate in raport nu prea sunt. Apreciere din partea lor mai deloc, vin entuziasmat la oameni si le arat niste chestii noi descoperite sau invatate, dau din umeri si pleaca. Acum cateva luni am livrat unul din cele mai bune rapoarte din echipa pe anul 2022 (ca sa va faceti idee de nivelul tehnic al echipei) si am luat initiativa de a face un program structurat de internship pentru ca nimeni nu o facea, iar internii se chinuiau sa invete pentru ca nu exista o structura si se invata pseudo random. Nu simt ca progresez profesional si sunt obligat sa fac prezentari tehnice + powerpoint-uri (mi se pune in program fortat si nu mi se raspunde la mesaje cand cer explicatii). Mi s-a zis in fata ca firmei nu ii pasa de progresul meu profesional si am ajuns la concluzia ca nu mai merita sa ma chinui. Firma nu ma merita.

Am cautat job-uri de penetration tester/ethical hacker in alta parte, dar gasesc doar pe la Bucuresti, Cluj, Timisoara si nimic pe aici pe aproape in Iasi, si chiar si alea putine. Ce sume salariale sunt pe aceasta nisa asta in Romania? Se merita raport salariu - munca - oportunitati? Intreb asta pentru ca eu sunt la inceput, doresc sa imi fac o idee. Daca stiu ca s-ar merita, as trage tare sa iau OSCP-ul.

Eu sunt mai priceput la programare decat la ceea ce fac acum. Am scris cod de 3 ani de zile aproape zilnic in timpul facultatii in diferite limbaje de programare si am vreo 9 aplicatii personale facute pana acum in mare folosind C++/Java/Kotlin/C#/Python/Angular, dar nu m-am specializat pe un anumit limbaj momentan.

In cazul cel mai probabil in care voi reveni pe programare, pe ce limbaje sau nise ati recomanda pentru cineva caruia ii place sa inteleaga lucrurile in detaliu? Mi-a placut mereu sa desfac firul in patru si sa inteleg concepte si cum sunt implementate lucrurile si sa incerc sa le fac si eu de la 0 in loc sa folosesc eu o biblioteca (just for learning purposes). Cel putin din experienta job-ului curent pot spune ca prefer mai mult sa programez decat sa testez.

Penetration testing-ul l-am ales deoarece sunt multe concepte pe care trebuie sa le intelegi bine si in detaliu, insa experienta in firma aceasta este dezamagitoare."

I'm extremely anxious about my situation and am just unsure how to proceed.  I am a paralegal in a law firm where I was hired after completing my internship. I originally worked for an associate attorney and after he gave his notice, I became the senior partner's paralegal.

The senior partner, who is in his 80s, took quite a liking to me and became a mentor to me (I'm in my low 30s) encouraging me to continue my education and has been very supportive.  At some point though, some lines got blurred. 

He would ask me for hugs when feeling down about personal things and, as weird as it felt, I complied.  Then he started giving me all sorts of presents such as money, jewelry, electronics.  I told him its making me and my husband uncomfortable but he would still mail things to my house.

Then, he took me out to lunch one day and kissed me (on the lips!).  I was quiet the whole way back and he just kept talking about how ""unique"" I am and how he cant stop thinking about me.

When we came back to the office, I wrote him an email about how absolutely uncomfortable I am, that I am leaving without giving two weeks, not to contact me and I got in my car and drove off. 

Of course, that didn't work.  He kept calling me, emailing me, and even left me voicemails with him crying and asking ""why are you doing this to me"".  The other partner was aware of what had happened and even spoke to him too telling him to just leave me alone. 

I started another job but I was in such a bad place mentally and feeling like I may have overreacted that I just couldn't concentrate on my new job.  I was there for two days and, like an idiot, called my old boss back after a crying message because I felt bad and, of course, he convinced me to come back.

He told me that I misinterpreted him, that he does love me, but in the type of way one might love a child or a grandchild.  I told him that I can come back but he needs to keep his hands to himself and came back the following Monday. 

As soon as I came back, he told me that I cant tell his wife what happened because she thinks that I just got overwhelmed and quit (which makes me wonder if his statement of loving me like his grandchild was true).  

And now, he is back to touching me.  He started touching the small of my back when he walks with me, then he started hugging me again and saying how I'm his ""rock"", and now started kissing me on the cheek again.  I don't know what is wrong with me and instead of saying something like STOP, I just freeze and let him hug me and kiss my cheek.  I don't hug him back and I look miserable enough afterwards that I have the whole office asking me if I am ok. 

I'm scared that if I quit again that he will go crazy and start calling me and emailing me from different numbers and emails like before and that it will impact me mentally again to the point of struggling at a new job. We are in a small legal community where everyone knows everyone and I'm scared to apply for legal jobs because he will find out.  I feel like I literally need therapy over all of this. 

I'm sorry for the rant.. and I guess I just want to know two things.  Is this sexual harassment?  And, if so, is it worth to pursue this further and does the fact that I haven't done much about this (except for quitting one time) hurt me if I did choose to pursue a case?"

I'm a 23yo and I'm currently living in Italy. I'm here because I'd like to hear opinions about my actual career path and if there's anything I can do to improve my situation. I will briefly explain what I've done so you can have a better comprehension of the context.

Since I was a teenager I have always loved computers and I chose to attend an IT high school (in Italy we have these 5-year IT high school programs called ITIS) because I wanted to develop a deep comprehension of IT-related subjects, such as networking, coding, etc. I also had three two-month internships during the last three years of high school, including one in London thanks to the Erasmus+ program.

After this period I decided to completely change my study field and I applied for a BSc in Business Administration in Italy. My last year of high school was super stressful and I felt like I didn't want to keep studying something that was leading me to burnout hell.

Overall I liked what I studied during my bachelor's. The point is after I started working as a Business Analyst right after uni I quickly realised that wasn't for me. With too much Excel and too little solving real complex problems, I was not satisfied or happy. 

Luckily, while attending my bachelor I have done some side IT projects and I was able to make a 180 turn and go back to doing what I liked, coding. At the moment I'm working as a Full Stack Developer and I'm living a fulfilling life. 

Since I'm a hard-working person and I often take important choices with a long-term perspective, is a (Conversion) Master's in Computer Science any good for my profile? I'd like to advance to higher positions in future (higher salaries) and I feel like a Master's degree in CS could be helpful. I've seen a couple of them in the UK but they're pricey (about 25-30k£) and I couldn't find anything similar in the EU.

I'm also considering Data science masters but those would be second choices since I'd like to stay in the IT field.

I'm open to hear any other alternatives I may have not considered yet. 

Many thanks to whoever will help me :)"

I'm chosing courses for the upcoming semester and am down to one slot with two choices. I can either be a Lab Assistant for a Fundamentals of Python class that I took (help students with debugging/basically office hours for labs), or take my first ML class. These are the pros/cons I've thought of, what is the better choice when it comes to employability/experience? I haven't landed a summer internship yet so I'm feeling a little anxious, Thanks!

Lab Assistant

Pros:

* More experience with debugging others' code
* Keep programming skills sharp

Cons:

* Slightly more time commitment but less stressful
* Technically not learning much since I already have experience with Python

ML Class

Pros:

* Expand what I know, it seems like a lot of the companies hiring now (startups, smaller places) want knowledge of something other than a single coding language 

Cons:

* I could take this class another semester
* Also could (realistically) find a research position with a professor and learn some ML/work on some projects related to ML in my own time and have that experience without having to take a class.

I currently have an admit to Vrije's joint degree program, planning to apply to Saarland Uni.

What  I have understood is that Vrije is very good for systems and it has  professors  like Henri Bal, one major disadvantage is cost of living and  tuition fee(assuming I don't qualify for tuition waiver).

For  Saarland, I have generally heard a positive review regarding the Msc  course and has Max Plank Institute for informatics. It also has a better  ranking in [csranking](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2022/index?all&amp;europe) .

my\_qualifications: Btech (Hons) in CSE CGPA 8.9 (tier 3 college), mutliple Internships and 2 years work experience as SDE.

My question is, would an MS in IT management be feasible given my lack of formal education, or would the MBA in IT management be a better choice? The MS would be about $3k cheaper at the place I am currently leading towards (Western Gov. University).

I would also be still working my job (full time, 40hours/week) while in school.

What do you think? MS or MBA? Are both feasible given my circumstances? One more than the other? I am a little concerned I would not have the experience, education, or time to complete the degree, but I think I could do it, just wanted to see what other might have to say.

\#1: **Junior Year English teacher (8/10).** She knows a lot about my circumstances (see below). I often struggled in her class but ended the year with an A+. She has seen me at my literal worst but has always helped me through it even was wildly inconvenient for her.  A lot of my writing in her class centered around history and international relations so she can vouch for my knowledge and global worldview. I also participated a lot in her Socratic seminars so she has seen me in a lot of debate-like environments. She is **VERY** selective with who she agrees to write a letter so I am sure it is a positive letter. However, were not very close so 8/10. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#2: **Junior Year History teacher (7/10).** Also knows a lot about my circumstances. I excelled in her class and she told me my writing was one of the best she has seen. I was super active in her class and often tutored my classmates. However, like my English teacher, we were not so close. 

**Interviews**

Penn: My first interview! It was really formal and didn't feel so casual tbh. However, I got the feeling that he enjoyed the conversation and it gave me some good experience. **6/10**

Duke: She said I reminded her of her son! She was super sweet and we were cracking up the whole call. She even told me I'd be a prime candidate for Duke's FOCUS program even though it was highly selective. She was a mother so she was super impressed with the fact that I was living alone and managing myself since 15. **10/10**

Harvard: A little more formal than my Duke interview but still was a casual conversation. The man was very sweet and had a lot of experience working with Copts and we talked a lot about Egypt and different human rights organizations in Egypt. He seemed very impressed with how authentic I was. I was upfront about everything including which activities actually mattered and which didn't. I was honest about my struggles with my academics but still highlighted my enduring curiosity and resilience. He was much more impressed with my academics and ECs that I never got to mention that I live alone 💀.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: Talked about my moving to the US, enduring an immigration rejection, and getting diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in the same week. Highlighted how this motivated me to study Middle Eastern History and inspired me to be an Immigration Attorney. 

Questbridge Topical Essay: Talked about my love of laughter and how it's a common trait that all Egyptians have. Connected it to our sense of community and how laughter can be used to overcome challenges and create mutual connection.

A little bit of background on me/my family:

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a middle-class household and am currently in my third year at my university studying business administration. During college admissions, I wasn't really sure on what I wanted to do with my life and, amid all of the confusion, ended up choosing a very prestigious private school under the pressure of my parents. However, I'm starting to regret my decision. If I'm going to be completely honest, in the moment of the decision I felt pressured by my parents because in their eyes the value of the education was just too good to pass up, especially since this school often places kids in very good jobs upon graduation, serving as a ""feeder school"" to very prestigious IB and other finance firms. So I agreed and attended the school under their guidance. What we didn't talk about with this decision is the financial pressure that came with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am one of four kids and although my parents are able to pay the expected amount of tuition (with generous help from financial aid), the education is still costing my family a pretty penny, especially considering that they want to help send my other siblings to school. This is something I feel guilty about every time it comes up, and it always seems to be the topic of conversation when discussing what I want to do once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

In regard to career stuff, I have been fortunate enough to discover two amazing passions during my time at school: Film and language learning/experiencing other cultures. I found these passions after a major injury I had during my freshman year that left me unable to walk for months. I have taken my pursuit of them into my own hands, chasing them relentlessly, developing my filmmaking/language learning craft, and even receiving praise from professors and employers for my good work on past projects. It's something I'm extremely passionate about and, in my opinion, genuinely good at.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently run the social media for an official school account, creating and managing content as the photographer/videographer, and also have developed a professional fluency in Spanish while beginning to study Brazilian Portuguese. I have also worked on several documentary projects through the school. I would absolutely love to find work working on film sets of some kind (or start my own production company) after I graduate, as it's something that gets me up every morning! I absolutely love it, and if I could find a way to combine this film work with working abroad that would be a dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, now that the time to apply for internships is approaching I'm starting to feel enormous pressure to pursue a prestigious career in Investment Banking/Consulting. This is something that genuinely does not interest me at all, but every time I have this conversation with my parents it always revolves back to how they have dished out a pretty penny for me to attend this school, and if I don't want to get an instantly high-paying job after I graduate why did I even attend?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that my parents genuinely just want the best for me, and I'm trying to see it from their angle: they've spent a lot of money to help me get a good education and want me to be financially secure in my life. I'm extremely grateful that they care enough to even have this conversation. However, the path that they're outlining genuinely does not interest me at all and I've resolved I want to do something different with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The pressure I feel whenever this crosses my mind just feels enormous and I'm starting to resent both my parents and, above anyone else, myself for not making the correct decision several years ago. If I had known that choosing this school would result in me having to choose a career I hated, I never would have done it. I feel like I'm in too deep to change anything, as I only have two semesters left at this university and a lot of the money has already been spent.

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you guys dealt with this? If so, how? I feel very lost and under a lot of pressure right now. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!"

I like it so far, the people are nice, its a super small business and even though I'm basically doing grunt work right now, the possibility to work on actually interesting projects in the coming weeks is probable.

However, while the work is good and definitely gives good experience, it's in an adjacent field to me and is not really what I want to do long term. The internship also seemed like a long term thing when speaking to hiring people and my now supervisors. The offer letter I got says that I ""will work until graduation."" I'm a junior right now, and am not particularly thrilled about working here over the summer, but ultimately I'm fine with it and may find the job really enjoyable and want to stay for the summer as well.

But this weekend I got an email from another person that works in a larger company in Boston. They also do work that isn't exactly what I want career-wise, but is in the field that I am currently studying. It's a company I applied for an internship for this spring for, but didn't end up getting. He said that he was looking for people to fill positions for the spring and summer, and was looking to do a phone interview in the coming weeks with me. I said I'd love to hear about summer openings. I reasoned I already have this job and don't want to quit one day in.

But what should I do if I find I want this new position? Can I just quit my internship and go join them in Boston? Should I ask my supervisor, and if so what should I say? I don't want to sound like I'm unappreciative of having this job, because I do appreciate them taking a chance on me, and tbh my job search was abysmal this past couple months. I want 0 for &gt;100 on applications online, including this potential company rejecting me a couple weeks ago.

This is all hypothetical, because I haven't had the interview yet, I haven't gotten the job yet, and I haven't even really started my new internship yet. I just want to know if I have the option to move on in the summer to this new position should I end up getting it.

# Looking for honest advice on uni situation

Hey guys, I am in a bit of a predicament and was hoping to recieve some advice. Btw, I know this isnt the forum for usyd or macq but I wanted to put it here to get an unbiased answer. 

I have always wanted to and dreamed of going to USYD but now that I am here I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work I will have to do just to keep my head above water for my commerce degree. I have just transferred from Macquarie Uni where I was doing commerce and law and was (pretty comfortably) able to have an average of an 80 WAM.

However at USYD, after talking to people and seeing reddit posts about how difficult some subjects and majors at USYD are, I am beginning to rethink my potential in doing well here (even before uni has started). I will most likely need a WAM of at least 75 to get some decent internships or even a chance at the IPP and I honestly don't know if I will be able to achieve that looking at the workload and difficulty.

I am hoping to get some advice on whether me putting some extra effort will be worth it as I will be graduating from an amazing uni (at the cost of a not so good WAM) or whether it would be better for me to graduate from Macquarie Uni (with a pretty decent WAM) but not that good of a reputation.

At USYD I want to do Business Analytics and Banking so I can try to get into investment banking (but I will need some good internships for this to be made possible such as UBS or Macquarie Group).

I was really hoping to know that in the event I do go back to Macquarie Uni will I still be able to land such big internships provided I get the high WAM or would those companies only want students from unis like USYD / UNSW??

I will really appreciate honest advice.

Thank you so much guys and please feel free to comment / discuss this you don't only need to vote :)

Last summer, I completed a purchasing internship at a large global company - mainly because I was too late applying for Finance internships and I just wanted to get some corporate experience and get my foot in the door with a good company. I enjoyed purchasing, but I also wasn’t in love with it, so my plan has still been to go into corporate finance.

However, I was just offered a full-time position to join the indirect purchasing team as an entry level buyer at this company upon graduation. 

Now I am stuck between taking the purchasing job and being guaranteed a good job upon college with great benefits (despite maybe not loving the job), or continuing to apply for corporate finance positions and risk not having a job for a period of time after college. 

I want to accept the purchasing job, but I am worried that after a couple years I may wish I went into finance, and if I switch careers I will basically have to restart my career with an entry level role at that point. The other thing is I have never done an internship in finance so I’m not 100% sure I would even really like it, but it is what I have thought I want to do.

I also live in a mid-sized city (population 200,000), and haven’t seen an abundance of finance opportunities. Additionally, I have to compete against graduates of better business schools in the area.

Do I take the purchasing job or keep trying to get into corporate finance?"

I'm going to add some background before asking my question

I'm going to be graduating in Dec with a bachelor of commerce - finance major. I have min 2 years experience in the military intelligence, cadets, and my schools investment club. I have a year or so sales, experience as well and I helped get my cousins business running in the past couple years. Leading a team is no issue for me and I've put in the work even while in school. I have at least 3 years of leadership experience in a job site (construction/maintenance). Currently I'm 23 M

Recently I completed three internships with riipen, one sales and one operations. Two of which was with the charter company. Things seemed pretty good, and I was asked about what wage I would accept in the summer for a potential internship. I mentioned the 22-24$ ball park was the market average. They told me they've offered 17.5 in the past. I jokingly said I could make more at costco and said I would be comfortable in the 22-24$ area. My boss said ""you really know how to sell yourself"". And seemed fine with that number.

Fast forward to today, I got news that the owner wants me to be an executive assistant and run sales + operations. I was really exited. We then discussed pay and it was said that 19$ for 30 hours would be the wage. There would be an option for commission but no details were given. She told me the base wage was low but the option for commission would make up for it (I'm paraphrasing her words).

I was told that I'm valued but any wage increase in the future would have more work expected.

I'm thinking on this more and that wage would be less than 30k a year. The company wants me to work for them for 6 months (this may to dec) but said money right now was tight since covid business slowed their earnings. In the next breath my potential boss said the booking for the services was up 900%. It sounfs like beyond 2023 i would be an executive and i might have a team but no solid plans were discussed or any wage implications.

I have a suspicious vibe from this experience, I was told that i am valued and trusted but then the pay dosent seem to reflect that. I checked Glassdoor and the website (canada) for similar wages. I saw a lot that were from 18$ up to 24$ an hour for 40 hours a week with entry level experience.  The lower end being the lowest job I could find and it was not in my province. Most being around 22$ with more hours.  My potential boss also has told me they've had issues in the past hiring good people.

 The company is also applying for hiring grants to help cover my wage, my gf last summer was on the same grant for a diff company and was paid 19.3 + weekend premium @ 38 hours.

My question: am I being lowballed and is this a good idea? I've read lots online that people get baited into this type of situation and then when it comes for the wage increase it dosent always happen. Im worried it could turn into a sales job. Sales isint bad by intself but i expressed interest in being oprrations. I've know my boss for about 6 months through my riipen internships. 

On the other hand, getting in early with a company now could be beneficial in the future. The cashflows seem good, and the business model is decent overall. I'm just worried my hardworking attitude will be taken advantage of especially because they want me to commit to 6 months for a below market wage with no direct compensation later on for taking a pay cut. I would also be her exec assistant so to me that should be payed above market.

I've thought about negotiating working for 4 months and then reavaluating, not working there at all or waiting to work for them when things stabilize.

As another thought, I could also pursue an investment career, to get my cfa or to work in futures. I have some coonnections in finance and had some expereince in futures trading through a competition at my school.

Any feedback is appreciated. These times are insanely stressful and I want to make sure ive thought of all angles.

I am considering dropping a class because it is adding a lot to my overall coursework, and it isn't necessarily required for me to take, and I'll still be on track to graduating.

After not doing much in high school beside schoolwork, I made it my goal to make the most out of my college experience by doing things outside of coursework. This semester I really want to do things like volunteering in the community, taking on more responsibility at my internship, and dedicating more time to growing our RSO. I don't know if I'll be able to do all of this while taking 18 creds. My classes right now are all very essay and exam heavy and at several points in the semester I'll be writing three essays at a time. If I really push my limits, I could get it done. But I also value my well-being and my mental health and do not want to risk that. The more I write this post the more I realize what needs to be done... I guess I just need someone to tell me I'm not copping out lol

Dear all, I’m a junior at a university abroad whose main language of instruction I am not fluent in. My GPA has dropped from around 4.2 to 3.9 to 3.2 (out of 4.3) in the past semesters. With all the classes I’m going to fail at this semester, it’s probably going to fall below 3. Because I failed too many classes, I would have to postpone graduation by a year. This is a result of both my personal shortcomings and other reasons, the major one being the language barrier imo. (For more details, please refer to the other post on this account. However, I understand that it is very long so I would try my best to answer concisely here if anything is unclear.) 

I am looking for suggestions on how best to spend this extra year in university to salvage the situation. From all the classes I’ve failed, you can tell I have a terrible understanding of most of the basics of computer science (dsa, os, database, etc.). The only thing I’m relatively confident in is coding and the theory of programming languages, as the English materials are very accessible. I can use a few languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, R, and some other languages for more theoretical applications), but I’ve never built anything comprehensive outside of projects at school. I had one summer internship that paid around 7.7 USD per day.

1. I’m thinking of building some projects that would look good on my resume.
2. I’m also considering taking an online masters course while picking up the basics of computer science by taking some English online courses and completing them seriously.

My goal is to land a job at an international company when I graduate. Realistically, I might not be able to do all of that while retaking the classes I failed at school and working a part time job to pay for my tuition. Where should my priorities lie? What can I do to best salvage this situation? Any suggestions/advice is welcome."

I am currently triple majoring: CS, Maths, and Data Science. I never really seem to have fit in with the huge party culture and found myself to really struggle socially, and feel like I would really benefit going to a school with a different environment.

I took the IB diploma in HS and got 41/45, my HS didn't do GPA. I also have decent ECs such as being ranked top 20 in Asia in HS for Squash, internship experiences at big tech companies, and I currently help the school I attend run and maintain their websites. 

Last year I applied to transfer to UMich, Brown, WUSTL, JHU, Northwestern, Cornell, Gatech, Vandy, and USC with a college GPA of 4.0 and got rejected by all 9 schools.

This year my GPA decreased to 3.97, and after experiencing mass rejection by top 25 schools both my college application cycle in HS and last transfer cycle I do not know if it is still worth a try as a huge amount of time is needed to prep for the apps and I am at this point expecting myself to just not get into any top25 schools.

I’ll still be applying for jobs related to embedded systems in case I get lucky enough to be accepted somewhere. Does this seem like a worthwhile/realistic plan?"

10ew0v8,0,2023-01-17,Internship Secured: Projects or LeetCode?,DoctorRorschach,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10ew0v8/internship_secured_projects_or_leetcode/,"Looking for genuine advice here, not looking to brag. I’m a sophomore who interned at Microsoft last summer and will be returning there this upcoming summer. I want to become better at coding, I feel much less adept than the other interns I worked with last summer and less adept than my classmates at university. 

I see two approaches to do this. I could either improve my skills through personal projects, particularly on breaks and weekends or I could just grind LeetCode. 

A SWE I met on the Microsoft campus last summer told me I should be LeetCoding every day. However, my CS friends tell me I don’t need to because of my current situation. This winter break so far, I’ve been working on making a website for my friend so I haven’t been doing LeetCode. 

Ideally, I’d want to return to Microsoft every summer and convert to full time, but I’d also want to be competitive to be able to get into other places. An older intern I met this summer told me he wished he did LeetCode because he doesn’t currently have the technical interviewing skills to apply to other companies since he had just returned to Microsoft every summer instead of grinding interviews. 

Thoughts?"

10ez8zz,2,2023-01-18,Success and achievement of the highest good,tackfulChaos,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/10ez8zz/success_and_achievement_of_the_highest_good/,"It's been three years since I last hung up my uniform. To say the least: life after the military has been and continues to be challenging both personally and in the work place. However, after careful thought I realized that I stepped to a new height. Another, more elevated, base-camp in my career and in my life. After making my employers a lot of money, substantial enough to buy a luxurious water front mansion and maybe with its own yacht, I realized it was time to take some time out of my day to state my accomplishment, feel the the weight of my labor, visualize that scenery of ridges and valleys and give myself the pleasure of awe that is my work. So now standing on top of my summit I can see what it took to get here.

My journey began in a four year college, which I attended for three years then failed out of. Since I needed money for school, a job, and wanted to escape my personal problems at the time I decided to join the Air Force. As an Airman I used the needs of the Air Force of wanting troops to pursue education to my advantage. So I enrolled in on-line classes, I CLEPed courses, and got my CCAF (Community College of the Air force). Three years in, half my enlistment, I got my bachelors in Information Technology with an Advanced Developers Certificate. During the whole time I felt like I was constantly thinking of ways to get into the tech industry. So I made BASH scripts, Microsoft Access Databases, became the excel wizard, and went to as many Meet-ups as I could that had to do with software development. As my DOS (date of separation) came within line of sight I started to get doubts and was thinking of giving in to the status-quo and sticking to doing the same job I did while I was in (i.e the safe route). Though I would have been fine in terms of competitive pay and benefits I knew I would have wondered what it would have been like to fulfill what I aspired to become.

Hope was restored when I went to TAP (Transition Assistance Program) where the instructor without bating an eye said that I could do it, had the necessary skills, and that all I need to do was to market myself properly. He recommended for me to apply for both types of jobs, both as a contractor and as a developer. This just meant more work because I needed two resumes. So I made two resumes and applied to jobs like it was my job. I did interviews while on deployments and filled out applications while still at work, this was serious and my spirits were back. I thought to myself things like ""if I don't get something lined up within a month I'm in trouble!"" in order to keep the fire under my butt burning red hot.

Two months went by and nothing. Then one day while I was leaving work late my flight commander happened to stop me and asked me to apply for an internship. He explained to me that it could help me get experience in the industry while trying to help the squadron understand how it can solve a logistical problem and the company that I would be assigned to would help in the understanding. So it essentially sounded to me as a three way win-win-win. So I was in and the very next day I filled out the application and submitted it.

I knew nothing what I know now and in the grand scheme of things I owe that man, my flight commander at the time, a great deal of thanks. According to the rules of this channel I can't say names but maybe its better if I leave it to a more general theme and say that if you were a Captain during 2019 who showed your Staff Sergeant at the time the door to the career and ultimately the life of his dreams I just want to say that there aren't to many weeks that pass by that I don't think of the great act of kindness you did for your Airman, an act that I have tried to figure out a multitude of ways to repay but can't and fear that whatever gesture I try to invent that it wouldn't be enough. However, please accept my thanks here and know that if I were your in your position and you in mine I would have done the same for you. I'm sure fate will have a way of crossing out paths soon so please be generous when I ask you what your favorite bottle of scotch is, after all there has been a lot of developed interest from your miracle.

During that internship I learned my employers technology well enough to build a partial solution I mentioned earlier, which was later used to procure a contract, which I was then was hired for after I was released from the military. That contact led to other contracts, which meant I had to learn and practice my skills more and get to work on all kinds of projects that included software development, tech support, architecture, you name it. Life went by fast career wise, along with all the other events in my life.

Then Covid happened. At the end of 2021 I hit a wall after hitting many other walls. I was a supersonic bullet that had been stopped by the 99th cinder block. I knew I could not continue working, so I decided to quit. My boss offered more salary and even time off to re charge my batteries but I denied those offers because I knew I really needed to remove the plug, otherwise I would not be at peace.

During this sabbatical I had one thing on my mind and that was sailing the Caribbean, which I did do by finding a position as crew for a private sailing yacht. A valuable lesson I learned during this time is that work is work. When it comes to getting paid for it you may value the work differently than your employer. When you want to do something there is a force in this universe that simply attracts you to it and if you don't want to do something the universe has a way of repelling you from that. When I learned that lesson I knew that life as a sailor navigating the seven seas was not the life for me. I love sailing but when in long voyages, or even when in those outside the protected waters of the nearby bay I get sea sick. I also got tired of fixing the boat. So I went back to work for the same company where I was offered a 30% raise and a new important project that would last the whole year.

Last year went by slow and the work alone burnt me out several times. That was just at work which is 1,920 hours out of the 8,760 total hours in the year (based on a 40 hours a week schedule). If you haven't picked up on the common theme that might be the reason for my fallout yet: what I do, my work, is my focus in my life. I'm a career driven person and everything tends to fold into my work. Now I don't want this to be so. I want to work in-order to live, not live in-order to work, but it is what it is, at least until a new core value begins. The good news is that I feel like I'm doing way better than before by being more present in the moment and being aware of what I like, don't like, where I want to spend my time, and where I don't want to spend my time. I'm getting better at journaling and writing my thoughts down to formulate my life story, starting from general concepts then drilling down to more detailed ones. There is still a lot to figure out on that front, a lot of reasons to worry but even more reasons to be excited about life again and go out and do things. Or heck stay in and right a blog post explaining how someone is able to end a seven year career as a Staff Sergeant and three years later serve as the primary technical leader for a multi-national, multi-billion dollar company as part of their new initiative to democratize their data landscape. How using nothing but pure grit manages to more than triple the largest account on his employers P&amp;L (Profit and Loss) statement. Today it hit me. I did it.

If that is not software development, if that is not leadership, if that is not perseverance crawling through the trenches of chasing down support tickets, or of searching through endless log files for any signs or trace of a bug, or of uncomfortable conversations of having to explain why it doesn't work then having to figure out a root cause, or of all the pesky little things that have to be done in-order to finally install the software in production, and for the sacrifices made in my personal life by that of an absent mind to those I love or choose to spend time with but with only the fraction of attention not consumed by the task assigned to me that at times destabilized or even annihilated my relationships, or of all the mental break downs I had to endure because I felt that everything: my career, my relationships, and my life as a whole were in absolute free fall, if those things don't make up and justify the stake in the ground next to me while standing on this apex of achievement holding up my flag on this world then at-least now I know. Now with the same certainty as that every breath of air I breath, in, and out of my lungs will keep me living through this and to the next adjacent moment, that the next time I get the chance to prove myself again that I would need two flag poles instead of one. For my country, for me, and though the later is flown at a lower height with the same truth, just described, I know that it represents the belief in the former and that belief is all I need, to rise to freedom."
10ezkl1,3,2023-01-18,Should I drop out of Grad School?,KingJodeg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10ezkl1/should_i_drop_out_of_grad_school/,"Hello everyone, I am contemplating a life decision.

**TLDR: Already with a B.S. in CS, do I drop my M.S. program now before the financial deadline and go for a job or wait until the semester is over to start working? My main goal is an awesome job**

Background:

* I graduated May 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science
* No Internship (Yes I know, not smart)
* No Job after grad (Yes I know, not smart)

I decided to return to my same university last fall to begin a M.S. in CS program (Spring 2024 grad). I did okay, but overall felt like I did not enjoy the classes, and now feel confidently that this program is not a worthy long term investment (correct me if I'm wrong on this). I very much want to move on from this college and explore new endeavors; **not finishing my program**. I spent the past winter break *and am currently* continuously applying and interview prepping.

My main decision is either:

1. Continue taking grad classes for Spring 2024, do a summer internship, and from there pause my masters program to work for the same company or a new one (Again, at most I want this to be my last semester at this university). The classes I’m registered for are difficult and again I will have to put insane focus towards them
2. Start my leave of absence *now*, and let my surplus of focus away from classes allow me to zero in on a job in the next month(s). I would hypothetically do nothing but intensely job hunt and network in every way that I can with my heart and soul.

**Would it be smarter to go for a job now &amp; drop classes before the financial deadline to do so (2 weeks)? Or should I go for a job and/or internship for May 2023 onward? I very much desire real world experience.**"

10f00iz,7,2023-01-18,"Got a job offer, they ghosted me for over a week and a half, and are now reaching back out but I feel that it was a red flag on their end. Need advice!",sunnybear18,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/10f00iz/got_a_job_offer_they_ghosted_me_for_over_a_week/,"tl;dr: I received a job offer for a decent position and put in my two weeks at my current spot . They then ghosted me for two weeks. I emailed twice within seven days, called the manager's cell two days later and left a voicemail, and got radio silence. I gave up and went back to my current job and asked if I could stay. Just last night I received an email with a slew of excuses and a confirmed start date. For reference, this is a small but notable restaurant group with multiple managers and I feel they should have at least acknowledged my acceptance earlier rather than ghosting, which left a bad taste in my mouth.

I need some advice on what to do!

First I was going to make this a rant because I still hadn't heard from them but they ended up reaching out to me later last evening with a slew of excuses, but now I need to hear some genuine advice because even though I think I know what the right choice will be, I seem to have have a history of making the wrong choices in my jobs and work life and I want to know whether or not I'm overreacting about this situation or if it is as big of a red flag as I think.

From the beginning: I currently work as a server/hostess in a large scale restaurant in a major city. I am a recent graduate and looking for work has been absolutely fruitless for me following the pandemic, as I had transferred schools right before COVID hit and ended up mostly remote with no network, no internships, no experience, and a B.S. in Psychology which is pretty useless by itself. I've spent my time working in restaurants for the past several years. It's flexible, pays the bills, and has worked with my schedule thus far but I'm getting restless in the industry and have realized that I'm not really cut out for sales.

I've been applying to jobs for months and hitting dead end after dead end, as my resume is essentially just super bland. It's been pretty demoralizing but I've felt lucky to have my jobs in the restaurant industry. Back in the beginning of December I found this full time administration position at a small but notable restaurant group. I would get paid a decent consistent hourly and I would have a consistent schedule, with Xmas and NYE off (uncommon for a restaurant). It would be stable and I would be able to work a routine into my life. I applied for the job and heard back a week later regarding an interview from the service manager.

I had a phone interview 5 days later and she said she had a few more interviews to conduct and would reach back out to me the next day regarding a second interview. I sent a thank you email that afternoon, didn't hear back. I ended up reaching out to follow up after I hadn't heard back for 7 days (this was starting to become a pattern). She emailed me the next day and asked if I could come in that evening for a second interview and a trail. I complied and it went well. She reached out to me on January 3rd and said that they were in the final stages and would make a decision the next day. After five days of silence I emailed again asking if a decision had been made. The next day I get a missed call from the GM as I was at work. I call back and it goes to voicemail and she calls me back 30 seconds later, offering me the job. It felt like a red flag to me that she offered it over the phone but everything prior had been done via email.

She said she'd be working through the weekend so to send her an email with my start date to begin the official process. I accepted the job and emailed her and the CC the service manager1.5 days later with my start date and a couple confirmation questions, and put in my two weeks at my current job that same evening. I hear nothing back. After five days of nothing I send a short and concise follow up email. I hear nothing back. The next day I call the manager's cell and leave a message inquiring about my start date and referencing my earlier emails. I hear nothing back. At this point I'm less than a week to go at my current job and starting to sweat about whether or not I'll have a job next week, so I decide to go to my current job and ask them to rescind my two weeks as this job was giving me massive red flags. They asked me to come in to meet with the GM in the next couple of days.

Last night I get an email with a bunch of excuses for the delayed response, citing training a new manager and dealing with a buyout (the restaurant holds about 40 people). She then continued to give me instructions for my first day.

At this point I've already approached my current job asking to stay and have yet to have a sit down meeting with the GM. I like my current job, I like the people and I feel supported and wouldn't mind staying, but I just wanted to dip my toes into something a little bit more reliable than serving. I feel that while the new job would give me slightly more stability and consistency (but less flexibility), they disrespected my time and were really inconsiderate, and have been bad on the follow up since the beginning. I feel that they easily could've taken the time to acknowledge and confirm my acceptance/start date and tell me that they were busy but would get back to me and my questions more in depth at a later point.

My gut feeling is telling me to stay at my current job. Am I overreacting with how they went about this whole process?

I actually just declared both majors on track for cs but a bit behind in the EE stuff. My question is would it be better and more beneficial to do a double in math instead of EE. Please note I came into college with basically the first 2.5 years of a math major under my belt, so although ahead still I haven’t touched math in a while. It would also let me graduate on time vs 1 sem behind.

This dilemma has been eating me alive and I want to know from people who have more experience in the major and more success with internships etc than I have about what you think is the best. Everyone I talked to said why not just do ce and my response to that is bc at my school ce is super hardware heavy and lacked the software components I wanted. I would do a minor in EE bc I want some hardware background but my school doesn’t offer it so I am planning on asking if I can create a minor which would solve all my problems but given that as of now it’s not allowed I would like some advice if my create a EE minor appeal gets rejected. Ngl so far the EE and cs double seems a bit daunting since at my school the cs and engineering departments r separated requiring me to take around. 30 crd (12-15 classes total) more than required to graduate.

EDIT:
Side notes: my cs specialization is in ML and AI. I plan on skill going to swe path initially and then hopefully grad school both for a MS in CS and MBA. I’m aiming really high for grad school so keeping a high gpa is crucial for me. I’m recovering it from 1 class I messed up in freshman year cuz of tech problems but still plan to graduate with a 3.8+."

I have a set of questions that i cant seem to find a detailed answer on so im hoping i might get some information here. In short im taking a 08R2-DC migrating to a Esxi 6.7 hosted WS2016 VM where i would like a ""fresh start"" on rearranging the older AD. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have an active AD/Forest that im preparing for a migration over to Microsoft Server 2016, im in the process of cleaning up old objects and folders but im running into issues deleting items that haven't been active or used in quite some time. Im getting a ""you do not have the sufficient privileges to delete ""intern 15-16"" or this is protected from accidental deletion - yet im currently using the domain/sysadmin account.

This AD has seen several owners prior to my hire 5+ years ago and im trying to strip the AD down to everything minimal in the sense of active users, computers and basic object folder - not extra clutter.  I feel getting the AD somewhat back to a fresh start would be easier in the long run, all the permissions and groups need to be revisited as there are groups for folders that a ""S"" would appear in what used to be a user - it annoys me.

If i can confirm these arent marked for ""accidental deletion"" is there a way to remove them or even set back to default an AD object tree?  I dont know if i can afford to create a new AD on the WS2016 or if its possible to migrate only specific workstations or users from the older DC. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do plan on rebuilding all the file folders on the File Server with correct permissions moving forward but im trying to leave as much of the old infrastructure behind as i can without having to migrate over a potential issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; is there a effective way to cleanup old AD DS permissions and broken paths in AD to prepare for a Migration to WS2016 smoothly?"

10fcz4a,7,2023-01-18,A question regarding timeline and approach from a prospective student.,Sleepybaan,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/10fcz4a/a_question_regarding_timeline_and_approach_from_a/,"Hi everyone, I’ve been lurking here for the past two months, and I’m seriously considering biting the bullet within the next year or so. With that in mind, I wanted to ask members of the community two main questions which I can’t seem to find the answers for. 

Starting with a little background, I recently completed my first undergrad in biology and biochemistry with the primary goal of pursuing medical school. Long story short, the timeline and minimal returns for the next decade that would come with perusing medical school, as well as dealing with insurance, have given me some unease about perusing the field. Despite a rocky start I preformed pretty well in undergrad, finishing with a 3.72 cumulative and a 4.15 upper division GPA. I also solo self studied for the MCAT and got a 519 (97th percentile). I only mention this to highlight that I have some confidence in my ability to self-study and keep on track with OMSCS. While the curriculum would be entirely new as I have literally 0 experience, I do think having previous periods of dedicated self study will really help. I just started a 4 day a week job in healthcare that will give me ample time to learn what I understand are the fundamentals over the next year. 

It seems to be running theme that people drastically underestimate the difficult of both learning computer science and this program specifically given it’s fairly low barrier to entry. I also want to say that this isn’t just a career thing and I genuinely believe I would enjoy learning the subject. I didn’t pivot earlier, despite interest, due to a bit of sunken cost fall it regarding my first degree by the time the idea came around. It seems common that people have a rather fetishized misunderstanding of the CS lifestyle; however, I have some family in the field, and I am not expecting some sort of tik tok day in the life reward from the completion of this program. 

This leads to my first question, how does one approach learning fundamentals with so many possible routes? I’ve read the side wiki prep section where that one comment goes over all the possible online courses they would recommend, but that comment was made before OMSCS released their series of prep Mooc’s with this degree in mind. If one had roughly a year to prep, should they persue the provided Mooc’s, or the recommend wiki udemy courses. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach? If students who have done either one of these paths to attending the program could weigh in it would be greatly appreciated. 

Second, the extracurriculars, how should one structure pursuit of personal projects and internships once attending OMSCS. I understand this question may seem like I am thinking a little too far ahead, but I really want to have all my bases covered before embarking on this pursuit. There are a metric ton of expectations on pre-med students when it comes to navigating the unspoken but required elements of an application to medical school, research, clinical experience, community volunteering, student leadership, etc. I went into undergrad blind to all of these since I don’t have any physician family members, and I ended up spending two years playing catch up just to break even with my peers. The point being, I’m doing my best to come in with an understanding of exactly what needs to happen in order to secure an offer. It seems that internships are the name of the game in terms of getting work experience. On to the real question at what point into the program assuming 0 initial coding experience should one began applying to internships. As a sub section of that question, how important are personal projects in landing prestigious internships, and at what stage of ones development as a CS student do they have the knowledge base to develop something that actually highlight valuable skills and technical understanding?


I really appreciate and advice at all, and I’m sorry if I missed anything obvious that would answer these questions. I’m nervous and it is hard to know what I don’t know.

Thanks y’all"

I just found this sub while looking for potential jobs. I'm about to graduate with a double major- computer science and public health. I'm also getting an IT minor. I swapped into public health after taking a semester off, during which I fell into COVID testing and ended up managing the testing teams onsite. 

I haven't especially enjoyed Compsci since the earlier classes- I enjoyed compsci1 and discrete math, but my school doesn't exactly have a great Compsci program, so I'm not sure if other schools would have had more vigorous early classes that would have told me earlier that this isn't for me. I don't even know that it isn't for me, necessarily, looking for jobs is just frustrating- even entry level jobs are looking for a year or several of experience on top of my degree, which is annoying.

I've had two internships but feel like I haven't really learned much at either, and I didn't particularly enjoy them. I've been trying to look for Compsci jobs with less coding focus. I don't hate coding, necessarily, but I really fell off for a while motivation wise after COVID, and feel my experience from later classes isn't quite up to par. I've also been more focused on my Public Health major in recent years, so it's been a little while since I was in a class that actually required coding. I've be considered trying to be a professor, but I really don't want to do any research, and I would also like to make enough money to survive, and, with any luck, pay off my loans. I've also been looking into product management, lately, though I don't have any formal business education.

Just looking for suggestions for positions that are bearable enough to do to keep me alive, I suppose! 

Tldr: feel like I've fallen out of Compsci bc of pandemic. Looking for jobs with less coding focus. Compsci and public health, IT minor. Want to make a good amount of money (I've got...a lot of loans)"

My immediate group uses AWS, and someone in my group said I could go ahead and use their SQL server. My experience with SQL is MySQL workbench, and I've connected to an AWS server before.

I was able to simply run my notebook in ML studio in azure on my personal computer, but I guess that isn't configured at work so that isn't an option. We do have pyspark and databricks through azure.

I feel comfortable in python and can do some ML, and I would like to just use scikit-learn in python for predictive analytics down the line.

For context, I am a recent graduate with a bachelors in Geospatial Applications, I currently intern at a municipal office spending much of my time working on various projects here and there, mostly doing surveying stuff out in the field (not exactly what I want to be doing, but I'll take any experience I can get). Recently, I was asked to make a map for them, however my office only has ArcMap 10.5 and a Basic License. Neither of my supervisors are very familiar with ArcGIS so my resources are quite limited. They also want this map to be uploaded to ArcGIS Online where it will be available for public access (so it would be best for it to be a web map, I think), therefore, they aren't looking for a physical/static map but an interactive one. The purpose of the map is to display all the businesses in the borough's central business district and their corresponding NAICS codes. They want  separate maps for 3 tiers of the NAICS codes, the 2 digit, 3-4 digit, and 6 digit. I want to know what opinions you guys have on this... is this a feasible task taking into account my limitations?

I am a (23 F) master's student in a European (relevant) university and I'm very close to graduating. I've passed all my classes, completed my compulsory internship and now all I have to do is to finish writing my thesis and attend the graduation session.

I'm from a non-European country that requires me to have a residence permit (which I have without a problem atm) in order for me to continue my education in my European university. About a week ago I have returned to my country of origin to visit my parents (52 M and 50 F) and my sister (20 F).

I've never had a good relationship with my sister simply because our personalities are way too different from each other and we've never had anything in common. Additionally, I've always had some small grudge against her because I have seen the difference between how our parents treated me when I was her age and how they treat her.

I've been both physically and emotionally abused by them throughout my childhood until I was 18 when I left the country to go to university in Europe. I have taken therapy with the university counselor for about a year and in the end made peace with it, forgiving my parents for their inadequacy when they were raising me.

Since then perhaps with the help of distance between us, we had a pretty good relationship, I thought we became quite close and I started calling them much more often, not because I felt the need to update them but because I genuinely liked talking with them.

Fast forward to two days ago, when I had a short fight with my sister where I suggested a very logical solution but just because she ""doesn't want to do it that way"" I've lost about 8 hours of my day, which I have planned to work on my thesis to send my progress to my supervisor professor at the end of this week. The thing that upset me the most was my dad defending my sister, basically enabling her princess attitude at the cost of a large amount of time on my side.

I got very upset not because he defended her but because I realized that if it would've been me acting this way when I was twenty, I would've gotten yelled at and even my passport taken away.

A couple hours later I went to talk with them to explain why I was mad and it turned into both of my parents saying they have never treated me badly, I've been imagining their emotional abuse and they have never done or said things that I've worked out previously in therapy and I was ungrateful for all the sacrifices they made for me. In the end, the conversation ended with my mom saying they wish they never supported me throughout university and my dad saying ""maybe it's better if you don't come to visit next time since each time you say we treated you badly just to hurt us""

Following this, today I figured out that I have an almost impossible-to-meet deadline on school fees if I want to graduate on the day I've planned for and if I'm late I need to pay around 4000 euros which neither me nor my parents have.

I've been very depressed after all this and also had a fight with my boyfriend of two years (23 M). I thought he was the only person I had left that I could get emotional support and he basically told me that I should've already started working in September-October last year and I would've had money to pay my school fee by now. I got very upset at this and basically thought okay fuck it, and told him ""I apologize for dragging you down with me, I think we shouldn't be together anymore.""

I know I messed up with basically every relationship in my life and I now have no one I can talk to. As a non-European student, I have very little luck in finding a job in the city of my University and I feel like I have ruined all my future plans and burned all my bridges in this last 3 days.

How can I fix this? Not only talking about relationships but just how can I get back to my old life where I knew what I was working for and what I wanted to achieve. Now everything feels very pointless and I feel myself slipping to the dark mental space I was in my first years of uni"

It has only been me and one other person for the last 9 months I have been here. I took this job because I was in need of an office type position for the experience and hours.

I have done a lot of good work here, sort of changed the way that they do business because they were VERY old school. Got a SaaS for us, fixed all the data, proper backups, and managed a team of a few service workers. 

My plan for a while now was to try and get an internship in the summer because this company does not allow me to move up whatsoever, I am essentially at the highest position I can be at. The person I have been working with for the last 9 months dropped the news on us 2 weeks ago that he is leaving. All of his duties have been relinquished to me so essentially I have to do it all.

Out of nowhere, an old acquaintance referred me to a job opening at a branch in her company. I applied and have an initial interview call on Friday, this obviously means nothing as it stands. If I were to get this job offer I feel as if I would have to accept it, it's an IT position which is what I have been pursuing, it's a much larger company with room for advancement, and I have to imagine it's going to be more pay. 

I am only 23 years old so I am brand new in my career field and I feel like I have to do what's best for me. The only thing is, my boss has no idea how to run the business at all. He would essentially be screwed without me here since he is relying on me to take over everything. I got very close with my old coworker and he essentially got trapped here in a similar situation.

Let me start out by saying I want this to come off as least narcissistic as humanly possible; as bad of a way to start as that may be. 

My names Jake, I’m 14 and am in 8th grade. I recognize that this is a young age to be looking for internships but please here me out. I’m somebody who has gone to summer camps my entire life and almost always end up hating it. My issue is that I don’t receive any edification from these camps. As a consequence of this, last year I decided to try my hand a a summer tech program called ID tech (for those of you that know it). This was a far more enjoyable experience. It gave me some independence, taught me a little bit, and was even quite enjoyable (which is not a prerequisite to my final decision). However, what I found was that even something like this simply did not challenge me at the level I’m looking for. That being said, my father suggested I look at internships: this would allow me to get more hands on experience in the topics I’m interested in, while still providing sufficient difficulty as well as looking good on both high school* and eventually college applications (maybe).

With all that said let me provide some extra information:

1. I’m generally interested in tech, more specifically software, though hardware is simply a juxtaposition in field to me (as in I enjoy both). I enjoy almost wr her kind of coding and have been coding since I was 5 or 6. I know Python, Java, Perl, assembly, R, and a few other ones to a lesser extent. I “specialize” in machine learning and neural networking.

2. As referenced in the beginning this is *going* to be narcissistic: I am not your average student. I have A+’s across the board, testing scores in the 2nd percentile, world class athleticism, work ethic like no other, lots of passion, I am extraordinarily articulate, charismatic, good under pressure, independent, and of course extreme humility (kidding).

3. (Preferences): As mentioned in the latter paragraph I am quite athletic. As part of this I train six days a week and having access to a gym is very important to me: though relinquish-able. I also live near New York City which means opportunity there would be highly preferred. And finally, I would really love to actually work on something instead of moving stuff all day or getting coffee (as classically displayed in media)

The final question: 

Does anybody have ideas for where I might be able to get some of the things I’m looking for in an internship. Additionally if you have ideas about where I might find this outside of internships that would also be appreciated. 

Thanks to all who have read this far - and a special appreciation for those who respond!"

Am aplicat la un post de internship pe JavaScript la Adobe si astazi am primit de la ei un mail cu un test online de 60 min. Aveti idee la ce as putea sa ma astept, cam cat de greu ar putea fi si ce tipuri de probleme se dau de regula la asemenea teste ? Mentionez ca sunt incepator, incerc sa intru in industrie 😁"

So its been about a year since i finished my degree and despite sending out a ludicrous amount of apps I've received 1 call back and that fell through in the interview. I've been working as a Valet just to pay the bills since i cant seem to get any job in the IT space.  

It feels like I've tried everything, networking with old classmates, having my resume reviewed multiple times on multiple platforms, building a portfolio showcasing a variety of projects... it just feels so hopeless when every app listed as ""entry level"" requires years of experience (which i apply for anyway because I've been told people get accepted for positions they are under qualified for)

I definitely made a mistake by picking a poor place to intern in college, especially since I've been applying to other internships now in desperation just to get some work experience and still no responses.

It feels like I'm slowly losing my knowledge because outside of those project showcases i did right after graduating i haven't gotten any real programming practice so I'm scared even if i land an interview i wont even have the skills to get the job. do people keep working on projects nonstop to maintain their knowledge or am i doing something wrong?

Working my way through school was hell and its just starting to feel like I wasted years of my life.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

10flazh,83,2023-01-18,Apply to everything you can,jadedgradstudent,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10flazh/apply_to_everything_you_can/,"Former cal student. Graduated with 0 experience in anything. I applied to labs, clubs, internships and on campus jobs. Never got anything in Psych/DS. The competitiveness of Cal once people matriculate is not emphasized enough. I was naive thinking that I could get research in my junior/senior year with no problem. Now I'm applying to research and analyst jobs with no relevant experience and it couldn't be anymore miserable.

I spent most of undergrad being a math tutor and it was awful for my resume. Nobody gives a shit if I can teach people how to compute triple integrals. I'm getting rejected by labs and firms left and right, but i feel that there's nothing else I can do to acquire experience (which is largely why I'm in grad school now, but even here I cant get into a lab because im in a coursework masters).  

This is largely a rant I needed to get off my chest buuuuut I do want to office some advice to lower-div students and that is: APPLY TO EVERYTHING. Give yourself every chance to acquire lab, club, or internship opportunities during college. Don't wait until the last 2 years like I did. The prospects of doing so are really bad. Dont become a math tutor or play league of legends for the first three years of college.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Research/Internships &gt; Tutoring/AI/uGSI roles. More importantly, apply to every opportunity that interests you and start applying as a freshman (even tho chances are slim).  /rant"

Background for context: I came in as an intern with a 2-year Business degree. I didn’t apply or interview for the internship. I just handed in my resume and got it. I never learned the basics. I was afraid of asking questions because 1) I was shy and 2)when I did, this one contractor who trained me literally condescended and criticized me for not knowing things. They were also made racist comments several times. I got depressed and my brain began working very poorly so it’s hard to retain information (even when writing it down). 

I am a SME turned Business Analyst and fear I’m in way over my head. I need to be able to know what I’m talking about when communicating between stakeholders and developers. 

Here are some basic questions I’m hoping you can explain. If not, please point me to somewhere where I can watch a video or all-in-one LinkedIn learning course or something. I wouldn’t even know what to search to find the answers to these questions. 

What is the difference between dll, sql, code, logic, and stored procedure? When/how should each be used?
What is a script? How is it used?
What is a nightly job?
What is a repository?

Thank you."

“You’re qualified, but you lack the proper amount of time”

I am a sophomore CS major that graduates Spring 2024. As such, this next summer is really my only summer to get an internship before grad school.

I have a couple large companies offering me an internship ($19/hr and $22/hr) that is in my hometown. However, I really want to travel and live in South Korea over the summer. The company that I would be going through would work with my school and I would gain 3 credit hours as a CS elective, making one of my final semesters easier. Unfortunately, it is unpaid.

It comes down to how much I want to study abroad. I really want to go to Seoul, but the internship being unpaid is a bit annoying. I could also take classes there and have no internship, but that would mean I have no internships before graduating (although, currently, I am working for the US Army through my uni on a robotics project-- it isn't necessarily an internship though).

What should I do? I don't strictly mind taking on the extra debt of going to Seoul.

Thanks!"

I  am on track to graduate in May of this year with a computer science  degree from a university in the United States. I am mainly interested in  web development but am open to try other career fields and plan on  applying to as many jobs as I can.

I  have taken a couple of Udemy courses throughout college for web  development but I do not have any large projects or any that I am proud  of that were made by me(I have projects that were made with help from  the courses I took). Due to being in the National Guard I was not able  to do an internship at all during college. I am open to move to a lot of  different places after college.

**General** **Questions:**

* Should I start applying to jobs now or try to make a portfolio site or at least a small project before applying for jobs?
* Any tips on things to work or prepare before applying?
* Should  I include my job that I have had throughout college that is not at all related to CS on my resume? What about my military service?
* Any other tips are also greatly appreciated. 

Thank you very much for any help."

10ft34r,1,2023-01-19,Master's Degree or Graduate,dumbcoder123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10ft34r/masters_degree_or_graduate/,"Very recently changed my major to CS from finance and I'm at a bit of a crossroads.

I don't have a relevant internship lined up this summer yet (got a return offer for my previous finance internship) and I will continue to search for a SWE internship until I get one. I just recently started applying because I finished my DSA class in December. If I don't end up getting one I'm not sure what I would do, I could go back to work at the finance internship to earn some money or I could look into doing research at my college.

My issue is my resume isn't necessarily tailored towards CS - I really only have 1 resume worthy project and will start a second soon to show off my CS skills. I have barely done any LC so I don't feel prepared for interviews. Obviously I am at a disadvantage.

I will most likely graduate next May, but I can graduate as early as  December this year if I want to, so I have 1 summer left before I graduate. I don't feel very confident given the current state of the economy/tech industry and I feel like I need more time to ""catch up"" to everyone else. I might be able to do my school's 4+1 master program (still need to discuss with an advisor about this), so I can give myself an extra summer/time to play catch up and degree by doing that but at the cost of having to stay in school for another year (and paying for it).

What do y'all think I should do?"

I don't know what to expect from the interviews or how many are they. The recruiter just said there is going to be a short coding task, but that's all he mentioned.

Also, I am in my 3rd university year at Bachelor, is there any chance pulling this off considering they are in a niche area? Are they looking for something in particular at a potential intern?"

&amp;#x200B;

An eternal void of nothingness was what surrounded them for countless millennia. Thousands of the Kartakani peoples have been asleep in their Aetherium powered caskets for for so long, the loss of their home world now seems little more than a broken memory. The infinite void of space seemingly supplying them with a near infinite gift of the great Aetherium they use to power their great ships.

&amp;#x200B;

Many a year ago, a doom came to their world. A great, terrible doom. Mages, sages and great masters of rock and metal came together to create a solution. It took all they had and launched into the sky a great metal fleet powered by Aetherium instead of the great sails that powered their ships of old. A fleet of a hundred Great Ships, set sail into the skies a month before the world of Karatha was lost, a great and powerful detonation rendering it to a broken husk.

&amp;#x200B;

Each vessel expertly crafted and customized to an absurd degree, each one powered by Great Engines that could siphon the very Aetherium out of the universe itself, convert it into fuel and blast with a force to catapult them into the beyond. Each ship, surrounded by a bubble, a great barrier to protect them from the horrors of the Void. At the head of this fleet proudly sat The Retributions Gaze.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that terrible day, The fleet stay silent sailing in the void, ghosts and bound spirits unrestful for eternity bound to keep the vessels functioning and away from danger. The fleet could hold in comfort and security a hundred thousand of their people. As undignified as it was to be stacked on top of each other like boxes at a market, it was still safety. As saddened as they were to leave behind millions of souls, this small contingent was all they could muster in the short time they had.

&amp;#x200B;

Every four years, they would be awoken from their caskets, to celebrate the Great Conjunction, a time of happiness and peace where they would feast and forge new alliances. The celebration was used to fill their bellies and secure their souls from the Aether's eternal grasp through rituals and spells. Then, when the party was over and the mess cleaned, they would return to their caskets and sleep once more. Each celebration would feed their bodies with the food supply conjured by the mages, cooked by the chefs, then eaten by all present, young or old, peasant or king. It would last barely a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Each casket would act as a chamber where the occupant would be kept in a state of time-sleep. The body would still progress and age, losing fat and tissue, but at such a staggeringly low rate the effect would be negligible in comparison to actual time. Each man or woman would enter fat and happy, and exit four years after, empty-bellied but healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

The mages would use the great Aetherium Crystals and Tuning Libraries to gather together a grand feast, conjuring food from oblivion and feeding them all with it. The food was basic and simple, but it was greatly appreciated by all present. The vast amount of Aetherium gathered by the crystals in their close proximity to the void ensured they could happily sail in the void for many, many more millions of years if they so needed to.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day, a great boon arrived. A gift from the gods. The Retribution found an object. It was a door. A massive, massive door. The flight crews were awoken from their caskets, engineers readied to their stations and mustered to arm the few cannons they had. The massive door was bigger than the Retribution by three times and could comfortably fit inside it.

&amp;#x200B;

The object in which the door was lodged, was truly massive, stretching from horizon to horizon, distinct bumps breaking the otherwise flat, grey metal landscape. A mage stood atop a pedestal at the front of the Retribution, the shield around them rippled with activity as he cast a spell, a short incantation.

&amp;#x200B;

The spell failed. The door held fast, a symbol of KEEP CLEAR refusing them entry. The bright orange strips surrounding and crisscrossing the door shimmered, as if to mock him. The Mage would dare not bring defeat to his people and struck out in anger. A bolt of lightning from the skies of the mother-world itself flashed from his mighty staff and hit a small object to its left. Lights, bright red lights appeared at each of the four corners of the door, spinning around and around as if to warn. Then, the lights turned green and ceased their rotation, the doors yielded and opened.

&amp;#x200B;

Quickly, as fast as they could, their great engines spooled up, belching fire behind them as the great fleet charged forth into the new opening. They had finally reached it. The Great Land they were promised so very long ago. Each ship going through what appeared to be a thin sheet of pure blue light that appeared in the hole. They knew not why, all they knew was that their great journey was over. As the last ship slid through, the door closed behind them. They, were now trapped.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mages were beside themselves with sadness and worry. All light had vanished, all was naught but pitch black darkness and they were dismayed they had lead their people into a trap. A Great Devourer, the one who brings darkness and death had lured them into a trap. It was then... the lights came on. The sight, was the most beautiful sight they had ever witnessed.

&amp;#x200B;

They were inside a massive world, many times larger than they could have imagined, and what lay before them was a forest of giant trees and giant hills, mountains of material they could use. They were clearly in a confined space, a great box, a great giant box hundreds of Kulics high, millions of Kulics in area that could comfortably house their entire peoples for a million generations to come. Three Great rivers ran through  hundreds of Kulics wide, with thousands of trees of all conceivable kinds, stretching from green grass to steel ceiling.

&amp;#x200B;

This was nothing short of paradise. Each ship as it came accustomed to the light, the great bubble shield popped, and allowed each occupant to smell clean, fresh beautiful air for the first time in as many years as anyone could remember. The fleet forged ahead to the nearest tree, a massive tree of red bark, thick enough to house ten entire cities for them. They would be more than comfortable here. This was, the absolute essence of everything they could ask for. Of one hundred ships, only sixteen were kept functional, returned to their glory as warships to defend their new home. One was permanently anchored to serve as a monument to their great triumph.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest were scrapped down to supply their new industry as they quickly carved through the great tree and forged a new empire. A new home was made in a large dirt pile at the trees base and used to mine valuable minerals. The lake was flush with massive, enormous creatures that resembled fish, each one could feed a thousand of them, and in that great lake were tens of thousands of fish, some bigger and juicier.

&amp;#x200B;

The local wildlife proved a challenge, but nothing that could not be tamed or reasoned with, and the giant birds and land creatures that populated this great place became mounts for work, flyers for security, travel and beasts of burden. Soon, these flying beasts became mounts for explorers and SkyDancers, and the land beasts known as mounts for warriors. Lesser or smaller beasts became farming helpers and beasts of burden that carried trade goods across vast distances.

&amp;#x200B;

After six months of living, the population doubled, and a monument was commissioned by the Magistrate Court to commemorate the Great Journey. With a surplus in resources due to their location and a new burgeoning empire, nobody saw reason to judge, and so, work began in earnest. A great site was determined, a place called a ""Junction Box"" and a monument was quickly built of stone and wood in front of this Great Place.

&amp;#x200B;

Now known as The Junction, the mages and Casters quickly began to use it as their headquarters. Quickly a new Guild was formed, and from this Junction an Aetherium Siphon was constructed. The great pink crystal was ten times the size of any other they had ever built.

&amp;#x200B;

The mages power grew, and soon they were able to manipulate the soil and the crops grew faster and produced more food, fields never growing fallow. They had truly found paradise. War. Famine. Disease. Hardship. Anything their new home threw at them, for fourteen years, this, regardless of the dangers, was paradise.

&amp;#x200B;

A War had come and gone between House Astariel and House Arnoris, with thousands dead before it could be found out that conspirators had gone mad and were bent on everyone's destruction. Assassins in the night slaughtered them and revealed their plans to all, stopping both wars.

&amp;#x200B;

A great plague ravaged the countryside one day, causing the animal population to face horrible injury and an agonizing death. The great plague jumped to their owners, and before they knew what was happening, farmhands and stable boys started getting sick too with the same awful disease. Quick as it came though, it vanished, with limited side effects but many deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

A drought hit them. On day there was a massive shuddering of the earth, and the world around them went dark for several days. In the coming months the rains never came and the situation became desperate. In response the Gods themselves seemed to understand their plight and to stay the hunger and sadness a gigantic pile of fresh foods including exotic fruits and beautiful sweeet stuffs was found outside one of the villages. A new pond seemed to have been dug, and filled with pristine clean water.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day, after fourteen years of life in a new world, with minor incidents but no real problems, HE came to them. On a fine crisp morning on the fourteenth year, a device, a spyglass of sorts was found outside the Elaris kingdoms castle. Out of curiosity, a youngster looked into it. He shrieked in terror at the sight of a giant creature, the sheer size was nothing short of terrifying. The youngster immediately raised the alarm and armies were assembled in preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

The giant suddenly began to walk towards them. It took barely a few minutes to cross vast lands hundreds of Klincs across, but strangely as some mages noted took great care not to step on anything. Just before reaching the frontline, it stopped and sat down in a field. It was... just like them. Only with rounded ears and of massive size. Armies were readied to fire. One mage used a sound resonance spell and commanded the creature to identify itself.

&amp;#x200B;

It responded by simply smiling and began to construct something. A strange parallels line of steel railings placed upon wood boards, carefully clicking them into place and setting them gently on the ground, then placing upon them an object. It was a box, a big rectangular box with tiny wheels underneath it. He pushed a series of buttons and the box began to move along the track. It moved with exceptional grace and speed, crossing the entirety of the track he had built in mere seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

He had noticed their fascination as the armies had now come to rest and were watching the spectacle around them. He stopped the thing on the tracks and was simply sitting there, smiling. Finally, he spoke. His voice loud and booming, heard by all across the kingdom.

&amp;#x200B;

""Good morning. My name is Carter Tyson. I am an ambassador to the Terran Republic. Welcome aboard the TRS Oregon."" He said and simply sat there with a smile.

After what seemed an age, one apprentice mage stepped forward from the battle lines and approached, using an amplification spell to guarantee his words could be heard. ""What be thy purpose here O great being? And what, pray tell, be this box that runs along tracks?""

""Well.. I am an Ambassador. Its my job to negotiate terms of peace. This box is what we humans call a train. We use them for mass transit and cargo freight. We... figured you might accept a small gift as our way of saying hello."" It replied, taking a small book out of its pocket and placing it gently on the ground.

""Did you create this place? Did your great constructs grow this forest?"" An older, more experienced mage spoke out.

""I didn't build it with my own hands but it is owned by the people I work for. You have set up your home in one of our starships. Its an Arboretum. Its essentially used for transporting small ecosystems across the void of space so we can plant trees on other planets."" He replied and hauled out a large book that had pictures in it, using these pictures as a visual guide.

""What is thy business here O great being? Have you come to harm us?"" One soldier shouted among his fellows.

""Erm... why would I do that? After all..."" He reached into another pocket and produced a bar of the sweet, sweet chocolate that all the people so deeply loved and placed it on the ground. ""We've been helping you out all this time. Why would we want to harm?""

They looked up at him with shock and surprise. Twenty men on the front broke rank suddenly and charged with careless abandon across the field, each screaming ""CHOCOLATE!!!"" as crazed madmen and began to pounce on the giant block of treat and carved at it with their swords.

The army's  great discipline crashed into nothingness as they charged forth and assaulted the chocolate bar. The giant held a hand on the ground and one brave soul stepped forward and climbed onto it. The giant brought the mage up to eye level and smiled. ""Well... it seems We've won you over. Shall we discuss an Alliance then?""

The mage bowed in respect. ""We shall be Deeply honored, O Great One!""

""Please... just call me Carsen."" He used his other hand, opening it for a handshake.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Heavy footsteps thumped through the halls, the pristine and sterile white and grey corridors marked with various doors and signage pointing in various directions. A man, six foot one, grey haired and grizzled trotted calmly through the hallway with a brisk pace. He had his hands behind his back, clenching his fists out of mild annoyance as if he perceived he had more important things to do.

&amp;#x200B;

He stood at the entrance to a hangar bay. The label above the door told him he was in the right place.

&amp;#x200B;

ARBORETUM - THREE OF TWENTY SEVEN. AUTHORIZED ENTRY ONLY

CONTENTS - FRESHWATER DECIDUOUS FOREST

&amp;#x200B;

""I hope for his sake this was important. If this is a waste of time you damn bet imma steal ALL the tequila from the bar."" He muttered to himself then pressed a button to be let in.

He was greeted by the sight of a group of seven people, four youngsters, two adults and one white haired long bearded old man with a nametag 'Jeremy' on his left shoulder. He spoke. ""Ambassador Tyler. Good to see you again.""

""This better be good old man. I'm in deep hell with the Mars Reclamation Movement. We got shit to do Jeremy, make it quick.""

""Oh it is, it very much is. But first, have you ever watched the movie, The Borrowers before?"" Jeremy asked with a strange smile on his face.

""Really? Uhh... actually yeah I did when I was like... five years old I think? Watched that movie for a kindergarten class project once. What does that have to do with this?"" Tyler stroked his beard in thought.

Jeremy chuckled, somewhat sadistically. ""Play the recording I made please.""

&amp;#x200B;

The monitor on the control room lit up and began to play a security recording. A compilation of fourteen years of work. It showed a fleet of a hundred 18th century sailing ships lining up at one of the cargo access doors. Each one was no bigger than a New York City Bus. The lead ship shot out some kind of electrical attack and opened the cargo bay door. After cycling atmosphere the cargo bay door opened and deposited them into one of twelve Arboretums.

&amp;#x200B;

The ships moved around to a close Redwood tree and started setting up shop and what followed on the screen was about fourteen years of development in the form of a montage. They tamed the various woodland animals in the arboretum as pets, service animals and other things, using sparrows and hummingbirds as flying mounts. They built a massive crystal lattice structure in front of a junction box and seemed to use it as a place of worship.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came a screen full of Arboretum explanations and system readouts, detailing how the entire light fixture system had to be replaced in order to supply a day/night cycle. The entire water table had to be sterilized and properly filtered. The Koi ponds had to be slowly replaced with more easily replaced Trout and the entire fire suppression system had to be overhauled so as to not go off from residual smoke from the settlements.

&amp;#x200B;

Cameras zoomed in on citizens living their lives, the miniscule race of humanoids barely three inches tall but biologically exactly like humans, only with pointy ears. Images flashed across the screen of them carving an entire city out of the trunk of a two hundred meter high Redwood tree. Smaller buildings made out of wood and carved out of stone mined from various boulders made up the majority of a large city housing thousands of people. A simple life of medieval peasants in a world of magic.

&amp;#x200B;

Ambassador Tyson was stunned silent. ""Seriously? Its 3183 AD and in over a thousand years of empty nothing, our first contact are tiny magical space elves?""

Jeremy simply shrugged with a smile. ""Better than being alone at least. We managed to recover one of their ships after it somehow lost power and crashed into the lake. Its in the lab so we can try figure out how their tech works.""

""Have you done any contact ops yet?"" Tyson asked, taking a look around.

""No. We have left various trinkets such as watches or nuggets or iron ore lying around in inconspicuous places. We've mostly been spending our time reinforcing the hull and upgrading the life support system so we can keep them in here. We've just run out of funding."" Jeremy tiredly sat back on his seat and leaned on the arm rest.

""Any serious incidents?""

""One war. We stopped them before they wiped each other out by using a remote controlled drone to kill agitators and conspirators. One plague of flu that hit the squirrel population and jumped species after one of our interns dropped his water bottle into the filtration system. One serious incident was a drought and famine that came after a meteorite strike and hit the climate control system hard, making us shut it down for eight months. Had to go in with watering cans to keep the grass from dying and dig a new pond to keep it filled with water."" Jeremy calmly explained, showing footage from various operatives during this time.

""Have you conducted any experiments on them?""

""Nothing intrusive. Placing trinkets such as watches, giving them a few carrot seeds and seeing that they do with it. Leaving a slab of chocolate out and seeing what happens. As it turns out, they are choc addicts. They cant get enough of the stuff. Beyond small stuff we simply haven't had time or opportunity just because we have been keeping the facility running."" Jeremy guided his attention to a shelf nearby filled with various objects including an electric train model, scaled to fit the tiny elves. All were labelled 'TO BE USED LATER'

The Ambassador sat thoughtfully for a moment. ""Are we good for First Contact?""

""That's why you are here."" Jeremy replied.

""Hm... Alright. Gimme the train and let me set up some track. Lets give them a gift as our first hello. And also, your funding and personnel has doubled.""

&amp;#x200B;

The End."

I’m not good at programming at all. I’ve struggled in all of my CS classes, even on things that should be easy. I failed 3 classes in college. I’m applying for jobs right now and if I’m lucky enough to get a technical interview, I do terrible. Last year I had 5 rounds for an internship, and I failed 3 of the questions. I went all 4 years of college without getting a single internship. 

I’m not good at this major, nor am I interested in it. The only reason why I picked this major is because my parents wanted to me to do this, but now they’ve decided that I can make my own devisions I’m stuck with a degree in a subject I don’t like. What are the options for me? Do I still have a shot at getting a job? I’ve been thinking of working for a few years and deciding what I really want to before going to get my masters for that. I know I want to do some type of engineering, just not software. Is this an actual option for me? My gpa is 3.2 which doesn’t make me hopeful for grad school. What do I do?

I have applied for countless internships and all I’ve gotten is the occasional “we’ve decided to move forward with other candidates”. But finally, I have an interview for an internship in a little under a week. 

My understanding is that it will consist of 3 full length technical interview with different senior developers. I am able to solve easy and the occasional medium LC problems as of now(will be grinding as much as possible until interview lol).And I just really don’t want to blow it and go back to getting countless rejections from other companies. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips on ways I can better my chances? Or insight on how tough these internship interviews are? Or any similar experiences that you guys have had. 

Should I spend most of my time on LC? Or more of the conversational aspects?

I appreciate any and all insight!"

I've been looking into some other subfields of CS and it seems like **systems software engineering** might be a good fit for me. I've taken OS and networking and done reasonably well, and I've also done two internships in C++ at relatively well-known companies.

I was wondering if any of you have made a similar career switch. If so, I had a few quick q's:

* **what should I be doing immediately to prepare?** I'm planning on brushing up on OS and networking and probably reading about computer architecture too. am I missing anything?
* **are there any specific resources i should be relying on?** 
* **what can I be doing extracurricular-wise?** I've joined my schools' AV team, where hopefully I'll get some embedded systems experience in. I'm also considering learning OS development and finding a good open-source project to contribute to.

My questions are:

1. What are some good colleges that I should be targetting while applying for a PhD in Statistics (I'd like to go for Applied) abroad?

2. What should I be doing right now besides performing well academically? Should I be applying for internships? Should I be taking up more projects? Should I enroll myself in more courses online and learn something useful that I haven't yet? 

3. What is the cost structure for the PhD? How much am I supposed to be saving up?"
10g1n7o,12,2023-01-19,Dealing with burnout and managing ego versus imposter syndrome,throwaway174278,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10g1n7o/dealing_with_burnout_and_managing_ego_versus/,"I’ve really been struggling recently with my self image as it pertains to my career, I’ve always been told I’m a very good engineer, I’ve been a part of some very large portfolio piece projects, but I can’t help but feel like I’m not good enough.

In the day to day I get assigned to mostly low level, easy, straight forward projects that a well trained intern could manage, and what frustrates me to no end is seeing the larger more complex projects that I know I can do, that I’m often brought in on to complete low level almost menial tasks on, I get to see the engineers above me spearheading these large projects, and I just can’t help but feel my ego grow, so many of them are just so…. helpless; and those engineers express so much respect for me and constantly consult me and rely on my skills to make something work, it makes me feel good to be a part of these projects and to help my coworkers but… it frustrates me that I’m continually assigned very junior roles, when those senior to me seemingly rely on me and my knowledge constantly to do the basics of their jobs. I’m paid quite well, my co-workers have immense respect for me, and I love getting to be a part of the team, but I just feel so useless when i’m assigned such junior roles, but then it flips from useless to frustrated when those in the roles I want to be in rely on me and my knowledge/advice/experience to do their own jobs… it makes me feel like i’m crazy i’m constantly flying between feeling wildly egotistical and inferior.

I can’t help but feel like being a young woman plays a part in it, as this has been my experience everywhere I go — upper engineering loves me and wants me on their large projects desperately, when given the opportunity I always meet and exceed expectations without issue on the largest of projects, I’m passionate for my work, I work tirelessly for as long as is needed to make the project the best it can be, clients love me and often name me personally post project, but yet as time goes on, i’m still finding myself sitting low on the ladder the majority of the time, despite those above me relying on me to fulfill their own roles.

It brings up so much emotion for me because I want to excel and I want to progress but nothing seems to get me out of the “junior engineer with the skills of a senior engineer who remains a junior engineer while coaching the senior engineers on the engineering stuff they’re supposed to know”, and I feel so wildly egocentric, especially with how this follows me from company to company, but it makes me wanna leave tech entirely despite my love and passion and years put into it, am I crazy? or am I being treated as shitty as it feels, and am I justified in my frustrations?"

Option 1 - Bsc in CS at warwick university. 4th best for CS in the UK and better than Option 2 Uni. There I can apply for internships every summer and try unicorn companies and see if I can get a return offer by bashing Leetcode

Option 2 - Bsc in CS at university of Birmingham sponsored by PwC, software engineering pathway. No tuitions costs, 18k salary and will get a job offer for PwC at the end of uni im not sure how much the starting is but it’s good for graduate. Worse uni than option 2 which may affect my FAANG chances

I ultimately want to make the most money and yes I have an obsession with fang or any high paying companies. I feel like option 2 I’d be restricting my self from trying to get into high profile internships and and if I’m successful option 1 would start me on a lot more than I would if I chose option 2.

Learned HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Java, made frontend projects, one full stack project with flask, Learned DSA and solved over 300 problems, Learned Linux, Once got super into Computer Networks (Thought I'd focus towards becoming a Network Admin kind of person)

Now in my last semester of college and I lost total interest in this field. I find it so utterly boring and mechanical that the only thing that is keeping me going is because I invested so many hours learning it.

Did one internship where I learnt and used the Vue framework and worked on a live project and it was so boring

There's money in this field but my lack of motivation to get any better will be my downfall cause the person that does enjoy it would far outperform me.

Things were interesting back then when I started because I didn't know how things worked. Now that I have a general overview of this field with OS, DBMS, Computer Networks, Dev Ops and how the entire SDLC thing works, it feels so mechanical and utterly boring and robotic.

I'm 21 years old and I know I'm not alone in this feeling and many times we have to do things that we don't really enjoy but it still feels very depressing 

I've primarily dabbled in Web Development and got fed up off it, currently I'm learning Node JS because I have to make a final year project for graduating but I'm basically forcing myself to learn because ""oooh listen to request 👏 call database 👏 do validation 👏 send page to client 👏 set cookies 👏 JWT authentication"" JESUS

Maybe switching domains for a while would make things interesting again, Data Science seems daunting because math is scary so I'm thinking maybe Cyber Security.

I would prefer to work more in the financial services area and enjoy investing personally and helping friends / family through their financial questions. 

My big things are finding somewhere that I can advance my career, avoid cold calling, and avoid years in a call center environment. I wouldn’t mind starting in a call center to get my feet under me and obtain any licensing I’d need, but would not enjoy it for an extended period of time. 

I’ve looked at Fidelity some and have an office not too far from me, but I’ve heard mixed reviews on it as I’m sure you will with any employer. 

Any guidance or advice on where to look and apply between now and Graduation? I’m looking for any general direction and help.

Problem is, I’m unsure if they’ll accept a temp licensed counselor. I’m also unsure of how to even begin with insurance, billing, and so on. Personally I like the salary of college and my ability to not need to play limbo with x insurance company.

I’m feeling a bit in a rut lately thinking about what my future might look like. For context about me, I’m a 26-year-old female currently pursuing my master’s in computer science—software engineering at CTU. I kind of fell into it; I currently work in publishing and have two BAs in unrelated fields, but I love computers and I’ve thoroughly been enjoying my class work. My hope is to get into tech to be able to better afford…well, living life. And I would love a job that challenges me in a different way without driving me insane (as is the case with my current job and industry).

My worry stems from the lack of actual programming that I’m doing in my coursework. There’s little to none so far, and I graduate in August. Every time I look at job postings I get incredibly nervous, knowing there’s so many things I have left to learn. I’d like to get out of my job as soon as possible, but it’s difficult to make time right now for deep-diving into programming on top of work and coursework. Adding to that, I may have my living expenses going up significantly in July, so I’ve more or less ruled out the idea of going for an internship to help build my skills.

I guess I would just love to know: What sort of skills do I need to be prioritizing if I hope to land a job programming? Am I so miserably behind in it that it’ll be years before any company is interested in me? What sort of options truly exist for someone coming fresh onto the scene with a master’s but no previous work experience?

Been doing research on data science internships out there. Here are some places where you can look for data science internships - people know anymore good places to look:

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/): As we mention, lots of opportunities come from your own internal network: it’s easy to apply to internships through your connections or at companies that interest you.
* [Indeed.com](https://uk.indeed.com/): Indeed is known for its job-search platform, but it also posts summer internships.
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/): Glassdoor is perhaps more focused on reviews of potential employees and salary information, but also posts jobs and internships.
* [digiLab](https://www.digilab.co.uk/careers/summer-internship-2023)**:** At digiLab we offer summer internships in data science, software engineering, ui / ux design and business development.

10gk03r,0,2023-01-19,"[ME]Different expectations for staff, regarding gender, boundaries, and communication",strongwoman1616,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/10gk03r/medifferent_expectations_for_staff_regarding/,"Am I being unreasonable?

This is the first time I've posted on here. I'm very frustrated with the lack of respect I'm receiving from my boss and certain coworkers and feel that I am not being listened to and receiving lots of backlash when I advocate for myself. 

For starters,  I (f)work in a childcare setting. The children are grouped by age and grade and I am in charge of the oldest group. I worked there since August of 2019, quite a bit longer than many of my co-workers.  I have been in school and just recently graduated with my bachelor's in mental health and human services. In the fall semester, I had an internship and could not work every day so my group was passed off to another staff. This staff (b) is male, has worked there for over 20 years, and gets away with everything because of how long he's worked there. I saw for myself and heard from other staff how chaotic the group was.  B plays favorites among the kids and allowed them to play video games all afternoon and eat all the snacks. There was no structure and unclear expectations. Since I've returned, I've been trying to set those boundaries and ground rules back up and limit screen time and snacks to 2 snacks during snack time. 

There is one other staff (E) who is close to B, that has been giving me trouble for over a year now. He started working in September or October of 2020. He has a degree in community health or something like that and his goal is to be a gym teacher. He has overstepped a lot of professional boundaries and no matter what I say to my boss, he still acts the same. He wants to have my group, I know this. He is obsessed with the gym and doesn't know how to handle a group in the room or plan activities that do not include the gym, tv, or going outside. I think outside of the box, come up with group games and engage with the kids. He only engages with the athletic kids. He wants to play basketball with my kids in the gym and outside but then we have no time for group activities together. He is the basketball coach for our city and I feel as though he is using this after school time as a way to get more coaching in when the kids should be engaging in other activities and doing homework. It's hard to plan things for the group when he complains to my supervisor that I am not allowing them to go to the gym even if they went the day before. He has confronted me in front of kids and other staff and been extremely rude to me several times over the past year.  I have told my boss that I will report to HR but she said it won't work out how I want it. I am made to feel that I am overreacting and because he has poor coping skills and a short temper, that I just have to get over it. This is not okay. 

Today, I allowed my group to slide around on a patch of ice with the expectation that they keep their hands to themselves and make safe choices. They listened. Apparently,  yesterday my boss went to 3 other groups ( but not mine) and said to stay off the ice because other groups have gotten hurt from kids throwing ice at each other. Kids from younger groups tried to come over with us but I told them I was not their staff and could not watch them outside of  the playground. I do not want to be responsible for a kid not in my group if they get hurt and I cannot make the choice to allow them on the ice without their staff's permission.  I saw other staff watching us but nobody said anything to me or my co-staff or come over to get their kids. When we got inside, my boss came in and addressed the ice situation and acknowledged that she had told other groups, but not us.  In previous years I have been allowed to take my group onto a patch of ice and let them slide around as long as they were making safe choices so I didn't think anything of it. My boss said I could not let my kids do it and tell other kids no, which I understand but none of their staff came over to get them. 

My boss then started talking to me about how B saw one of my kids standing on a chair with a broom. This is true, but what they didn't see or didn't mention was me and my staff next to him supporting him because he was trying to get an orange that was stuck on top of the light. This annoyed me because the kids were constantly doing things they weren't allowed to when B was in the room and B always turned a blind eye and he never got in trouble. My boss then said B said ""I know (child) is hard to deal with but come on"". This made me upset and feel like I was being thrown under the boss. I don't understand why my boss told me B said that because it wasn't beneficial to the conversation and made me get angry. I was already frustrated from E overstepping my boundaries and undermining me the previous day and nothing being said to him. I got mad and told my boss that it was B's problem because he created a lot of behavioral problems due to negligence and free rein. My boss then yelled at me to get in her office, in front of the kids. She told me I was being disrespectful and couldn't talk to her like that and told me to go home and not come in tomorrow. There was no communication. I could not tell her how I felt and what I had been seeing. I do not feel respected and that I will actually be listened to. Other staff get away with hell and I have a moment of frustration and get sent home. Other staff are rude to me and never get addressed,  I am told to get over it. But I get in trouble. I wasn't perfect today, but I felt as though my boss overeacted and was way too harsh on me while lenient on others."

So im a sophomore CS student in university right now, and I feel pretty pretty unsure about my abilities.

So far in my degree I have taken some math courses such as discrete (had a hard time with this one) calc, linear algebra etc. I have also taken an intro to programming course (we learned loops, variables, reading and writing to files, etc in Python) a course which was about UNIX (stuff like C programming and bash scripting) and an intro to cs course in Java (the difference with this and the Python one is we learned more theory about OOP, and mostly about data structures and advanced data types like arraylists, linkedlists, trees queues stacks, all that sort of stuff).

I did ok in those courses, got Bs and B+s. This semester I am doing comp architecture using circuits and assembly and my DS&amp;A course (AVL trees, hashing, more graphs). The semester has barely started but I just get super nervous thinking about the assignments I will have to do. I feel like I overthink waaaay to much to be honest. I feel like every time I go to class i get very nervous because I feel like every single person knows a lot more than me and I cant stop comparing myself. I have tried but its really hard to just one day say “alright, im just gonna focus on myself and not care about how others are doing”. 

Then theres the stress of internships. I have practically nothing on my resume right now and I want to change that by creating a simple website to display my portfolio and also creating a small app to beef it up. Its just so many things to think about that it overwhelms me all the time.

Anyone have some advice for me? I truly think that CS/SE is interesting and I am fascinated by its applications, but the thought of failure in school and what I assume is impostor syndrome feel like theyre holding me back. Thanks.

Im currently a sophomore who is majoring in data science and computer science. Potentially Major DS and minor in CS. I was wondering what you guys think is the better workplace for me. I have confidence I would be able to land a decently good internship as a data analyst job in either tech or finance out of college based on friends who have done similar paths coming out of college and I already have two internships under my belt for data analysts. (Data scientist job out of college seems a little out of reach with no phd or masters). Ik for junior year internships, you normally end up returning there for a senior year good.  So for this internship, I was wondering where you guys think I should go for tech vs finance. My biggest fear in finance is working 80 hours a week as a data analyst and not having any potential to do some side hustle. However, I don’t know if I can make a good amount of money in tech. But I also think tech will be an easier transition to being a data scientist.  I also love to learn and want to continue to learn at my job. My dream is to eventually create my own startup and I’m just scared that finance might not allow enough side time to even try and start something like that. I would super appreciate anyone who has worked in either of these fields to give me some advice. Thank you!"

I'm not in a rush, but I'd like to move to and settle in an English speaking country in the long run. I'm wondering how viable it would be for me to move to either the UK, Canada, or Australia and whether it would be a good choice in the first place. I'd like to be able to advance my career further as I feel there is no future in Japan (awful wages and limited opportunities). I would also like a path to dual citizenship as I'd have to renounce my Bangladeshi citizenship for a Japanese one (which I would not want to do, as my parents health is deteriorating so it is important for me to continue to have right of abode in Bangladesh, and I also plan on retiring there).

My dad was a university professor so it was much easier for him to move from country to country, but as a computer engineer I feel it might be much harder.

However, to I recently came to the realization it’s essentially just IT Audit. I don’t want to work in IT Audit post grad. I don’t hear good things about this position (mostly from this page and other reviews)

Should I continue with the internship (starts in summer) so I can get my foot in the door and hopefully transition to another area or another company with more desirable postion (not sure if i can leverage my internship experience at big4), or start applying for other internships and pull my acceptance offer. Essentially, is it good to do this internship with no long term interest and more so as a stepping stone?

I’m a junior at a top 10 CS school with a background and focus in AI/ML. I worked 5 consecutive summers as a machine learning intern for a military research lab starting as a freshman in high school and spent last summer as an AI developer for a tech startup near my college.

Even apart from compensation, the area of computer science I’m most interested in is ML for quant, but after applying online to 70+ different quant internships I’ve only had 2 interviews and I lost both positions to grad students.

I’ve networked with friends and family in different funds along with alumni networks but have still come up dry.

Im a double major B.S. Computer Science and B.S. Economics with a stats minor. However, due to some health struggles incurred during my freshman year, my GPA stands at a 3.4 right now.

I expect to bring it up to a 3.6 after this semester (easier course load than last) but I’m still wondering if my GPA is the primary factor holding me back from quant and if it’s even worth pursuing quant without a better GPA in the meantime.

Wisconsin Madison holds more prestige and I am curious if it is significant enough where employers will prefer that over Minnesota. 

-say I get into Minnesotas Honor Program but not Wisconsins (or vice-versa), will employers care about the honor ranking? 

Minnesota is situated in the Twin Cities which I am thinking might give me more opportunities for internships and connections. I am not too familiar with the Madison area.

I also am interested in possibly moving out West to Seattle or possibly a big city like Chicago or NYC. Wouldn’t mind going to Silicon Valley also if I got an opportunity. Will choosing between Minnesota or Wisconsin affect this?

Did I do the wrong thing and how to I make it better.,benevolentdegenerate,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10gqbcr/ending_a_relationship_to_do_depression_and/,"I need to know if I did a horrible thing. I’ve been in a really complicated long distance relationship with a woman for about 10 months but have loved for many years. We recently reached a shit or get off the pot kinda moment. She has been struggling with anxiety and depression for many years and it seems like it’s recently gotten worse. We both struggle with alcoholism and chronic weed smoking.

My ex of almost 4 years was severely depressed with intense suicidal ideation after a horrible sexual assault. For years I used to have to break into her Appartment, and take her to the hospital cuz she was trying to kill herself. I’d Call and text her constantly, not knowing if she was dead or alive. With years of work and effort she was able to get through this and is in amazing place now. She has expressed so much gratitude to me so many times. I proud we were able to get through it but it left me changed irrevocably. I’m pretty sure I have some sort of ptsd or at the very least serious trauma from feeling as though her life was in my hands everyday for so many years. I have never been quite the same since that relationship. And now when people close to me, especially romantic partners vocalize severe depression and suicidal ideation I fucking freak out and don’t know what to do. It just affects me so intensely mentally and intern, physically. I have struggled with depression and anxiety myself, this situation certainly exacerbated that. My mother (who is a psychotherapist) has serval times voiced the concern that I possibly am bipolar (just based on behaviours she has observed over the years). This, coupled with my substance abuse issues doesn’t make me the most stable fucking dude in the world. 

Now all this being said. Me and the current partner (it’s hard to say partner cuz we live on different sides country, never like officially dated, but we’ve loved each other for years, things just never lined up when we lived in the same city. Someone was in a relationship or was away. We connected last spring and really ignited things romantically and expressed deep feelings that we had both had for a long time. However I had just moved across the country and was only home for a visit. But we’ve been talking every day since, she came to visit me once and my planned visit over the holidays was canceled due to weather). But let’s use the term partner cuz that shit is complicated as heck. 

Anyways, I’ve been in a really bad place and not been very present. Partially because of my own mental struggles right now and partially because of the fear, anxiety and intense stress her increased mental illness has been causing me. 

We just had a conversation figuring out what things are and I expressed my fear and reservations about being with someone who struggles with mental illness because of my passed relationship and the trauma it caused me. This obviously made her feel horrible. Me as well. Now I’m thinking I shouldn’t have told her that. I thought it’d be good to be honest and explain that I don’t think I can be there for her the way that she needs me and that her pain is causing me pain and I don’t know what to do. I did see this honesty as potentially positive long term. This came after saying maybe we should take some time apart to figure out our own obviously fucked up lives. Now I’m thinking I definitely shouldn’t have fucking said that and feel like a piece of shit. At first I thought being honest might be a good thing. But now I’m thinking it was horrible and to hard for her to hear. I tried to explain that it’s not her fault, it’s due to my trauma and the strength I lack but fuck obviously she’s not gunna take it great. What was I thinking. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice on the next steps. I can’t take back what I said. But I don’t want this to be something to causes her more pain and mental anguish for the rest of her life. How do I help her. I really regret saying anything because it fucked her up which intern is trigging all my fucking shit cuz now I’m so scared for her. Fuck me. How do I move forward and find a way to make this a positive motivator for both of us. 

Thanks for taking the time to read. Any advice (especially from any mental health professionals out there) is greatly appreciated."

I have yet to hear back from a lot of companies I applied for. This will be my first internship too.

One of them actually interviewed me to tell me how much of a good fit I would be based on my resume and the projects I have in there. However, they are currently filled out for 23' summer. 

They did offer me the internship over the Fall semester which requires me to take a semester off. I would love to do this but my school is not so CO-OP friendly and it could jeopardize my financial aid status. 

Now that I realize it, is it too late to apply for internships for the summer of 23'? Should I just give up? 

Is anyone else, in a similar situation?"

International Student (Pakistani female)

Major: Business/Finance/Business Analytics 

Straight 8 A\*s and A's in O-levels with only one B

In my 11th-year transcript, I have 2A's and 1B, but I just sent my mid-year transcript with 3A\*s and 1A

I have pretty strong ECS

2 Internships in Business related(national bank) and technology-related sectors (These were highly selective, in one internship only 1 is selected in a pool of 200 and the other I was the group leader of 3 kids which was also very selective)

1 NGO's co-founder, collected money 

Wrote 2 articles, and researched their topics (women's rights in Pakistan and social media's effect on people)

And a few more ECSs (Student council, Tutoring, Poet and Teaching students kathak dance)

My common app essay is pretty strong, I wrote about the movie ""father of the bride"" and related it to my father and me and how I started writing poetry. I used additional information to write about how I started making money as a 10-year-old by making bracelets.

I could have improved my supplements, but I was just SO DONE with writing. They were like 6/10.

Also, I am asking for ALOTTTT of aid. ( Which I know might be the reason for my rejection)

Universities that I applied to:

Smith College 

Brandeis University (ed2)

Skidmore College 

University of Richmond

Claremont Mckenna

Bucknell University 

Vassar College 

Washu 

Whitman College

Saint Louis University

I worked so so so hard for these as I started before any of the students even started working on their apps, and still, I do feel like I will get rejected. Before doing my work, I helped my friends with THEIR SUPPLEMENTS- 

But I just know if it's good for me I'll get accepted, if it's not I won't.

I am an international junior CS student with two prev. internship in local startup companies working in the industry. This year, I want to have an internship abroad. However, you guys know the situation very well. Also, not being 100% sure, I would like to have a Masters's degree after graduation to specialize in a specific topic. 

I have a nice GPA and am mostly good with theoretical courses. I believe those can help me in applying for a Master's. However, I need to gain research experience as I do not have any. So, it might be reasonable to seek a research internship this summer. However, I have many concerns and need clarification. 

Firstly, I don't feel confident about being enough for a research internship. I mean, what will happen if I don't understand what my supervisor works on or can't provide a sufficient contribution to their project? Also, a research internship may not improve me to help my technical skill. Additionally, most of them are unpaid, and my economic situation doesn't allow me to do an unpaid internship.  Most importantly, I am not yet sure about a Master's degree. If I don't attend a graduate program, then this research internship will be completely meaningless.

I believe some have already followed those paths in this subreddit. I am writing to ask for your advice and guidance. Also, I will appreciate anyone's idea on those."

The compensation for the **internship** is very high (about x2.5 of the other offer). tbh the compensation thing is the most thing I like for this one because my 6months will be easier.

2. Offer B: a multinational company, the team works on just the backend of things, which is a veery good to me because I want to set myself on a path to be a backend engineer, no frontend. There are seniors and experts who would help me learn more. The company specializes in banking/trading stuff. The compensation is low (just like any other internship in my country, the offer A is really an outlier). What I like most about this one is that I'll **learn** from seniors, I'll get the chance to see how are they working on big projects, and I'll put myself on a path to work on the backend of things solely.

I'm looking for advice related to a software engineering job offer I received. Thank you in advance!

I've been interning with company A since mid-last year. The first internship ended in December. I started my full-time job search around November, and in late November/early December I had an initial screening meeting with HR at company B. On my resume, I have the position at company A listed as ""X date-Present,"" so during the company B screening I was asked when the position would end, and I answered December. I assume this information was written down somewhere, perhaps recorded in my file.

Sometime in December after this screening I accepted an internship renewal with company A with a start date in January. Technically it is a 2nd internship; I signed a new contract.

My interview with company B was also in January, 1 day after the start date of my renewed internship.  They were not aware that I renewed my internship because I didn't inform them. During the interview I was not asked about my current employment; they might have assumed I was unemployed, but I'm not sure. I talked about my experience at company A during the interview in the past tense because I was referring to my experience during the first internship, which ended in December. My current employment never came up during the interview, so I never mentioned to them that I was still employed at company A.

Company B made me an offer that I'm excited about, but I'm worried that if an employment history verification happens on a background check then it will appear that I was misleading about my employment at company A, since the last thing that I told company B was that I would be at company A until December, when in reality I might be employed until February by the time the background check might be run. Another concern is that they might have an issue with me resigning from an internship, or have an issue with me resigning from a contract so soon after it begins (about 1 month).

I'm concerned that my offer could get withdrawn because it might look unfavorably. But I don't believe that I did anything dishonest, and I was never intentionally or maliciously misleading. My resume is also still accurate because it says my employment at company A lasts until the present day. I understand that it's very bad to lie about dates on a resume, and this issue might still fall into that category.

Is this something that I need to be concerned about at all? Do employers care about my employment status after I've submitted my resume? If an employment history verification occurs during the background check, would the results showing that I'm still employed past the date I told company B be a concern to them? Is this something that I should clarify in an email or a phone call, and if so do you have recommendations for going about that?

Thank you so much!"

I'm looking for some input on whether my current college goals are reasonable and whether I have a shot at getting accepted into the primary schools on my list. Feel free to let me know if there are additional colleges I should consider as well. All replies are appreciated and I'd love to know your feedback and what areas of improvement I could potentially work on. With all that said, I am planning to apply as a sophomore transfer and I want this to be my final batch of college applications (at least until law school haha). In other words, I'm not looking to wait and apply as a junior transfer next year.

**Demographics:** Indian, Male

# High School Statistics:

Went to a decent public school. Around 250 students. We didn't have a reportable class rank, but I would assume that I was somewhere in the top 30-40% by the time we graduated.

**High School GPA**: 3.4UW/3.95W (Not great, I know, but there's a strong upward trend throughout my four years. Freshman year wasn't really great for me, and I was kind of an idiot. Luckily I managed to wise-up junior and senior year) (I think my GPA is what really screwed me during my initial application process)

Course Rigor: Mostly honors classes as a freshman and sophomore, then mostly AP's my junior year, and a mix of honors and AP's my senior year. All said and done, I graduated with 7 AP's under my belt.

AP Scores: Of those 7 AP's, I have 3 that can qualify for college credit.

APUSH: 4

AP Micro: 4

AP Lang: 5

**SAT**: 1530

**High School Extracurriculars:**

Nothing too special, but I was decently involved throughout my high-school career. Though I participated in a fair few organizations throughout high-school, there's nothing really stand-out here. I was more focused on being a well-rounded applicant rather than having one specific spike. I'm going to keep things sort of vague here in the event that there are admissions officers perusing this subreddit (I don't want to potentially give my identity away)

1. Internship at governmental office (related to career track) (junior summer)
2. Volunteer at local food pantry (freshman summer)
3. Cycling fundraiser (freshman, sophomore, junior year)
4. Robotics Team (freshman, sophomore year)
5. Entrepreneurship club (junior, senior year)
6. Squash Team (senior year)
7. Piano (been doing for a while, around 8 years)

**Awards:**

1. AP Scholar with Honors
2. High School Honor Roll (don't laugh)

# College Statistics:

Currently attending a T70 private school. It's a decent college, however it doesn't really line up with my current career goals and I'd rather explore my opportunities at other institutions instead. I don't feel like I have any loyalty to this school and I'm just killing time being here.

Major: Economics

Minor: Political Science and potentially Business Studies

**College GPA**: 4.0 | 42 credits by the end of my freshman year (15 first semester | 15 second semester | 12 AP transfer credits)

Course Rigor: 1st semester was focused on mainly getting gen-eds and pre-reqs out of the way since I know I'll have to redo a few major related classes when I transfer. 2nd semester is more focused on completing classes related to my minor and any remaining pre-reqs for my major.

**College Extracurriculars:**

Again, there isn't anything crazy here, but I did take the initiative to get involved in groups and clubs I found to be interesting.

1. Impact Investment Organization
2. Pre-Law Fraternity (completely pre-professional)
3. Fencing Team
4. School Newspaper editor (not very involved here so I might leave out of my app, not sure yet)

**Awards:**

1. Dean's List

**Recommendation Letters:**

1. My primary letter is probably going to be from one of my writing professors. I think this is going to be good as he has shown his full support and has even encouraged me to transfer. I also participated quite a bit in his class and grinded on all the essays. I think we're on the same page here.
2. For Gtown, I need a Dean's letter. Not too sure how this is going to go since I haven't even met with the dean once. As far as I know, it's only to confirm that I'm in good academic and disciplinary standing with the school, but if he's required to write a personal evaluation of me, I'm unsure what he'll say. (hopefully good things lol)

**Essays:**

I can't really be the judge of their quality, but relatively speaking, they're a lot better and more succinct than my original college application essays. That said, my original essays were pretty horrendous, so not really a high bar to clear.

\---

**Colleges I'm Applying to (in no particular order):**

1. NYU
2. USC
3. WashU
4. Emory
5. Gtown
6. Tufts
7. Vandy
8. Northwestern

Luckily, I have the privilege of coming from a relatively well-off family so financial aid isn't really necessary for me. I probably won't apply if I think it'll hurt my chances, even by a bit.

So what do you guys think? Good applicant? Bad applicant? Lmk please lol"

I'm at a crossroads about what to do: to choose Industrial and Systems Engineering degree for money and security or throw myself into my interested career field despite it being one of the careers with one of the highest barrier to entry (Forensic Science)?

Context of my situation: I lost my entire 20's to depression and dealing with abusive + toxic environment (family abuse etc.) and abusive relationship that wasted 5 years of my life, basically. I am now 30 and just transferred to a four year university. Since leaving my ex in 2020, I've made significant changes by seeking therapy and got my anxiety &amp; depression under control, I quit alcohol, and going back to school to ""start a new life."" I got accepted to state school but not for the major I chose. I chose Chemical Engineering as my first choice because I was always interested in Chemistry and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE) as a second choice mainly because it was the fastest one to get into and required less class. I chose Engineering because I was getting advised to get into engineering school by everyone around me. Counselors, family, and it seemed the ""safest"" degree for job security. Sadly, I ended up getting into ISE because Chem. E. was impacted and so is Chemistry major. I chose this major because at the time of transfer application, I didn't really know what to do but the decision to pursue Engineering seemed the most logical and ""safe"" decision. Also, it was the fastest route to transfer to ISE. Everyone in my family is engineers so naturally, everyone told me that I should do engineering. At the time, it seemed like a logical decision but now I'm torn. Now at the university, I took my first semester of ISE and I don't enjoy the subject one bit. It is painfully boring and uninspiring. I have zero interest in the subject but managed to finish the classes with high grades. I tried to change my major to Chem. E./Chemistry but Chemistry department is denying my request to change major because it is so full. I can quit this school and apply to another school for Chem.E/Chemistry but I don't really want to go through the hassle of transferring school again. Although, I don't particularly enjoy engineering, with Chem. E., at least I would've learned a subject that I have some interest in. The first semester of ISE made me have a hard look at myself and ask an honest question if Engineering career is something I can do for the rest of my life to put food on my table. I know I should've thought about this before but I wasn't really in the midframe to think about this when I was at community college because I was only thinking about leaving my ex and breaking away from a toxic/abusive environment. (I know I messed up by not thinking about this early so please don't berate me on this). No offense to ISE's but I looked at ISE jobs and all of them look incredibly dry and boring to me.  I'm so sorry if I offend anyone by this statement but I just see all the jobs in this field at as another corporate job that pays well. I love the intellectual aspect of problem solving but the job itself is not that interesting to me. Only attractive aspect of ISE career market is the money and job availability.

Now, about my true passion/interest:

In my free time, I read copious amounts of Forensic Science books and developed deep fascination and interest in Forensic Science since high school but never really considered it as a career choice until now. It was always the genre of book I naturally gravitated toward: forensic science and natural science nonfictions. Forensic Science/Chemistry is the only subject that gets me super excited. I guess everyone has some interest in True Crime but I am more fascinated by the scientific investigation aspect. Forensic Anthropologist and Forensic Investigator such as Dr. Sue Black and Dr. Henry Lee are one of my most respected &amp; beloved people and I often daydream about doing what they do. It was always the thing that I thought about but felt like an ""impossible dream."" After painful first semester in a major I don't really have interest in, I am now considering switching my major to Forensic Science with Chemistry concentration as an option since switching to Chemistry/Chem. E. seems unlikely. Another option is that I transfer to another school for Chemistry but it will be another year process and extend my time in school. 

Upon doing a lot of research, reading every forum posts and FB groups of Forensic Science professionals, I see that this is one of the careers with the highest barriers to entry. Difficult to get jobs and few job availabilities. I'm feeling a bit discouraged. If I push through ISE and graduate with Engineering degree, at least I wouldn't struggle as much to get a job that pays my bills. I mean, I'm 30. Do I even have the luxury to think about ""passion"" you know? My only advantage is that I am so lucky that I didn't wound up pregnant with my abusive ex so I have no dependents nor a desire to start a family any time soon. I only have myself to worry about. However, I feel it in my gut that if I never try pursuing my passion, I'd spend the rest of my life wondering/regretting my decision of never trying to pursue something I am interested in or am I just thinking fantastically?

My heart is calling me toward Forensic Science and with my interest, I am prepared to face the challenge but I am afraid I am setting myself up for a lifetime of struggle to find jobs in such a niche field. Everyone I talked to in this field are warning me that this this field is insanely competitive: high amount of applicants and few jobs. My ""logical side"" is telling me that I should push through ISE degree because of the money + job availabilities in my area (San Francisco, CA) and try out few internships and if I truly hate it and go back to school once again to pursue a career in Forensic Science field? This choice will obviously prolong the process of going into Forensic Science field and cost more money and time.

I am not looking people to make a decision FOR me but I just want to hear if anyone was in a similar situation as me and how did it turn out? Is it generally a bad idea to force myself to get a degree in something I'm not interested in?  I know I should've thought about this in my 20's but I honestly didn't really have the luxury to think about this because I was just thinking of survival and not unaliving myself. I am lucky that I am even here today."

I filled out the LAUSD application AND FULLY disclosed my misdemeanor DUI in 2019.

My credential was cleared a couple days ago (I fully disclosed my DUI w/ them, as well); so I assumed I would be cleared by LAUSD, as well.

Today I was notified that I was DQ'd... after asking questions, I was finally told it was because of my prior conviction....

HOWEVER, They are giving me an opportunity to appeal by... (1) submitting appeal request form (explaining DUI incident), (2) submitting updated resume, (3) Three letters of Rec. with handwritten signature.

My question: Is this routine for all School districts, or just major/large districts?

Should I even attempt the appeal; or it it futile? (I have already started it, but would just like honest opinions)

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Common App: 9/10 I would guess. I'm a writer and it really only could have been written by me.

Supps: pandered to colleges, used vivid imagery, and revealed interesting details about my passions and background. I was admittedly kind of rigid in my Harvard essays (because I come from such a non-traditional background and felt I needed to come across as credible), but in my RD supps, I shared some additional context about my life (including being a caregiver for a sick family member) and really dissected my identity and interests.

LOR #1: 11/10 ""best of a career""

LOR #2: 8/10 didn't get to read this one but it probably describes my character strengths rather than solely focusing on academics, chose it to balance out #1. She probably selected ""top 10%"" for my academics, or perhaps 5%.

Counselor: 8/10. Doesn't know me super well (as she just started this job this fall) but she showed me her letter and it details my warmth, initiative, and motivation. She also nominated me for several scholarships.

Given that I would be just starting my full-time job when I interview with other firms, do you guys think that it would better to inform my interviewers that I already have a full-time job but am looking to transition due to the reasons listed above or try to ""hide"" my current full-time job unless asked by my interviewer and then disclose this closer to the offer stage.

I'm a former business major working in an Asian country with a cushy-ish job (pays well but is unrelated to tech), and I'm planning on applying to a CS program that offers guidance for people like me who have zero experience in the field.

By a stroke of luck, I was accepted into a 6-month data science bootcamp run by the government and a top-tier university in my country. It's all expenses paid, and I'd get around 500 bucks-ish a month which would at least cover food and commute. I think this would be a great opportunity for me to get my foot in the industry with at least an internship to put on my resume before I apply to any Master's programs.

Unfortunately, I've saved barely enough to get by for a two-year program, and I know if I stuck around a year and a half longer at my current position, I wouldn't have to stress about money while I focused my energy on studying and looking for a job. But I also have zero relevant work experience, which could make it a lot harder for me to find anything in the future. 

My question is this: would it be stupid of me to quit my job for this bootcamp?"

I feel so because I believe having a late Graduation would give more time to Intel to give me a return offer. So, guys should I communicate to hr about my new graduation date. Other interns I know have put May graduation date so I don't think it would be a problem with HR.
Thanks"

10hoohx,1,2023-01-21,Power Struggle between a Senior Position and Recent Grad,chicagowalker,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10hoohx/power_struggle_between_a_senior_position_and/,"I recently took a job at a small company. I was hired because of my experience and had skills no one  had at the company.  I am 15 years out of school (architecture) and have led countless projects and have managed many employees.

Because we are so small, there is a flat organizational structure with the owner managing the team. The owner is great, but still figuring out how to manage a staff after working on her own for years.

The other employee that I will be closely working with is 18 months out of school with an unrelated degree. This was her first job, and she was the first employee of this company. She is capable and confident, but of course she is still very junior and objectively making mistakes. This is normal for her stage of the profession, but the issue is that she treats me like I am her subordinate. 

I do want to acknowledge that she is the expert at working at this company. I am sure that being the first employee meant that she had to figure out a lot of stuff, and really feels ownership. I think she very much wanted other hires because she was overwhelmed and wanted a helper. 

I also want to acknowledge I came on too strong at first, pointing out issues on the project I was taking over and giving the group too many resources and tips. I think I was just feeling off about being treated like an intern and I overcompensated telling them everything I know. 

With all that said, there is no way that I can not acknowledge the vast differences in our knowledge. The company is taking on more complex projects and it needs to be understood that I know what I am talking about. I have no issues with taking a note about a subjective decision, but I will not be questioned on very basic parts of my knowledge that I have worked so hard to acquire.

I did have a conversation with the owner and tried to gauge the situation. I let her know some of the mistakes the other employee was making. The owner acknowledged that because the other employee is so confident, that sometimes she forgets how green she is. She also said how thankful she found her because she had been hired as a helper and then really made herself invaluable and allowed the business to grow.

How can I navigate this without offending or overstepping. I was thinking that I request that we both get non-tiered titles, so that she can be in charge of a piece of the business. Not sure if that helps anything, but I also do not want a constant power struggle."

myquals: I'm 24, currently in the second year of 3 years LLB. Did my grad in B.A. Geography- 68%; 10th %- 9.2; 12th %: 95.

&amp;#x200B;

It's incredibly embarrassing drafting this post, but here goes... 

I'm nearly 25 and have no absolutely no clue about what my career goals are. Primarily because during my younger days I was diagnosed with some chronic health issues leading me to feel I'd never live long enough to reach working age. So no need to worry about career and stuff. I have always had a survival-based and somewhat hedonistic mindset to just get by things by doing the bare minimum and enjoying the 'present', never really pondered over what I wanted to work or specialize towards. I was fascinated with medicine or bio in general, reading about health issues or satisfying my hypochondriasis browsing Web Md but eventually took up humanities for the sole reason that I sucked at PCM or anything to do with numbers or formulas and commerce involved math as well so that was never an option either. 'Naive me' equated getting high marks in school and college with a successful life. But when I graduated I realized i had been wasting away my life rote learning bs for exams and so decided to do a professional course. Which brings me to pursuing this LLB. I was enthusiastic while studying for the entrance but a couple of semesters down the line my interest in litigation has completely worn off and none of my internship applications to law firms have gotten any response.. to make matters worse I'm barely passing the sem exams. Kinda regretting doing this course now. Meanwhile my family expects and pressurizes me to take the USPC exam sometime soon, which I both; firstly am not interested in and know that I realistically don't stand much a chance given the competition level and reservation.   

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel disassociated with real life. Reading online about career options feels very overwhelming. Just when I think I can take a particular exam or acquire some skill, self-doubt starts emerging. Ultimately I procrastinate or nothing at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and btw, I don't have any marketable skills or productive hobbies. As for achievements I was a goodish student in school and undergrad clg, but not so much in law school :( 

Other than that only noteworthy thing is that I got a blog and article published last yr on some legal topics.

I just want to put all my efforts toward one thing which brings me financial stability. That's all. The problem is that I don't know what that is. I'm just very confused. 

I'm willing to put in the work and realize my potential after getting some clarity. 

I figured that if I couldn't sort my life in almost 25 years, maybe ask for the opinions of fellow Redditors, the community here is mostly rad and very helpful. (I daresay even better and honest than most real life people i have met). 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe Im overthinking but I have a weird inkling people might flood the comments with 'seek therapy' and 'you'd get nowhere with that mindset'. Trust me I know that. But my fam is not even slightly supportive and I can't afford therapy rn. It's on my priority list of things to invest on after saving my future salary.

&amp;#x200B;

That was pretty much my rant. My apologies in advance cause this kinda post maybe not be suitable for this sub and might get taken down. Then again its linked to career advice so who knows the mod may allow it. I just need some clarity on all the realistic possibilities and career options (and step by step procedure to achieve them) I have including within and beyond the legal field where I can still fetch a reasonably good standard of life. I wish i could have been more specific but am clueless atm. Hopefully, this is not a lost cause already and some good samaritan rescues me with his/her life-saving words 😅

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks xD"

It’s just frustrating to know experiences like internships and research projects are so crucial when they’re as competitive as they are. I want/need to begin working, but even entry level jobs prefer the experience over the education, and I’m having trouble on deciding what to do next. I don’t have a set timeline. I just have no idea what to do with my skills. I don’t have a specific interest because I don’t even know what anything is. I’ve never tried anything, so it’s hard to even gauge that.

10hwos5,67,2023-01-21,My Tips on How to Easily Get From New Undergrad &gt; Internships &gt; Dream Job,chapa567,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/10hwos5/my_tips_on_how_to_easily_get_from_new_undergrad/,"JK, I lied about it being easy. BUT there are steps you can take to improve your odds (and I've somewhat tried to compile here for a US-centric approach in 2023). My background--3 internships and a co-op + additional offers at all different aero-based companies.

***I just got college, I'm a freshman, and I'm ready to be the next Elon Musk!***  
Or maybe Steve Wozniak is a better analogy, whatever, anyway. Freshman year--a couple of things to keep in mind. Go to class, manage your time, do your homework, and start off with a strong GPA if you can. It's a good time to explore your interests, just don't get distracted from the academic adjustment of being at college. Starting off with a strong GPA gives you a buffer against when classes may become harder (or not, depends on person-to-person) or just you start to do poorly.

***But I thought GPA doesn't matter for getting a internship/job? Or does it?***  
Kindaaaaa. For positions with more applicants/demand or mid-to-larger companies in general, GPA is used as a cut-off. It won't get you the job alone, but if you're below the cut-off (typically 3.0, sometimes  3.2 or even up to 3.5), you may get filtered out just based on that.

***Can I get an internship as a freshman?***  
At this point, you are not very competitive for internships. You're taking intro Calc and physics classes and just don't really have the knowledge to compete against upperclassmen for big shiny internships. But there are things you can do to improve your odds

***So I'm a freshman (or even a sophomore/junior/senior) with no experience. How get internship?***  
A few steps. My first recommendation - joining a project team or research team where you can start to get exposure within your field of study to some hands-on engineering (because you won't get much from classes). Examples are joining a Formula SAE/Baja SAE, Concrete Canoe, Design Build Fly, etc. team at your university (student teams where you design and build something). Get involved, put some time in (6+ hours a week), and ask questions. For research, look up professors in your department--see what research they're doing, and email them to ask if they could use any undergrad research assistants.

For freshmen/sophomores--this experience will help you break into getting your first internships. For upperclassmen, **if you like being on the team and time commitments, seek out a leadership position on these project or research teams!** It makes a big difference--you definitely shouldn't do it unless you really enjoy being on a team, but if you have the dream of working at NASA/SpaceX/GM/Tesla/big sexy company that everyone and their sibling want to work at, it helps. I should point out--engineering translates to different industries much of the time. If you're a Chief Engineer on a Formula team (obviously automotive), many of those skills translate to make you competitive for an aerospace job.

***If I'm not competitive for internships, should I even bother applying or go to career fairs?***  
YES YOU SHOULD! First off--get your resume polished up. Find a simple, clean template you like, research engineering resume tips, and have people (other students, mentors) review it (r/engineeringresumes).

Then, go to your school's career fairs. Have multiple copies of your resume, and practice your 5-minute pitch beforehand (""Hi I'm blah blah blah with this major and this experience and interested in this stuff and your company that does that stuff to""). Talk to as many companies as you can and hand them your resume and chat with them about what their company does, your interests, and where they align. Don't just stand in a line for Lockheed Martin for 2 hours, **go to smaller companies and industries outside of your interest, especially if you're looking for your first internship!** They are a great place to start your undergrad career with--and generally are a little easier to get an internship with and get facetime with. The goal at a career fair is to maybe just get an interview--either on the spot or a call later that they want to interview you. **Also--consider fall/spring internships as well as co-ops.** They are also a little less competitive and skew towards underclassmen.

Apply online to companies and positions that interest you! It really is a numbers game. And if someone at the career fair tells you apply online, don't fret--that's how they track your applicant and contact info so 9 times out of 10, that's how you apply. Some companies will write notes regarding who they meet at a career fair and their interests that get attached to the applicants in their online system. And of course, you can apply outside of career fairs.

***I'm getting interviews but I'm not getting jobs. What am I doing wrong?***  
Your interview skills may just suck. Half the battle is keeping your calm. Generally speaking, the person on the other side of the desk or camera wants to get the idea that you're a normal person--easy to work with and get along with and know enough to do the job you're being interviewed for. Spoiler alert--no one usually does, that's what on-the-job training is for.

Interviews take two forms generally--behavioral and technical questions. Sometimes they're different interviews or an interview will include both types of questions. The behavioral ones take the form of ""Tell me about a time when you didn't along with a coworker"" or ""Tell me about yourself"". Generally speaking, they wanna get a glimpse of your personality and how well you work with others. These questions can trip you up if you're not prepared. Fortunately, if you google ""engineering behavioral interview questions"", you'll find a list of 200+ of them. Before you start interviewing in general, go through these questions--think of some responses to them based on your previous experiences (some are hard to answer because it's not a situation you've faced but do your best, even if the real-life situation is a loose fit). You can even write them into a Word Doc to have at your side should you interview virtually.

Technical questions are different--you'll typically be approached with anything from a short-answer, general knowledge question (explaining a concept from one of your classes in your major) to an elaborate design, manufacturing, test, etc. problem that aligns with some of the problems that the company faces. **You are not expected to know all the answers!** These questions are meant to test your base-level understanding of knowledge from your engineering coursework. They want to see how you think about solving a problem, not whether you actually get the right answer. Think back to how you solved engineering problems in your classes, projects, or prior work experiences (maybe some assumptions, think of some general equations apply, concepts, etc,). Keep calm and stick to what you know and your fundamentals. It's okay if you don't know the answer or how to proceed with a part of the question--just demonstrate how you would find the answer (textbook, peers, research--the more detail you can get, the better).

**Side note regarding the ""Tell me about yourself"" question:** This trips people up because they don't want to say about themselves. Prepare for this. My specific response is usually along the lines of ""I'm so-and-so, X major at X university in X year, interested in X type of engineering or focus area within engineering, participated in X student orgs/X internships, and finally, a fun personal fact at the end (I play an instrument or am in an acapella group). Basically, summarizing who you are professionally but ending on a note of something fun/interesting and personal like a hobby--you might get lucky and earn brownie points if one of the interviewers shares that hobby.

***My first internship is lame or not in the industry I want. Am I stuck forever?***  
Nope, if anything--it'll tell you that's not what you want to do or what you're interested in (which is valuable). Internships often work as stepping stones--you start with an internship with a small company,  not doing a lot. You go to another year of classes--learn more coursework, get a little more involved with your extracurriculars, and use your previous internship (again, many technical and communication skills are transferable between industries) to get something better for the next summer. This cycle continues until maybe (just maybe), you've narrowed down to a particular specialty, industry, or field you like. So you limit the scope of your job applications, you update your resume with your experiences, and tailor it towards the job you want. And maybe with a hint of luck, you get your dream job in the end.

***I've sent out 200+ applications and have gotten 0 interviews. What am I doing wrong?***  
First, check your resume. Is there some sort of egregious error on it or is it poorly written? Having others make comments and review it (such as r/EngineeringResumes) will help.

Next, what year and what experiences do you have? Like I said--underclassmen have a harder time and may require more applications to get a hit. Project teams or research will help improve your odds as well as pursuing fall/spring internships or co-ops. Internships do as well--even if you're applying for a different industry, highlighting the skills that transfer and a potential employer want to see in your resume can help.

Lastly, it's a numbers game and about being persistent. Part of that is going to career fairs, apply a lot and applying early, and leveraging connections with fellow students, professors, family and friends, etc. to get that ""in"". If it's any consolation though, in only about 10% of internship/job offers had I made any contact with someone connected in any way to those companies. I have seen certain companies aren't interested if you apply to literally all of their positions (like Lockheed) on their website for interns, so it's beneficial to identify a few positions per company that interest you most.

***Okay, so I have a dream job or dream company I want to work at but I don't have an ""in""? How do I get there?***  
First--recognize that undergrad is a stepping-stone experience. You may (or will) hop from internship to internship, learn more and more over time, and be given more and more responsibility and leadership in student-run teams. So the summer you finally land that SpaceX internship may be your last summer at college.

First--really understand what the company does and the kinds of engineers they employ for different purposes. If you can find a job posting that lists requirements and desired skills, even better. Tailor your resume towards matching those skills in your resume and experiences.

That of course, may not be enough. So how do I increase my odds? Some things that I've done that worked for me--using an objective statement in my resume at the top. A few sentences highlighting what I'm interested in, that I'm interested working at company X, what position/team there I'm interested in, and maybe how my interests and skills can apply to that team.

In addition, LinkedIn. I would literally DM mid to senior-level engineers on DM at the company or with my dream job (the ones that flesh out their profile), briefly tell them I'm a student and interested in what they do and that I'd love to chat with them for a half hour about what they do. I got maybe a &lt;25% response rate, but one of those responses got me my dream job. It gives you a chance to better understand what working there would be like (especially full-time), and if they like you--maybe they can put in a good word to their manager or even become the manager later on and hire you.

***Man, this internship/job search thing sucks, I have no experience and no one wants to hire me. Should I just go become homeless?***  
It sucks and beats your morale, especially when you hear nothing but crickets. We've all been there, even your friends you see posting about their internship at NASA next summer. Just keep applying, go to career fairs, get people to review your resume, get involved with an engineering project or research team, and keep going. Go out on Friday night with friends or game all night to clear your head if it helps.

***What if I didn't get any internships or the job I wanted?***  
Keep applying--it's just a numbers again and you just have to keep on trucking. And the end of your undergrad is only the beginning of your career--people jump from company to company all the time. **Not getting an internship or full-time job does not indicate your value as a person, and does not indicate your potential value as an engineer.** Keep applying, do what you can to flesh out and improve your resume and extracurriculars, and network to the best of your ability.

On that note, my stream of consciousness is ending, but I will try to update this with responses to other questions in the comments."

I’ve been struggling with addiction, won’t mention what type because that’s something I want to bring up when I’m at a point where relapse isn’t something that haunts me. I’ve been clean for the last couple of days, and I really hope it stays like that. I hate that repetitive nature of being disappointed in myself time and time again when relapse does occur, and that embarrassment has prevented me from great internship opportunities. I’m a third year, college student and academically I’m doing good. My mental awareness on studies is there, but with addiction It fades away to abyss. I’ve been struggling for 3 years now, but recently I’ve been staying busy, even got a new job and hoping to save some money up incase of an emergency and of course, pay any money directed towards rent etc. Let’s just hope I stay afloat because those moments of relapse, hurt. It’s such a haunting feeling, knowing that you were, for example, 3 weeks clean or 1 month clean, and out of no where, that urge overtakes you and you’re at zero. Yes, I agree that the ability to restart is what makes us human, but being stuck inside that loop is something I can’t see myself being part of anymore. I know I’m capable of letting that go, sooner or later I’ll get there. I just hope that moment is now, truly. I live a pretty good life, never really had to worry about anything related to finances or friendships (usually kept a small circle of friends) and I have amazing parents. Never had everything because enough was sufficient to me. Family is important to me which is why my parents don’t know. Heck, I’m pretty sure they’ll never know. Adding that extra layer of hurt onto their lives doesn’t seem fair to me, but I have to stay strong. My parents came from Mexico to the United States (crossed the border) in search for better job opportunities, and yes I’m aware of the unfortunate methods in which my parents got me here. Do I think their should’ve been a process in which my parents followed protocol? Absolutely. I’ve always thought that looking at immigration, for example, through various lenses is important and to that I take notice. I do think immigration should be regulated, but at the end of the day I was born here in America, a place that isn’t necessarily perfect, but it’s never treated me bad to the point where I hate on it for things that people are promoting. I know, I got a little off topic, but I just wanted to make that clear. My parents perception of their lives truly revolves around work, their grandkids and simply keeping the house straight, so I know that I have to overcome this addition through my own grit to prove to myself that I’m capable of overcoming it, instead of relying on people (who get paid, btw) to guide me. I’ll update in a week to see where I’m at and how things are going. That is, if anyone else is secretly struggling with an addiction. I, too, wish you a speedy recovery because this is HARD."

I'm using a throwaway account. I'm currently a sophomore majoring in CS at a T25 school or T20 uni. I did my high school outside of the US and don't have any relevant experience in the CS field. 

For freshman summer, I had some personal issues because of which I didn't really do much in summer. This fall, I took up lots of load with 2 on campus jobs, ambassador for a company and handling a club.  I started applying for internships this fall and like everyone I didn't get many offers. I do have 1 interview scheduled in March for backend developing. I got the 1st round interview (general why did u apply here and some info about the info) for spring, cleared it and deferred the interview for summer. 

 I'm not the greatest at coding and honestly I'm just about to start using leetcode. I honestly feel I'm extremely behind and don't know where to start. The CS classes till now have had decent level coding but I'm honestly intimidated and don't know how to prepare going forward.

Ca sa trec direct la subiect, sunt student la informatica economica (economist cu fite cica) in anul 3 si dupa sesiune as vrea sa incep sa aplic pentru un prim job, ca programator.

Ideea e ca n-am nicio idee la ce sa ma astept sau cum sa ma pregatesc, deci cer aici sfaturi de la cei trecuti prin asta. As vrea raspunsuri cat mai apropiate de realitate, fara sugar coating.

Inainte de intrebari, las cateva informatii probabil utile pentru a putea sa-mi raspundeti eficient:

* La facultate nu am facut vreun proiect relevant pentru informatica
* N-am niciun internship sau practica, jobul  ar dubla ca practica pentru facultate
* Din facultate cunosc bazele OOP si ceva Oracle si SQL, si am lucrat cu C#/C++. Si ceva HTML but we don't talk about that
* Ca ""studiu"" independent, m-am jucat cu Python cateva luni, suficient cat sa pot scrie ceva boti mai complecsi pentru Discord; Aici am cochetat destul de mult cu comenzile de baza SQL si putin lucru cu diferiti API. 
* Nu cred ca e relevant pentru un angajator, dar ca informatie despre mine poate e util, am descoperit ca pe langa stack overflow mai pot apela la o resursa interesanta numita documentatie. Aparent nu-i asa complicat de inteles pe cum pare.

Si ca intrebari in mare mi-ar prinde bine lamuriri sau sfaturi legate de:

* Ar trebui sa public undeva un bot mai complex de discord si sa-l pun ca proiect in CV sau e prea basic?
* Asta o sa sune stupid, dar... La ce pozitii ar trebui sa aplic? Ma refer ca titlu, pot cauta doar ""software engineer"" sau e prea vag?
* Dat fiind ce ""stiu"" deja, ce ar trebui sa mai studiez ca sa fiu angajabil?
* E in regula sa caut direct pozitii de junior si sa sar internshipul? Mi-ar prinde bine salariul si internship platit nu prea vad pozitii.
* Daca e sa caut pozitie de junior, care e intervalul salarial? La cat ar trebui sa ma astept? Ar trebui sa astept o oferta ok sau sa accept orice pentru a avea acel prim job in CV?

Orice alt sfat e bine venit si din nou, caut raspunsuri apropiate de realitate. Spuneti-mi ce trebuie sa aud, nu ce vreau sa aud.

Mersi!"

I’m a junior planning on applying to math Phd programs in the winter. I’m mainly interested in applied and computational fields of math. Last summer, I didn’t get into any paid math REUs so I did the unpaid Polymath Jr one, with the thought that I would be competitive for a paid one in 2023.

We (me and 9 other people) got a preprint out on arxiv which is cool. However, I was pressured by my parents (money lol) and some friends into grinding for internships this summer, and somehow ended up getting a technology summer analyst (basically SWE) position at a bulge bracket bank, which I accepted. My housing plans were finalized so I can’t reneg anymore.

I know that an internship can’t hurt at all, but I also can’t stop feeling like I should have focused on getting a paid REU instead, which I’ve heard are pipelines into the phd programs and also are great experiences. This semester I’m doing a research program at my school in a field I’m really interested and it’s a similar style to a paid REU program, but we’re not writing a paper or anything.

Does anybody have a similar experience or background? This is my last summer before grad admissions so I guess I’m just looking for advice what to do in this situation."

I have since had a couple internships where I got to get real experience with React and learned some Python with Django. 

The market right now is an extremely daunting place. Unfortunately the company I was interning for ended up with a hiring freeze and layoffs so I wasn’t able to transition to a full time position with them.

I have a small amount of wiggle room financially before I have to seek full time employment in a different industry.

My question is this:

What would people here suggest I really focus on to stand out as a new developer right now? Free or cheap certification courses that could be helpful knowledge and on a resume?

I’ve had the suggestion I look for some data analyst work as I have some experience with that and it may be less crazy that software devs industry right now.

It’s hard to stay motivated while watching developers with years of experience lose their jobs overnight.

Thanks for the advice!"

10if3wa,0,2023-01-22,NUS BAC 2023,matsuoni,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/10if3wa/nus_bac_2023/,"JC student here, applied to NUS BAC, NTU Accountancy (likely to get both offers cos of my seniors with my 85rp also got) and received SMU Accountancy offer. 


I currently want to join NUS BAC cos of the prestige of NUS (as per my parents) but afraid of the nature and competition involved in the so called top Uni. 

1. Top Students Only? (RI, HCI and IB, Merit Poly)

Is it true that in NUS BAC, you’re competing against mostly top students from ib/jc/poly/foreign students and scholars. I understand that not many ’smart’ students will be going Accountancy cos nowadays top students mostly go to computing schools/medicine/law (idea of accounting being obsolete or taken by robots).

2. The Bell Curve

Is hard to get A grades since NUS BAC only has 200 students, thus bellcurve causes only the top 20+ students in each mod to get A-
Also any students in NUS BAC can share how hard is it to get A- and at least B- in the course

3. Employability for low grade grads

If my grade overall falls to 3.0 and below, I won’t be able to graduate with Hons degree right? If so I should downgrade to 3 yrs non Hons Accountancy degree. Will I still be employable with non Hons Degree and/or low GPA Degree? I know connections is a things but grade still matters no? Will I get any job if I graduate with non Hons or with a very low GPA?

4. Downgrade to NUS Biz (Most Important qn I need answer to)

By which year can I exactly write in to ask for transfer to NUS Biz from BAC without extending my degree term? Has anyone done this before. Can this be only done in Y1 or be done in Y2/Y3?

5. Overseas Exchange programme for BAC

Is it even possible in BAC? With the insane amount of mods can someone even map non accounting mods for exchange programme and complete degree in 4 years?? Why is the BAC degree so packed

6. Should I consider NTU Acc or SMU Acc instead?

NTU 3 yrs programme is enticing but feels to short to explore interns or have time for CCA, SMU Acc no. of mods feels just nice cos it’s lesser  thus more time for above said interns and cca ventures but feels to ‘simple’. SMU has community service as a mod counted towards credit. It has lesser mods than NUS and not much ‘elite’ students go to SMU. SMU also does not feel like a full fledged Uni cos of no hall options at all (other than princep) and limited number of faculties (smaller Uni but higher fees)

Thank you everyone in advance :)"

Fewer companies are recruiting,  lots of hiring freezes and companies are laying people off everyday.

It's likely I'll have to end up recruiting again in my second year and I was trying to get a sense of what that looks like at T15 schools (assuming the market is better in the next 8-9 month).

So for people who recruited for tech-pm FT and internships both - How comparable are the 2 experience in terms of options and ease of landing a Job? I know companies like adobe have a strong pipeline for MBA interns but does not hire nearly as many FTs. Amazon typically has programs for both. What about other companies and the industry in general?

PS: I do have a SWE and PM background so I'm not a career switcher."

Despite having relevant experience, it's understandably hard for me to simply ""apply"", and I've always obtained my opportunities through networking or more often, cold-emailing. 

At my IT internship's conclusion last summer, my supervisor offered to connect me with a colleague at a company I've always wanted to work at, but before I reach out, I could use some advice on how.

Also, the company JUST underwent a merger. Two companies, one with \~100 employees and the other with \~500 (international). My connection was employed with the former, though started earlier in the company's development. It's a cybersecurity firm, and a cybersecurity role is what I would be pursuing.

First, when should I reach out? My school year ends in early May and I intend on pursuing my undergraduate next year. Additionally, I applied to some prestigious universities, expecting results in mid-March--would an acceptance to say, Stanford or MIT, help my chances in any worthwhile way?

Secondly, should I be doing anything different when applying to a company of this size? is there anything I can do to help overcome requirements or notions about my age? Does the merger have any effect on the hiring process?

Lastly, if this doesn't work out, what are some other effective ways to find opportunity? Linkedin? Reaching out to old coworkers and supervisors? Can I reach out to hiring managers who've previously rejected me?

tl;dr: highschooler trying to network myself into a summer internship, could use some advice. When do I reach out? How can I overcome my age? Are there effective ways of networking/reaching out I'm not aware of?

Thanks!"

10iqbjo,2,2023-01-22,Looking for advice on which path to take,businessbee89,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10iqbjo/looking_for_advice_on_which_path_to_take/," So I am a career changer, and Ill get straight to the point. I am deciding between doing a paid training program (Dev10) that trains you in some stack to become a ""software engineer"", or another program (NPower) that trains you in IT (ITF+, PM cert, etc). I am also in college (free school for me) taking online classes in programming and other relevant courses (C++, Linux fundamentals). I also have passive income. Just hoping for some insight from anyone who might have experience in one of these programs. Thanks for any tips

NPower:

* being a veteran got me in
* no $X binding contract
* 7 week paid internship (makes it 23 weeks in total)
* longer program but shorter days (5 hrs, 5 days a week)
* trained in something like a helpdesk role (less desirable)
* unpaid during the program
* 80-90% job placement once finished with the program
* have and will apply to locations where I want to eventually live long term (South)

Dev10:

* having a bachelors degree got me in
* $20K binding 2 yr contract
* paid during training
* trained in Java stack for software engineer role (more desirable)
* paid during the training (600 per/week, 12 weeks)
* will be sent somewhere for 2 yrs (North) and isn't my ideal location, but its a big city
* paid even when can't get placed with client; while interviewing
* long weeks (60 hrs /week 6 days a week min, heavy workload)"

10is3rt,1,2023-01-22,advice on which path to take,businessbee89,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/10is3rt/advice_on_which_path_to_take/,"So I am a career changer, and Ill get straight to the point. I am deciding between doing a paid training program (Dev10) that trains you in some stack to become a ""software engineer"", or another program (NPower) that trains you in IT (ITF+, PM cert, etc). I am also in college (free school for me) taking online classes in programming and other relevant courses (C++, Linux fundamentals). I also have passive income. Just hoping for some insight from anyone who might have experience in one of these programs. Thanks for any tips

NPower:

 • being a veteran got me in

 • no $X binding contract

 • 7 week paid internship (makes it 23 weeks in total)

 • longer program but shorter days (5 hrs, 5 days a week)

 • trained in something like a helpdesk role (less desirable)

 • unpaid during the program

 • 80-90% job placement once finished with the program

 • have and will apply to locations where I want to eventually live long term (South)

Dev10:

 • having a bachelors degree got me in

 • $20K binding 2 yr contract

 • paid during training

 • trained in Java stack for software engineer role (more desirable)

 • paid during the training (600 per/week, 12 weeks)
 • will be sent somewhere for 2 yrs (North) and isn't my ideal location, but its a big city

 • paid even when can't get placed with client; while interviewing

 • long weeks (60 hrs /week 6 days a week min, heavy workload)"

I am doing great in school. The 2 engineering clubs I'm in as well as some connections helped me land a internship for Spring 2023, and I have another one in Summer of 2023. If you were my friend you'd assume I was beyond happy. However, I am not. I don't want to seem ungrateful, and I feel guilty for feeling this way. I have friends who I grewup with you died at a young age, and compared to them I'm blessed. Compared to my school friends I'm blessed. I wake up every single day miserable. At night, I can't sleep because life feels like a endless rat race, like im working till I'm old just to die. I try going out with friends, and my girlfriend and its fun temporarily, but then when I go home its the same thing. My internship so far has been boring, and management is kind of rude. I do what it asked of me, I go out if my way to ask for more work, and they act like it's not enough. My parent's are undocumented immigrants, they don't have a retirement plan. I was good at math and science, and engineering pays well so I chose this path. I had to grow up fast, I started working an under the table job at 15. I've been working since. I never got to explore what I liked. I just knew I had to make enough so I can live comfortably, and that allowed me to take care of my parents when they decided to go back to their home country. I've just been overwhelmed lately. I feel like I chose wrong, and my life is going to be an endless cycle of misery."

People always told me I had so much potential; I got my bachelors in lib arts at a top university in the U.K. but then covid happened, my whole world shattered and my mental health continues to bomb severely. 

During covid I started a PhD in computer science but dropped out after a few months because of mental health, I then did a few shitty jobs (market research, bartender, tech intern) but fired from all of them due to adhd, autism, homophobia. I’ve been freelancing as a tattoo artist for the past year with a part time bar job but I’m coming to accept it’ll never be enough money to live and it’s not satisfying at all. I spent 5 months this summer applying to 10 jobs a day in every thing imaginable I thought would be vaguely interesting but got a handful of interviews with no success but I’m just extremely socially awkward and find verbal communication very difficult.

I don’t even know what to do anymore, I feel like I try harder than anyone I know but people dont like me and employers don’t trust me to do a good job. I also have no idea what to do in life, I’m good at creative and analytical things but don’t have any skills that employers want. On top of that I’m transgender and I’ve suffered a lot of homophobia/transphobia in workplaces and social situations that I just don’t really see much point in trying anything anymore because so far it’s always got me the same result; people avoiding me or trying to get rid of me because they find me too awkward and quiet and not-normal. And also bc of this some people expect me to be some crazy non verbal genius but the truth is I’m terrible at most things including coding, I just used to work insanely hard to compensate for it, something I don’t really see the point in doing anymore..

I know I have so much wasted potential; I always got amazing grades, did internships through uni, I got given a full scholarship to do a PhD right after bachelors (not normal in the U.K.) but I’ve just fucked up everything because of my mental health and I’ve given up hope that my brain and confidence level can ever go nearly as far as it used to. 

I don’t know what I’m asking but I guess ideas? If anyone has been in a similar situation , how to get out of this place and restart your life ? 



Edit: I cant afford a therapist, don’t want antidepressants, I’m medicated for adhd but doesn’t help that much since I feel so directionless and hopeless."

I have previous internship experience as a QA engineering intern at a Fortune 100 company and have recently been looking for a PM internship. After sending countless applications I have been offered a PM internship at a medium size company for this coming summer. I have been actively trying to land a PM internship for some time now and am thrilled to finally receive an offer, but I am perplexed because the role isn't super technical. Would I be better off looking for another PM role that is more technical or alternately looking at roles outside of PM such as QA, Software dev, and Data Science roles in order to grow my technical skills? Which option would benefit me more in the long run? I would appreciate any and all advice on the matter. Thanks"

And my class rank is 1-495.

This semester just started, and so far I have all 100 (But I may not be able to maintain 100 but I’ll try to maintain a high A). 

And I’m taking for sophomore year are: 

- English 10

-Integrated math 3 (IM3)

-AP physics 1

-Pre-calculus 

-AP human geography 

-AP computer science 

-Spanish 1 

-PE 10 

Those are as much ap class I can take, my friends say my class is too heavy. But I’m still not sure if I’m doing enough to get accepted at top collages. If not what more should I do ?

Just to let you guys know: my school doesn’t have honor classes or college courses."

This is year 2 of our grant and we already had budget cuts, it’s most likely not going to be renewed for next year. I was looking to apply for an internship this summer (my contract ends in April) and I need a recommendation. My current job is in the exact same field of this prospective position so she would be a perfect recommender.

Would it be weird to ask her? Or should I ask a co worker?"

I just did my final round and I think I did really well, the interview had all the green flags and I'm feeling pretty confident; however, I don't want to feed into my delusion.

From those who received internship offers, were there any signs/indicators that you were their first choice? also, is it good that the recruiter told me that they will let me know by late next week and to let them know if anything comes up for me?

Thank you in advance!"

When colleague started he knew nothing of the systems and languages we used and I taught him what to do (I have 10 years more experience but joined the company just 1 month before my colleague). I shared documentation and online tutorials which he hasn’t reviewed based on questions I get. It’s been 9 months and atleast once a week we have a call so I can help him through something he’s having trouble with. My boss doesn’t know about these calls as we are all remote. I don’t want to throw him under the bus by bringing it up but it’s starting to feel like this guy is overly reliant on me. It feels like I’m doing him a disservice by helping because he’s not getting a good grasp of what to do on his own. I also don’t want to just ignore him because he does need help. The time I spend with him each week (1hr minimum) is taking time away from my other projects. What would you do? If the answer is talk to the boss how do I do this without making the kid look incompetent?

Current sophomore and according to One UF, need 10 more courses for CLAS or 12 more courses for COE to get a BS in CS. Unsure of what area of CS I’d like to work in - possibly cloud computing/SE. Getting no bites from summer internship applications, which is unsettling. Could be the 3.1 UF gpa. Rough academic start at UF, but doing better academically now. Plans after undergrad are ideally to work in a CS position and then start grad school. But concerned about job prospects and the economy, so keeping the option to go straight to grad school open. Does COE look better to grad schools by any chance? If so, the 2 extra courses are probably worth it to me. Other interests are business/communications/math. Any advice appreciated."

10ja2r1,16,2023-01-23,Can i resign after a year,Physical-Degree1867,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/10ja2r1/can_i_resign_after_a_year/,"This is my first job as a developer.  I did my internship as this company for 4  months and got hired, i just finished my probation last dec 13 and now regular. But I'm considering on resigning on june exactly 1 year after officially hired and find a better company. Okay naman company ko now, international based in canada, maganda culture okay yung pay for entry level, once a month sa office, not heavy workload i can go outside, sleep and do my thing .

My reasons:
- My title is applications developer but we dont code at all kahit kaunti. I only do configurations sa system nila, test and validate. I really wanted to code. Kaya i dont enjoy what i do/my tasks anymore.  

- Honestly i want to work sa office, but whenever i go to office ako lang magisa. I work better pag nakakasalamuha team mates. I dont really like wfh. 

- i feel disconnected from my team mates, theyre all from central america. Im having a hard time connecting to them so i can do my job well. 

- i dont feel challenged at all anymore. Sobrang onti ng workload. Boring na tasks for me. Wala nang growth. I would really enjoy coding kahit gaano kachallenging. 

- maybe get a higher offer, current base ko is 30k + allowance. Sabi mag kaka increase 5k now pero wala pa. 

- life situations. I want to resign and rest and come back fully okay.

Questions:

Is it okay to resign after 1 year considering it's my first job?

Is it okay to ask for 45-50k salary? 

Can i still include internships in my cv for a second job? 

Do companies still ask for TOR since its my second job already? 

What will happen to my HMO? Life insurance? Sa company. Sayang ba mga yun kasi 1800 deduction ng hmo ko monthly? 

How can i resign without burning bridges? Or not disappointing my team lead, manager or workmates. 

Thank you"

10jct90,1,2023-01-23,How do you forgive?,MorallyGrayAntihero,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10jct90/how_do_you_forgive/,"See, I'm on the verge of cutting off almost everyone I know in college and move on with my life. A lot of things happened and to paraphrase the Toy Story theme song, I don't have a friend in them. 

One major thing that happened was I raised the entire batch' concern about pursuing FTF internship. The pandemic is slowly declining but the department is slow on accomplishing the requirements. They had other priorities. This has happened before, like when the entire batch got an INC grade because they had other priorities and our research subject was ignored. However, the DEAN just called me demanding. I told her I'm not the only one with the concern and asked the batch to speak their mind but none of them did. Apologies were given to me, it still hurt but I moved on.

 I could say so much about the little things and the big things that made me feel lonely in their company. I had to pretend someone I'm not just to be around them. In every encounter, I'm the bad guy. I have to accept every apology. I have to swallow every situation where I'm always wrong, that I always hurt people. And now I feel about this with everyone. I think I'm burdensome, unlikable and unlovable. No one was there in my darkest times so it's hard to connect with someone. Isn't that what you have with friends? You connect with them and you can feel vulnerable around them? I got caught up in living up to their idea of me that it's hard to be me around them. I try to communicate but it won't get through. So I just pretend around them. And I lose my progress in my personal growth.

Maybe I am burdensome, unlikable and unlovable. A pain in the ass.  Even my close friend told me I'm a headache, though she said that jokingly. I think she's not joking at all . At a new place, my first instinct is not to make friends. I'm not good at making friends. I'm not great at communication that's why I often catch myself always being misunderstood. And after what happened with my friends in college, I have new good friends. However, there's still people who doesn't like me. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I have to make them like me. Please understand that I have to because I'm an adult now and I have to make friends. Those people are in the circle where I make connections and networking. Or maybe not and just drop them as a group and they call me a coward.

So, my solution? Move out of the country and start new. Let time heal and I learn lessons. Come back as a new person and try to connect with all my friends in this country.
 To which I think is somewhat not good at all but it still sounds a good plan? I think I have avoidant attachment style so I always run away but I think that's for another post.

Could anyone give my advice on how to fix my relationship with people?  I'm looking for different perspectives here. Maybe I can find my lapses and improve. Thanks :)"

I ramble badly so I’ll make this quick as can be. 

I graduated with my Bachelors in CS and have always loved technology/coding. I was very lucky to have an internship through college and since graduating I’ve hopped between jobs until finally landing a great developer role that I’ve stuck with. 

The issue is, it just isn’t scratching the itch as I thought it would. I wake up and just feel bored going to work even though my team is great and the work is semi interesting. I get worried that big things rest on me like customer bugs and I know I need to be challenged but I don’t really feel fulfilled once I complete a big bug. 

I guess first question, is this normal as a young dev/worker? I just don’t get how my parents could stick to jobs for 20+ years and I’m already bored of this job I’m at, even though I know I should be grateful and love it (and I do for the most part). 

I really feel that i just want to see people more and feel like I have a bigger impact directly, being behind the screen just feels odd especially since my big hobby is gaming so I’m just behind a computer for more of the day than I’d like. 

So second/last question, if anyone else has felt this and moved to a job where they felt better, what was it? Part of me really likes the idea of technical writing but I wonder if there are small niche jobs a CS major can squeeze into. Thanks anyone for any and all insights!"

As I didn’t have any internship experience, it was really tough finding a job in finance. My job is a customer service job and it is very basic, most of my coworkers don’t have a finance background to give you an idea. I already over perform and feel bored. The salary is also near minimum wage and as I studied abroad, I have a lot of debt to pay back.

I have a lot of free time so I am devoting it to studying towards the CFA and a few programming languages. I also speak 4 languages and been reviewing them to make sure to keep my professional proficiency.

I want to get into IB/equity research but I was told that jumping through jobs isn’t good, and one should stay a minimum of a year into their position. 

So, when should I start looking for another job? How can I show companies that I have the required skills even though I entered a very basic position after graduating?"

* 26/hr for a forty hour work week 
* Moving stipend to headquarters along with housing stipend
* Working with client management (Java as the primary language used)
* Financial/Broker Company 

The second company is Lumen Technology 

* 30/hr for a forty hour work week 
* Technology company
* Database management
* Remote

I'm not sure which would help me in the long run as I pursue other internships in the future.

I'm a first year Junior and this would be my first internship"

I'm a freshman majoring in comp sci. I don't have previous coding experience, but I have been getting good grades in my comp sci classes. I've never had a job and I don't even have a resume yet. I know that students usually apply for internships before the summer of their junior year.

I never had any experience outside of school so my knowledge of MS excel, python, and SQL (things they listed on their application) are limited. However the interview process was very basic, just asking question about myself and only one technical question about MS Excel so I'm not sure if they're expecting to hire someone that's super experienced in these things.

Am I going to have someone with me at all times teaching me the ropes? Is it possible they're just going to have me do simple tasks anyone can do?

I have a call scheduled with my supervisor tomorrow where I can ask him questions about the position. Should I ask him ""what applications should I expect to be using the most so I can start refreshing my mind on it"" or would that make it seem like I'm not proficient enough?"

I’ve applied to hundreds if not thousands of jobs, have had like 10-20 interviews, and 0 offers and wondering what I can do. 

A little background: I got a bachelors from a good university within the IT realm. I’ve been dealing with a total lack of motivation since senior year due to a very negative outlook on life. I hate what I studied, am struggling socially, and am depressed to work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. It’s why I didn’t look for a job while in school and thought to take a few months off. 

I started looking for a job shortly after graduation and have struggled since. At this point, I think this gap from graduation is hugely affecting why I can’t get a job. I suck at interviews too. 

I basically just fill out apps online and hope for the best. I think my resume is decent (internship experience, looks clean) and has been reviewed alot (by friends, college advisors, ect). I’ve tried a few temp agencies but don’t hear back. I don’t call, try to reach out to hiring employees, or follow up on interviews. I also don’t adjust my resume too much. I’m wondering if these things would even make a difference. 

Any advice on what I can do? I don’t want to sound picky or ungrateful but I don’t want to have to take a shit low paying job to get my foot in the door because that’s why I went to college. I’m not expecting100k a year off the bat either but I see a lot of IT jobs lowballing with  30-40k for a bachelors and experience and the job sounds terrible and I really think I did better/have a more qualified resume then these jobs are looking for. Pretty much everyone I knew in college was able to find a job and start above 50-60 at least. 

At this point, am I forced to take a shit job or is there hope landing something decent still? I’ve also applied to these undesirable jobs and haven’t heard back or got an offer either so it’s not like I’m avoiding them.

I know I’m not entitled to a job/high paying one cause I have a degree, but I really don’t think I’m this unemployable and I believe I can do a job as ok as anyone else can (degree or not)."

I know I should act like working for 7 days as a training waitress is not that much, but my feet hurt, my back hurts, my wrist hurts from carrying all those plates and my hands have first to almost second degree burns and probably slight chemical burns from using all the desinfecting cleaning products for cleaning the floors and whiping the working places. 

I'm too exhausted to fucking cry. I have the need to while writing this but nothing comes out and it hurts. I feel terrible because I keep making the same mistakes. I rarely smile even tho I should. i forgot how to properly smile around people. I want to be me, not some overly friendly bitch that is hungry for the tips of the customers. I can't fucking do this anymore. I want to cut so bad and I can't stand the feeling anymore. My chest is so exposed because of my work clothes (I have to wear a dirndl as a 16 year old) and I feel sexualized. There has been a lot of people looking at my breasts when I was standing infront of them or I saw them starring when I was polishing glasses. I feel so uncomfortable. I feel like one of my bosses hate me and the other is just making fun of me for not knowing stuff that I wasn't shown in the first week. I feel so terrible and dumb. I feel like it's useless to continue my internship and my school. 

I should just give up. It's not like I've been not dissappointing everyone at this point. I feel like everyone hates me and my parents don't even want me to come home. I feel like nobody realized that I was gone. I feel like my mother doesn't fucking understand how much I'm doing. She always tells me that she has it way harder than I do, just because she's fucking older than me. She thinks it's fine to say that I'm not bullied because I don't know what real bullying is and that looking for a therapist is just a waste of money. She will never support me in any other way but work. She just wants me to work. She was the one telling me to spend my only week without work before school to go to work and help out at the restaurant I'm working at right now. I feel like she just thinks about money and herself. I can't handle it anymore. I feel like theres nothing else for me to do. 

I will never get more time to be a child. I will never get the time back I've spent crying and cutting myself. I will never get my friends back because I'm just a pathetic piece of shit. I'm too stupid and depressed to fucking have anyone to be friends with me. Everybody hates me. There were actually people telling me to finally kill myself because I was talking too much bullshit. And they were fucking serious about it. They were fucking serious about telling me to fucking kill myself. The thing that hurts even more that those words is the fact that I can get my hands on something for that to make it look like an accident. My parents would never know. No one will know. I could just fucking tell anyone a lie and they would believe me because no one gives a fuck. I should just do it at this point. What do I have to fucking lose. Nobody will ever believe in me. I will never believe in myself. 

**I'm pathetic for writing this. I'm such an attention seeker. This is all I do every. Single. Day. I tell people how bad I feel to make them think about me and be by my side, just to fucking throw them away because I feel better. AS SOON AS I THINK WE ARE FRIENDS I WILL ONLY VENT TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FRIEND AND THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR. I will never ask you to spend time with me because I always make up lies that I can't hang out. I will always come to you when i'm sad because the pick me over here has to act depressed to get friends. I will cut myself as a sign of attention seeking so everyone can tell me to seek for help but I will say 'I'm fine' and continue my life. I will ask you for advice that you can't give to me and I act depressed because I don't get it. I act heartbroken to you saying that you're not my friend because of the way I am and my ""mental health"" has effected me.** ***I hope that's what you wanted to hear my ""dear old friend"". That's what I've been thinking for ages. From the day on you've hurt me the most. You're the fucking reason that I self-harm. I just act like it's because of someone else. IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT.***

It's funny that everyone thinks I self-harm because I got bullied. They never thought of me self-harming because of an old friend of mine. She was sweet. She was so nice. She was a real angel. I did everything for her. I forced myself out of the house for her. I went to places with her because she knew I was struggling at home. Now it's all over. She will never talk to me again. She will never think of me the same way ever again. She will only see me as the depressed bitch. She will never know that it's her fault I started to self-harm. 

I just need someone. I want someone to love me. I want someone to appreciate me. I want someone that gives me the feeling that life isn't as bad as I think it is. I just want a simple hug that will mean something to me later in life. I will never get any of these things. And it's all my fault. I always drive everyone away. I annoy everyone. It's always my fault. Everything is my fault, even if it was to 3 percent my fault, still completely my fault."

My previous SWE internship had more of a vetting than this. On top of that they gave me a 2 hour time period to expect the phone call and they ended up being 10 mins late.

Red flag 3: The location on the contract seems to be legit, but they don't show on the map.

I don't know if I should give the company name, but the third question the person on the phone asked me is what my expectations for salary are. I said $50k because I just wanted to get a position.

I was pondering for months in what to do for my future and I thought in doing a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science through an online American college called ""University of the People"", to learn and earn with an internship and eventually work in job that don't require a lot of coding or without coding at all, like testing and analyst roles. The enrollment deadline is tomorrow but there are more chances in March and May.

At 20, I worked for the first time and for just 3,5 months, in the same company my father works, but my father convinced me to quit the job because he thought I wasn't happy at the job and in fact I wasn't.

In 2021 I got an associate degree in Game Design in a Brazilian College and I also made some courses in IT and Design fields. I know how to speak my native language, Spanish and English.

My objectives are with a degree are making money with a job that I like or at least I tolerate and invest my money with hobbies and in an Italian citizenship to be able to live in one of the European Union countries.

So, is making a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science worth it and I will be able to accomplish my objectives or I should work in something else?"

I was told that Most game studios usually just  hire cs majors for that type of job. Which is true. But does that mean there’s no hope for me?

I have a connection with a possible software engineer internship. Will this help at all?"

10juimx,1,2023-01-23,Get Certs or Wait?,JustBeHonestT,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10juimx/get_certs_or_wait/,"Hello all, I have been following this sub for awhile now and taking advice here and there as I pursue my CS degree for Cyber Security more specifically in the PCI DSS field/positions and also Technical Writing. I hope you all can help me make a decision based on what has happened. 

Recently as of two weeks ago, my wife got scammed and the scammers wiped out our $8k in savings, her checking account, maxed out our shared credit card and took out a $10k loan in her name all while we were in the process of moving during a very stressful time. This has caused me to change jobs to increase our income to get back on track with our savings and bill payments which I went from $14 an hour to $18 an hr. Down side, I have to travel extensively so I will not be home with my wife and child.

So I have deferred my college until August as it can all be done online, (I started last year in August so only did one semester), so that I can focus on the new job. With this I wish to make use of my time as much as I can so I ask should I study for the Comptia Certs (A+, Sec+, Net+, etc.) in the mean time while I am traveling? or should I not worry about such positions until I graduate? (Community College is at the level I am at with only one semester done.)

I have roughly 8 years of a mechanical background (This new job also being in the mechanic field) and looking to break into the CyberSec field. Only 26 so I know I have time but I would like to make the most of my time in the best way I can. Only asking because I have seen that the Cyber Sec field is more of a mid level to experienced level field so if me obtaining these certifications now is going to waste my time then I would rather wait until I get back on track, get back to college and apply for internships and get those certifications around that time close to graduating with my associates/during interning. Ideally, I would like to work this job for about a year and enter into the IT field as Help Desk or Support. I understand that it more than likely will not be at the same pay rate as I am/will be making but I have accounted for that for the experience as I am looking to be long term for Cyber Sec.

Please let me know what you all think. Ask questions if I need to clear any thing up and I will respond as quickly as I can. Thank you in advance."

I’m currently a junior at Georgetown University and am looking for advice as far as which opportunities to prioritize this summer.

I’m doing Georgetown’s BS/MS in Data Science and Analytics 5 year program, so I would still have my senior year of undergrad and one year of grad school remaining.

Currently my options that I’m pursuing:

1. Data Analyst Internship for Optum/UnitedHealth Group

Pros: 
Relevant industry experience

Close to home




2. Statistics/Data Science Summer Research Program at Carnegie Mellon

Pros:
Good for lots of data science connections- help with networking 

Sports focused- I’d love to eventually work in sports analytics if a good opportunity presented itself 





My eventual goal is to work in data analysis- either as a data analyst or scientist for a business (my undergrad majors are Finance and Business Analytics) or within sports (although I understand these roles are harder to come by)

Wondering which of these opportunities would look better on a resume for future employers and open more doors as I eventually start looking for a full time job post graduation"

Is this really the wave all companies will go about hiring devs across all domains in CS? I was really surprised at the difficulty of the questions. I was not expecting Leetcode-style questions from a medium-sized GAME DEV company.

Should I have been expecting some Leetcode hards from a game dev studio?

Also, Why does it seem like every company nowadays, even small startups are using extremely niche algorithm problems that take a chunk of your time to filter out candidates?"

The program is meant for engineering graduates who want to transfer into tech. My undergrad was in Electrical Engineering.

It's an intensive 12-month program with the last 4 months (summer) including a project students have to complete for an industry partner; a variety which you choose from on a first-come-first-serve basis. The project is referred to by the program, unofficially, to be ""like an internship"" - it's unpaid. The program states 60% of students get hired back where they did their internship project.

My question is:

For the purpose of finding a job after graduating, is it worth it to try and get an ""external"" internship outside this program? Most of which I'm eligible for are 4-months long (ex. Summer Intern Developer at XYZ tech company). This would prolong my degree by 2 semesters (which would be Sept '23 to May '24) ? During those 2 extra semesters, I would be doing the industry project to complete my degree. Would it make me much more hireable even though I'm giving up the opportunity to work during those prolonged 2 semesters?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: For the purpose of landing a full-time position: Is it worth doing two internships (one unpaid) before graduating at the sake of prolonging graduating by 8-12 months, being unpaid for those 8-12 months?

Thank you."
10jxhgm,4,2023-01-23,Medical School or Finance?,princeap576,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10jxhgm/medical_school_or_finance/,"I graduated from the University of Miami (I'm from California) with an Economics degree back in 2013 with hopes of landing a role in IB , which was quite a lofty goal coming from a non-target, but I was quite young and naive at age 23 and I thought that it was possible. At the time, I thought that with proper networking, I could potentially weasel my way through. Consequently, I thought that by completing as many internships as I possibly could, I'd manage to eventually land a full time role; however, my parents, at the time, were using me into medicine, and I gave in and listened to them.

To give you greater clarity into my situation, my timeline is as follows:

May 2013: I graduated from the University of Miami with a degree in Economics.

July 2013- August 2013: I attend a three week long course on financial modeling and valuation through the Investment Banking Institute in New York, as I had thought it would straighten my candidacy for a prospective role in IB/Management Consulting.

August 2013- December 2013: I approached an internship placement company- Dream Careers (now defunct for obvious reasons)- with hopes of the internship turning into a full time role; however, I turned out to be massively disappointed to find that I would eventually be cheated out of my money. Before I had made the payment of $7K, I was lured in by false promises of placement into a prestigious role as an analyst at Expand Research, a consulting firm; however, when I arrived to New York, I was dismayed to find that the role had already been filled and that I was placed into a securities firm that failed to provide me with adequate experience that I needed to progress in the finance industry, i.e. they did not sponsor me for the Series 7 exam.

December 2013: I returned back to L.A. and did an extensive search of finance firms with hopes of eventually landing an internship which I did at a boutique investment bank in Santa Monica.

April 2014-June 2014: I was forced to work 80 hour work weeks without pay all for the sake of networking myself into the finance world.

August 2014: My parents pressured me into medicine, so I eventually undertook a post-bar program at Columbia where I satisfied the requisite coursework for medical school. Two weeks into the program, I was robbed at gunpoint and I flew back to LA.

January 2015: I rejoined Columbia.

July 2017: I finished the program at Columbia.

July 2018: I sat the MCAT.

August 2020: I was accepted into Georgetown University School of Medicine, but didn't attend because my parents dissuaded me from joining, they kept using COVID and medical school debt as excuses to keep me from going, so I let the admission slip away from my hands. I know that I was a massive idiot for listening to my parents, and now I'm paying for it.

February 2022-August 2022: I completed the necessary coursework and passed the state exam to become a licensed real estate agent in the state of California, not that I think that it is a commendable feat, as anyone with a pulse can pass the exam.

January 2023: I find myself in a massive predicament, which I need to find a way out of because I cannot continue living my life like this. I have chalked out a timeline to keep as many doors of opportunity open so that if one shuts on my face, I'll have the other one open, which is as follows:

January 2023: I enroll in WSP FP&amp;A bootcamp and receive the certification by the end of February so that I can list that on my resume, although I really don't know what my prospects of landing an FP&amp;A role.

March 2023: After I've attend my WSP certificate, I register to sit the MCAT for May 2023. I figure that I could give medicine one last shot, and if it doesn't work out then at least I will know that it isn't for me. I purchase all the study material for MCAT and spend the next 3 months studying for the MCAT.

May 2023: I sit the MCAT and wait a month for my scores to come back.

Granted that I am readmitted into Georgetown University School of Medicine, do you think that becoming a doctor would even be a worthwhile investment in this day and age?

I’m a senior in college planning to apply to HBS and other deferred programs.

**About Me:**
- GPA: 3.65/4.00 at Top 3 public school
- Major: Computer Science (CSE)
- Internships: software developer internship at NASA (7 months), software developer internship at a small tech company (3 months), web developer internship at a small startup (3 months), investment analyst internship at small investment bank (current)
- Extracurriculars: leadership position in an on-campus investment club, leadership position for college publication, member of campus rocket club, former mentor of campus banking club, intramural soccer
- Demographics: Male, White
- Recommendations: 3 from NASA, 1 from college professor, could ask investment banking ceo for one (harvard college alum)
- Background: father works in medicine, mother is a homemaker

**Why I want an MBA?**
- I’d like to get more into areas like banking, private equity, and venture capital. I need a baseline to do these things and my CSE education hasn’t done this for me.

**Target Schools**
- HBS 2+2
- Stanford Deferment Program
- Wharton Advance Access Program
- Booth Scholars Program

College has been an experience. Constantly changing majors and struggling to figure out what I’m interested in. I’ve reached my last semester and I’ve found an interest in research psychology and occupational/physical therapy. I’ve been an intern for a rehab facility and a psychology lab so far. I’ve enjoyed them both.

Research Pros: more interesting, I love learning, my professors really motivated me.

Research cons: low pay, can get tired of being at a computer all day everyday, may be difficult to find job even with a masters

PT/OT pros: always moving, higher pay, always around new people

PT/OT cons: burnout, may be more difficult to change career in future, patients may be difficult at times

These are at least some of the pros and cons I can think of for each career path. Any jobs or careers where I can do a little bit of both? I’m really conflicted and feel like I will make a mistake. I’m applying to a research psychology master program right now. I’ve pretty much gotten a 4.0 for all of my psych coursework and my professors are really pushing me to pursue research."

Currently, I'm learning full stack web development in Javascript through The Odin Project, as I would like to become a backend web developer and for work I own a handyman business.

Skills: Python: 5 years, .NET Framework (VB and C#): 2 years, SQL: 1 year, Javascript: Less than 1 year, Django: Less than 1 year

Libraries: (multiprocessing, websockets, requests, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, selenium, beautifulsoup, ta)

Degrees: Bachelor: Information Systems; Associate: General Business

Languages: English: Fluent; Spanish: Conversational; Japanese: Beginner (Can read kana/hiragana and understand only 200 words. Worse than N5 but it's something at least)

Location: United States -&gt; Japan

Experience:

2017-2018: After college in 2017, I worked for 8 months as an IT intern in business operations for a large hospital and I did not enjoy acting as the business liaison/interface of IT. My internship was only 3 months, but my company extended it (due to bolstering high turnover ratio as we had 6/12 people quit in a 5 month period).

2018-Present: My father owned his own handyman business (which I grew up working with him in), so I soon started my own business in a separate area and designed a simple WordPress website that allowed my customers to pay through WooCommerce, contact me, and view my services I offer: (gutter cleaning, pressure washing, etc.).

I'm at a Paiza JP 'A' level.

Desired Industry: Web Development

Conclusion: Japan has an underemployed IT and construction industry and I have applied for roughly 100-200 IT jobs, all being rejections, except for one interview where the job description said ""no Japanese required"", yet the interview ended up being in Japanese and we could barely understand each other. The following were the reasons of my rejections:

50%: I don't live in Japan, 20%: Japanese level is too low, 20%: No reason, 10%: Skills aren't good enough for position.

I am so desperate for experience that I've seen posts on Craigslist Japan asking for small web design projects, and I offer to do it for free just so I can put it on my resume. I feel jobs other than teaching jobs would be ideal for me. I would love to start off in an entry level web developer (back end) role, but I've also applied for some construction jobs.

Thank you in advance for any advice."

Hi fellas. I feel like this question needs some context so here it goes: I’m a political science student at a pretty top university who took a couple of cs classes (think Python + Data Structures/Algorithms) and immediately fell in love with programming. The classes I’ve taken have very little to do with web development or software engineering per se so I’ve also been teaching myself React+Django for several months now as well as taking a few web development small gigs. Now I’ve finally come to the point where I feel comfortable asking about next steps. The thing is, the more traditional path to get a foot in the door is an internship, but getting a legit internship for software engineering sounds kinda impossible for a guy doing Political Science/Econ as his majors, so I don’t know if instead I should pursue more freelancer gigs and build a solid portfolio that then I can use to apply for junior positions. 
I have currently secured an internship in consulting at a Big4 firm (won’t say the name but starts with a P) for this upcoming summer, and I know they also do IT consulting, so I was also wondering if this is an option worth exploring. If anyone’s done IT consulting at big4 companies, what’s up with these jobs anyways? Not a lot of info online.

Sincerely yours,"

I am a recent graduate of a degree in BSc software engineering (After doing a higher certificate in software development). I graduated with a total average of 90%+. During my studies I have done around 2 years worth of part time (between 4 and 6 hours per day) work and worked with a massive variety of languages and technologies. I worked both as a full stack intern and a linux specialised software engineer. During my school years I have several other achievements such as playing professional chess and have been 2nd in my country for Jiu jitsu and 3rd in my country for light contact MMA for more than 5 years. I never stopped working even since I was a child and have been building my achievements with the goal of moving to greener pastures.   


While saying this I feel like I should be one of the best candidates in this underpopulated market. I'm currently working in my country (where I am grossly underpaid, even for the standards of my country) and only getting around the equivalent of $700 a month (pre tax). I can't afford refilling my car, studying for my part time honours degree in computing and I am still living in my parents' house. I am looking to leave my country yesterday as there is so much political unrest, corruption and loss of economy in my third world country.   


I am replying to every single open Entry Level job I can find on LinkedIn and I am not even getting a single response, phone call or email. Why am I not getting an interview, let alone a job? I have been looking for over 2 months now and have submitted to more than 100 open positions. I feel so demoralised and useless. I just want to get a job and move to Canada or the EU where I can start to live a life. I'm working 12 hours a day on average and I am not seeing any progress since the past few years.  


I would love to work remotely for a year (I am literally at the point where I would go completely nocturnal to fit the corresponding time zones) and then move once I have some form of financial security. Any advice on what I can do to be recognised internationally? Are there any international recruitment companies that can land me a job? Any help would be appreciated. I am so desperate."

To give some background, I am still in college (I'll be graduating March next year, unless I take a leave of absence). Until very recently I've been focusing on Philosophy as my main subject, but as the realization that I'll eventually be joining the real world sunk in, I did some thinking and decided I want to do programming (I took a programming course and it was the most fun I ever had; decided to teach myself some Python, and it's been really fun overall too). I love the feeling of having a concrete problem to solve with clear conditions for success and failure, with immediate feedback in case I do something wrong. (I hear the pay is also good, which is nice too.)

Problem: I've only recently started learning about programming and the IT world. I have no mental image of what the industry looks like, what kind of jobs there are, no experience compared to students whose main subject is IT, no internship experience, and 0 qualifications. My previous work experience is completely unrelated. I am having a great deal of trouble making a competitive CV for any internships or jobs. 

Ideally, I want to start working in the field right out of college, but the more research I do, the more overwhelmed I feel by this ever-expanding checklist of things I need to do. Certifications, internships, upskilling, etc.

So, where do I start? I hear that helpdesk is the way that beginners with no experience start in IT, so my current plan is to find helpdesk work while working on certs on the side (I hear Comptia A+ is where one should begin, and I imagine I'll also keep building my skill in Python.) Is this a good plan?

i never got proper training for my job .. but starting as an intern helped. my manager doesnt work in my state as we are all spread out and work hybrid. i had imposter syndrome for the longest, and I convinced myself maybe its not me.. its them haha. i have to constantly beg my manager for work for i do not have a enough sometimes to last me the day or week. its very rare i get fulfilling task. we are billable so i have to put my time somewhere and when i dont have billable work i obv charge to the company and my manager and all the higher ups hate it, but they also want you to be conservative with billing clients? but if i have nothing to do it gets a little gray. i have asked several times what should i be doing when i run out of work and my manager beats around the bush and never gives me a clear answer. 

the job always wants us to be 60/40 .. but my office is so depressing we do 20/80 on a good week.. the work culture in my home office is very forced and no one seems to have anything in common. its very strange. 

everyone is nice at the job but i feel it may be time to look elsewhere. is that bad? i have only been at this job for a year. i dont see myself here long term and know its not my passion. it seemed more as a stepping stone.. i am in my early 20s and want a job that i feel like i have SOME impact in. i am new to the job and industry and i am the youngest at the company (company has around 600 people) this job makes me feel like a last resort (maybe because i am new? or dont do the work as they imagined?) there are other new people in my dept that have also mentioned its hard to get information and support at this company despite them being all about work ethic, comfortability and teamwork.

10k8mg4,2,2023-01-24,Difficult Choice Between Old Dreams &amp; New Ones,scottyprovolone,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10k8mg4/difficult_choice_between_old_dreams_new_ones/,"Warning- this is a LONG one, because the backstory is impacting how I'm looking at this.

My husband and I have been married four years, and have known one another for six. When we met, we were both religious, and left religion a little over a year ago.

When we were first married, we shared a dream to have at least 2-3 kids eventually, and about 7-8 months in, call us overzealous, but we started trying. 2019 passed by with no luck, and 2020 was especially painful because many people I knew were getting pregnant and it wasn't happening for us, at the end of the year in 2020, we found out I was pregnant, but I miscarried about a week later and was absolutely devastated. 

In 2021, my husband started PA school (a rigorous 2 year medical program), and we moved out of state to another place. He is due to graduate this year in June 2023- the program was incredibly expensive, and we've incurred a lot of student debt that is going to start accruing later this year according to the Biden Administration.

Fast Forward to November 2022, I'd been out of town for a few months, and had come back to uncover some heavy secrets that my husband had been keeping from me our whole marriage. Smaller events prior to this had happened that had injured my trust in him, but it had always been more or less easily repairable. But this was devastating information to me, and as someone that has trust issues - I found myself wondering if I really knew who he was and it decimated the foundation of our relationship. 

 I decided I needed to see a counselor to process things. He told me he'd work on it, but since then, I've caught him lying to me again twice. It's not so much what he's done as it is that he's lied to me. That is a core value of mine and a boundary that I have set.  
I love him, it's a habit that will time to break, and this is a foundation that we are currently working on rebuilding, but things are, understandably, shaky right now. 

  
But in January 2023, I recently found out that I was pregnant, and this one seems to be sticking. When I found out, I was angry and not excited. In the past few years, I've moved on- and it was a slow process of acceptance, but eventually I came to see it as a good thing, because then we could travel, and do all kinds of things that I'd always dreamed of, kids are a lot of work etc, and when I saw that positive, all of that felt like it was slipping away. 

I majored in international relations in college, and had the opportunity to live in Germany for several months, which sparked a lifelong obsession with traveling and anthropology. When we were first married, I had the opportunity to return to Germany and complete an internship, but being newly married and being members of a patriarchy based church-- my husband said no. This is something that he now regrets, but we both know that he held me back, and have talked about it a few times. Since we have been married, I have been the dutiful wife and have always put his dreams first- I left an internationally networked job that I loved to move and be with him, and I prioritized paying off his undergraduate loans during the pandemic, and even after he finishes school, we were planning on throwing money at his student loan so it doesn't follow us all the way to retirement.

Now that I'm pregnant, all of the things I was looking forward to at the end of his schooling would be taken away. The moment it was finally going to be ""my turn""- this happens. We'd be relocating to a new area with a heavy outdoors scene and a good airport, so I thought I'd have the opportunity to make new friends, do lots of hiking, and take a few trips here or there. With a new baby, everything seems more dismal. Going anywhere with a child is an event, people our age aren't having many children, especially if they're not religious. So for me, it'd be very difficult to make friends and very isolating. My husband would just be starting work, so he'd be working long hours (12 hour days +), and I have no family in the area, so I would be caring for the kid pretty much 110% on my own. 

The area is an expensive one, but with two incomes, it'd be pretty easy to pay off the loan and pay rent and living expenses, savings and a little bit for fun. But with a baby and no second income, we'd be starting off behind, and from my estimates, we would be able to make the minimum payment + a few dollars on the loan, pay for baby expenses and essentially be on the road to having his loan paid off in 20 years, maybe have a stateside vacation every other year or so... and the thought of having a baby right now is a conflicting one.

Both sides of our families want us to give them grandbabies and would NOT be supportive if I had an abortion (both on principle, and because they want grandkids), so we wouldn't be able to share that info with them, and since we accidentally got pregnant after 3 years of infertility- what if this is our only chance?? And I know parenthood has its own rewards and would be wonderful in its own way- but it requires 110% commitment. 

But on the other hand-- I know that I'd have to put off my dreams of traveling for a long time, and maybe even permanently, depending on what life throws at us next. My husband wants the baby, since he's always wanted to be a father, and I DO want to be a mom...but not right now, and I'm being accused of being selfish. I can either get the abortion and lose the chance of us having our only biological child, possibly have my husband resent me even though he says he won't, and a lifelong secret from our families but keep my dreams OR... I could have at least one biological child, more or less give up my autonomy and any dreams I ever had of being able to spend going across the US in a van, or backpacking through Europe/Asia.

Right now, I think I should get an abortion because of the general outlook of things right now, but I am starting to waver because the fear of regret is hitting me REALLY HARD.

  
Any advice/opinions would be much appreciated."

I’m currently changed from cooking into hopefully getting into tech. I’m about to land my second AWS certification for the solutions architect associate and then soon after I will be running towards the professional certification. 

My question is this, I’m currently trying to head to school and land a job. Problem is, that I’m currently living abroad in South America and it’s been extremely difficult to start school down here. It’s it feasible to land an internship or job with just certifications if I do some projects on my own to show I want to learn? And if I decide just to continue to get more advance certs like the CISSP right after my professional can i expect to be able to work my way up to a six figure salary somewhere once I have the required experience and skills without a degree?"

(The role requirements state that programming experience isn't compulsory, but is preferred.)

However, after doing the pre-interview assessment and getting my results back, I found that I significantly underperformed in the pre-interview coding tests, due to the fact that I was given a test based on the figure for the number of programming hours I had, which I now realise I greatly overestimated. I was still offered a screening interview due to my performance in the other tests, and if I get a second interview, it'll be a technical round where I'm given a coding problem and asked to solve it.

My worry is that this technical round will be too difficult for me due to my overestimation, and result in me performing poorly. Would it be inappropriate to email them to make sure the test is appropriate for my level and clarify my programming experience, or do I just accept my mistake and try my best?"

I'm currently a software engineering intern with Collins Aerospace, who is a part of Raytheon. I have been doing an internship with them in Phoenix, however they extended me to remote part time earning about $30/hour. However, I don't really do much and the work I do really isn't all that interesting and I don't see myself moving back to Phoenix once I graduate.

I recently got an internship offer from Northrop Grumman for an embedded software engineer position over the summer. This one is full time and in person, and the commute is roughly 60 miles one way however I can probably crash at a friends house some days. The work seems very interesting and I feel like having the experience there would be a huge boost to my job prospects as a graduate. They will also sponsor a security clearance for me. The pay is lower at $24/hour, however this is in Florida and I can probably negotiate up to $26/hour.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else has been in a situation like this, and if so, what did you end up doing?"

I start next month and am already dreading it (11 hours a day  6 day a week). The entire placement procedure left a bitter taste in my mouth, 90 % of the companies I couldn't sit because of my CGPA(my own fault not denying that). For the 10% of those which I could sit I couldn't clear first round because all of them are online and I didn't have a group to write them with(not very social, good looking or female).

Now I have applied to over 50 jobs (I know not that many) but I only heard back from 2 which both offered the exact same salary just in much more expensive cities.

My question is:

Should I keep preparing for interviews, grind that leet code, revise CS fundamentals,  and hope I'd have better luck once these hiring freezes and these mass firings ends(who even knows when that would be? pessimists say 2 years)

10kn6at,2,2023-01-24,Advice for switching specialty area,Vivid-Courage-2780,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/10kn6at/advice_for_switching_specialty_area/,"Hi everyone! I’m looking for some advice on the best way to ethically switch my area of specialty. I’m going to try to keep details as vague as possible since my specialty area is pretty small in terms of counselors who practice it.

I completed my masters in counseling in 2020, and in my program I specialized in career counseling. I still completed all of the counseling classes, practicum, etc. My internship was working with primarily career counseling clients, where there was overlapping mental health and career elements to the work and I was supervised by a counselor.

After graduating, I realized that one of the few places that career counselors can work is in university career centers. I quickly learned that counseling is not supported at all in these spaces (or rarely is, depending on where you are). 

I attempted to set up a private practice to work towards hours for licensure, but struggled because I was a SAHM at the time and didn’t have help with childcare to do sessions. I interviewed with a group private practice, and they essentially told me that I wasn’t a real counselor and would need to start from scratch, despite having my provisional license. 

I decided to go to the corporate world in a totally different field for a while to make some money, and it’s given me the space to think about my counselor identity. I think due to the barriers I faced it soured me on the career specialization, and while I know career is a part of the person/client, I don’t desire to continue specializing in this area. 

I’m looking into post masters certificate programs for mental health counseling to add to my education, and potentially trying again with a different group practice or starting a small private practice on the side beyond my corporate job and finding a good supervisor. 

I’d like some advice to know that I’m not doing something wrong or unethical by going about it this way. Since I’ve gotten my degree I’ve really felt like I’m not a “real” counselor and it’s messed with me quite a bit, even though I have my provisional license and my specialization is not very different from any other specialization area. 

Any advice is appreciated!"

Finishing up my final semester in university. Secured a bulge bracket banking internship during my final summer and eventually worked hard enough for them to want me bank after graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why am I posting?**

I am thankful to have found my way out from my rebellious teenage years and would like to contribute to the community in ways that I can. I might not be able to offer much right now but hopefully I am able to share my experiences to motivate current people that need it or, offer my two cents to students who got lost and are finding a way back.

**Side note:**

Did not come from wealth, landed the internships without any form of family ties/connections. Really humble family background, was financially assisted from primary school."

10knm7g,1,2023-01-24,"I’m at an impasse, and about to bail altogether. My manager is 10 years younger than me, and only gives visible projects to those under his age.",Competitive_Classic9,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10knm7g/im_at_an_impasse_and_about_to_bail_altogether_my/,"I’m 40.  My Director is 10 years younger than me, and my last was 10 years older.  

I’m at a good place in my career.  Im “ok” with where I’m at, but think I should be further along based on experience and leadership.  The problem is, I keep finding myself in positions where I’m swimming upstream, in a “right place, wrong time” situation.  

My current position, my Director was promoted soon after I joined.  He has less overall experience, but more company wide experience, and is a good fit, and I’m wholly supportive.  That’s not the issue.  The issue is that he keeps assigning the innovative and visible projects to junior team members, including interns that aren’t even going to be joining us long-term.  

I’ve expressed (since interviewing) that this is the exact things I’d like to be involved with, and have experience leading projects in.  I’m wholly stoked to bring junior members along, and am open to feedback (and absolute credit, support, and implementation) if they have better input.  On the flip side, they haven’t actually brought anything new to the table, as far as new technology or skills.  Don’t get me wrong, they’re absolute assets, super capable and intelligent, but there’s no particular software or methods they’ve brought that would make the decision to implement them as process initiators that makes sense.  

My issue is that my manager is only offering these projects to the junior associates.  They are pulled into meetings to collaborate and brainstorm, and pulled into projects that will have direct visibility to upper leadership.  Myself and the other “senior” members on the team are expected to test, tie and “break” the implementations, except we’re only privy to the changes after they’ve already been built.  Honestly if I’m being honest, some of these things, I could’ve built out by now, taught to the junior members, and ran tests in.  I also would’ve reached out to various teams to determine this is even optimal, and not dated processes.  

My last role fell into this as well.  Again, the more “senior” member were tasked to “test” the systems, not to contribute.  When I took matters into my own hands and rewrote processes, I got a lot of pushback, but ultimately some recognition when I implemented it, but the result of my efforts still went to another team (although I did get my direct managers to fight for r cognition in my annual rewards).  

I’m honestly sick of this.  I’ve been vocal, but it seems arbitrary (or maybe biased) as to whom is deemed capable of innovating processes.  If we all were involved as a team, or if there was actual merit involved behind he decision for these projects, I’d be all about it.  I’m honestly not even pushing for recognition, I’d be completely stoked to just be a part of saying I contributed.  But at the same time, I’m tired of having nothing to show for leadership roles bc my title doesn’t reflect the projects and implementation I’ve managed, and Im not getting the opportunity for more leadership roles, bc somehow people are not hearing me when I say I’ve pulled entire teams along, bc I don’t have a “manager” or “Director” title.  

I don’t know how to navigate this.  Im currently at a good spot, but don’t want to “waste” too much time to end up in the same position.  I’m actually ok in this title for a while, but I need change mgmt and leadership opportunities (and reflected title) to be able to progress my career.  I’m really getting discouraged, bc I keep seeing people hit the right positions at the right time, and they have significant less experience, and quite frankly, they’re not even particularly personable or intelligent, so I don’t get it.  

I work in a MCOL city, but all of this makes me consider taking a step back.  I want to be “successful” but it all seems arbitrary and random at times, and I seem to be hitting everything with “mediocracy”, yet the effort out in isn’t worth it."
10knt2r,7,2023-01-24,Offered internship today!,reefer_madnessss,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/10knt2r/offered_internship_today/,"I recently finished the trifecta early this month and immediately started filling out job applications for anything that remotely related to IT in any field like help desk, networking, or entry level security. I applied to exactly 23 jobs , 4 looked at my resume. 1 reached out for an interview. I matched every single criteria they were asking for but one ... Dreaded  Work experience. Instead of letting it defeat me I confronted the obstacle and asked if they had any internships or other positions available that would allow me to transition into this position or one like it in the future as I develop further into my career with cyber security. They offered me an internship with evaluation after 90 days for employment. It was my first interview for a position outside of a retail or restaurant environment. Over all I am super excited.

The certifications got me the interview no doubt about that ! But they did not secure me any position by themselves. What did impress them was my willingness to be upfront and honest with them and further invest in my development to prove myself in the capacity that is needed.

TLDR: Certs will get you the opportunity. Its up to you to seal the deal and fit the rest of the criteria they are looking for."

Coming from a small town, I had to move to Memphis to find audio-related intern opportunities. I found a studio who could give me hours and got paperwork approved between them and my school. However, it’s been a slow month for the studio and I’m worried I may not get all my 120 hours I need by April. Should I consider finding another internship opportunity?"

I have a degree for networking and security but the person in charge of that section doesn't really like me or like anyone from the helpdesk so I can't join his projects yet. My manager said in the future they want to get a company to build a helpdesk chat bot for internal employees. I was experimenting and built a basic decision tree bot but I don't know if it's worth showing. Our company outsources the coding to India and it can only give instructions on how to reset your password and 2 other simple common internal problems we get in the helpdesk.

Is there anyone with similar or close to my gpa who managed to enter ntu scbe?  Im aware that I have other options like SIT but I desire to go to NTU and would like to try that first. Not really sure how to approach this cause I still have NS which means I have more chances to apply.

I just heard back from a couple of former classmates who are doing really well for themselves. One is currently going to Alaska working as a lineman nailing six figure salary from high school, another is doing real estate investment and so far seem to be doing well, another has enlisted in the military (USAF, stationed in Yokota Air Base) and urging me to join him after. 

And meanwhile there's the CS students who are all trying to do the next best leetcode, the next best projects, the next best grades, and then just to be told that they either sucks, didn't get the memos that getting 5+ internships is key, or making barely enough to live in the HCOL they're in to the point where they're exhausted. 

At what point do I just not take it anymore? Oh, because somehow I'm lucky in the prospect that I get to make six figure salary at minimum starting off, living in overpriced apartments, going to the office every single day, and being at risk for layoffs when times get hard which will put healthcare, stable income, lifestyle, etc. out and into the street? 

If I had known that this was coming, I would have never done it. I would have never been to an institution that seemingly does nothing except serve as an antiquated place in society, and not only that, but to major in something just because I liked being around computers. I should have done my research and went for a more stable lifestyle, instead of chasing the bags when the bags is already about to burst. 

I don't know what I'm going to do after I graduate in a year. I think I will go ahead and try to apply to around more security posts, as I'm already doing that on the weekends (maybe go armed for extra $$$), and then just live with my parents and take care of them, or at the very least find a cheap apartments near one of the places I work at.

I've also been interested in IT and Computer Engineering, but Computer Science is more exciting. The primary purpose of my doing this is to relate some of the classes my University offers to the careers I am told about here. I have multiple options now, so I can narrow it down by doing this as well.

I love coding; I find it fun to sit there and struggle with a coding problem because that dopamine hit after I figure out the problem is incredible. I am also interested in AI, but that's mostly because I had a robotics class in 8th grade where we programmed Lego robots to do specific tasks. If there's an adult version, please inform me IMMEDIATELY because that would be my dream job. Not only that, but I've begone to notice many of the video games I play to focus on optimization and automation. With that in mind, I'd love a career in AI. Still, I am trying to figure out what that even means, so I'm asking for specific AI/automation/optimization subfields that I could begin to pursue. I'd love to have an internship somewhere in the future, so I better figure out what exactly I want to do now so I can know where to get internships at :).

As stated previously, the IT career path also piqued my interest because I love learning about and exploring computers. Not only that, but my University offers Computer Hardware/Software installation, config, and support classes, which I know for a fact I will love as long as my professor is good at the course. Concurrently, Computer Engineering has become an interest because it is fascinating how people can know so much about the CPUs, GPUs, and other PC parts. I am curious if I'd get that with a degree like Computer Engineering, but that's what I'm here to figure out. I like coding too much to go with just Computer Engineering or IT; I could minor in one of those if my University offers it, but I don't think I could change my major to either. However, if there is a job out there that I would love, and it would benefit me to major in one or two things or even minor in multiple items, I would be open to hearing about it."

I'm a french student in engineering, and the OMSCS program aroused my curiosity.  
I'd like to apply for Spring 2024 but my academic history is quite special and as I said in the title, **i'm quite afraid about my two first post-secondary years**.

To put it simply, I grew up in France and I have always wanted to study engineering (especially in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science) since my childhood. 

I started by following the ""[preparatory classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles)"" which is an intensive undergraduate program that leads students to integrate a French engineering school. Note that no diploma is awarded at the end of this first cycle (2 years). At the end of the 4 semesters, I ended up with 10.9 ; 11 ; 12 ; 14.8 of overall GPA (/20).

Then I joined my school to specialize in applied mathematics (Data Science option) and prepare for the ""[Diplôme d'Ingénieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur)"" (graduate program which lasts 3 years just after completing the first cycle). I ended up with approximatively more than 14.5/20 of overall GPA during the two first years, and I'm currently aiming for the same kind of grades this year.

I have no fear regarding the fulfillment of the academic requirements since the degree in progress is recognized as master's level in France/Europe (+ GTech mentions it [here](https://grad.gatech.edu/admissions/international/country-specific-requirements#f)). But I'm a little terrified when it comes to taking a look at the grades of my preparatory cycle. 

**Can bad grades during this first cycle reduce my chances of admission? Or will GTech ignore this first cycle to prioritize the grades obtained for the engineer's degree ?** 

\+++

In addition, I already have some experience such as internships as a Web Developer, Data Analyst and I am currently on an apprenticeship contract with a company for the position of Data Scientist.

**Can such experiences make up for this ""bad"" first cycle?**

\_\_\_

Note : I made use of several sites like [WES](https://applications.wes.org/country-resources/resources.asp), [IEE](https://myiee.org/gpa-calculator) to get an idea of ​​the US GPA score, my first cycle GPA is near/less than 3.0, and engineering cycle GPA is near 3.6"

In Australia, we don't receive a PhD ""in Data Science"" or ""in Statistics"". Instead, we are just conferred a PhD under the faculty that our supervisors are in. My PhD will be developing deep learning models for musculoskeletal MRI analysis; this is linked to the medical school with some external supervisors in biomedical engineering fields. 

When listing this on a CV, should I put:

 ""PhD - Faculty of Medicine and Health

Or should I add some tags like ""PhD - Faculty of Medicine and Health | Computer Vision, Medical Imaging""

Before i continue i need to mention that i live in Egypt.


Anyway, so I graduated with a specialisation in AI but I honestly didn’t like it, i started applying for local generic software engineer roles that i assumed would take fresh grads but no dice, so I thought to myself remote work is more competitive i need to improve my skills. 

At that time i got accepted to a government scholarship program akin to a bootcamp for full stack development, i was told by my peers that this program was well regarded and would set me apart and provide me with good skills.

After finishing that program, i started making personal projects to learn and flesh out a portfolio  and started applying to any remote web dev jobs and i am still not getting even interviews.

So i am starting to think that having a remote job without experience on you resume especially when you live in a shithole is impossible.

She built an internally-used application that is just a mess. I'm not sure how it passed the initial code review process (which I wasn't a part of). 2 months after she joined I'm tasked with adding a new feature to the application. I end up spending a week on the new feature (when it was slated to be completed in two), only to find that my ability to 'plug' my feature into the existing code is hampered by the total mess that she wrote. 

Honestly, an intern can write better code (and she's a senior). Basic features were sloppily implemented, like logging. All computers that ran internal application would log to the same log file! Given that only one computer can gain write-access to a file at a time, logs from other computers just failed. Every corner I looked past there was another piece of slop for me to clean up. I feel like she shat on a plate and is enjoying watching me 'clean it up'. 

I wrote a massive document of all the changes I needed to make justifying them (since they were extensive). He read it and left some questions which I addressed. Is there any more I should be doing? Beyond the technical document I submitting justifying my changes, should I bring up my frustration about this project to my manager?"

A company has posted a full-time, mid-senior level job with a range of $69k-119k. I’ve looked at the job description and quite honestly, it’s similar to my current role with the only difference of more money being offered. I’d like to try and apply and shoot my shot at possibly getting a 6-figure job.

How do I justify that I am worth paying 6-figures?

For reference: this is a corporate communications position and their only qualification is a BA in Communications (which I have). Minimum experience of 1-3 years (since graduating I have 2 year’s experience; 3 years undergrad of relevant experience thru internships)

I’ve researched the salary average for this position and it’s around $45-64k which is outside of the range provided by the job. I’m currently being paid $55k and I’d love to really push for $100k if not the $119k.

I basically tick every box in the experience and skills they’re looking for in a candidate. 

Thank you for any helpful advice!"

Which to an extent is a good thing: it makes me exhaust all avenues before messaging my mentor.

10l584e,1,2023-01-25,Masters degree or job,RandomSonzai,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10l584e/masters_degree_or_job/,"I am currently pursuing my undergrad in Electronics. However I soon came to the realization that it's not my cup of tea, the result being consistently poor grades (probably &lt;2.5/4 by the American 4 point system). But recently, after completing my internship where my work was in UI developement, I became mildly curious about UI/UX dev. I had also developed quite a considerable amount of curiosity in making content using Blender3D and the Unity game engine (just a noob tho) in the year before.

So when I came across the curriculum for the post grad course in Human Computer Interaction at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I was interested in pursuing this since it seemed to have elements of all the fields that I'm curious about. So I decided to maybe apply to Georgia Tech, RIT and a couple of others.

But I am still confused as to whether I want to pursue further studies as my undergrad studies have me exhausted and burnt out making I feel that I might not be able to keep up. I just don't want my post grad to be a repetition of my undergrad which makes my head hurt quite literally every waking moment in a day. Having spent a considerable amount of money just to pursue an undergrad degree which I have not imterest in feels like a waste of money to me, furthermore if I decide to pursue a post grad which is a lot more expensive and would require me to take up a loan would just add to the stress if I ended up regretting taking up the postgrad course I had chosen resulting in a huge financial burden for me. 

The exhaustion is also affecting my mindset for job hunting (it's currently placement season) making me feel like it would be better to take a year off just lazing around in bed. But in the eyes of society, it's looked down upon.

The deadlines are coming up soon and I haven't prepared for either the job hunt or the post grad applications. 

Any advice is much appreciated...

This may not be the correct sub but I don't think this post goes against the READ ME guidelines. If it does, then I apologize and take this post down.

Currently I am at a no name local college getting my Bachelor's in IT. I am in the second half of my junior year and so far through some of the course work I have done, it seems like half of my classes have been focused on introduction to programming in different language (Python, C, and currently taking JS/HTML/CSS) and ""hardware side"" of technology (like networks, servers, etc.) as well. Personally, I am more interested in the programming side as I find it the coolest and most rewarding. 

I have been doing some reading around and apparently a BS in IT is not good if you want to get into some web development, which is something I have been thinking about more recently. In my most recent class, we have been getting into JS/HTML/CSS data structures and this is the most interesting course I have taken so far. Being able to create a functional web page and seeing the magic that goes on behind the scenes is incredible, and I have only begun touching the basics. 

But, it seems like I might be screwed. IT IS TOO LATE for me to switch to a CS major as I would have to transfer schools, which means more expenses and losing credits. This is not an option for me, so I am set on just finishing my BS:IT as I have about a year left. I have already transferred once before and accumulated and insurmountable of debt at my FIRST private uni after high school, so I had to go to my local community college after getting kicked out of their (long dark era of my life, was originally in school to be a pilot).

\*\*My question really is, what would be my next steps if I wanted to go into programming for web development? Is it possible to get a programming entry level position with a BS:IT?\*\* It seems like this degree is highly looked down upon in the programming community according to some of my research online. I have no desire to work for a giant company like say, the Googles and Apples, but for example: I can see myself at a smaller company working on creating web pages for clients that don't have the technical expertise to do it themselves. 

Would going to a coding bootcamp after getting my BS:IT be a good option? Or getting a masters in CS? If I go to a coding bootcamp after I graduate for a couple months, I think it would be easier, as I already have programming experience through my BS:IT. It would make the course work more like a refresher for me. 

Currently I also have been working at my local GeekSquad/BestBuy for a year. I have 4 years of customer service experience under my belt. I have been looking for entry level help desk positions or programming positions, but they all want tons of experience and certifications for what seems entry level jobs that don't pay well anyways. I have been wanting to find ways to get a job that can give me some hands-on experience, but it seems impossible. I know internships are one way, but I don't think my college offers any, especially not in the programming field. 

Or maybe, this is all way over my head, and I am wrong on my perception on how to get a position in the programming field.

In my country we have internships for every semester (I’m a nurse student) and this time I’ve been on a children’s specialty at the hospital. 
It’s been the worst internship ever. 
I have been sick for a year while I’ve been diagnosed with adhd, and I told them that. After I’ve been honest I have been looked at differently. 
I’ve been over talked, not heard or seen as a future employee.
I feel like I’ve done everything wrong, and I am still getting treated badly. Im talked harshly too and I can’t do it. 
Im scared of my guidance counsellor (who hasn’t been there) and the head nurse (that have only heard stories that other people have told about me). I’m scared of my colleagues and I’m scared I can’t do anything right. 
This semester I’m in now, it’s the hardest in the entire education and I don’t have the confidence to do anything on my own because of all off this. 
I’ve been told I have to hold my personality back, because it’s not a good idea to stand out.

I hate this and I wish to never act like this to anyone.

I'm on a good level in Python, and have built several simple projects with gjango, have good knowledge of CRUD, templates, DB, views and other basic functionalities of Django. Almost completed Django course on Udemy where we build e-commerce website with all necessary functionality. 

Secondly, I'm not a Canada's resident/citizen. But I consider immigration to Canada soon, I also have open work permit for three years with prolongation opportunity.


So, my question are next:
1: is there any chances I can land my first job as an intern/junior in near future? (Is my skillset enough for it and etc)
2: what would you recommend to do to increase my chances?
3: I've been applying for a lot of positions all around Canada, including internships, junior level positions etc. (I've read a lot of articles with general questions for Django juniors and I can answer almost all of them, so I thought:  why wouldn't i try applying? But got around 10 rejections and other part of companies didn't even reply). Is it possible that my current education or the fact that I'm not in Canada rn be the problem or I just have poor CV and should also work on my GitHub more? 

Sorry for a lot of text and some mistakes, I'm just excited about moving to Canada and really interested into landing my first job there, especially now with layoffs and other market problems. Thank you for your time."

This fall I will be transferring to UMBC to finish off my degree but have been met with a new decision to make. Ive heard from many and the school itself that UMBC offers an accredited Social Work degree that will license you by the end of the bachelors and can put you straight into their SW Master's program that will only take 1 year to complete. It also requires a built in internship to gain experience before graduating.

This all sounds great but what I want to do is therapy. While I can start practicing much earlier with a LCSW, I am afraid to go that route when I've heard numerous disadvantages when it comes to knowledge on how to treat patients.

The pro's of SW also ensure more job opportunities and a versatile career path. But is it really that hard to find work as an LPC/LCPC?

My goal as a therapist it to work with trauma patients and/or crisis intervention but I would like to gain experience with more mild mental health cases as well.

For awhile Ive been planning to do a BS in psych, and a Masters in Clinical Psych. However I'm also reevaluating that as I may switch to a BA psych and a Masters in Counseling.

If anyone could please offer some insight to help me make a better informed decision with the pros and cons, as well as actual experience and possible regrets, I'd really appreciate it!"

I am 33 and after graduating high school in 2008, I went to a university in a traditional manner studying Theatre. I dropped out after earning about 55 credits. Naturally many of these credits were basically useless toward an I.T. degree so I knew it would be almost like starting over and I still have about 2 years left before I graduate.  


 In the past year I have truly gained so much more knowledge of the field but have yet to secure even a basic entry level Helpdesk job. I am not an expert in anything but I do feel I have at least gained the understanding and ability to perform a job like this. I was even able to secure an unpaid, virtual internship for a program supporting a department within the US Federal Government. I have a good foundation of skills that include a few programming languages, light application development, security policy creation, vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, using Kali Linux in virtual box, NIST framework, a bit of networking, among other things. I am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ exams but that process is admittedly taking a while due to how busy I am with school, internship, plus my regular full time job doing call center customer service for a large retailer. I know the CompTIA A+ cert will help my chances in securing a job, but honestly I would love to not have to rely on that.   


I know that my résumé is not super impressive and probably honestly throws up some red flags because I have struggled to stick with an employer for any significant amount of time in the last decade. This is partially because I want so much more for my career and none of my recent roles have been very fulfilling. But also it is because I had made very poor life choices for a while that led to me really kind of messing up my life. But, I have made major changes to pretty much every aspect of how I operate as a person and can honestly say that I have grown from those experiences and that is not a reflection of the person I am today.   


That being said, I was considering starting a volunteer service offering general I.T. assistance to an apartment community of senior citizens. My mom lives in the complex and she has asked me to help a few of her neighbors a few times with setting up accounts, routers, troubleshooting smartphones, etc. And I am always happy to help. So I figure, maybe I could set up something a little more formal to help gain some experience and become more marketable to employers. Thoughts? Advice? THANK YOU!  


TL;DR Has anyone done volunteer IT work and would it be worthwhile for me to do it as a way to gain experience and become a more qualified candidate for jobs."

I'm 25 y/o, graduated with a Master's last year, doing an internship since Sept. I've been doing them since my first year of Master's (this is technically the second year I've been working).   
1st &amp; 2nd internships were not paid, as they were """"part of my university curriculum"""" (this is very average in my country).   
3rd internship was 800€ a month, had to take 1h train as the city where it was is incredibly expensive and wouldn't allow me to.. well, survive with that amount of money. They told me they would've hired me at the end - of course they didn't, telling me there wasn't enough money to even extend my internship, just to hire another intern right after my contract ended.  
4th internship is the current one. I'm paid around \~900€ in a major European city. I like the people but I'm overworked and the team cannot seem to function without an intern to support them, as they are also overworked. The work itself is either hectic or incredibly boring, and any suggestions I'm asked to provide are then scrapped. The curse of the intern I'd say: not a full employee but still does even more than one.

I've been thinking about quitting for a while now: all the other trainees have started quitting as well, I'm tired of not having some kind of stability and certainty and I'm feeling very burnt out from working for two years without a pay for half of it.   
What's stopping me is that:

* I cannot rely on any financial support that's not mine: my parents cannot support me, and since I barely have money for basics (food, rent, utilities) I don't have a lot of money as an emergency fund.
* There is a very low change I'd be getting a better job (not necessarily a lot better, the pay for entry-levels is still low here) - they require more years of experience than I have
* Because of the above point, I could just get more internships - which I'd like to avoid.

I'm not sure what to do, I just know that I'm always mentally tired and I never have the energy to do anything else. On one hand I feel like I should be grateful to even have something, and I'm aware that with my degree this is the situation out there... but on the other, I'm really so tired of working."

I had family members die while I was in school and I just wasn't in the place to do internships on top of my school.

I was so f****** certain I had this job, like I was so f****** certain I thought this whole job would change my world I was at the final stage of the interview process I met with two of my potential bosses I thought I did really good in that interview process like I thought I did really good.

There was a final question about Big o notation and time complexity I kind of was a little jumbled about because I didn't really understand what they were asking me they simply asked me if you had a large data set that needed to be analyzed and you needed to write an efficient function how would you go about that.

And I just explained what Big o notation was and you know they didn't ask me in any particular language and there was no coderpad so I simply said well I would try to calculate what the Big o notation of a function was and if it was not sufficient for a requirements I would do research on something that didn't have a quadratic time complexity that would ultimately become inefficient.


Is this because of all the tech layoffs? Is it because these jobs now have the opportunity to hire people who are being laid off from Google and Facebook and so that's why I have to compete against as a recent graduate?

I'm just so hurt right now like how the f*** can I be this far on a hiring process and not get a job I mean I already had the initial technical interview and then a secondary technical interview and I thought I did really well and I'm just like so hurt and angry right now. I mean I f****** needed this job so bad.


I'm sorry this was the perfect job for me like I wanted it so bad. It was like my dream job.

It seemed perfect for a new graduate too it was an entry level position.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on choosing between the two. Is Deloitte a better option since it’s the “biggest” big 4? Are there any major differences in the work culture? Has anyone interned with either and could tell me how they liked it?

Any advice/insight would be so helpful in making my decision. Thanks in advance!"
10lcnvo,0,2023-01-25,"Pay-Equity Adjustment for US, Rural Nonprofit?",inthemuseum,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10lcnvo/payequity_adjustment_for_us_rural_nonprofit/,"I need perspective re: pay equity adjustment/raise-ish talks.

Context: I manage marketing/communications, development, and grantwriting at a medium-sized nonprofit in rural America. I’m the only department head with no full-time direct reports or assistants. I have an intern who is really more work because, y’know, intern, not an actual assistant; she’s awesome but I am also teaching her.

So full details: I got an objectively bad raise last year at my annual review. It was 3%, but practically that amounts to… $60 more per month. My rent didn’t go up much, only $100, but that’s still $40 more than my raise. Which makes me feel exceedingly undervalued. I’m effectively being paid *less.*

Come to find out my coworker (also a department head, slightly senior by tenure but effectively a peer) got a raise from 36,500 to 40,000. So basically a like 9% raise. We have roughly similar past experience, and she’s been at our workplace I think like two years longer.

She does a great job, I admire her unconditionally and respect the heck out of her professionally, but she’s only running one department. I run three, essentially, with no help and had nothing to start with in literally creating those departments. I’ve increased just grant income 15%, excluding an almost 200k two-year AmeriCorps grant, on top of roughly 250k annually (so with that added in across the two years, 2022 is more like 350k, 2023 yield is already 400k). I make 38,625 (over 37,500 pre-raise). Most fundraising/grantwriter types bring in about 10% of what their annual fundraising goal is, based on everything I’ve read. Most similar positions in the rural parts of my state make at least 40k. If we break it down, I should be making like 40,500, not even counting the fact I also do MarComms.

I had to set up both MarComms and Development infrastructure from nothing. There was no predecessor; fundraising and marketing were passive afterthoughts. My boss made me feel like trash at my annual because I didn’t have time to do much on the dev side my first year, but I did not have time between MarComms and huge grants. There was literally nothing for me to work from on either front, and because of my boss’ minimal direction and weird approach to fundraising, I spent more time on the MarComms side because I know how to build that from scratch successfully and needed something I could use as a basis for development/fundraising collateral and communications.

I’ve now created a solid dev infrastructure that is getting results (up like 30% in unique individual gifts; lower total yield by dollars but we are in a freaking recession and like every nonprofit brought in less, and most saw even fewer unique donors over 2021). MarComms is really not as much work once you get the wheels turning, compared to creating a department from nothing, so I had time to build out development as a department.

But I still do not have time to do it all. An intern helps a little, but I feel like I’m being held to a different standard. My boss most recently complained that I’m not getting enough photos, but again, three departments, one person. I can either write a dozen thank-you notes to people who gave us actual money or go take enough photos to get like 10 decent shots. Hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars vs maybe a social media post or two? Come on.

So I guess I’m not quite sure how to ask for a raise/pay-equity adjustment (it’s really more equity-based) because my boss seems to be holding me to a very different standard. He’s provided help to one colleague (three underlings, including an assistant), the other department head/manager level colleague got a far bigger raise. It’s extremely unfair, but I’m not sure how to get my boss to agree to an equity-based adjustment when he seems to believe I’m not doing enough to even get a fair COL adjustment.

I like this job, really, aside from the boss’ favoritism toward one other employee (the one who got an assistant and help) and how he holds me to different standards than the rest. Like, there are very few opportunities to do the things I like most in the combo I’ve got them (creative direction, grantwriting, and development experience, all at once, which is gold if you’re on the nonprofit career track). And my coworkers are great, genuinely some of the best people to work with and great friends at and outside of work. So I don’t want to launch myself toward a job hunt because I love my team, which is seriously GOLD in a field as toxic as nonprofits. But damn is it infuriating to be treated like this where something as crucial as pay is concerned. Like, I’d be far more okay with how he treats me if I were paid equitably. But I’m not managed well nor paid well, so something needs to balance that scale, and this job’s not providing that.

I don’t know how to TL;DR this so I am sorry this is long. I am frustrated and maybe word-vomiting."

I'm having a pretty hard time trying to decide what school I want to go to.

For a bit of background, I'm a Geography and Data Science student at the University of Washington and I've had a bit of internship experience working as a software developer and will be working as a data analyst intern this summer.

Both programs are great, so it makes it a bit harder for me to decide. I just want to be able to graduate from a program, get the opportunity to work for a solid tech company as a data analyst, and have the capacity to pivot to a different field if I find out it really isn't for me (which probably won't be the case but who knows).

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated (sorry for a longish post this is my first time)."

Currently accepted an audit internship for 2023 and I'm wondering if anyone has any experience switching into another internship at PwC, but a different position. IT Audit has sort of peaked my interest from one of my classes (and getting a CISA/other certs) and I've always liked the idea of the field. 

Would it be possible to switch? Also is it possible to do my audit internship and then just be hired as a DAT/Tax associate? 

thanks"

I am a counseling intern and am dealing with an internship site that is displaying abuse in power, bullying behaviors, and emotional manipulation. To describe more this fall she goes off on how she is going to get rid of me and every week until the predetermined time I did not sleep much, was consumed with anxiety, and was just a mess. I ended up going to the emergency room for suicidal thoughts and I struggled with them before that for more than a month. I was not admitted. The time comes and she decides to keep me. Now she is going off on how I am indebted to her to stay for the entirety of my internship time, I dont get any vacation/time off, I have to take on so many clients... or else.

I have been trying to communicate my issues with my program supervisor at school and not getting any support whatsoever. I have gone to the dean now. 

I just need help! What do I do?? I have all my hours for what is expected for graduation, but what are my rights as an intern in this situation?? My partner shares with me that I dont owe her anything and how this isnt right, etc but I feel so stuck. Every week I go in I feel like I am walking on eggshells to not piss her off and boot me. My relationships with my clients have been amazing and consistent since I began my internship. This woman just doesn't like me. Please help... any guidance or support would be tremendously appreciated before I lose my god damn mind."

&amp;#x200B;

So far in regards to accepted applications:

Failed first interview with Coupa Software. This was one of the first applications I sent out so I was optimistic back then

Invited to IBM coding challenge which Idk if they send it to everyone

I have about 5 requests for interviews on angellist but they’re for unpaid roles

Past first interview with everlaw but failed coding challenge

Passed first round interview with city job and just completed second round interview

Interviewed with state job seemed positive

Interviewed with county job again seemed positive

Passed initial interview but failed coding test with checkpoint

This is around 200 applications. So I’m getting requests but idk if they’re the kind I’m looking for(unpaid: been reading that these jobs are a big no no)(state, county, city: heard these jobs are undesirable). So idk if my interview rate is good or not.

I've only applied to jobs in the Bay Area or remote and I’d really like to stick in this area or within a 100 mile radius due to family matters.

My resume consists of:

a basic full stack app where you basically enter a string and then enter what you want to search within the string and then it returns the result of your request. The county job requested this as a preliminary screening and they seemed very pleased with it.

A 2D video game coded in Unity and C# that I made with 4 other classmates for our senior project. I’m honestly really proud of this. It’s similar to A Link to the Past

A personal website in HTML and CSS

A basic employee entry system in C++ using the command line

I have a BS in CS

I also have a summer internship

I want to know what I need to do right now. Should I keep applying and practicing leetcode. Should I drop everything and work on a portfolio project?(I have no idea what to work on)

I also want to get a regular job(like mcdonalds or something) and then keep applying but afraid I’ll forget programming practices or if that time would be better served programming?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired and stressed of the doubt what do I need to do? Am I just not meant to be a programmer?"

So basically I scored really low for my poly gpa have repeated now am currently year 2 gg to year 3 with repeated modules and my gpa is barely touching 2. But if I do my internship maybe my gpa will increase. Sim my only options is gg to private Uni I want to go to sim UoL data science and business analytics or any it related course. But I don’t know if I can enter with my scores and don’t know how much will it cost. I have only o level math but since covid I haven’t touched math often so is there any bridging courses I need to take?

So here’s the main qns I wanted to ask 


1) with my gpa can I go Sim else, what are my options 

2) if I can enter Sim what will be the cost annually 

3) because of my repeated modules my graduation is expected to extend till sept 2024 so will I be able to attend sept aug sim intake if I try to apply for sept/ aug intake with my extended semester?

4) Is there really no chance for me to enter local Uni? 

5) if I enter sim is there any loan options available or is it only for financially down people 

Do share down your opinion so I can proceed with the advice provided"

10lka9x,3,2023-01-26,Scared to leave my “dream”(isolating) remote job,shydi96,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/10lka9x/scared_to_leave_my_dreamisolating_remote_job/,"First ever Reddit post—I’m so scared to even put this out there but yearning for advice. This is long, but hopefully not too rambling! 

Basically, I have a remote job in an ultra-competitive industry I’ve worked super hard to get into, but now that the novelty/relief of ending my job search has worn off (about 4 months in) I’m miserable. 

Background: 26F. I’m living with my parents, which has wonderful privileges (comfort, no rent, family, pets) but it’s getting sad at this point 😳 I’m not growing, and I feel extremely isolated, MUCH more so since being remote. Pre-Covid, I was working in a busy office full of young people straight out of college like me, and I was really coming into my own. Virus basically killed that (already dying) industry, so I left to work at a restaurant for about a year. (This might sound like a strange choice, but I made more $ at the restaurant, sadly, and it definitely “toughened me up”. I don’t regret it! Miss the people, NOT the job.) 

This summer, I did what’s basically a certificate program for my current industry, finally capitalizing on a lot of skills I built in college and one of my lifelong passions. The program was in NYC, and honestly, the best part about it was living there for month. Thanks to this program, I got a remote internship, and then my current job—I was truly stunned by this, as I’d left NYC questioning whether the industry was really for me after all. A huge portion of my classmates do not have jobs. 

At first, working remote felt downright luxurious: I worked in person the entirety of COVID, and especially after my restaurant job, I felt so proud/lucky to finally be a part of the laptop class 😂 It also felt like a validation of my expensive education and hard studying (I was very academic in college, to the point of missing out on a lot —-but that was my comfort zone at the time.) Not being on my feet all day helped me get addicted to exercise, too, which I’m so happy about. However, the months have slipped by, and I now barely leave the house. 

I don’t socialize except for dinner with 
one super close friend, maybe brunch about once a month with friends from my old job, and alumni events 30 mins away, where everyone is already paired up. (Another thing, I’ve dated but never had a serious bf. religious/sheltered upbringing + insecurity=💀). High school friends I’ve tried to connect with are struggling—working minimum wage jobs, also living with parents, and literally just want to smoke weed. (No judgement, just not my thing. Especially in someone’s mom’s house lol)

I desperately want to work in an office again, but moving to NYC (where my job is based) is almost impossible on my salary. For all these reasons, my gut is telling me to leave this job around the 6 month mark, and go to a nearby commune I’ve been interested in since before COVID where I can be around unconventional people my age and do hands on work. At the same time, I know this decision is probably the “wrong” one on paper, will inconvenience my boss who’s been amazing, and will plunge me back into the uncertainty before I nabbed my current job. I’m a huge believer in Meg Jay’s “The Defining Decade”, and I feel like I’m finally building some identity capital—-but I’m at zero socially and emotionally. 

I just want some fun and freedom. I feel like 85% of my life has been in front of a screen, and I’m scared to let another year pass by. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and gotten out? Can anyone relate, or feel less alone after reading this? I’d love to know.

I know this is a long wall of whiny text, so thanks for reading if you got this far 🌞"

Due to health issues and anxiety I've never had a job. I've tried to get a job but have mostly been turned down or couldn't do the job due to panic attacks and didn't make it past a day. (I tried to push through, but I just couldn't.) My health issues have gotten better but my anxiety remains. I've tried meditation, medications and therapy but it hasn't really helped. 

Now that my health issues are gone I have decided to study. I'm doing a double bachelors in comp sci and maths or physics. I'm going to be aiming for software engineering roles. But I'm worried about having no experience when going for internships/graduating since everyone else will have a Maccas job or something. I'll also be graduating when I'm 30. I've been told I look young for my age and have had people assume I'm only 18, so I'm hoping employers assume I'm around 22 or just an old looking 22 year old when I'm 30 so they're not wondering why I have no experience before uni.

What do I do? Will I be unemployable once I graduate? I currently have an 89% WAM at a go8 uni (a good Australian uni) but am only a first year and unsure if I'll maintain it. If I get good grades will I be able to get into an internship and then a grad/entry level position or am I screwed because of my late start in life? What happens if my grades take a nosedive and I end up with a bad WAM? Is it too late to start in life at the age of 26?"

Best way to proceed?",employm3,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10loigt/30m_2021_graduate_quit_jobs_due_to_depression/,"I graduated with my BS in Public Health in 2021 with 1 internship completed and \~5yrs clinical experience as a tech/CNA. I obtained my first post grad WFH entry level job 6 months after school and stayed there about 6 months before I took a leave of absence (managers suggestions after a rough 1-on-1 meeting) but ultimately decided not to return. I've suffered from clinical depression and social anxiety for about 2/3 of my life and have not received treatment since April 2022 when that happened.

Mid 2022 and I got another WFH job but higher paying and less hours. However, it was a 2hr drive to the office which I had to do my 12hr shift 3x a week for 2-3 months of training. It was all computer work. I stayed in hotels and Airbnbs when I worked. Initially there were some personality issues between my trainer and I due to my lack of ""wanting"" the job as much as others in my position. About 2.5 months into it, I had a severe anxiety attack a few hours before work. I called in for the weekend and then dropped off my equipment in the office after hours. This made me think it may be the field I'm not interested in anymore or that I made a wrong choice with my degree since I always thought about nursing for a more clinical role but I'm not certain.

I was planning on leaving the above job off my resume which would give me an unemployment gap from April 2022 to Present. In that case, how should I go about moving forward from this with regards to finding work (PT only, a different field, back to school..)? Or how do I go about explaining the gaps in my resume?

I got a general IT bachelors degree (CIS, fundamental networking, coding, and management courses), data analyst internship, was a junior sys admin for a year, and have been a SOC analyst for a year now as well (now a SOC analyst II, have comptia sec+, working on my CySA+). 

To be honest, I eventually want to make the jump to a software developer title (coding has always interested me and I enjoy my small projects Ive had in the past). Im just not sure on the way to do it. Obviously I dont code everyday, but I have a general understanding of basic commands and could look at code and at least have an idea of what it's trying to do. 

MY QUESTION is, should I take a coding bootcamp? Should I just self learn through free courses/youtube? Does my current experience hold any weight? 

Im not trying to get a fast track into a software dev job, I want to ensure I understand the fundamentals and such before making the switch (and potentially progressing my cyber career a little further before making the switch). I could get a pentesting cert to show that Im familiar with at least python and then make the switch as well.

TLDR: What pathway would you recommend for someone in cyber sec to transition into a software dev job."
10lrhj9,0,2023-01-26,HELP! I to come up with a lie ASAP before my parents kill me !,OneSherbert9108,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10lrhj9/help_i_to_come_up_with_a_lie_asap_before_my/,"I (19F) am in big trouble and I really need some advise on what lie or excuse I can tell my parents. Before I begin this story, I want to let everyone know that i am VERY well aware that I fucked up, everything is my fault and that my parents will be livid. When I mess up I usually manage to come up with a good lie which has helped me a LOT the past two years and I just need to come up with another good lie. I’ve always been good at covering up my tracks and lying on the spot but I need help with this.

For context: I have two bank accounts and two different banks. Account 1 at Bank A is the account I’ve had since I was twelve years old. My parents saved some money for me on Account 2 at Bank B throughout my childhood and had to legally give that account to me when I turned 18. I decided to use that money to pay for my tuition since my parents told me they weren’t going to pay for my tuition anymore (probably couldn’t afford it since they are also going to help me financially on my semester abroad). I told my parents I probably wasn’t going to use Account 2 at Bank B too much, which was true. 

What happened: When I was 17, I saved up for an iPad Air, which cost around €700. When I came home with it, my parents were angry and told me to bring it back since they thought it was a waste of money (even though I worked for it and saved up myself). When I had access to Account B i realised I was going to use that account to buy things my parents don’t agree with. But with my OWN money. I bought the newest iPhone, new shoes, concert tickets, beauty appointments (lash extentions, nails, hair etc.) weed and basically just everything my parents think is a waste of money or “bad” like the weed. Around March last year I started getting into debt. I was so irresponsible with my money, and am aware that this was entirely my fault. The country i live in allows all students to receive for a student loan without income/background check very quickly so i decided to request the loan for about 5 months, until i paid off the debt. the amount i received was the maximum amount, almost a €1000. I also got a second job to ensure I would never end up in a similar situation again, which paid really well. This job would pay me on Account 2 at Bank 2, and so i continued to make such purchases. As said earlier, I am going on a semester abroad very soon. Despite everything going on I still managed to save some money, and am still saving. My parents are aware of me saving and of the debt. Just not of the loan. My parents are very against borrowing money. This has been going on since september 2021. 

Examples of the purchases I made on Account 2 at Bank B: 
- iPhone 12: €800. told them it cost me about €300
-Festival tickets are usually between €60-€120 and i’ve been to quite a few 
- concert tickets are usually €100+ 
- Nails: €50-€70 every three weeks 
- lashes: €40 every three weeks 
- braids (hair): €120 every two months 
- weed: €12 every two weeks 
- just bought new shoes: €130, told them it was €40
- i take the uber often when going home from partying which sometimes costs me €60 if i’m far away.

The issue: Here comes the part that stresses me out. Today i got ready for work and quickly went to my dad to tell him I was leaving. He asked me whether I had enough money for my tuition (I pay monthly since this academic year) since he noticed I have been working less lately because of my studies. I told him yes (I have plenty of money on Account 2 on Bank B). He asked me to show it to him, so I obviously only showed him Account A on Bank A. I had about €6 on that account. I didn’t say anything. I then came up with a quick lie and said I was going to get paid this week. I then went downstairs to grab my stuff and leave for work until he stopped me all of a sudden: “Wait a minute. How about Account 2 on Bank B? Can I see it?”. He would go LIVID if he knew I had been 1) borrowing money in the past, 2) see the crazy purchases and 3) find out i’ve been buying weed on a regular basis. My parents are already annoyed since I got a parking fine lately. I told him I needed to catch the bus and left. He insisted I tell my job I’m going to be late so he can see the account. This has never happened before? I’m pretty sure he got a sudden gut feeling to check that “secret” account. I kept telling him I really needed to catch the bus since I’m already late and was already late yesterday. He let me go but he will definitely ask to see the account when I get home. 

I escaped him for now but what do i say to him when i get home??? I know I’m caught regardless, but i want to lessen the damage as much as possible. What excuse is there that I can use to make them less mad at me?? I know the trust will be gone but that doesn’t matter cause I don’t like my parents anyway (many reasons). I will be living on my own in two weeks for my internship and will go on my semester abroad after so I just need to put up with them for two weeks. I’ve planned so many nice things (festival, concert, surprise party, shopping, booking a trip to paris with my bestfriend etc.) for those two weeks with my friends before I leave and I really don’t want that to be gone right before I leave for about a year in total. Any advice/lie is welcome.

EDIT: i paid off the debt a whole ago! the loan stopped !!!"

But I just wanted to motivate people, probably a lot of you are better coders than me and know more stuff, just keep studying and applying and you will eventually get there, there's no ""one"" path, study what you want and make projects, make a good CV and try to stay calm on the interviews!

I (21f) am at my hometown for winter break (university student). I met with my high-school friends yesterday, and it made me remember how much potential I had back then (in high-school) and it feels like I wasted it all. I dreamt my university life would be so much better by now and I am extremely disappointed in myself. To be honest I can’t say I am not successful in school and I am only in my 3rd year, but I haven’t done anything I wanted to do in high school. I am very dissatisfied in my friend group, even though I do love them I don’t think they are the right people for me. I always thought I would have friends which are very close an we would help each other grow and improve but that’s not the case here. If anything, sometimes I feel like my friends are pulling me back. I also wanted to achieve better things academically, but right now I am just getting by. I didn’t have a great internship or went to another country as an exchange student. And the worst part is I was kind of depressed first and second year of uni and I let everything go now I am not sure I can get it back together. 

I must say I am usually not an insecure person, I am very confident in myself and I know that I am capable of a lot of things. I am smart, cultured, kind etc… I am constantly educating myself on subjects and I am trying to grow everyday. I am basically the person I wanted to be when I was a kid that’s for sure. I get compliments from people and I am liked by many. That’s not the issue here. I am disappointed in myself because I think I wasted my potential and I don’t know how to pull it back. I am not in a place I want to be and I am not sure if I can ever go to that place. I feel like I am stuck in an environment I am not supposed to be in. I don’t know if that makes sense. I think I am just really anxious right now. 

Besides all that, I can’t talk to my university friends about this anxiety because they wouldn’t understand. I feel closer to my high-school friends but we kind of got distant in uni and to be honest I am ashamed to talk to them about this subject. It is obvious but I have been a high achiever all my life and I had high expectations of myself. I’ve never beat myself up for not being successful in anything because I know I am human and I am allowed to fail. However, right now I feel like I am failing my life and myself. 

Besides all that; my boyfriend and I had a huge fight and I am to blame and he wanted to take his time for a bit and not talk to me for a while at least until we see each other when we go back to university in 3 days. It is better to not talk anyways because we both suck at messaging and it always leads to misunderstanding and more fights. He is the only person I can talk about anything but I think it would be really selfish to bring my stupid anxiety to him at this point. 

To sum up, I feel like I am wasting the best years of my life away.

So yeah. I had nobody to talk so I just wanted to vent here."

Even if I read it in a notebook and go to apply it at the end in another cell, I forget what I'm doing right away. I struggle to write proper pythonic code because I just don't think in that way - and we haven't really been taught how, though I've seen examples in texts I'm reading.

It's starting to really freak me out - I felt I was doing really well, considering my marks from the first term, until I flopped a technical internship interview very hard and have been struggling away with lab tasks in a new perspective.

Ugh. Here's how I lost 20-30 minutes of productivity yesterday.

I've been working on a responsive web puzzle game, and had just implemented a bunch of callbacks on `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` events so I could handle smooth swiping/scrolling without triggering button presses.

We test it on Chrome desktop, mobile, Safari/iOS, etc and all is well - the original problem was solved!

Then an intern goes: ""Uh, it's not working on my MacBook.""

Sure enough we check the console on desktop Safari and see:`ReferenceError: Can't find variable: TouchEvent`

All caused by a little piece of code:`return (event instanceof TouchEvent &amp;&amp; other_condition_here);`

Googling around showed a few possibilities (like in TS trying to wrap the interface into another module to export), but in the end we had to replace the logic with:

`return ('touches' in event &amp;&amp; other_condition_here);`

Urgh. What a weird gotcha when, elsewhere, we've dependably been able to do instanceof comparisons with things like HTMLInputElement.

10m10oe,6,2023-01-26,Just hit the 200 internship applications mark and have had very little luck so far. What am I doing wrong?,Pratham05,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10m10oe/just_hit_the_200_internship_applications_mark_and/,I know the market is really slow right now in terms of hiring and I have been going for mainly big N companies since the company I work at right now is Fortune 25 but I did expect more especially since I have an internship under my belt and I go to a T20 CS school. I get OAs from some companies and I either do really well or really poor but they have only resulted in an interview at most. Most of my friends have gotten offers or at least interviews from these companies and some don't even have internship experience. I have posted my resume to the resume advice page here and at r/csMajors and I haven't gotten much feedback so I don't think that's the issue but [here](https://imgur.com/a/7iIKQM8) it is. I am hoping to implement changes and try again for fall internships while I go with my current company for the summer but I'm not sure what I am doing wrong.
10m3sc1,218,2023-01-26,Simulacrum,FarmWhich4275,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/10m3sc1/simulacrum/,"I approached the human controlled colony of Exodus. Exodus was a sort of mid-point in Terran space, within the realm of the Terran Dominion, it was more a Waystation used by travelers and cargo carriers the galaxy over. A tinge of fear erupted in my throat as my ship, a diplomatic corvette, quietly flew past one of the Dominions massive three kilometer long carriers. The same Carrier that had become so deeply feared throughout the galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

The system bustled with activity, even a Saranis Hive Ship was docked at the human station, undergoing what looked to be a cargo haul. It scared us to no end to understand how Humanity managed to actually pacify the Saranis Hive Fleets... and more so than that, actively trade biotech with them. Most ships were human. Straight edges mixed with curved hulls, cannons the size of smaller ships and smaller ships with the kind of armament you'd be crazy to fit on a ship that small.

&amp;#x200B;

The human Ambassador had asked us to come here, with a volunteer willing to do something 'beyond the pale of unorthodox' and demanded that we agree on an explicitly and exclusively volunteer only basis. I had that volunteer. He was one of us, a Drakarnis, a young one, barely out of the academy. He sat quietly in his seat, his tail fluttering side to side in excitement. He was genuinely amazed by all the ships on display. Humans had the most... massive and diverse space fleet of any in the galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

Plasma, mass accelerators, energy weapons, spinal energy beams, kinetic bombardment cannons, missiles, torpedoes, anything you could imagine, every single Terran ship had at least a combination of half of those things. Usually as standard too. Terran ships were also the largest. Even if you could get through their shields, their armor plating alone would shrug off most weapons fire. The Xaxclikani Imperium found that out the hard way.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Exodus Station this is The Flying Khartis, VIP on board requesting docking permission."" Our ships navigator calmly said, communicating with the station.

&amp;#x200B;

""Copy that. Uhhh proceed vector two-niner-three by six-five-eight, traffic left and right, CZ-88 heavy and Darctaris cruiser to your right. Proceed docking bay twenty three Charlie."" Came the radio response.

&amp;#x200B;

""Confirm traffic, dock twenty three charlie at t-minus two minutes."" The pilot said, the sheer confidence in her voice calming us down. ""We should be there shortly sir. It looks like the Human Ambassador is already there.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Then we shall meet him. Cathus, come with me please."" I said and made my way to the docking tubes.

&amp;#x200B;

Cathus looked at me, the youngling clearly taller than his elder by a clear foot and a half. ""My Lord... what exactly did the humans say they wanted?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No idea Cathus. They said this is an exclusively volunteers only basis, so I expect its important enough and dangerous enough they expect trouble. I can tell you youngling... When a human is acting that serious... you know its important. They dont smile."" He looked at me, his jubilance suddenly vanishing.

&amp;#x200B;

The door opened and we saw a host of Terrans greet us. Two of their Legionnaires, flanked by a squad of Marines on parade to the left and right with weapons at their sides. In-between all, was the Ambassador, a kindly old man with greying hair and a waking cane. Just like me, he was getting on. ""Kalthar old friend! Good to see you again!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Indeed it is good to see you again Ambassador Reginald!"" I replied in turn and surprised my escort by giving an old friend a hug.

&amp;#x200B;

Reginald returned it, and dismissed the soldiers at his call. ""Thank you for coming and on such short notice. We have two orders of business to discuss. The first is that cargo ship over there. Come, let me show you.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Come Cathus, don't dawdle.""  I spoke up at Cathus who was mesmerized by the Legionnaire staring at him.

&amp;#x200B;

We hurried over the docking area and came upon a viewing deck looking over a Terran cargo ship. a small one. Well small in terms of Terran ships anyway. ""Say hello to the Saucy Sue. Yes I know, don't worry about the name. Her cargo, is yours. Special delivery.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reginald handed me a data pad, it was the ships cargo manifest. ""Two thousand tons of Carbalite... three thousand kilos of gold... two tons of... TWO TONS OF ANTRONITE CRSYTAL... and.. fourteen tons of Copper, Tristeel and Titanium."" I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes. All yours!"" Reginald smiled at me.

&amp;#x200B;

""Reginald... you are handing over a fortune of Atronite Crystal that will serve us for the next sixteen generations! Why? How?"" I asked, flabbergasted in shock.

&amp;#x200B;

""Long story short, you know Abraxis 9? that seemingly worthless star system in your back yard you gave to us? Turns out the asteroid field is saturated in valuable resources. Some of the asteroids in that field contain Atronite geodes hidden by Nickel, Copper and Iron deposits. This right here is adequate compensation in the form of - sixty percent - of our mining yield. The rest, is already on the open market, at agreed prices."" Reginald simply smiled at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to steady myself on Cathus' scaled form to stop myself from collapsing. We both nearly fell over in response to the news. ""By all the gods of the Void... Sixty percent!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It took me some time to calm down and regain my composure. ""You have no concept of what you have just done Reginald... If there is anything we can do, in return, name it.""

&amp;#x200B;

""We will keep that in mind for the future."" He smiled warmly and directed us inside the building.

&amp;#x200B;

""As for our second order of business. Remember what I told you - volunteer only."" Reginald said as he walked with us through a corridor towards a specific door.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon reaching it, I noted the name on top of the door. ""Holodeck VR Suite?"" I quizzed him, furrowing a brow.

&amp;#x200B;

Reginald simply smiled at me. ""We have discovered something interesting during a test of some experimental equipment. A... happy accident, so to speak. Please, come in.""

&amp;#x200B;

We entered at his behest and noticed a large domed room with three pods in them. One of which had a bald human wearing a white jumpsuit in it. He seemed to be connected to some strange device, but I didn't ask. ""Well... this is... erm...""

&amp;#x200B;

""Peculiar? Yes it is. Humanity has many secrets, and I feel it is time to explain but one such secret. Virtual Reality. Utilizing non-intrusive non-surgical neural helmets we can transfer the users mind waves and brain patterns into a computer system. The user can then experience... well... anything. They can literally create an entire fantasy universe in their own heads, and we can see what they create. Mostly, we use it as a test bed for our starship designs, and as a training tool for pilots and engineers."" Reginald explained, calmly.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly... it all made sense. ""AH... so that explains a lot. It explains how you were able to do so much with so little time back in the Elesium War. Suddenly so much of how you work makes sense."" I let out a sigh of relief. An age old question we had since meeting humanity had finally been answered.

&amp;#x200B;

""Recently however... we discovered, by accident, another use for it. As sophisticated as the tech is, it recently had a slight incident when er... well. Someone's mind got accidentally uploaded to the wrong body."" Reginald explained, gesturing to the human in the pod.

&amp;#x200B;

""Erm... wait... what?"" I looked at him, genuinely confused.

&amp;#x200B;

""The neural helmets have a hidden secondary function apparently. Something we thought only Starship Core Pilots could use, but apparently if you complete a series of events and use a specific form of code, any individual can essentially download their neural patterns into another persons brain.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Reginald explained this. And it suddenly hit me. Like a ton of bricks in a sandstorm, it hit me. ""H-how...?"" Was all I could manage to say.

&amp;#x200B;

""Quite by accident. We had a server malfunction in the system, a few crossed wires during a power surge caused one of our interns to download himself into one of these here 'blanks' as we call them. Clones that we use to test new cybernetics software."" Reggie pointed at the human in the pod.

&amp;#x200B;

""WHAT!?"" I Exclaimed. The room echoed with my yell. ""Thats illegal! Cloning is illegal in the entire galaxy!""

&amp;#x200B;

""You are quite correct, but, not correct. Cloning of functional creatures - of sentients or sapients - is illegal, yes. These however are not clones of sapient creatures, but more just blank shells of roughly similar genetic material. Its technically legal."" Reginald said.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well... That's the best kind of legal. Have you... fixed the error?"" I asked, taking a closer look at the pod.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes. We use our StarCore pilots to adjust the system to fit specifications and rebuild the neural net to exclude any power surges. Several tests were conducted with Blanks. That incident wont happen again, and we are absolutely certain that this will work when we use it."" Reginald explained, adjusting some of the Blanks clothing.

&amp;#x200B;

""And... what exactly are you going to use it for?"" My tone of voice shifted. I was now actually scared.

&amp;#x200B;

""I shall cut to the chase. I want to put your volunteer Cathus into this pod here and put him in a sort of limbo using the neuro helm. Then, transfer control of his processes into the Blank, and then see what happens.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reginald's response made me collapse to the floor. ""ABSOLUTE MADMEN!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

""I will do it."" Cathus suddenly spoke. He stepped forward and held his tail high.

&amp;#x200B;

""CATHUS!!! I FORBID THIS!!"" I yelled out, commanding him to stand down.

&amp;#x200B;

""I volunteered for this. So shut up."" Cathus started me dead in the eyes. I knew from the frills of his horns he definitely was dead serious. ""What exactly will happen here Ambassador?""

&amp;#x200B;

I clambered to my feet as Reginald began to explain. ""You are put in this pod. Your neural patterns are repeatedly scanned fifteen, thirty, then fifty times in succession in order to guarantee a perfect synchronization. You are then put in a sort of bio-stasis where your body's processes cease. We are aware of your cultural proclivities so this wont be a full transfer it will sort of be like a... erm... remote control scenario where you will have control of the Blank.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh... I thought it was much worse than that! I'll definitely do it! Where do I sit?"" Cathus said, chipper again as he was when we entered.

&amp;#x200B;

""Third pod, there. The middle pod is kept vacant with a neuro-bank to store memories just in case something goes wrong. In case the shit hits the fan, we can copy your entire neural pattern to a databank for storage and guarantee even if the body is unrecoverable, you'll still be around for us to create a clone of you and get you back up and running."" The female operator sitting at the console said.

&amp;#x200B;

""And if we knew there was even the slightest risk of something going wrong, we would not even be attempting this in the first place."" Reginald said, pressing a button opening the pod. ""This is entirely voluntary. As far as I am concerned that cargo ship was nothing more than dues that were owed in accordance to our friendship as a species. You have no obligation to do anything beyond here, and I wouldn't hold it against you if you walked away. Think very carefully. Do you still want to do this?"" Reginald asked Cathus, holding him by the shoulders with a serious expression, looking him in the eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Cathus thought for a moment and moved over to the pod. It took him a bit to get comfortable in the human-made seat and had to move his wings and tail around a bit before he found a sweet spot. He gave a nod to the operator. ""Ready to go.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I stood near the console by the operators and tried to compose myself. The operator started to do her routine. ""Tracking neural patterns. Neural patterns set for species Valikantis Sapiens Orionis. Tracing memory.... found.""

&amp;#x200B;

A monitor popped up, showing a video - from Cathus' very own eyes of his days in combat training with the Academy. ""By the stars..."" I stood in absolute awe. We were actually watching his memories.

&amp;#x200B;

""Fascinating isn't it? We use this tech to solve criminal cases. Its amazing just how many murderers and thieves we caught and punished with it. We don't do it without the proper legal cause of course, innocent until proven guilty. We only use it as an absolute when we already have enough evidence to convict anyway."" Reginald explained in a dulcet tone, having now moved to stand next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

""You kept saying something about... Core Ship Pilots... and this tech was based on them. What are... thing you said?"" I asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""Core Pilots, or Corers, are humans that have undergone a staggering amount of cybernetic and genetic augmentation to essentially plug themselves into a ship, feeding the ships systems into their bodies and allowing them to... well... control the ships they pilot as easily as they control their own bodies."" Reginald explained, handing me a data pad.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another billion piece puzzle suddenly fell into beautiful place. Now we understood why Terran warships performed as they did. Now we know why ship crews were so damn fast - there weren't any. Terran ships could be controlled perfectly, instantly, respond to any threat and direct its entire firepower to a single target in a matter of milliseconds. The Terrans... suddenly became many times more terrifying than we already knew them to be.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Neural registry complete. Running redundancy check.... Complete. Rechecking... All systems OK. Checking neural pathways for transfer translation. Stand by."" The female said as she worked away. I could no longer see Cathus, his pod had been covered in a black veil.

&amp;#x200B;

""Going well so far. Corers are a crazy breed of ship pilot. But almost every ship in the fleet has at least a basic variant of this tech. Corers usually control larger ships, such as the carrier you passed through. Most are independent contractors or solo operators who simply just live their lives in the Void... but each one is contracted to join us in the event of a conflict. You wouldn't believe what some of these guys find out there... its beyond amazing."" Reginald continued to explain a we watched.

&amp;#x200B;

""Neural pattern mesh stable. Redundancy stable. Backup stable. Backup copies one through seventy five, stable. Patient stable. Blank stable. System ready. On command."" The Operator put her hand on a key, flipped open a protective cover and inserted the key. She then looked at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought for a moment. Then I looked at her. ""Do it.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Transfer commencing. T-minus thirty seconds...""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Time itself seemed to spontaneously stop. Those seconds seemed to be years, decades, I felt older by the time they finished by millennia.

&amp;#x200B;

""Complete. Checking system. Neural net... OK. Neural MESH.... OK. Patient health... OK. Neural stability... OK. Connection established and stable. Check OK, all clear. Pod 3 is clear to open. Waiting order."" She said.

&amp;#x200B;

I waved my hand to give the go. A hiss of machine parts and pneumatics followed as the pod containing the Blank opened. ""Medics on standby. Security team on standby. Systems stable.""

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into the pod. Its eyes were open, looking at me. It slowly sat up, stumbling with its arms. ""Cathus... Platoon Corporal Cathus Dulerious... Is that you?""

&amp;#x200B;

It looked at me. Then at Reginald. Then at its hands. It raised them and took several deep breaths and clenched its fists. After what seemed an eternity he spoke. ""Woah.... I know Kung-Fu.""

&amp;#x200B;

This made Reginald burst into laughter, and made the operator slap her forehead with a chuckle. The standing medical team laughed alongside the security officers too. Reginald composed himself and spoke. ""The procedure was an absolute success! I knew that code phrase would be good!"""
10m3x1a,6,2023-01-26,Ghosted by Internship?,Karbar049,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/10m3x1a/ghosted_by_internship/,"tl;dr - I cannot get a response from the person 'overseeing' my internship, which is required for graduation, and I'm freaking out a bit. Looking for advice.

Hey you lovely people, looking for a bit of advice. I'm in (what should be) my fifth and final semester of an MPH - epidemiology program. As part of our program, we are required to have an internship and create two 'deliverables' for the organization, using our newly honed public health skills. The university will post opportunities from different organizations, but actually applying for and getting the internship is 100% our responsibility (no issue there, we're all adults). So back in November, I reached out to someone who posted an opportunity with our university. She emailed back the following Monday, stating that she received all my information and was excited to work together, and she would reach out by the end of the week to get everything started. (I was thrilled, excited, and happy to have a plan.) However, the end of the week came and went. I figured I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, she was probably busy, things come up, etc. no big deal. When I didn't hear anything by the end of the following week, I reached out. She emailed back the beginning of the next week, that she wanted to schedule a meeting for December 21, which was a few weeks away, but I was like 'great, just let me know when, and I'll take my break then,' as I was / am working full-time. 

Meeting happens and includes her, her supervisor (I think), two other students, and me. We all express that we have to do this in order to graduate and have a plan in place by January 4 for the 'deliverables' that we are providing. She's all positive that everything will be fine, no worries, so excited, etc. Then, as we are signing off, she states that she's going on vacation until January 3, and she's leaving the office about 2 hours after our meeting, but she'll be available by email. I email her with a plan/thoughts/etc. a couple days later, and hear nothing. Touch base again on the afternoon of January 3, to see if I can get a finalized plan in place. Finally hear from her on the morning of the 4th. Submit all the required documents to my school and think it will be smooth sailing. 

I email her the following Monday, letting her know that everything was submitted and approved through the university, and while this is supposed to be a remote internship, their office is close enough (\~1 hour away) that I can go there later in the week to meet in person, or we can set up a Teams meeting, or phone conversation to get started. She emails on Tuesday, saying she wants set up a meeting on Friday (doesn't confirm modality) and she'll be in touch the next day. I hear nothing, so I email Wednesday afternoon. Still nothing. I email Thursday evening and Friday morning, trying to set up a time to meet so I can get started. She emails on Monday afternoon, that she is headed to the port and will not have email access for a week while she is on vacation, but hopefully I can start doing some research and come up with a plan for deliverables under in initiative that is not even mentioned on their website, and we'll 'hit the ground running on Monday.' She should have been back in the office this past Monday, and I've emailed her twice (once last week Monday and got an 'out of office' response, and once yesterday) and am yet to hear anything from her. 

I thought I had this all squared away in November. Now, if I don't complete 90 hours of work and 2 projects, I'll have to postpone graduation and likely have to pay additional tuition. How do I express to this person that she is getting free labor, but it requires her to put in 5 minutes of work? Has anyone had any similar experiences? What did you do?"
10m4dcs,2,2023-01-26,How to describe expanded scope of responsibilities?,akornm,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10m4dcs/how_to_describe_expanded_scope_of_responsibilities/,"Hi, [I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/sikemt/advice_on_weird_job_description_please/) here a year ago asking how to describe my job, I'm applying for computer science internships now and still don't know how to describe it so I'd like to ask again.

I was hired as a warehouse worker after getting a biomedical science degree. Over a few months my job duties expanded to include customer service, digital marketing, accounting, ecommerce website management, database development, business process automation software development, as well as some custom software solutions for the company. I received multiple raises and a bonus as a result of my versatility.

Obviously only the latter half of that would potentially matter for a CS internship, but I'd like to highlight the fact that I'm a quick learner, given that my background was originally unrelated to CS, I taught myself how to code while on the job, and I'm 24 competing with 19 year olds who have been coding since the womb.

Can anyone please help me come up with a bullet point to describe all of that concisely? There's so much I did and I'm really having trouble generalizing it all.

On my resume I have my position listed as ""IT Specialist"". I'm not too satisfied with my first 2 bullet points, but they are

* Significantly decreased time spent on manual work by identifying and automating repetitive warehouse and ecommerce tasks
* Planned, developed and deployed custom software solutions including an inventory management system, company database and product catalogue web application

Is there any reason to tell the company I got my full time offer from about the internship?

**So the BIG question is should I change my career from a Videographer to a ""programmer""?**

***This is gonna be a resume of my career so far a sum up of my resume. So you can skip it if you don't wanna waste much time but still wanna give some advice***

* I worked 3 years for agency making just a bit above the minimum wage in my country (Portugal), COVID affected my agency and after they hold on to the max they had to let go people.
* Since February 2022 I was on and off jobs, I worked one day for a dental company as a videographer but i hated it so much because it was old school and I was gonna get cooped up inside of the office 8 hours a day and that kind of made me scared and i quitted that job (I was gonna get paid 1000€ after tax) which was not bad, but i hated what i was going to do, editing videos for health and being locked in a office.
* 1 month after, I got another job, Videographer for a Hair Transplant company, the salary was better (1100€) but I only stayed there for 1 month, Yes I locked up in a office 8 hours a day which I hated, I saw the boss making the Intern cry 2 times, and believe it or not the first 2 weeks I only went to the office to stare at the wall, because they didn't had equipment for Video or a ""good"" PC. So yeah, I said f\*ck it to that job and quit again because the environment was very old school and toxic, a lot of ""power play"".
* 1 week after I landed a job I was applying while at the transplant company, to an FIFA Esports team to be their videographer. Now job was very bad in salary wise, but so much more chilled, (800€ but not contract - kind of of a freelance but I'm still their employee and need to put 8 hours a day kind of thing) this seemed fun for me because I'm sort of a gamer myself and it was my favorite game FIFA. But this was only for 3 months because they just need someone to cover the end of the season for their videos to the socials.

So all of this brings me to today's day, **unemployment, unhappiness with my career, self-doubt, and the most impactful, LOST!**

Since August 2022 I've been unemployed but i went to like 4 or 5 interviews but nothing really happened because maybe it's a Portugal thing people only want to hire for internships on my area (because the government pays half of the 700€+- salary) so yeah.

I do love videography, but I dont think im that great at it anymore.

**So right now I have to make a life changing career decision and some feedback, advice.**

I have 2 options:

1- I have a job offer from the biggest football club in my country to be a videographer for them, the Wage is a bit less than 1000€ but it's related to something I love, Football.

* Pros: Football, Video, Very close to my parents house.
* Cons: There might not be a future in my area (No climbing the corporate ladder, promotions), Wage, Schedule (Since its a club I have to go to all games and edit the footage after the games).

2- Enroll in a intensive programming course for 8 months and just roll with that. (I'm already am in talks with one)

* Pros: Refreshing, New beginning, seems like a area with future, heard some people could work from home 2 to 3 days a week, Wages seem enticing.
* Cons: Don't know if I'll suck at it or no, or if the future is as bright as people who enrolled on this make it sound.

I think I left a lot I wanted to say because I suck at organizing and communicating my thoughts.

So if you're interested in helping and have any questions about this text let me know.

Thank you if you took your time to read all of this."

* Since February 2022 I was on and off jobs, I worked one day for a dental company as a videographer but i hated it so much because it was old school and I was gonna get cooped up inside of the office 8 hours a day and that kind of made me scared and i quitted that job (I was gonna get paid 1000€ after tax) which was not bad, but i hated what i was going to do, editing videos for health and being locked in a office.
* 1 month after, I got another job, Videographer for a Hair Transplant company, the salary was better (1100€) but I only stayed there for 1 month, Yes I locked up in a office 8 hours a day which I hated, I saw the boss making the Intern cry 2 times, and believe it or not the first 2 weeks I only went to the office to stare at the wall, because they didn't had equipment for Video or a ""good"" PC. So yeah, I said f\*ck it to that job and quit again because the environment was very old school and toxic, a lot of ""power play"".
* 1 week after I landed a job I was applying while at the transplant company, to an FIFA Esports team to be their videographer. Now job was very bad in salary wise, but so much more chilled, (800€ but not contract - kind of of a freelance but I'm still their employee and need to put 8 hours a day kind of thing) this seemed fun for me because I'm sort of a gamer myself and it was my favorite game FIFA. But this was only for 3 months because they just need someone to cover the end of the season for their videos to the socials.

So all of this brings me to today's day, **unemployment, unhappiness with my career, self-doubt, and the most impactful, LOST!**

Since August 2022 I've been unemployed but i went to like 4 or 5 interviews but nothing really happened because maybe it's a Portugal thing people only want to hire for internships on my area (because the government pays half of the 700€+- salary) so yeah.

I do love videography, but I dont think im that great at it anymore.

**So right now I have to make a life changing career decision and some feedback, advice.**

I have 2 options:

1- I have a job offer from the biggest football club in my country to be a videographer for them, the Wage is a bit less than 1000€ but it's related to something I love, Football.

* Pros: Football, Video, Very close to my parents house.
* Cons: There might not be a future in my area (No climbing the corporate ladder, promotions), Wage, Schedule (Since its a club I have to go to all games and edit the footage after the games).

2- Enroll in a intensive programming course for 8 months and just roll with that. (I'm already am in talks with one)

* Pros: Refreshing, New beginning, seems like a area with future, heard some people could work from home 2 to 3 days a week, Wages seem enticing.
* Cons: Don't know if I'll suck at it or no, or if the future is as bright as people who enrolled on this make it sound.

I think I left a lot I wanted to say because I suck at organizing and communicating my thoughts.

I have internships lined up for this summer and next, i’m transferring schools to be at a school that i don’t despise (i hate my school but it’s a whole diff story)

i have plans for the next few years that i’ve worked very hard for and put a lot of time and thinking into, and i’m really happy with the trajectory im on.

i want to go to grad school and travel after college, and my new school (for grad school) has opportunities for study abroad for graduate students that would fit both my time frame and wants right now

my mom is pushing it and thinks i’m too much of a home body, or because of my anxiety, or a multitude of other reasons, but it’s truly because i don’t want that for myself right now and i don’t think i should be forced into a program and waste my time and energy and her money, when easily she could back off and push it when i actually want to go study abroad.

tldr: my mom wants me to study abroad asap, i want to wait until grad school or travel after college. help??"

I am a fourth year software engineering student and have only 1 semester remaining before I graduate (graduating in May 2024). I have 2 terms for internships, Summer and Fall 2023. I have previously interned at two companies (4 month and 8 month).

This recruitment season looks real bad. I got like 3 interviews, rejected for 1, ghosted for another and interview was cancelled for the 3rd due to ""business decisions"" and they stopped hiring.

I reached out to my manager from my previous internship for a return offer for 4 months. I still want to try for Fall 2023 internships to get into a better place than that. But, My manager is really pushing for an 8 month term. They said if I am okay with 8 month, I can join.

I really like the team and the company culture and it is a decent name. But I kinda don't want to go back to the same company and the same team for another 8 months and specially because these are my last internships before I graduate. I want to try something different and get experience at a different company as well/

I dont really know what to do here as I am unsure if I will get anything for Summer at this point if I decide not to accept the offer. And if I do accept the offer, I dont know if I compromising for my Fall Internship.

Would really appreciate some advice from you guys!"

10m88ff,3,2023-01-26,Need advise on how to lead a normal life.,VegetableMany6443,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/10m88ff/need_advise_on_how_to_lead_a_normal_life/,"I’ve reached my breaking point, I’ve been half arse trying to sort my life out for nearly two years now. I can’t maintain a good habit for more than a day. 

I’m going to provide some context regarding my regular day to aid in scoping advise ~ any of which is greatly appreciated. 

I’m a uni student diagnosed at 18, I’m medicated on Ritalin and essentially hate myself for borderline achieving nothing in the last two years. I go to sleep every night telling myself tomorrow is the day I do this, and every single time I near enough fail. 

I struggle to wake at an appropriate time even after setting a million alarms, I then struggle to eat breakfast ~ partly due to not knowing what to eat/Ritalin subsiding my appetite. If I do wake at the intended time, 90% of the time I’ll stay in bed for an hour then get up and do nothing of value until about 1pm when I finally get ready for the day. (Assuming I have no commitments that require me to get out of bed). From there I’ll set up my computer to do university work and surf the web for several hours (1 more video/article etc) until I eventually start my work and only manage to do work  for a single hour before I take a “break” for four hours. Then all it takes is one friend to call me on discord and I’m wasting my life on video games, this is followed by a football match/tv show that is dropped weekly/or researching an area of my module that has no  relevance to examination (would be a good thing if I learnt and revised the required stuff first..). Then it’s late, I can’t take more medication or I won’t sleep and I’ll piss about until I go to bed - which I will sit on my phone doing the same thing until I eventually go to sleep knowing I’ve failed to accomplish the bare minimum, let alone done anything to advance my career or aspirations :(.

There are some days where the first half of my day will go perfectly, then I’ll think I’m on track and take a “break” etc. But I’ve only truly experienced a good day (get up eat, gym, school work, working on myself, free time, bed early) a handful of times. 

Other factors include eating habits: when off Ritalin I’ll eat when hungry and will eat lots, when taking it ritalin for sustained periods (exams etc) I lose my appetite, drop 20 pounds and can’t go to the gym (I’m 6.2 190 for the record). I go from eating 3000 calories to scraping 1500. Which in turn worsens my ADHD. 

My sleep and health is much better when off Ritalin and I’m more of a normal person but I can’t pick up a pen for more than literally 2 minutes. 

I used to be poor at “doing what I said I would”, but have massively improved on that largely because my girlfriend has bad anxiety and letting her down is not an option.

I’ve no clue how I’ve got this far, I still get good grades 2:1-1:1 while attending nothing and studying next to nothing (I’m fucked in year three if I don’t sort myself out). But it feels so fucking shitty knowing what I could achieve, yet my “disability” knee caps me.

One thing to note is that I have a very addictive nature but not in a “i need do this or i cant function way”, but where I’ll just go and do something else obsessively if I’m restricted from my primary stimulus. (Bored of X game - plays guitar/piano for 3 hours etc). I don’t know how to direct this characteristic into useful things.

Today I’ve downloaded software that renders any application not relevant to my work useless 9am-9pm so hopefully that will be a start.


I apologise for the lack of coherence and continuity throughout this post - I’m on the verge of falling asleep. 


But any advice on eating habits on medication/sleeping/fucking doing my uni work/eradicating useless time wasters so I can focus on my future (I have bursts of hyper-focus regarding things like generating passive income/getting internships etc, but the last true one was several months ago and it’s profits are all dried up).

Any advice regarding CBT/hypno therapy. 

It would be great to hear some success stories from people similar to me. Any advise would be amazing as I just want to be normal. 

Notes:
-taking short breaks doesn’t work for me, as a short break wont end
-I don’t even experience true stress that could be used to scare me into studying
-my mental health is actually very good as I’ve always had a optimistic but pragmatic mindset ~ Im happy as a person but I can’t begin to imagine how happy life could be without adhd.
-I’m extremely reliable when it comes to people I don’t care about for some reason (part time job/meetings) but used to be late for lots of social things

NOTE: All revenue estimates are from [this](https://gamalytic.com) tool posted here last week. This is gross revenue, so the amount in pocket is much less. This is only counting Steam releases (unless someone knows of good estimators for other platforms), I deliberately ignored mobile or flash only posts.

It seems like the only success is post 9, where they grossed a total of $771.9k. However, this is over 5 years, which is $154.38k per year. According to [this](https://letsmakeagame.net/steam-game-revenue-calculator/) tool, this would be more like $61,084/year net, hmm.

I just recently received a couple of internship offers and I am just stumped on what to choose. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and have received offers from two companies TJX Distribution Industrial/Mechanical Engineering internship and ICM Mechanical Engineering internship. TJX is offering a higher pay overall and a housing stipend which is 200 miles away from me, while ICM is a HVAC contractor company in my hometown that works in surrounding areas will require transportation which is offered by the company already and provides hands on work. Both internships are in the summer. I am just confused on which job to choose and which of the two internships would benefit me more academic wise. I'm confused on what to choose.

This is ICM: 

 A few areas in which to gain work experience include:  


* Understanding the fundamentals of HVAC preventative maintenance (PM)
* Troubleshooting, repair, maintain install commercial and industrial HVAC equipment
* Work with customer facilities in support of project-based contractual requirements in a cost-effective manner
* Commercial and Industrial refrigeration training
* Provide field support to technicians at basic and advanced levels
* Basics of controller point types and how a logic statement functions from Input to Output
* Basic rules of a BACnet communication bus and how it should be installed
* Gain working knowledge of air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers and cooling towers
* Assist in the installation of various size Variable Frequency Drives (VFDS
* Fundamentals of estimating and job/bid proposals

 This is TJX:

 

**/** Hands-on experience in a worldwide logistics operation responsible for millions of units in inventory

**/** Dynamic and collaborative environment with an emphasis on problem solving to increase efficiency

**/** Robust classroom and on-the-job training to facilitate learning with ongoing mentorship from leaders

**/** Inclusive culture and career growth opportunities

**/** Support in execution, delivery, and achievement of operational business goals and objectives

 

Through this internship, you’ll have the opportunity to:

**/** Lead a summer-long process improvement project using the DMAIC process and lean methodologies

**/** Conduct frequency studies to develop, update, or validate frequencies within standards

**/** Facilitate time studies to validate labor standards

**/** Sort and analyze statistical data from observations and work sampling through Excel

**/** Learn about TJX and how our business is run by spending time on the operations floor with area supervisors

**/** Leverage JDA for pulling performance reports and job code mapping"

Almost 60-80% of students go for it, as they believe all these investments could now be reaped through this new phase of life. But as a student from a not-so-rich background aiming to apply for a Master's degree, with just internships as my experience, this is extremely difficult. My friends getting placed with amazing money offers, while I am waiting for acceptance. And the worse thing is, all of my safe schools are of higher rank🥲.
Though I have a okayish UG profile, the fear still haunts me. The question of What if I don't get accepted. I might have wait for the next cycle, which is one year. I could have invested that time in a job, but now I have none. Even if I try for a post, I have to compete with other professionals rather than students to obtain it.

My new job thankfully works heavily out of sql, python, and excel. My question is, since I didn’t have internships and didn’t make it into ib, do I still have a chance at making it into “high finance” (ie hedge fund analyst/portfolio analyst at at a firm like pimco)? I know my background is pretty data heavy so should I consider a data path and try to go into tech instead?

10mh1u3,0,2023-01-27,I struggle to trust my girlfriend and want to be able to trust her better/fully trust her.,Professional_Cut_683,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10mh1u3/i_struggle_to_trust_my_girlfriend_and_want_to_be/,"I apologize for any mistakes in my English, it's not my native language.

Me (20m) and my girlfriend (18f) have been together for about 3 months. We met on vacation and are long-distance but so far everything has been perfect and we've seen eachother at least once a month. The relationship itself is also going really good, ofcourse distance makes it hard but like I said it's been going good. 

We're both young, and would both like to go to parties every now and then. My girlfriend also has to go on 2 international internships this year, both being 8 weeks (16 in total). She's going to warm/tropical places, one in Europe (where we both live) and one in the Caribbean. She told me she wants to party there besides doing her internship work and make friends. The thing is, I'm really really struggling with trusting her not to do anything shady and cheat on me, either sober or drunk, while she's gone on her internships. She told me she trusts me when I would go to a party or go out with friends in the future and that she trusts me not to cheat on her. I know she likes to wear dresses (and wow she looks so beautiful in them) but when she wants to go to parties during her internships she'll probably wear one of those club dresses, she said herself. 

The problem is that, like I said, I'm struggling with trusting her not to do anything shady and cheat on me, either sober or drunk, when she's out partying. In my head, parties and clubs are just a place to hook up and kiss strangers but ofcourse people say that girls usually just go to parties with friends to dance. Still, I can't shake the thought of parties just being places to hookup and kiss strangers. We talked about me finding this difficult and having the fear of her cheating on me while she's partying during her internships, and she told me she wouldn't and we'll work through it by maybe her texting every now and then while she's out. I just find it difficult. I know I'm an overthinker. This is also her first relationship and my second, and my ex really fucked with my mentality and trust due to her being extremely toxic and manipulative because of her mental issues. Also adding in the fact that I have had to do almost everything in life on my own, I find it hard to trust people, including her. 

I want to improve my trust in her though and trust her fully likes she does with me. I want to tell her she looks good, have fun, to stay safe and update me while she's out. I want to be able to give her space and not be insecure/not trusting her while she's out partying while on her internships. I want her to know that I trust her. I want to be one of those people that can just trust their partner while they're out to not cheat on them, either sober or drunk (I don't think drunk is an excuse). I just don't know how. So many times I tell myself that I either trust her or I don't and that if she does cheat while she's gone it's her loss and her problem and that it's better for me to not be with a cheater. So many times I try to put myself in her shoes and know that she would feel way better when I'd trust her to not cheat when she's partying. 

She's not super good at communicating, I'll say that, but it's becoming better and better. She's also never given any reason for me to assume she'd cheat. 

It's just so difficult for me to trust her. What if she does cheat? What if she cheats while she's drunk and says she regrets it? Does she wear short dresses to get the attention of other guys? Does she wanna party to have fun and dance or to do something with someone? Would she let other guys flirt with her, or even worse, flirt back? What if she finds someone she likes better? What if she cheats on me? What if she wants to go partying on her internships because those are places to hookup and kiss strangers? What if, what if what if... 

I want to improve my trust in her, and of course it takes time and it'll get better but I know this is something I need advice on, which is why I'm here. So hopefully someone can help me with this and give me advice on how to improve this. Thank you so much in advance. 

TLDR: I struggle with trusting my girlfriend, especially for her to not cheat on my while she's partying during her 2 international internships this year. She trusts me not to cheat and I want to be able to do the same for her since that's ofcourse so much healthier in a relationship than to not trust your partner. I just struggle with it. What if she cheats while she's out? Does she wear club/short dresses for the attention of guys or for herself? Will she allow people to flirt with her or even do it back? Does she wanna go partying because people hookup and kiss strangers there? What if, what if, what if... I wanna be able to trust her, tell her how good she looks when she shows me her outfit, tell her to have fun, stay safe and update me and not sit at home overthinking and fearing she's cheating on me. How do I imrove me being able to trust her?"

I am in my final internship semester and have had such a rough go of it attendance-wise and it’s only January. I have already missed two days.

At the start of the semester my grandfather ended up in the ICU so I took a day off to go be with him. 

And now my car has completely died on me. I go to school two hours away from home so I have no familial support to pick me up and drive me. No one in my sorority (or other clubs and orgs) were available to pick me up (and yes I did offer to pay them) &amp;&amp; despite being in a college town I could not get Uber or Lyft to find me a driver this morning. 

I e-mailed my OFE &amp; CT this morning but I am feeling so discouraged. I feel like I’m disappointing everyone because of my circumstances. I should not be failing this hard just to get to school one month in. 

Does life ever just “get in the way” per my cooperating teacher? Am I going to have a hard time getting a job because of this month’s attendance? Am I really disappointing people or am I just overreacting?"

I study computer science in a somewhat renouned university in Brazil, but the past year I noticed that in my specific major, it is pretty bad. I don't have courses like Linear Algebra or Calculus, which is pretty bad, since my dream is getting a Masters degree in CS in the US or in Europe. Would I ever have a chance of getting into a Masters program without these subjects? I have the option of adding Linear Algebra and Calculus to my curriculum, but I'm an intern and the classes take place during work hours.  Should I just change to a different university? Should I go for an online course like ""Mathematics for Machine Learning""?  
First post here, thanks."
10mmfq3,1,2023-01-27,Help- in a career dilemma of sorts.,kraken_enrager,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10mmfq3/help_in_a_career_dilemma_of_sorts/,"


So I’ll be completing schooling in like 1.5 months and am gonna pursue law as a profession(in my country law can be done straight outta school)

I have 3 broad options, but don’t know what to choose. I’d really really appreciate it If any lawyers or someone knowledgeable about the field can help me out. 

1. I’ll get into NLU Jodhpur or Kolkota with NRI quota, take that and study there.(both tier 1 law schools)

2. Go for Jindal Law School(private law school, rich ppl go in when they don’t get in any good place)

3. Get into GLC/random uni(no attendance required), but work right under a senior partner at Khaitan(one of the best law firms in India) for 5 years full time(we know someone). 

———

I think it’s important to note that as far as internships are concerned, we have quite a few good connections so I can get pretty good internships in india and abroad as well— I plan on doing 10 in 5 years if I don’t go with the 3rd plan above. 

——— 

With that out of the way, I want to do MBA post law or LLM in a super niche field(corporate fs), is that a wise option? I’m presuming my resume will be good enough to be accepted into any Ivy/Oxbridge/tier 1 uni. 

———

Now for my actual career path, 

I have 2 things in mind,

1. The normal law path— I’ll likely make partner in 8-10 years, and start a boutique firm a few years post that. 

2. My own business, my parents have excellent industry connections in the heavy industry and finance world(f500 level), so with their knowledge and help I will likely be able to start my own industry and stuff. 

Ideally I’d want to start a heavy Industry—something in shipping, mining, chemicals, metals etc. stuff I have family background in. 

———

Could y’all please please help me out with this. Thanks!!"
10mmydk,1,2023-01-27,Weird Dilemma (Internship interview),ImpressiveYam4082,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10mmydk/weird_dilemma_internship_interview/,"Sorry for this being long btw. ....I study food science, and I went to a career fair looking for a summer internship. A very big and well known company wanted to interview me the next day and it was exciting. During the interview they asked me a question that caught me off guard. They said would you be comfortable eating and preparing pork, beef, chicken, and peanuts. Now the thing is ... I follow a kosher diet (not strict but I stick to the general rules) and while, I am comfortable handling all those things, and testing them for anything the company needs ... I wont be able to consume them. Now, I genuinely did expect this to come up as I was expecting questions about qualifications etc.  I just said yes in that moment ....

&amp;#x200B;

The company is contacting me to interview further with them and are interested in me. I feel bad, and not sure what to do. Is there something I could bring up, saying I am comfortable not eating but only handling those products in a way that's awkward? Of course any non-meat product or fish is totally fine!

I have been having trouble finding positions and getting interviews applying online and just didn't want to crash a potential opportunity to learn about my field and build my experiences on my resume. I have tried applying to companies that better fit my restrictions such as beverage companies, dairy, seafood etc ... when I apply I dont ever get a response :( 

Any advice would be appreciated."

This is the resume that I used when I got offers from Facebook, Amazon, Google, Capital One, etc.: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzxHhOLe6zCJnc\_usqBO-fzNsB1OjEl9/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=108870502914037679947&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzxHhOLe6zCJnc_usqBO-fzNsB1OjEl9/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=108870502914037679947&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

It has a ton of room for improvement, but it still got the job done.

Hey, I’m Joon; currently a software engineer at Instagram :) I wish I had known about this subreddit when I was going through internships/FT recruiting cycles. The internships and FT recruiting grind is tough to say the least. I didn’t have people to talk to honestly about stuff back then, but I was fortunate to meet some upperclassmen who went out of their way to take me under their wings to show me how things were done. I love the fact that people in this subreddit are here to answer questions for people like me back then.

To try and pay their generosity forward in whatever way I can, I started by going through this subreddit’s resume review/roast thread to see how I could help. [r/csMajors](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/) is full of bright individuals who’ve accomplished so much. Yet, some resumes made it hard for me understand, in just one scan, what candidates have done previously. I would love to individually submit feedback for each resume, but unfortunately I get caught up with things.

As the tech industry continues to face layoffs and economic uncertainty, it's more important than ever to make sure your resume stands out from the rest. A tight, well-written resume can mean the difference between getting an interview and being overlooked.

I’m by no means a recruiter. But, after submitting hundreds of resumes and reviewing hundreds more, I've found that the resumes that stood out the most had these four key elements.

(If you consume information better via videos, here’s the same content but with visuals: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN\_myIGkEtM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN_myIGkEtM).)

I’ll try to supplement each point with examples. And I’m happy to try and answer more specific followup queries:

1. They were easy to read.Stick to simple templates and familiar fonts (Times New Roman, Garamond, and Arial are your best bets). It’s ok to be visually boring; this isn’t where you should stand out. Make sure your resume answers the important questions in an order that makes sense. This is the template I used - it’s a modified version of my college’s career service office’s template. But, it works. No fluff, no weird structuring. Link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfIwLW1NxNHBDTx6\_TVTAtwCtYgi\_McwmuF8-OwopvU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfIwLW1NxNHBDTx6_TVTAtwCtYgi_McwmuF8-OwopvU/edit?usp=sharing)Recruiters spend on average 6-8 seconds looking at your resume. What this means is that recruiters come up with a quite binary response to your resume, “yes” or “no”. You’ve already done the hard work of doing projects and working as interns. Help recruiters get to a “yes” for you.Keep most bullet points to just a single line. Don’t try to explain too many things with each bullet point. This will force you to be concise while making it easier for recruiters to follow you.  
Ex.If you’re looking for internships or new-grad opportunities, I personally recommend sticking to this structure from top to bottom: personal info → education → work experience → projects/university leadership → skills &amp; interestsOnce you’ve graduated and you much more work experience under your belts, you can prioritize work experience over education and perhaps get rid of “projects” altogether.
2. They articulated the applicant's impact.Buzzwords alone don’t effectively communicate your accomplishments. Highlight what you did and your impact as the front-and-center item and don't include unnecessary details. Companies are interested in your ability to provide impact, not just in your ability to master dozens of technical frameworks.It can be so easy to lose ourselves in listing the technical implementation details. But your resume should highlight the cream of the crop - the best of the best that you’ve done so far. Talk about the RESULTS of your work and WHAT you did to help teams succeed over nitty-gritty “HOW”.  
Ex.&lt;Bad&gt; ”Built a full-stack web-application using ReactJS and NodeJS frameworks for the company’s promotional website.”&lt;Better&gt; ”Drove 100% of new sign ups by engineering company’s promo-website from scratch in ReactJS and NodeJS”
3. They used numbers and metrics to quantify the applicant's impact.Show, support, and dramatize the impact of your previous work by putting metrics and numbers all over your accomplishments.Numbers are a shared language between engineers and recruiters. Your fellow engineers might know how challenging it must have been to write certain APIs, but recruiters might not. However, they certainly know what it means to enable certain experiences for users, to drive sign-ups, and to bring in thousands of dollars in revenue to your company due to your feature engineering.A quick playbook for how to make your bulletpoints stand out with numbers:

* First, define the most impactful thing you did
   * features you built, classes taught, debugging, etc.
* Second, what metric did that thing move?
   * revenue, new sign-ups, user engagement, student engagement, etc.
* Third, how much of that metric did you move?
   * $? %? Resources saved?
* Ex.Let’s use the same example from above. Say you built out a promotional website for a company end-to-end. The thing you did is easy to identify, it’s the website you built. The metric you moved is probably new users that were attracted to the company’s products due to the website. Finally, think about how many new users you attracted in sheer numbers of percentages, and pick whichever looks more impressive.

4. They boasted the applicant's individuality. Show that you're an independent thinker by pursuing projects that you truly care about.Building projects on your own is tough and challenging, so make it enjoyable for yourself at least! If you have hobbies, frame the goal of your projects to be in the world of your hobbies. You will have so much fun and your project will be more interesting and intriguing.At some point down the road in the recruiting timeline, you’ll get asked a question, “what’s something you’ve built that you take pride in”. This question prods the candidate’s ability to talk about what they did and their individuality. What do you care about, what have you worked on around what you care about, etc. You’ll have such an easy time answering this with projects you’re passionate about.  


Ex.I loved teaching since high school. Throughout college I took any and all opportunities to teach programming and coding to students of all ages, domestically and internationally. I just had a genuine blast working with students and like-minded teachers from all over the world. And, it was by far one of the things that made me standout as a candidate through the recruiting cycle.

Bonus. Write your hobbies and interests at the very bottom

You might have interviews in which you’ll connect immediately with the interviewer based on your interests and hobbies :) Easy way to add a dimension to yourself."

So, I am 18 years old, and I **intern** in a startup that deals with human capital development. I have been leading real teams, with people who are \~college graduates, with real projects since the beginning of september (i was in a different team then, but then came to this one on late october), and I feel like I have never done much in terms of leading team to create actual value, have output.

I know that, as a leader especially, it is really bad to have imposter syndrome and stuff, but in today's team review, our reviewer mentioned how our team is best in terms of people in the entire organization, and if we do our work well, we'd do insane job, create great products and value. And, that got me thinking that I am not leading them well. Like, I am not getting output, so why am I made the team lead? Sure, when I didn't have the ""title"" (I honestly don't care about it) I was leading my team the same way that I do now that I have a title. But then as well, and still now, I don't think we ever produced good output.

I have been trying to do everything. Engaging my team in asynchronous discussions, creating a safe environment, following OKRs and stuff, reviewing them, but I feel like I am not doing a good job. :(

I feel like there's A LOT that's happening when in reality there isn't; it's just me being lazy. I feel like I am wasting my team's potential.

I feel like if someone else comes and leads us, we'd bring out more output. And, the fact that i am thinking this makes me feel like it's the best time for me to get my leadership skills better. But I don't know how to. In the next 15 days, I need to get done with a VERY important project that is like crucial for the better life of all in my organization. I feel so incompetent. I say that i'd do things but I never do. :((

I know how much important people and time are in a startup and it's like I am wasting it. I feel like I am harming the startup more than I can help.

What do I do?

ugh, a lot of insecurity is in the air, and I am very sorry about that."

Anyways, after 4 months of recruiting hell, I got my first offer and it's for a government contractor that only wants US Citizens. They want me to sign the offer by Monday. Note that I quick-applied to this company, and didn't see it's citizenship requirement. Also, they never mentioned citizenship anywhere in the interview process.

I understand that some government contractors need to get their employees certain clearance to have them work on-site, which is only possible with a US Citizenship. However, I'm a green card holder and I've been in government-contractor buildings for tech-related purposes where holding a green card was enough.

I'm hoping that this company doesn't actually need security clearance for interns, and only stated ""US Citizens Only"" because they want interns that can convert to full time with no citizenship complications. The company is also pretty small (\~300 employees) and they really liked me, so I'm also hoping that they're willing to bend the rules a little.

Anyone have any similar experiences? What should I do? My largest concern is that I'll do the internship and then run into legal trouble later (possibly when doing taxes?)

The recruiting process has just really drained me, and I violently want to be able to accept this offer. Thanks so much!"

Its my first post here, and this has been bugging my mind for sometime.

I am doing double major in biology and computer engineering, and since my first major was biology I always sought out research internships and got pretty decent experience in great labs in the field. But more and more I realize research is not something I want to do for the rest of my life. Currently I am one semester away from graduation and I feel like I missed out on something with having no real industry experience (only had one industry internship but it was a month and online bc of pandemic).

I think I want to pivot to more software engineering (maybe still in the healthcare field) but not really sure about my chances because it seems that there are a lot of talented engineers who already has more experience in industry than I do. Any advice on how can I make a smooth transition?"

10mtrut,2,2023-01-27,24F looking for career guidance. I have two paths in mind but I don’t know what to choose. How can I decide?,RedFloatingSpaceDog,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10mtrut/24f_looking_for_career_guidance_i_have_two_paths/,"Hey gang! I’m looking for career guidance.  I’m feeling lost and I do not have my family’s support. I’m starting to set out on my own course and build my own identity and career apart from my parents’ expectations but it isn’t easy. I grew up in a typical Asian immigrant family where the diplomas you have is what earns you love and respect. Formal studies and I have never ever clicked. I’ve dropped out of college twice. Both times I went just to make my parents happy. I left with whatever money I had saved and had the incredible chance of volunteering on a family farm in France for a few years where I’ve learned how to do so many things and so much about myself. It’s been a great opportunity to try many different things. I’ve always been somewhat of a tomboy. Much to my family’s dismay, I have always been drawn to “manly” careers and what my family views as “low class manual labor”. I am quite introverted and highly dislike dealing with people. I found that out because where I volunteer does Airbnb. The chit chat and cleaning up before and after people I found is something I hate. Extensive socializing is extremely draining for me in a working context. In school I also stayed in my corner, and ate lunch alone. I’m very happy on my own. I’ve also had internships behind a desk and screen and get restless after a couple hours even if the work is mentally stimulating. I love being outside, doing physical work, working with animals, my hands, and with tools. Some of my favorite things I’ve done here is learn to fell trees, chop firewood, repair fences, change my own oil, and much more. Even when the hours and days go by, the going gets tough, and the weather is terrible, this type of work is still very much my preference. I trained my very first working sheepdog by myself and she is coming along very well! Working and problem solving with her to take care of the sheep is definitely the work I cherish the most. My hobbies include hiking, hunting, and training for and participating in sheepdog trials. My experience made me realize how much I enjoy many different aspects of farming and how much I love to DIY. My goal is to have my very own homestead to be as food independent as possible (not totally off the grid like making my own shoes and tools and such), make a name for myself in the sheepdog trialing world, and create a board and train/ training school for working sheepdogs. 

For now, I’m looking for a career path that would provide me with a high degree of autonomy in my work life. I see two main paths: 1. Stay within farming, work with my dogs, and be a shepherd for a living. Or, 2. Learn a skilled trade in something that would allow me the time and means to raise my own sheep. I could train and trial in my spare time. Some homesteaders talk about part time work that pays well so they have enough time and money to dedicate to their homestead projects. Additionally, expertise in a skilled trade (welding, carpentry, etc) would provide useful in any homestead setting.


Ideally I would love to be able to work with my sheepdogs. If I stay in France, the tradition of transhumance is very much alive and kicking here (for the record I am a US citizen). My original plan was to work as a transhumance shepherd and do contract work during lambing time, shearing, etc, or on a ranch in the states. With regards to farming I’m open to working pretty much anywhere in the continental USA and Europe, but would not be opposed to shepherding work in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand. I love the environment, lifestyle, and tradition here in shepherding, but work in France doesn’t pay as well in general. Work in agriculture doesn’t pay well in general. I’m worried I’ll struggle long term. It’s just me, my two dogs, and no other dependents, so I’m open to working anywhere we are needed. The advantage with being a shepherd or farm/ranch hand is that free housing is often a part of most contracts and I’d be able to save up. With regards to skilled trades, I need to do more asking around to see what fields would be a great fit for me.  Learning a trade would likely offer me better pay and more security. At the same time, while it’s not my favorite thing, it’s work that I’d find exciting and engaging. I saw that many apprenticeships will pay you. I think this could be a great route but I would need to find a way to incorporate raising livestock and working with my dogs in my spare time, as this is truly where my heart is. 

Thoughts? Thanks all so much!!"
10mv6z2,4,2023-01-27,Is a positive manager who doesn’t really get mad the norm or a fluke?,lethrowaway465,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10mv6z2/is_a_positive_manager_who_doesnt_really_get_mad/,"So some time ago, my old manager quit and was replaced with a new one. 

The old manager was a really nice person. She was super encouraging whenever our team made mistakes and never got mad. The new manager has a very different style- if someone makes a mistake, her first instinct is to get mad and lecture them. She’ll give someone a 10 minute lecture for making a typo. She doesn’t really yell, but she definitely has a frustrated/angry tone, and often says things that are just discouraging and critical (not in a constructive way). Sometimes she’ll even single people during group meetings. 

The thing is, I don’t think the quality of work has really improved under her leadership. It’s roughly the same trajectory as with the old manager; the only difference is, nobody really likes work now. Personally, I feel like I’m trying to improve out of fear/nervousness (whereas with my old manager, I tried to improve because I respected her and really wanted to do better). I know many of my team members feel the same way, and some of them have even mentioned they’ve been jobhunting solely because of this manager. 

The thing is, we’re all young/pretty new to the workforce. So I can’t tell if this is unusual, or if I just got lucky with the old manager and this new one is the norm. All my previous work supervisors have been really nice, but those were school internships and stuff so idk if I can compare. Can someone who maybe has more knowledge about this share their general experience with manager attitudes? Ultimately, I want to know if this is something I shouldn’t need to deal with, or if it’s normal and I just need to get used to it. Thanks! 

TLDR: in your experience, do managers tend to be really nice and encouraging about mistakes? Or is it more likely they’ll be mad and frustrated?"

My grades are pretty good (GPA 3.67, will be 3.7 if all goes well), and I have a handful of certifications (in AWS and Scrum), and had an internship (business related but not IT). My current skills are in Microsoft Office, Python, HTML, MySQL, Tableau, AWS, and Googling. Other coding language/app developing skills are just in the beginner stage and aren't anything of substance yet.

I was talking to someone that has been in the tech indutry for a while and they outright said that the industry barely cares that I have a degree at all. On top of this, he suggested that I need to format my resume in such a way that it is heavily catered for each individual role and position that I apply for. What this includes is the long list of technical skills they've mentioned (some of which I've never learned in school), more certifications, and to put a very substantial project on github tied to my name.

Where do the requirements for an entry level IS/IT position end? Isn't entry level supposed to mean that I learn along the way? Am I simply not applying for the right kind of positions? (Open to anything IT/IS related.)

The thought that I might've simply not done enough to qualify myself is very defeating as my journey through college is coming to a close.

10mxbuk,2094,2023-01-27,Made $200k last year while still in college,littlesauz,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/10mxbuk/made_200k_last_year_while_still_in_college/,"I've had this in my draft post for weeks and idk if it's of any value to anyone at this point but here goes:

Got the final numbers this week and to my disbelief, I 8x’d my income between 2021 ($25k) and 2022, while still in college.

Realizing I made this money last year hasn't made me any happier than when I worked at a restaurant for $2k/mo, but I did learn more last year than any other year, about business and life. Hopefully there's something in here that helps someone out there.

My business is an ecommerce business, I buy containers of product that I've white-labelled from a manufacturer in China and sell it online. I don't work from a beach in Bali or drive a nice car, most of my year was sitting behind a computer at my desk, answering calls, visiting the warehouse, etc. My day-to-day resembles most 9-5 jobs. But, I'm making enough money to support myself and building equity, and that's been the #1 goal since I got started.

Some background, my first experience in business was a drop shipping business that I started in 2020. It had all kinds of issues and stressed me the fuck out, but I managed to sell it in the summer of 2021 for $15k. People always say ""don't sell unless it's a life changing amount of money"" and as dumb as it sounds, $15k at the time WAS a life changing amount of money. I'd never seen that much money at once, and that check proved to me that I was at least capable of creating something valuable. Smiling ear-to-ear, I took my $15k to the bank and enjoyed the rest of the summer without a care in the world.

For two months, I applied to jobs, internships, and got ready for school to start up again in the fall. After a single week of classes, I realized there was no way I'd be able to sit still for another 2 years of school: I had to start something new. I started looking for product ideas.

My criteria was this:

\\- high AOV ($500+)

\\- no local competition

\\- somehow related to my existing product/industry knowledge

Within a few weeks, I stumbled on what I thought was an amazing product that fit my criteria, and decided that instead of leaving my hard-earned $15k in the S&amp;P, I was going to go all-in on starting my own direct-to-consumer business. I blamed most of the issues of the drop shipping business on how dependent I was on the supplier, and thought by taking on more risk and servicing a larger portion of the value chain, I could create something more sustainable (and more profitable). I would buy inventory from a factory overseas, wait several months for it to arrive, brand it, and sell it online.

I started with one order (one pallet) of the product from China in November 2021. This was when shipping rates were still insane so the cost of the product was about $5k and the shipping was $7k via ocean, so after some other costs, ads, Shopify etc I'd pretty much put all the money I had into this new idea. The first pallet took about 4 months to arrive, but in that time I was running ads, sending out samples to customers, and improving the website. I managed to sell the entire first batch of inventory before it arrived, and used that revenue to order another pallet from the factory in January 2022.

By March 2022, the second pallet was sold out and I ordered my first 20' container. This was a huge jump in order size, and suddenly my entire net worth was in that container, plus I had $10k in credit card debt. Everything was riding on that container, if something went wrong I'd pretty much be SOL.

Of course, the manufacturer fucked it up and sent about 35% of the inventory in the wrong colour, with this terrible finishing material that looked really cheap and fake. The product I'm selling is very aesthetic-based and I've priced/marketed it on the higher end, so this was devastating to me. I had a meltdown in my bedroom, yelled a bunch, took some deep breaths, and prayed that this wouldn't sink me. For weeks, I had nightmares of all the 1-star reviews, returns, complaints, lawsuits, etc., but there was nothing I could do. I took photos of the product as it was, put it on the website and hoped for the best.

A small number of people complained, but most people didn't seem to mind the difference (or know the difference, since there were virtually no competitors in this niche), and the ""terrible"" inventory was sold out within a matter of weeks. We even got a few positive reviews during that time which really got the ball rolling.

As usual, when it feels like the sky is falling...it usually isn't.

As the months went by, I kept repeating this process: Ordering product, selling it, calling customers for feedback, having the factory make changes to the product, selling more, repeat.

I sold $80k/month from June-September, $100k in October, $200k in November and $120k last month.

I closed out 2022 with 800k in revenue, I netted about 25%. No employees, some contractors for odd jobs, and a 3PL. From Jan-May I was in school (taking 5 classes) while working a part-time internship in fintech. In May, I went full time into the business, but was back to school in the fall with three classes. My grades have taken a hit as the business has grown but I'm still on track to graduate in April.

I've finally hired a full time employee to handle customer service and am now working on adding new products and pursuing new markets.

As I said in the beginning, I made $25k in 2021. In 2020 I depended solely on COVID checks, and before that I waited tables while pursuing a career in music.

Here's a few of the things that have helped me the most over the past 2 years.

**Be honest about your reasons for doing things**

Ask yourself this - if you could never tell a single soul about what you're doing, would you still do it?

If you could never brag at dinner parties about owning your own business, would you still want to own one? If you couldn't put ""entrepreneur"" in your bio would you still want to be one? If you can't answer these questions honestly, reflect on your reasons for doing what you do. In my experience, it's incredibly hard to succeed at something if your primary motivator is vanity/ego.

The life of a business owner is too ugly and painful to be worth it if you're just doing it is to flex on imaginary haters. I made the biggest strides in life and business after I deleted my instagram account and haven't looked back.

**The silver bullet you're looking for is sacrificing the thing you love the most**

I'm not there yet, but the one thing that's helped me progress more in life and business more than anything else has been giving up one of the things I love the most: alcohol.

I absolutely love the feeling of being drunk, but from March-October last year I didn't have a drop of alcohol and the business objectively wouldn't have done as well as it did if I didn't make that choice. I also felt, like, incredibly happy considering how much bullshit I was dealing with as a never-ending stream of problems and tasked continue to pile on.

The subconscious reward structures I'd built for myself (alcohol to celebrate, to relax, to end the week, etc) weren't really apparent until I stopped drinking. Same went for the escapist tendencies (alcohol to forget problems, mitigate anxiety), I didn't realize how much of a crutch alcohol was until I cut it out for an extended period of time.

Some people don't have crutches at all, some people have different ones like weed, porn, video games, etc. If you have something that you go to when things get really hard, try cutting it out for a few weeks. You'll be surprised at how much more you can handle than you thought, even without your crutch.

Heineken 0% feels 90% as good and has none of the downsides, highly recommend.

**Run towards whatever scares you the most**

Almost every single ""win"" from last year stemmed from doing something that scared the shit out of me. Over-communicating with customers when their orders were delayed by MONTHS. Calling customers personally when they were pissed off and letting them yell at me. Reaching out to people who I deemed to be out of my weight class (celebrities, big retailers, etc) and pitching our product. Putting out content that I'd made myself (that I was starring in) on the company socials. This stuff all scared the shit out of me and I wanted nothing more than to NOT do any of it - ""just bury yourself in the Shopify dashboard, you don't need to do any of that"" is what I told myself.

Every single time that I put my head down and ran towards the thing that scared me the most, I was paid back 10 times over. Customers went from angry to understanding. Big collaborators featured us at no-cost and skyrocketed our growth. Videos went viral, etc. Good things happened that I never would've imagined.

If it scares the shit out of you, run towards it.

That's it - I have no idea what the future will bring, but these are the learnings that have stood out to me the most thus far. Wishing everyone a prosperous 2023"

TLDR: I can’t stop job hopping and I have no clue what I want to do with my life. I have good experience with both large and small companies and I’m a strong performer, but I can’t figure out what I like or what I want to do with the rest of my life. HELP!

Longer Story:

I suffer from job hopping and I think it's partially due to not knowing what I want to do with my life. I’m 26 years old and I’m on my 4th corporate job. I had a quarter life crisis about 2 years ago where I had 2 different jobs in the span of 5 months (not included in the 4 jobs previously mentioned). I took the jobs because its what I thought I wanted and then quit for better opportunities and more pay. I can’t decide on what I want to do, what my “passions'' are, or what industry I even want to work in.

All of my experience is great on paper and I have had a wide variety of experience - I’ve worked for a traditional private equity firm, a startup, a large retailer, and my new role is at a very well known brand (large company). I’ve always felt like my work needed to be part of my identity and I am constantly putting SO much pressure on myself and my career. I’m very impatient, I like to be in control, and I want to be successful (whatever that means). In university I was extremely involved and had 4 internships and a nearly perfect GPA if that describes anything about my type A personality. Ironically, I’m also the first person to say work does not define you and that you need to have passions and interests outside of work, which I do. I can’t seem to practice what I preach. 

My past roles have been analyst/associate positions and I’ve always been frustrated by the fact that I was not in a manager position where I could call the shots. My newest job (started less than a month ago) is finally a manager position which is partially why I took the job, but I am already in my mind thinking “well now that I have this job, what's next?” If I am not progressing and thinking about my future I feel stuck and like an absolute loser. My new company is a large corporation and I honestly hate the large corporate vibe and my absolute end goal is to be self employed doing god knows what. I also get SO bored immediately upon getting a job, but I get an absolute thrill out of interviewing and trying to get an offer, it’s a weird and self sabotaging hobby. 

I always have so much going on in my mind and it’s really stressful, I put so much pressure on myself for absolutely no reason. I’m considering going back to school for my MBA ( bc I don’t know what I want to do and it feels like I’m progressing in life by doing so), but I have no strict 5 year plan, no 10 year plan, just going day-to-day stressing about my future. I have many “dream” jobs across a wide variety of industries and in the end I want to be self-employed (but with NO idea or path to get there). 

I don’t know if I am asking for help or just venting about my work life here, but any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I can’t decide on what I want to do, what my “passions'' are, or what industry I even want to work in.

All of my experience is great on paper and I have had a wide variety of experience - I’ve worked for a traditional private equity firm, a startup, a large retailer, and my new role is at a very well known brand (large company). I’ve always felt like my work needed to be part of my identity and I am constantly putting SO much pressure on myself and my career. I’m very impatient, I like to be in control, and I want to be successful (whatever that means). In university I was extremely involved and had 4 internships and a nearly perfect GPA if that describes anything about my type A personality. Ironically, I’m also the first person to say work does not define you and that you need to have passions and interests outside of work, which I do. I can’t seem to practice what I preach. 

My past roles have been analyst/associate positions and I’ve always been frustrated by the fact that I was not in a manager position where I could call the shots. My newest job (started less than a month ago) is finally a manager position which is partially why I took the job, but I am already in my mind thinking “well now that I have this job, what's next?” If I am not progressing and thinking about my future I feel stuck and like an absolute loser. My new company is a large corporation and I honestly hate the large corporate vibe and my absolute end goal is to be self employed doing god knows what. I also get SO bored immediately upon getting a job, but I get an absolute thrill out of interviewing and trying to get an offer, it’s a weird and self sabotaging hobby. 

I always have so much going on in my mind and it’s really stressful, I put so much pressure on myself for absolutely no reason. I’m considering going back to school for my MBA ( bc I don’t know what I want to do and it feels like I’m progressing in life by doing so), but I have no strict 5 year plan, no 10 year plan, just going day-to-day stressing about my future. I have many “dream” jobs across a wide variety of industries and in the end I want to be self-employed (but with NO idea or path to get there). 

I don’t know if I am asking for help or just venting about my work life here, but any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

My question is: Can how well you interview determine the compensation they offer? I understand there is usually a range and it can be based on experience, but if you go in and just interview really well, represent yourself really well and mesh well with the interviewer can that also get you higher compensation within the range for the position?"

A little background: I recently went through a LONG interview process - eight separate interviews with two directors, four managers and two VPs - for a manager-level position with an organization that seems like an absolute dream to work for. I believe all eight interviews went well (I feel like if any of them the went awful, I wouldn't have made it to this final step), but I know I'm going to be disappointed if I don't get the opportunity. I also understand that's just part of the job process.

Anyway, I have one final interview on Monday with all of the eight people I spoke with for one last panel chat on one final Zoom call. It's nice knowing I made it this far in the process, but I am starting to get nervous that I will be regurgitating a lot of what I talked about over the past few weeks. The hiring manager said this final interview is for the group to ask any follow up questions as well as for me to ask any follow up questions. My question here for the subreddit is: **Are there any ways to stand out in a final interview panel so I'm not just restating everything that I have already told them?** I'm sure there will be new questions I haven't received yet, and I'm in the process of thinking of new, fun questions to ask the group as well, but if anyone has been through a grueling interview process like this, I'm happy to hear what your experience was like.

**A little bit more about the actual job:**

\- It's a manager level position that oversees three coordinators.

\- I've have managed people (interns and an assistant) in the past.

\- The position would oversee three coordinators.

\- It's in a new city on the other side of the USA.

\- Outside of managing, the skills they're looking for are all things I have do currently.

\- The main theme in each of the interviews was not my skillset per se, but on how I can help manage a group of young professionals who need relief after a long year that was capped by their old manager leaving in December.

\- I know eight interviews is A LOT, but I am totally honest when I say that I loved chatting with each and everyone of my interviewers. After each interview, it solidified me on the position, the organization and the culture. A really kind group of individuals who I know really want the right person for this position.

**TL:DR: I really want to nail my ninth and final interview and if there are any suggestions on how to stand out without regurgitating information I already talked about, I would appreciate the advice.**

Thank you so much!"
10n0qau,21,2023-01-27,PSA for accepted students (congratulations!) who didn't get into their preferred major,LASCareerServices,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/10n0qau/psa_for_accepted_students_congratulations_who/,"*We help students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences get jobs, including students in those “what are you going to do with THAT?!?” kinds of majors. Here’s what we can tell you.*

If you got into UIUC, but not the program you had in mind, **you’re going to be okay**. A specific major is one path to the life you want. It's not the only path.

Gate-keepers know gate-keeping: how to administer a fair and consistent process that filters applicants down to a number that they can accommodate in their programs. They make the best decisions they can, but they don't know you, or what you have to offer, or how your strengths fit with what the world needs. **Their decisions shape this particular moment, but they don’t define you.**

The advice below is meant to help you move forward, particularly if you are struggling with the decision of whether to accept your offer at the U of Illinois or attend a different institution that admitted you directly to your preferred major.

The pain of rejection is real, and so is the fallout from family expectations. If you're still processing the news, save this post until you’re ready to think about next steps.

1. **Identify your reasons for applying to that particular program.** Summon your inner five year old, who responds to every question with ""Why?"" Your inner five-year old will not have much patience with the circular reasoning of ""I wanted to go to Gies because I wanted a good career and students in Gies graduate with well-paying jobs so I wanted to go to Gies."" Try to drill down to some bedrock motivations that are unique to you and your situation.
2. **Think about what you want your future to look like.** That good career that you had been counting on a specific major to deliver to you: what is particularly desirable about it? What do you know with certainty that you want to be true of your life five years out from college, ten years out from college? Don't fall back on job titles: think in terms of more general features of work and life satisfaction. Write down the top five things that are important to you, in rough order or priority. (No, everyone doesn't want the same things; your list may look very different from your friends' lists. This is your life you're going to be living, so start owning it.
3. **Think about your next steps for building on those core motivations.** College supplies many learning opportunities regardless of your program: minors, involvement in relevant student organizations, summer internships, information/learning sessions with employers who come to campus, entrepreneurship opportunities. If you remain certain that only a specific major that you’ve been admitted to elsewhere will give you the learning you want, then you have your answer.
4. **If you plan to accept your UIUC admission offer despite not getting into your preferred major, do some research and networking**. There's a lot you don't know about the careers available to you, and talking to alumni is a great way to expand your knowledge. The search bar and filters for alumni on the [UIUC LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign/) will lead you to Illinois alumni who arrived at your chosen career from a wide range of majors.
5. **Talk to the career center or career services professionals in your unit once you get to campus.** They're there to help you figure out how to get from where you are now to want you want.
6. **Pay attention.** What do you do that gives you satisfaction? What skills do you want to develop? What do you tend to do better than other people? What do you often contribute to a team or project? Look for ways to build on your strengths and use them in new ways. Be open to possibilities that sound interesting -- even if you can't quite connect the dots to the future your imagine for yourself.
7. There's not much that any one major prevents you from doing. **If there are technical or quantitative skills that you want to learn, look for ways to learn them.**

Good luck! If you are on campus this fall in an LAS major (or another program but leaning LAS...) come talk to us."
10n1a89,1,2023-01-27,Advice on Work Relationship: Coworker (M27) and Me (F23),whompingwillow123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10n1a89/advice_on_work_relationship_coworker_m27_and_me/,"There is this guy (my superior) I work with that I'm starting to form a crush on who I think is attracted to me but I don't know what to do. We work together in a giant office with dozens of people. I started working at the office about 6 months ago and so did he (he is doing a year-long internship).

&amp;#x200B;

From the moment we met, we have gotten along really well. He is a funny, goofy person who is one of the sweetest people I have met. The way he interacts with people is heartwarming and makes me like him even more. There are a few things that have happened that make me think he is attracted to me but something is holding him back from making a move. My gut is telling me that he is just nervous because he is not someone who exudes confidence and is more on the shy side. I have been told multiple times that I come off as intimidating. Here are some examples:

\- He loves the Spanish language and is always trying to learn it (I am Latina). I was talking to him and one other coworker who speaks Spanish (she is like his work mom). I left the conversation for a minute and when I came back, the coworker told him to repeat what he said to her since I understand Spanish and he knows some words here and there. After she told him to tell me, he looks at me and stares for about 30 seconds until the assistant encourages him again. He then tells me ""Necesito buscar una novia Latina"" which translates to ""I need to find a Latina girlfriend"". I found this odd since the conversation we were having before I left had nothing to do with that topic. And the fact that he was looking at me for so long before saying it.

\-Another example: Our office was having a Christmas party and we all could sign up to say what we were bringing. I had my mind set on bringing iced coffee. When the paper came around to me, I saw that the coworker had put iced coffee. I still wrote that I was bringing iced coffee since I had my mind set on it. I saw this as an opportunity to start a conversation with him. The next time I saw him, I was going to bring up how I noticed he is also bringing iced coffee and what kind was he bringing so he wouldn't bring duplicates. Instead, he started out by saying that we should collaborate. He said he would get the iced coffee so that I wouldn't have to go and I could just venmo him half. The next day I was assisting him with a task and he asked if I would like to go to the grocery store with him after work to get the iced coffee for the xmas party tomorrow. I of course said yes, but I thought it was weird since the day before he said he would go. I got the vibe that he was trying to hang out with me outside of work.

\-One of the coworkers that work with us told me that she constantly sees him staring at me in the halls and goes out of his way to try to get a glimpse of me. She has no idea that I am starting to catch feelings, so it was all her idea to tell me this without any influence.

\-Last example (even though there's a lot more): There is a client of his that loves me and I love her too. She is wonderful and we get along so well. She has come to the office many times and the last time she was here, I smiled at her while he was walking her out. She turns to him and says ""oh my god she is so cute"" and he looks at me and smiles big and says ""yeah she really is"". He did not have to say that and could have just stayed silent.

&amp;#x200B;

I need ideas/advice on how to get him to ask me out without being too obvious. He is very outgoing with everyone but when he talks to me he gets so nervous and only becomes outgoing when I make him feel comfortable.  An important piece of information is that he will be going back home to a different state in 6 months since it's a 1-year internship program.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have a crush on a coworker who is slightly my superior. I have a gut feeling he is attracted to me too but is too shy to make a first move. I listed a few examples above. Once I make him feel comfortable, he opens up and is outgoing like he is with everyone else. But otherwise, he is always shy with me when he is usually not like that. Any advice on ideas on how to get him to ask me out without being too obvious would be greatly appreciated."

10n33j3,24,2023-01-27,Texas Instruments vs Sam's Club/Walmart SWE Internship,shrimpboyho2,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n33j3/texas_instruments_vs_sams_clubwalmart_swe/,"Currently have two offers from the companies in title. Wondering which one is a better option for me and/or any experiences users can share working for said companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Texas Instruments SWE Intern - Dallas, TX

\- $25/hr

\- $1500 Housing Stipend

\- No transportation (won't have my car either)

\- More low level stuff (embedded systems, etc) that I am genuinely interested in.

\- 10 weeks

&amp;#x200B;

Sam's Club / Walmart Global Tech - Sunnyvale, CA

\- $37/hr

\- Housing and transportation included/free (can opt for a $1k housing stipend instead)

\- 11 weeks

\- High level software development unlike TI, which I wouldn't mind doing. I just find lower level systems more interesting.

\- Better location?

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a second year student but am on track to attend graduate/professional school in 2024. Also, this is my final summer to have a SWE internship experience since I have to stay on campus next summer as part of my curriculum track.

I haven't found many experiences of people who interned at TI as opposed to Walmart Global Tech, which have generally been positive. In addition towards the higher pay and location (being in Silicon Valley is def appealing), I am leaning towards Walmart Global Tech. However, I do find that the work at TI does more closely align with my interests.

Would appreciate some thoughts and insights on this."

10n4qij,2,2023-01-27,Workload stress,thegirlwhothinks22,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10n4qij/workload_stress/,"I’ve been at a financial services business for about 8 months.   The training has been poor from the first day of employment.   But I kept telling myself that it would get better and give it a chance.   As time went on I put up with a lot of a attitude from the girl who was supposed to train me and tried my best to ignore the chip on her shoulder.  This person was being groomed for another position and didn’t have much interest or skill in training anyone for anything.   I choose to find out things for myself and seek others who could help.   That helped somewhat but not really enough.   I did bring up my concerns several times to supervisors about my lack of training but it didn’t seem to have a impact.  In the meantime as time went along I started to understand how heavy the workload was and it seemed like I was struggling more and more because of the lack of training.   Next thing I know, the other person who helps out with the job tasks is leaving.   Instead of hiring a full time replacement, it was decided to train an intern for a week and a half and split their duties between preparing taxes and client service.    I brought up again to supervisors my feelings of overload and overwhelmed but it just didn’t seem to again make any impact.    I have been so stressed, full of anxiety, overwhelmed, and literally crying because of it.   It finally got to the point where I gave my resignation.   

Now I’m wondering if I did the right thing.    What are your thoughts?"

Got sick a week ago and was on the road to a nice recovery until suddenly yesterday I started RE-developing a cough for some fucking reason. It only got worse, can't even speak without coughing up a fit. I hate that besides this I would be healthy otherwise, I feel fine but I haven't been able to go to the gym as a result and I feel like shit not being able to improve myself.

I feel so unloved romantically. Turning 20 in a few months and never had my first kiss or lost my v-card yet. Doesn't help that I'm not the party/clubbing type. Never even had a girl express interest in me, not even because they were bored or some shit. I'd like to think that there's at least one girl out there who fancies me, but I know that busying myself with these thoughts will only waste my time and my energy like the last time. What I'm basically trying to say is that although I'm not looking for a relationship, if a girl I thought was attractive came up to me and asked me out I would give it a shot and put my all towards it, fuck that hookup bullshit.

College and jobs/internships, don't even get me started on that shit. I only started coding a year and a half ago so it's only natural I feel that I'm behind everyone else in terms of experience. Seems that everyone else is looking for an internship, launching websites, building up experience with projects. I feel as if I don't belong. I'm planning on waiting until the summer after next academic year to start all this stuff, with this summer mainly being for going to the gym and learning some stuff in my free time, and also getting a job so I can take some load off my parents.

I just want some sort of answer, some sort of sign that this worry is for naught. 

Man that was kind of refreshing, I should do this more often."

But being in the Placement Cell of our college, I get to know how exactly bad is the situation for Placement in our Department (especially in lower NIT like ours). Also I kinda sucks in Coding, so I have no chance of IT jobs and am interested in the Electrical Domain also.

The thing is that there are not many GIS companies, and I sent my resume to do my internship, but no one responds, maybe because I know the basics, now I will do my internship at school with a teacher, but I won't do GIS.

I am afraid because I will not gain experience and I feel that I am failing, and I am going to fail. My coworkers don't do GIS, but now they work in construction in other states and maybe earning a good salary. I know it sounds pessimistic, I try to be positive, but I feel like my life is slipping away.

I want to leave my country, travel, see the world, and I thought that GIS would be a great opportunity to do so.

I think I should start a portfolio, but I don't know where to start. I read that I need python, SQL, database, and I want to learn, but I don't really know where to start.

Sometimes I think that GIS is not a solution to start traveling to other places or countries to work.

Is it a possibility to work abroad with GIS?

I know how to use ArcGIS, CAD, I know some English, I need to brush it up, but how am I supposed to start dabbling in GIS?

Fyi, I do have cs internships but they required no leetcode, just building personal projects which I enjoyed A lot more back then. I advise those who are freshmans- juniors to grind leetcode like crazy and learn your data structure because I didn’t realize how easy OAs can be when you study. From what I’ve learned, your best chances of landing high TC as new grad is to get internships at big tech or equivalent  because the barrier of entry is so incredibly low for interviews"

Last time I posted here was two years ago, I'm back with more details that hopefully lead to a narrowed down list.

Long story short, I'm a developer with only one year of experience in telecom as operations support, besides that I've done few internships in development, but that's about it. I'm currently due to start working as an information analyst soon. The problem here as a female in the middle east I'm finding it hard to find work in IT for obvious reasons.

My end goal is to move somewhere where I can dress as I want and be respected as a professional, so my plan is to do a masters in data analytics somewhere and hopefully not come back. My budget for this is about 34K-39K USD for a year or two. I speak French, English, and Arabic - willing to blend in and learn any language.

That's it pretty much, any countries you can recommend within these criteria where I'm likely to be offered a sponsorship afterwards?  As I know some countries are getting more strict and students have no choice but to go back home. Thanks"

But ever since i was young i was scared to work, i was scared of finding a job, of making a cv and all of that. I am 23 now and my parents are helping me move out on my own. I've already been such a burden to them and to others i might seem lazy. But every single day im getting worse to the point i feel i shouldn't stay alive anymore since i can't even take care of myself. I feel so useless and that no matter how much ill try i will fail at any job and i have these weird thoughts of me working but ending up ruining everything or even hurting someone. That everyone will always complain about me not being good, im scared of interacting with people and not being able to please them. My months on my internship were the worst. I had panic attacks every single day and i would cry in the bathroom every day before starting work i would always be scared i will mess up something or that my boss hates me. 

It never stops. I dont know what is wrong w me. I sadly studied smth i do not like to appeal to my father. And he is pressuring me to follow this proffession even tho i hate it. I genuinely cannot stay here anymore. I for some reason can not communicate with others and i remember many times at my internship id follow the instructions of my boss and she would tell me "" you took it too seriously i didnt mean exactly 3 mins "". Ive had it many times where people would tell me i take everything too seriously which i don't understand im just trying to follow instructions.

All i want is to be good at smth but i always end up being bad at everything. I tried to explain these thoughts once to my parents but they dont seem to understand what i mean. At the end of the day maybe i am lazy?! Im scared im so scared. Does anyone else have that fear of working?"
10nfhm6,49,2023-01-28,Ideas for excercises for learning RTOS,TacticNum,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/10nfhm6/ideas_for_excercises_for_learning_rtos/,"As an assignment for university I have to come up with exercises that teach students the capabilities of an RTOS. But apart from a 4 month internship in embedded software development I haven't had any real world experience in working with RTOSes. Because of this I have a bit of a hard time coming up with ideas of what's important to know for new learners. 

The exercises are supposed to be for students who already know how the basic context switch works and they are also already familiar with concepts like Tasks, Semaphores and Events.

So far I have exercises on creating a FreeRTOS project from scratch, measuring the task level interrupt latency and using a gatekeeper task for synchronization of a shared resource.

Maybe some of you who have more experience than me and are working with RTOS can share some ideas.

So my question would be: What might be some interesting ideas for exercises or what are some things you would have liked to know before working in embedded software development with RTOS?

By the way I'm using an STM32F4 discovery board and FreeRTOS to demonstrate these exercises."

-BS and MA in speech and hearing science. 3.9-4.0 GPA, strong GRE scores

-Lives in the Pacific Northwest

-Income of $50k and despite budget tracking in excel (I know there are apps but I spend less when I do it manually) I tend to come out net negative each month (no savings, just debt including student loans, car payment, medical bills, and credit card debt that I converted to a personal loan). My boss will not pay me more but it’s the only job I’ve had that isn’t high stress/didn’t make me severely depressed and burnt out and the only job with decent health insurance which I absolutely need.

-I work 10 hour shifts and usually study during my lunch breaks and on the weekends. 

-I’m getting the credits needed for a degree in CS. I have taken 2 intro courses, web development, data structures, discrete math, computer architecture and assembly language, databases, open source software, and software engineering. I’m barely more than halfway through my program. I’m 4 required courses and 2 electives away. My GPA is 3.81.

-I’m not that strong in programming. I feel like I’ve barely learned anything from classes because they move too quickly for me and classes are discrete/separate enough I feel like I forget what I learned because my skills aren’t being reinforced and revisited. I have adhd and need repetition to learn. With working so much, I feel like I’m constantly coming up on assignment deadlines and not having enough time to really sit with the material because I’m rushing.  

-because I’m relatively far away from graduation, I’m afraid to do internships because I’ll have no job to return to once the internship is over, and I need the money.

-unmarried/independent female with no relatives who would take me or anything

-I hope to work in data science and NOT web development. My favorite project was when I got to decide what to do on my own, so I did NLP stuff and felt really motivated by that. 


Anyway, I’m burnt out and frankly depressed (and yes I see someone). I withdrew from the winter quarter and signed up for some udemy classes in C instead. I don’t know a single soul where I live because I spend all my time working or studying. I don’t know what to do. I’m broke. The lack of money and lack of social safety net distresses me. 

Should I just keep pushing? Take time off school and try to meet people? Go the boot camp route? Drop out and look for a job while taking data science-oriented udemy courses?"

Counselor: Had a really good relationship w her, she helped me through tough times and I just had an overall really good relationship with her.

**Interviews**

Didn't have any

**Essays**

Think these were my strongest piece. My personal statement was sort of relatable but also somewhat unique (talked about a teacher who helped me find my voice and how I dealt with switching to 12 different schools and the growth that ensued. Most of my essay focused on my growth). Everyone who has read it so far has said it's incredible.

I think my strongest supplements were my UMD Supplements by far but all of them were also really well written.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Northeastern (ED). Admitted for CS+Econ but got 0 finaid so it's gonna be 73k first year. NPC said 36k, desperately trying to appeal but I have no leverage. Fuck me. Would've rather gotten rejected without a doubt. Wanted to apply to Lehigh ED but everyone told me I was gonna get aid and this was my top choice.
* Pitt (Rolling)
* ASU (Rolling), 16.5k merit. Parents don't want me going here
* CU Boulder (EA) not for CS though, Exploratory program (basically undecided)
* UMD (EA) not for CS either, L&amp;S (basically undecided as well)
* Rose-Hulman (EA) gave me really good aid but since it's in the middle of Indiana my parents don't want me going here. Also didn't really like the social scene.

*Deferrals:*

* NC State (EA). Fucked me up since this was my last hope of safely withdrawing from ED. I'm just utterly lost since people with GPAs less than 4.0W have gotten in but people with 1550+ and 4.4W have also gotten flat-out rejected.
* Ohio State (EA). Yeah whatever didn't really care.
* UW-Madison (EA). Also sort of hurt but knew I wasn't standing a chance at T20 CS schools.

*Waitlists:*

* UNC (EA). Didn't have high hopes even as an in-state applicant

*Rejections:*

* Case Western (EA). Didn't hurt in the slightest

**Additional Information:**

Fuck life. NEU Delayed my Financial package by over 1.5 months just to give me 0 aid and since I couldn't bag my in-state flagships I've lost hope. If the appeal works successfully I'll have a happy ending but for now I'm trapped. My parents said they'd cover everything but I know NEU is not worth that price but no matter what I say they say they'll cover it and that I won't have to worry about a thing. My parents cannot comfortably afford this price but again no matter what I tell them I just end up getting yelled at by everyone about being too sensitive or overthinking it. Apparently maybe through some loopholes we may be able to lower the price down the next few years which is a risk I might have to bank on. Since ED won't be binding next year, another option is to maybe try transferring and cut my losses. I'm insanely grateful of their support but I seriously hate the feeling of being a burden on them. I'm an only child so I don't have siblings to worry about but this will hurt anyways.

Now I'm stuck w/ 2 choices for the foreseeable future. UMD will cost \~55-60k/yr for 4 years and NEU will cost 73k the first year but maybe less the next few years. Also no guarantee I'll be able to transfer to a CS major at UMD and I'm dead-set on CS.

A month ago I was having the time of my life. Euphoric, and finally thought I proved myself to everyone after years of getting shitted upon by everyone and being in a shit mental state for over half a decade. But now, I struggle to get up, smile, and feel like a corpse. In a week my life has completely crashed. But I guess the most I can do now is make the best of my situation.

I just wanted to be a good son. My parents (and me) are immigrants and have struggled for years (mom used to work in a gas station at the most dangerous part of Cleveland and is a laborer still, dad was once a waiter and through hard work managed to get into IT) and have finally settled but now I'm gonna be the reason they struggle again. I just can't reason with them anymore. I get their point of view and if I was a father I'd do the same for my kid in this situation but fuck it hurts like nothing else."

10nk5ee,4,2023-01-28,Advice on WE,throwaway_abcdabc,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/10nk5ee/advice_on_we/,"Hey, everyone!

Background:

I’m a 24M URM (Hispanic). Moved to US at 18 and went to a small university were I graduated with a 4.0 Bio degree. Went to a T20 med school but ended up withdrawing, after 2 1/2 years, because I realized that path was not for me. (No debt if that helps for anything) Now, I want to pivot into finance and am looking for advice on how to best prepare.

Education:

4.0 undergrad GPA from a small university.

Med school was P/F so transcript would just have P on all the courses. (I do have a great relationship with the med school, and they have repeatedly said they’d love to write me a letter of rec so maybe one will come from here)

ECs:

About 1,000 hours of volunteering during undergrad split between hospital, clinic, tutoring, nursing home, and medical mission trips.

In med school, I led a cooking class for heart failure patients in med school. Had some translation work in free clinics along with just medical volunteering at the same clinics. I taught a class in medical Spanish, held a leadership position in the Latinx medical society, and mentored many of the lower and incoming classes. Also had other volunteering but it was mainly one-offs like speaking at a fair, etc. Overall, it adds another couple hundred hours.

I have some research, too. A public health paper from undergrad along with some clinical research publications in med school. Will be working in a lab in the short term while I plan out the switch into finance, so that will also potentially add a couple first author publications.

Not sure where to put this, but I also wrote a fiction which generated some income (not retirement money, but enough to pay bills for a while).

WE:

Worked in conjunction with the VA in a program to transition veterans who were in active duty to pursue advanced education. The actual job ranged from counseling about majors, tutoring, outreach to find veterans scholarships, benefits, and other financial resources at their disposal to traveling to different trade schools and community colleges to help veterans transition to jobs. I also led a team of tutors where I did perform interviews to hire them. All in all, I was here for 2 years.

MCAT tutor for about 2 months prior to beginning med school.

The only other work experience I’ll have is the lab work I’ll be starting soon. There’s ample opportunity here to lead a small research team to net some more leadership, but I have no other working experience. 

Hobbies:

Not sure how applicable this is for an MBA, but for medical school applications hobbies were very important.

I founded a club for a sport that I do in med school, and I volunteer at an organization helping people, usually minors, with disabilities to be able to participate in the sport. Another hundred or so hours here.

Also do the aforementioned writing.

The advice I’m looking for is how much the lacking work experience hurts me. Additionally, should I be looking for internships, or given my non-traditional application, is continuing with lab work okay? Transitioning into finance with all my experience being in healthcare is difficult which is why I want the MBA in the first place.

I’m not planning on applying to an MBA this year or anything, but I want to start planning out how to best prepare my CV during the next two years. I apologize if this is not the right place to ask something like this, but the premed and MCAT subreddits were incredibly helpful for figuring out how to become a strong applicant for med school so I figured I would ask here.

Additional info:

I am a first gen.

I also understand advice without a GMAT score may be difficult, but I plan to research it and dedicate an appropriate amount of time to study for it. Hopefully the score will be good so perhaps give advice assuming so if that makes it easier."

I cannot emphasize how important it is to study data structures/algorithms early on and do leetcode early. This advice was given to me when I was a freshman but I neglected to take it seriously since I absolutely struggled terribly and lacked consistency to practice at the time. Although I worked hard and built personal projects, I was able to land internship offers at startups with no leetcode grind. The caveat of this is I missed out on so many opportunities to work for big and stable tech company where I could’ve gotten a return offer. I even had fang interviews. I failed even the most easiest OA in hindsight due to my lack of data structure knowledge and leetcode practice. Now as a senior job hunting, I’ve gotten better with Lc and d&amp;a due to practice and I can’t believe how easy I had it when I was applying for internships than getting a ft job as new grad. They expect more out of you now whereas as an intern the bar for interviews were incredibly easy. Honestly, for those who are currently disliking Lc or struggle with it, I’ve been in your shoes. I use to hate Lc but I struggled with the problems but once I got good with it, man even the hard questions seem so easy to me. All it takes is consistently to do it routinely and study and eventually you will get good and realize how easy these Lc questions can be once you grill down the patterns and their implementation. Projects matter too, but Lc is what ultimately takes you to the next level. I advise those who are freshman’s- sophomores to land an internship at startup so when u are a junior it is so incredibly easy to get callbacks from more companies for internships once u have experience. I can testify to this because I worked for a startup Junior year that paid like sht during the school year and when I was applying for ft roles for the summer, I was able to get callbacks from fang and various big companies from having relevant experience. With this being said, don’t make the same mistake like I did by not studying. It will bite you. It will hurt you if you don’t study and practice. You will just have a tougher time finding a job as a result if you don’t seize the opportunity now as a student to get those internships at big tech or big companies that can land to ft roles. The reason I suggest trying your best to land a role at bigger companies since they are more stable than startups so they have the cash to give return offers for full time. I interned at a startup (250 employees) and the company was not stable to give return offers."

With the entire tech company basically falling into the gutter, why are they advertising a busy recruitment season with “Meta University” and their regular SWE internships. I know a lot of people who have applied for Meta U, and practically nobody has heard back. Heck, will they even hear back AT ALL? What is Meta doing… honestly. Are they just trying to dig themselves into a deeper hole? Are they trying to make a false image that they’re doing okay in numbers, hence why they’re opening new roles when in reality they’re not even hiring for any??

In other words, why hire more and advertise “a busy recruiting season” when in reality they’re still laying off people from day to day??? Could this be them putting a wool over our eyes? They won’t actually be hiring anybody."

10nqsm0,1,2023-01-28,Let the relationship go after 5 years or try to make a solution!,shadow406172,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10nqsm0/let_the_relationship_go_after_5_years_or_try_to/,To explain the topic fully I have recently split with my girlfriend of 5 years it was a mutual and civil breakup that has us both very devastated and upset we are still best friends but we really do both want to be together and make it work no matter what. I'm 22 almost 23 now I know im not that old but 5 years is a decent part of my life and we did everything together and shared all of our interests we were best friends and identical to eachother. The real issue here starts with covid as I was in my last 2 years of college with her at the time and because of covid I could not do a internship as they were not available until after I graduated and you cannot do a internship till your junior and senior year. Due to that I was unable to get my foot in the door at the jobs I had intended and later the ones I had lined up. This is important because me and my significant other now live 1200 miles away we used to live in the same area but her family moved to where we went to college. So now with college debt and my payments being 1250 a month for college alone and not getting the jobs I needed and 2 others for some really crazy reasons but thats irrelevant I was unable to move down there with her for us to get a house together. So for the last year I moved back up at home and have been trying to sort my life out with no luck so far covid really did its damage (make sure if you go to college you do a internship). The situation now stands me and her split because of the distance and we have no idea when I would figure out whats going on and she really does want to wait or figure a way out. The only other conflicting issue I have in all this is the relationship between me and her is perfect never any real issues but our families serverly dislike eachother and it causes issues on my parents afraid that if I move down there then they would never see our kids or get to be a part of there lives and are afraid her family would prevent them from seeing eachother which I would never want to happen and if it did it would cause serious fights between me and her and ultimately cause severe issues. I just know I do ultimately love her but I love my family so its so hard to make a choice like this.

2. *Civic Nonprofit Director of Technology/Writer* (3 years): coded and designed site with 5mil+ annual visits, my writing on the site has hit 200k+ reads as well. (This was worded horribly during EA, I didn't mention either of these numbers, which I think really hurt me)
3. *Robotics Internship Team Lead* (2 years): developed robots to automate a specific corporate function for IPO company. robots being used in local office rn, plans to expand to several more offices soon. (Also worded badly in EA, made to sound less important)

1. 3 x PVSA Gold
2. 3x AIME qual
3. AP CSA Perfect Score (1 of 369 out of 80k takers)
4. National Merit Semifinalist
5. Employee of the Quarter, Most Involved Intern at Activity #2 (1 of 5300 employees)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Read them all, don't know what the rating scale would be but History, Physics, Calc BC teachers all gave me very positive reccomendations, especially discussing my leadership and importance in the classroom.

Outside Recs were from my manager at #3 who gave a strong rec on leadership, technical skills, and work ethic. Other one was from my contact at #4, very positive

**Interviews**

Only interview I had in EA was MIT, was incredible tbh, went 2.5 hrs and I talked to interviewer over texts afterwards too.

For RD so far I've had Harvey Mudd and Northwestern, both went pretty great (generally I think I'm a good interviewer). Gonna have Yale, Georgetown, and Princeton this week. Hopefully Stanford and Harvard interviews come through soon.

**Essays**

Personal Statement for EA's was about the depressive slump I experienced after crashing and burning at robotics regionals, and how my little sister helped me recover through that through minecrfat, and how recovering from that made me remember why I truly loved robotics to begin with. I'd say 7/10 because it was written well but a little boring/non-unique. 

My personal statement for RD's about growing up in underresourced area -&gt; moving to place with ample opportunity -&gt; falling in love with robotics because it was smth so cool i never could have imagined doing in old city -&gt; starting my nonprofit to help spread robotics -&gt; bringing robotics opportunities to my old neighborhood turned out a lot better is probably more like a 9/10 based on other people who've read it's opinions

Overall, I think I had a pretty strong profile. The things I wish I could've changed were

1. I didn't do any research. Probably not as big of a deal in CS, but I wish I had. I think the length of activity #2, and the strong rec letter, helped downplay this a little though. I'm doing research with a UCLA PHD student this sem, and independent research as well, which colleges got updated on through LOCI's/Interviews
2. Bad Activity List Wording: I will forever regret not wording Activities #2, #3, and #5 better. They sound so much more meaningful and impactful the way they are described for my RD's.
3. B+ in Calc BC. Really wish this hadn't happened lol, messed up my statline and a potential red flag for the field I'm entering. Don't know what to say, just that the class at my school was extremely hard. I think this was counteracted by the fact that I got a 5 on the test, 3x AIME, A second semester, and positive rec from my teacher that assured schools I was academically compotent. Hopefully the A+ in multivar that went to my RD's helps back this up.
4. Nonprofit (semi-red flag). Founded this because of robotics, but I think it may have looked disingenous in EA's because I didn't talk much about it in essays (I only talked about activity #4, which was facilitated through my nonprofit), and because I didn't have any credibility. Hopefully for RD's, the Forbes feature and the new stronger PS help make this not a potential red flag
5. ED: I regret wasting my ED and not ED'ing to Duke. I was blinded by my dreams of MIT or Stanford. Life would've been a lot less stressful if I'd ED'd to Duke and potentially been accepted (though who knows, that's a big potentially). On the other hand, my activity list and personal statement are a lot stronger now, so we'll see soon I guess.

That all being said, I'm really happy with my acceptances in EA! Such a nice cushion in case things fall apart in RD. I still have about 25 decisions yet to release, and I expect to get into at least a few, but we'll see from there

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UMich LSA (woohoo, still need to see if I get in to CS advance selection, but I really love the culture and opportunitues here)
* UIUC CS+Econ (double woohoo, checked portal randomly half an hour before it was meant to come out to see a big Congratulations message. Really like this school too, so good for CS, but leaning towards UMich)
* Purdue Data Science (my first acceptance will always hold a part of my soul, but would probably not go here over either of the others, especially considering I was admitted second choice major)

*Defers:*

* MIT EECS (this one made me pretty sad. Half the math club presidents from my school have gone to MIT, and I was hoping I could continue the legacy. Maybe RD, but not much hope)
* UChicago CS (not too surprised about this one, only applied because I had time left in EA. dropped a fire LOCI though so we'll see)
* USC CS+BA (that 50% off for NMS is lovely. Hope I get in RD)
* Georgia Tech CS (hopefully I can convert to an acceptance)

*Rejections:*

* None

*Withdrew:*

* After yesterday, I withdrew some schools. I hope someone else can get in to them
* Northeastern University, Boston University, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC Merced

*Awaiting:*

* A whole lot lol
* Brown, CalTech, CMU, CMC, Cornell, NYU, Duke, Harvard, Harvey Mudd, JHU, Northwestern, Princeton, Rice, Stanford, UPenn, Yale, Georgetown, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, MIT, U Chicago, USC, Georgia Tech

**Additional Information:**

Now to discuss my best friend! This guy and me could be literal twins, we were in all the same clubs from middle school through high school, close friends since elementary, debate partners for an year (before we both quit), and our little sisters share the exact same name lol.

Our profiles are pretty similar too. He's my math club co-pres, was on my robotics team, and did a couple of the same internships. He also got a 36 ACT, 4x AIME, but he has a 4.0 as opposed to mine.

We both got second choice major at Purdue as Data Science last week. Yesterday was crazy for both of us, I only had 3 decisions (UMich, UIUC, and GT), while he had 6 (UMich, UIUC, UMD, U Wisc-Mad, UNC, and GT). He got into 5, and was waistlisted at UNC. So so proud of him! Was really happy when we both had good days yesterday, and we're gonna try and take tours of UMich and UIUC together some time in the coming months. 

Overall, I'm just so relived that I got some acceptances yesterday. After my deferrals from MIT, USC, and UChic, I was getting worried that I'd be hit by 7 deferrals and only 1 acceptance, which would have really sucked. Hopefully with my polished profile for RD's, I can hit some more of my top schools! Will make an update in 2.5 months with more results/where I end up committing!"

10nsw0x,0,2023-01-28,Should I sign this contract if the contractor is being greedy and shady yet is better than other positions?,Theprocastinator213,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10nsw0x/should_i_sign_this_contract_if_the_contractor_is/,"TL;DR interned at company, company offered contract to keep working, contractor seems greedy and shady but the role is still a bit better than other internships yet limits my career there once I graduate.

So I'm a student who interned at a nuclear power company. The internship went well and I was offered a part time contract afterwards to continue working during school and full time during the summer. I can't do an internship or co-op there because my uni has an 8 month limit for their co-op program and I already did my first co-op there for 8 months.

The problem I'm having is with the contractor, who is different from the company. The original rate for me would be $40 an hour, but the contractor got greedy and basically asked for the rest of the total cut (the company said $70/hr was their limit and the contractor asked for the full $70, $40 for me and $30 for them). The company thought that was too high and lowered it down to $60,  the contractor then lowered my pay down to $30 an hour, keeping their cut intact. 

I was really pissed off because I only went with these guys because they said $40 an hour was guaranteed. Anyway, I talked to my boss about it (we're on good terms) and he said I could just end it early and find another contractor that won't take 50% of the cut (said the usual is 15-25%). But I finally have the contract in hand there's a 6 month non-compete clause with the company after termination as well as a clause saying that they must keep their ridiculous cut if there's to be a pay negotiation. I haven't signed it yet.

This obviously stops my plan of finding another contractor and makes it so that getting any pay raise would be impossible to get.

I'm still leaning on taking this role because it pays higher than other intern positions and the market is really shit so I could hold off for a bit as the company is recession proof. But if I do then I can never go full time after school here, so I would be betting that the market gets better in a year.

I have a call on Monday to talk about this contract but what would you guys do?"

10ntpt0,1,2023-01-28,Comp Sci Questions,Great-Move,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/10ntpt0/comp_sci_questions/,"Hi students of Concordia,

I'm currently a self-taught software developer working full-time that is thinking of undergoing a Comp Sci degree part-time to allow me to get into better roles and open more doors. Now part of my questioning around the whole situation is to figure out if it's actually possible to get a fairly flexible schedule as a Comp Sci student here. Part time is one part, but being able to do most of the work remotely would be even more beneficial for me personally. Obviously if there are a lot of team projects I'd have to meet up at some point in the semesters, but overall I'm looking to be able to skip all classes and just study the homeworks by myself at home. Another thing is I don't want to do any internships as I already am working in the field, and some degrees like Engineering degrees at ETS and PolyMTL make internships mandatory regardless.

Has anyone done something similar or just have felt that it would be possible? Thanks in advance!"

Rent (too low for me to say) 

Thinking about keeping the van long term and would like to travel but I am aware that traveling is expensive and I just need a quiet place to study and remotely work. So staying in a quiet area might be good for me with wifi.

I don’t mind living in a van but the finances do bother me. I am thinking if I get a internship it might get me a bit further. 

How much van can I buy. I am 5,9 so I need some headspace. The lease is up in the next month. I have 30 days or so to make a decision. 
My credit score is around 640 Before it was almost 790 but college brought that down.  
I rarely go out to eat because I can’t afford to
And in the past year the amount of times I have to eaten out I could count on my finger. Mostly 10 dollar shrimp and rice or a pizza. 

My biggest concern right now is solar 
Electrical and insurance and water. When I get a job I will build it out more 
To make the place feel like home.
In addition the reason why I am not on campus is because one the commute is not so good and it tires me out and I don’t feel safe in school.
It is monthly bug checks where I live but I get tired of studying and maintaining someone else’s property while cooking for my self every day."

I was going to finish my bachelors by June but there was a technical error and now i can only finish it on January of 2024, and then I will be able to pursue the Masters. 

I'm only going to be doing 2/3 subjects till then so I'm going to have some (a lot) of free time. I want to brush some skills but I don´t know what sort of skills to acquire, and I´m searching for an internship so I could build some sort of experience.

**I could use some advice on the type of work I should look for and the skills. I'm thinking of specializing in computer engineering (it´s part of the Masters) and sub-specializing in Machine Learning. For now Im going to upgrade my Excel level to Advanced but just that won´t be enough.**"

I’ve been doing a double degree w/ compsci and unfortunate circumstances have meant I could only do comp1151 in term 3, which I quite enjoyed more than any of my other courses from my other degree. 
I am eager to find a beginner level internship and was wondering if I would be able to find one with my limited experience and where I should look?
Cheers"

I need some advice so currently I am a third year university student in IT doing a computer networking  degree which basically covers ccna/ccnp. I am in an internship right now with a known networking company in an automation / devOps role but I want to learn more and solidify my skills . What certs, projects should I get into so I can make a more fundamental concepts. I also am trying to get more into python scripting as my programming skills are very beginner-like. I have a year off from school for doing internships so by the time I go back to school I want to rack up a few certs and projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

any advice will be greatly appreciated!!!"

10ny4r2,129,2023-01-28,Entry level is saturated,EngrRhys,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/10ny4r2/entry_level_is_saturated/,"Entry level positions are very saturated. If you want to get into a good company, you really need to stand out, be it in communication, technical skills, projects, etc, and even then, there is no guarantee you would get the job. Assuming you get the job, you would also need to continuously upskill so you can stay relevant. So for anyone out there thinking that IT is lucrative, of course it is, but only if you have the determination and skills to show for it. 

You are looking for a 100K salary job but your skills are not even worth 20k? Yeah, dream on. There may be cases like this but they are extremely rare and lucky. 

Not trying to discourage anyone here. I just want to set expectations because people got it into their heads that they can easily earn 💲 just by getting into tech.

Edit: Entry level means no experience yet or fresh grads with/without internships."
10nzfam,5,2023-01-29,Should I apply for a Job while on Internship?,Stycroft,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/10nzfam/should_i_apply_for_a_job_while_on_internship/,"I'm a graduating student currently on internship on this company. I just finished week 1 and its not really hectic since its a wfh setup and I'm pretty free most of the time so I'm just improving my programming skills, watching tutorials, tinkering my working portfolio so I'm wondering if I should apply for jobs while im doing the OJT.

I'm still not sure what the payout would be in this internship if I ever get offered, I might like it and stay here but is it okay if I look for other companies? Or wait after I finish this internship and graduate first.

I guess I just want to maximize the time as I want to be employed and earn already. Would be nice to spend this OJT getting paid. Thoughts?"

My background is in Quantitative Finance and Computer Science which seems like it would go to a waste if I was to stay in the Markets group full time since the Rotational Analyst program is merely menial work that is nowhere near as much quantitative or technical. 

I was wondering if it would be possible for me to seek full time, New Grad opportunities as a quant analyst/data scientist or something of that nature at other firms upon doing my junior internship there. Also if I was to stay there for full time, would I then be able to move onto a decent paying job after the Rotational Analyst program concludes?"
10o0ic3,3,2023-01-29,Struggling a bit with my first internship,LeMoNdRoP3535,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/10o0ic3/struggling_a_bit_with_my_first_internship/,"Long time lurker here and have always loved the feedback given by others. I am on the MFT track and recently started my first semester at my internship site. I had about 5 clients total during my practicum last semester, which just happened to be all individuals. My clients I’ve seen so far in my internship (2 weeks) are 2 couples, 1 family and 1 individual. I’ve got 2 kiddos doing play therapy next week and another couple I’m waiting to hear back from. 

Needless to say this is by far the largest amount of clients I’ve had and the most diverse in terms of individual, couples and families. I feel vastly unprepared since I didn’t get any actual practice during prac and I feel like I’ve been thrown to the wolves in a sense because my site gives me a lot of autonomy. Which is great! But also terrifying because I’m in charge when I’ve never been in charge before! 

The last 2 Thursdays I’ve seen my last client at 7pm so I’m not getting home til 8:30ish. Keep in mind before this I’m usually in bed by 9 nightly. I have had trouble sleeping these past two Thursdays and feel just emotionally and physically drained the next day. It’s scary to me because I have anxiety to begin with and anything that feels slightly off can trigger it. I’m feeling like I just can’t handle it. Like I’m weaker than my friends in the program and it’s scary. I LOVE the work I’m doing. I love learning and seeing the things I see happen but holy shit I am so tired and so scared most of the time lol. 

Can anyone relate? I know this is the right path for me but I’m also scared at how much it takes and if I will be able to sustain it. I know internship is a shit time not getting paid for this immensely draining service we provide which just aggravates me more. I guess tell me it gets better? Or rather than I’m just not alone in it?"

I went through the basic level of each, I came to the conclusion that I want a career in frontend. I am currently looking for a job in web dev but the training is quite uncertain.

What exactly should I do to properly prepare for my front-end developer career? Should I develop a 2 project on JS Vanilla and then switch to a 2 project on a framework? It's fine if I choose my framework in advance and limit my options list of possible frontend jobs by doing only one specific framework (I already have a good inclination towards React), but I'm not 100% sure which framework I'd like to develop on and to make the experience.

10o14r4,4,2023-01-29,Is it worthwhile to get an associates in IT or certificate of achievement if I'm already getting an associates in CIS?,SomeHaloGuy117,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/10o14r4/is_it_worthwhile_to_get_an_associates_in_it_or/,"Hello, this is my first time posting here and this is a question that's been bothering me for a while.
This summer I'll be receiving my associates in CIS. While I'm not entirely ruling out transferring one day, I cannot afford to transfer to a 4-year right now and really, really don't want to take out a loan. The community college I'm attending has certificates of achievement for programming, networking, cyber security and full stack development and an additional degree in IT. They even have a degree in manufacturing automaton, though I'm trying not to get carried away.
So my question is can taking any of these in addition to my CIS degree enhance my job prospects, not just in the IT field but with tech jobs in general? It might be worth mentioning that some of these additional programs have internships attached to them and both the cyber security and networking certs are designed to aid students in getting their CompTIA certs.
Just wanted to ask since I've seen a lot of mixed information when it comes to degrees vs certs vs experience in the tech field."

I've been looking for similar cases to the one that I am in right now, and any advice that one might have for someone like me who is worried about my future and the possible outcomes of my education and how they will reflect onto a Job search in the future.   


I'm in my 4th year of engineering degree but it feels like by credits or by overall classes needing to be taken I'm barely scratching the surface of my second. Due to the way that my community college handled high school graduates and the classes that they've taken prior to college, I feel like I was set back almost an entire year or maybe more. I didn't start Calculus until I was in the first semester of my second year due to having to take a split pre-calc class, and my college also required me to take introductory courses for both physics and chemistry before even taking the classes towards a transfer for a degree. That progressed until now where I'm in my 4th year, only just starting to take my last physics and Chem course required for transfer, taking DiffEQ for transfer and I haven't even started the engineering specific courses for lower division So I can approach a 4-year for a BS in MechE.  


I feel like I've been set back at least two years, and I fear That I'll become a 7 or 8-year engineering student and I don't know how that would look on a resume compared to other people who have graduated earlier and with higher level degrees such as a Masters.  


All of my close friends and family that are in the same or similar degree programs are already in 4 years about to graduate or are pursuing their respective masters degrees or Higher.  


Should I accelerate the speed at which I take courses or should I stick with what my current plan is and aim for just a higher GPA and focus on internships and acquiring skills related to my discipline?  


I'm a student in the US and I don't know how this will reflect how possible job prospects will see me going forward."

I was never really that close to him nor did I hang out with him allot. But this year was different because it’s our intern year and to my luck I was placed in a group with him ,so im stuck with him for the whole duration of the training.

I never really cared for him that much but because I’ve been spending so much time with him I realised that I find him so annoying. He always makes these inappropriate unfunny jokes that no one laughs at except for him. He has the mindset of a 13 year old child and it’s mentally exhausting. 


I know that I may be overreacting because no one else in my friend group nor do the other 2 in my intern group find him annoying and that’s why I’ve never said anything about him. The other reason why I’ve never said anything is because I really care about my other friends and I don’t want to ruin anything or make things awkward. Also I’m scared that they will take his side and shun me out because I’m being an asshole about this. 


I only have 2 more months to spend with him so I’m just going to withstand these final two months to the best of my capabilities and continue on with my act.
I feel terrible for thinking like this and I just wanted to vent. Thank you for reading."

I’m in college and have a decent internship and recently got intro a relationship, I’m spending more time outside and stay out late and my mum hates it even when I text them my whereabouts and answer their calls. Today, I was out the whole day and my mum called me while I couldn’t pick up and ranted about how I was inconsiderate of their feelings, disrespectful and selfish and didn’t call to inform them my whereabouts which I told a night before and said that her blood results were bad because of how miserable I make her. I’ve tried communicating what I want. I would like to enjoy my life without anxiety and sacrificing our relationship.

Edit: For those of you who commented with their opinions, thanks very much. I didn’t know I would receive this much advice. As for the update with my parents, i brought up family counselling because I fear that we are not hearing each others needs and I don’t want an estranged relationship with my parents when they are all I have. It went sour, and my mother received an impression that I was calling her brainless. As for the curfew, she just has a very fixated concern on how others perceive me as someone who comes back late at night. She gave me a reasoning that all her life, she never asked for anything, she asked me this one thing to not go out late and I can’t even be grateful for everything they did and are doing for me. It’s safe to say I don’t know how to proceed to have a warm relationship while having our needs respected, both my parents and mine."

The new project is a tech initiative which involves removing lot of legacy systems and replacing them with microservices using modern tech stack.

The lead is a data engineer and not much of a coder. He has no idea what I'm coding. There are 3 software engineers in the team (myself included). Other 2 are not doing anything. Among these two , one is a cry baby that gets stuck after few minutes of coding and keeps crying for weeks. Other guy doesn't have any idea what he is doing and whatever he did is useless. 

We are constantly getting pressured by the lead who intern is getting pressured from higher management to showcase the progress so far. 

90% of the work we have shown in the previous demo is my contribution. I was also helping the crybaby do her work as well. my time also gets wasted in guiding the other guy. I was on leave for the past 2 weeks and nothing got done. 

I feel like I'm alone in this team and I don't want to do more work than assigned to me.

This whole team and work feels like a circus. I don't care though, not my monkeys and not my circus. But more work gets pushed to me, other two are incompetent.

I have no idea what to do now. I can put more hours and effort to understand the project and lead the team. I'm more capable to lead the team than the existing lead. But the question is always, why should I. I'm not getting paid extra to do this.

2 more guys joined the team, I don't think they can do anything, the work is complex. The lead can't guide them.

My manager left the company, this week was the last working day. Tomorrow I'm having a 1-1 with my new manager. I have no idea what to say.

This project was not my pick I was told (at the time of re-org) that I'm a temporary member and would be moved be moved to a new project, after the new project requirements are finalized.

This old manager of mine left without moving me into new one. 

Most likely at my 1-1, I'll request my new manager to move me to a new team. Won't tell him anything about this circus. 

There is no growth in my career if I keep working on it. I want to move to frontend teams so I can become a full stack developer. I will gain nothing by being in this team.

what would you guys do if you are in my position? or what should I do now?"

I finished a masters recently and wrapped up relevant internships in Computer Vision. After 4 months of wait, my phd offer got revoked due to budget freeze. So I only now started searching for jobs. My plan is to work one or two years, be somewhat financially stable and apply then for phds properly. I do have strong financial constraints and need work immediately.

I got shortlisted for an interview for a position related to robotics (uavs, ugvs) for 3d mapping. They did mention they were ""strongly"" interested in my candidature. So I feel I might have a good shot here. But the core competency requirements is understandably C++/ROS. I did clearly mention my skills and experience in my CV and didn't add C++ at all. My entire experience upto now has been with deep learning based computer vision using python and pytorch. I'm pretty sure the job requires working with real time systems.

Has anyone faced something similar before? What should I keep in mind? How how to pitch myself? Or maybe python stack is enough too? Your advice is greatly appreciated."

A little about my background, I have 3+ years in a support role for a bank and it is becoming monotonous, hence I am looking for a switch to dev. 

My undergrad degree had little to no exposure to programming. So, I'm finding it a little difficult to understand. But going through the stuff in codecademy along with a few short explanations from YouTube, I'm able to understand little by little. 

My plan as of now is to use codecademy to complete the basics of coding. I have started with python from codecademy since it was shown to be quite easy to code with

My goal is for Full stack development by the end of the year. 

I would appreciate your suggestions about 

1. The programming language, python, is it a good start for full stack dev. 

2. How can i improve my problem solving skills, because my understanding is you need math and problem solving to do well in programming? 

I just don't want to code, I want to be good at it. 

3. Being a Non CS grad, how can i improve my CS knowledge by atleast until the end of the year? 

4. Critical thinking, how important is it? And how will it help? 

5. Studying for GATE and to try for masters using gate, will it (Masters) help me land a good SDE role? 

6. Cloud (Gcloud, AWS, Azure) tech, is it worth learning while trying to get into the industry, or for later? 

7. What kind of internships can i get started with? 

Apologies for such many questions and Thanks in advance, I'm just lost, hence looking for suggestions. 

PS: If anybody could mentor me on hows and whats of the industry, a dm would help.

I lost most of my friends because I have been an awful person, abusive, manipulative, and even predatory piece of shit because sometimes I tried to hookup with my friends if I noticed they were open. A toxic fucking friend. The group of friends we used to have for more than 10 YEARS broke up because of a situation that is MY fault, a group of friends I valued more than family, because I was stupid as fuck and after a night out I lied to get in bed with a friend's friend and apparently I touched her ass and I don't even remember it. And what's worst is the question I lied to didn't make sense to me back then so I replied without thinking much but it was fucking serious... The friend's friend was high on edibles and we used to hook up so she knew I would be interested in something happening and she asked my friend to not let me sleep on her bed. I didn't fucking know about this when I said ""yes"" when my friend asked if she knew I was going to sleep there after I asked him for us to switch beds, I thought that was just my friend being nosey or whatever, I wouldn't go to her bed if I did know she was high and uncomfortable with me. She saw me get on the room, I could notice she was frustrated as she asked if my other friend wasn't coming but I had no idea it was this serious. This doesn't excuse my actions but fuck this is so frustrating. 
I apologized, I've been doing therapy, I cut out porn and stopped drinking, I swear that as much as an asshole as I've been I SWEAR that none of this was done with intention to hurt anyone and I DO NOT wanna be this person anymore but now nobody will believe me, and I understand that. I wouldn't either.
I have severe anxiety and I've been obsessing about this topic of sexual assault and researching everyday and the only conclusion I got is that I'll be seen as a sex assaulter for life and if people know about this I'll probably be physically assaulted at college and they will ask for the college to kick me out cause they don't want to study with a fucking sex offender.
I'm 4 years in graduating in an area that I do not like and there's still 1 to 2 years left. I have a internship in the same area currently and waking up everyday is a battle but I need the money to provide for my family. My mom doesn't work, my stepfather is too old to work but too young to retire and he's comfortable living by asking his father for help. 
My brother has mental anger issues and never pursued college and doesn't even have a job or cares about looking for one. 
Our house is terrible, we're poor. The amount of money I make is low, I can barely help my family because I also have to rent a place to live because my college is far.
My self esteem right now is non existent.
I want to kill myself SO BADLY. I know what method to use and everything but I can't because my fucking family needs me. It breaks my heart to think how my mom will feel since none of the other fuckers do anything to help at home. And also because of the part of the friends group that actually believe I can become a better person and didn't give up on me (which was all of the girls in the group, surprisingly). I thought about moving out of the country (I live in Latin America) and restarting my life but how do I even do that when I can't focus to study and make money? This all sucks so bad I just wanna fucking scream. I wish could just go back in time and never got on that damn bed. Better yet go 10 years back in time and look for a fucking therapist as I should have since waaaay long ago. Fuck."

so... first of all, imagine yourself growing up in a preeeetty religious home environment.  you were never that religious yourself growing up, but you were still doing the bare minimum because you believe, too. you care. 

so, yeah. anyways, imagine that you're constantly told that God always have plans for you and if things don't go your way, then it's not meant to be. and also to love your family no matter what. 

yeah. cool? okay now imagine having absolutely nothing that you ever wanted growing up, and you constantly giving into your family after because ""they're always right about what God has for you."" 

i genuinely think i'm going fucking insane. 

i feel like i wasted my entire life, EVERYTHING away. i wasn't allowed to pick my fucking (high) school. i had to compromise on my course choice during (college) that i had to stick for 3 years, full of regrets. i had to turn down an internship to a really big company that i looked up to, just because it wasn't the job they wanted. for ME. i'm not allowed to make a business or pursue my hobby as an artist (even though my family also lovesss to compare me to others online who do have businesses) and keep my interests on a backburner. they made me break up with the One person that finally understands me not too long ago; a lifelong friend i had for years, who i only dated for almost 2. reason? religion. i feel as if that pushed me close to my breaking point. 

and i have one more thing that i have no say in, but it'll out me (because this is country specific) but i'll just say that it's definitely gonna fuck over my house ownership ability once i move out :) 

just because my family did some mistakes growing up, means i'm not allowed to make mistakes on my own (and also fix theirs too)! amazing. i can only do what they wished they did, at my age. we absolutely love to see it. and all this because of money. poverty's a fucking ass, and this country's too expensive how the fuck do people live in it !!! my mom's concerned about my future job as if i had many missed chances for big shots because you won't let me pursue them !!!

now? i've left a (now dissolved) company 6 months ago and have been job hunting again since. on the side (because times are so tough), i'm interning for a small business that has a super interesting premise that i truly cared about and lined with what i want, but NO. it's not a fucking government job, so my mom's been pestering me (once again) to apply for a preschool trainee teacher job instead, despite me having to argue against for YEARS now. fun fact !!! if i take this fucking job, i'll have to quit the other because government jobs don't allow moonlighting. which means !!! i have to sacrifice one more thing that's kept me sane in life !!! fucking hell !!! 

my interview for said job is tomorrow. if i succeed and actually get it, that's it. 

i'm so tired of God just mocking me and always laughing in my fucking face, going ""oh you're so silly, you're never gonna get anything. you'll only live in the shadows of what others want from you."" what is the point of giving life to me? what is the point of letting me have the illusion of choice, only to punch me in the face every. single. time? and most of all, why on fucking earth did you let me have hopes and dreams? 

i've been nothing but afraid of death. but i can't also admit i've wanted to kill myself ever since i was young. but now, i'm starting to have major reasons. i just need the guts one day, so wish me luck. maybe soon, if the interview for preschool comes back positive (as if i'm ever surprised if it does. another fun fact! i cannot deal with kids. this will go so well. maybe god's trying to change my mind about wanting kids, so i can be even more miserable with myself.) 

( anyways if anyone wants to suggest running away, or reasoning/empathising with parents, or yaddi ya? don't. it's not gonna work, trust me. this country is ridiculously small and a graveyard full of miserable souls in dead-end jobs. my parents can never be reasoned with, and i actually tried that honestly, and i have no one else to talk to anymore. i'm fucking sick of it. ) 

i doubt anyone's gonna read this, but it's okay. i've not had anyone to talk to deeply for a while now, so i'm just pouring everything out here. might get caught, but at this point, i've lost all hope for my future and present, so i can't give shits anymore. all i have now is my fan account for a popular childhood actor and a lack of reason to live 💖 

also, just to clarify, yes i am 20+. yes, that still sounds like i have a long way to go! no, i still don't fucking care about wanting to live. and no, i don't feel bad.

i pray everyday to God to kill me soon. i hope that'll be the one thing he'll actually fulfill, for once."

It seems 90% of positions requiring a CS degree are in fact looking for a web developer. This frustrated me more as the projects to choose from for our final 2-semester long senior project are all related to webdev and UI/UX design, which frankly is more graphic design than computer science and bootcamp grads can successfully tackle these projects. 

Where are the people interested in lower level/systems programming? My fellow students at my Uni dont necessarily have any interest in projects that would involve langs like C, C++, Rust, etc.(overall in a lower level environment), is this common? Everyone seems to be interested in creating a website/web interface.

edit:
It seems most of the lower level work and interest lies more in the intersection of an engineering discipline (EE/CE etc.) rather than CS itself. For example networking, kernel/os, anything relatively closer to the physical hardware.

edit #2:
The mention of demand was said the most. With the amount of applicants to these jobs, talks of saturation/layoffs, etc. does this not make these skills/positions more disposable given the abundance of people in this area? I'm now curious what the justification behind obtaining a difficult 4-year degree is when a lot of competition in that space is bootcampers, freelancers, and self-learners. This is perhaps a naive way of looking at it.

It's starting to look like the true essence of computer science related principles and applications have slowly drifted to the actual engineering spaces while CS has become synonymous with swe/webdev and CRUD tasks."

10oihei,23,2023-01-29,Anyone else feel so insanely far behind everyone else?,Minespidurr,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/10oihei/anyone_else_feel_so_insanely_far_behind_everyone/,"For a little context, I’m a computer engineering transfer student (did first two years of undergrad at my local community college) beginning my second semester back at university after a 2 year hiatus. The pandemic really messed my life up. I had a few deaths in the family and so had to leave school two weeks into the semester. 

Looking back, it was a really tough decision and returning to the university environment has been an undertaking. A lot of my friends are graduated or about to graduate, and I feel so out of place it seems. Add to that the fact that I live off campus and am very financially insecure atm. This eats away at a lot of the time I’d like to use engaging in clubs and other organizations. 

Not only that, but compared to other engineering students at my school, I feel so…behind when it comes to readiness to actually be an engineer and enter industry, which is what my end goal ultimately is. Everyone else seems to have all this experience from high school clubs, internships before college, family members helping them out etc while I’m here, with an “ok” resume (was a math tutor at my school, worked as an RA my first semester back) struggling to figure out how I’m going to get my first internship. 

Is this normal? Like up until now, I’ve done well in my classes. I like math, and am eager to work with technology. I can’t see myself doing anything else. I just don’t know what to say to someone during a career fair, let alone an actual internship interview. I have no idea what kind of work I’d like to do for a company or what to even research about one. It feels so discouraging at times."

I learned html, CSS, Javascript, angular and react. Some other course as well.

The education was a mess with terrible teachers (I am the most positive guy ever so I'm not joking when saying this). They barely knew English and in angular course the teacher straight up stole a online course and teached it as he made it. I found out by googling and found the course.

At the end of it I felt the best I learned was react.

I had internship at a big company and I later got job there. The internship I got to do my own project and did that in react.

I felt good. Until I got the job, and as I got it the company went out and said to all 600 employees that ""this company is now changing to remote, so no need to go to office"".

I'm new, I need help like a mentor, I need to ask quick questions. All this flushed away.

In my team they have 4-5 projects, like C#, dot Net, angular and others. I don't know any of them. 

I have anxiety everyday. I've never had this my entire life. I feel like shit, I know nothing. I try to find the easiest task and make them take longer time to do. 

Since I got the job I became worse, I couldn't even write you the easiest function if you asked me to now. I am scared everyday for getting questions. 

When I get anxiety instead of fixing it I put myself in a corner. Like at work I go to bed and just hate myself. Instead of trying to get better.

I just, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I feel I need a reboot/restart. But what can I do? In my spare time where should I start.

If you read this far, thank you.

10olu2d,0,2023-01-29,"My Unfair Internship Experience , I can submit a report without having a written promise of employment ?",Puresoulwithlove,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10olu2d/my_unfair_internship_experience_i_can_submit_a/,"&amp;#x200B;

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with my recent experience as an intern . I worked hard for 6 months, alongside my fellow intern, with a great deal of dedication and passion, to learn and contribute to the company. I started for the first 3 months, working on a specific project, and then switched departments for the next 3 months. During this time, I gave my all and was appreciated by all the stakeholders, including my manager and supervisors, I was thrilled when I was told by my manager that I was accepted for a full-time position after the completion of my internship.(please note that it was a verbal promise ).

&amp;#x200B;

However, despite this positive feedback, I was shocked to find out that my verbal promise of employment was not honored. My colleague was the only one who was recruited, and I later learned that this was due to personal issues unrelated to my performance or qualifications. This has left me feeling betrayed and disrespected, as if my hard work and contributions meant nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse, I found out that there was an opening for the same role that I had been promised only two days after my departure. This feels like a clear case of discrimination, as I was not given the opportunity to compete for the position despite my excellent performance and dedicated service to the company during my internship. Please note my period of internship was unpaid.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to emphasize that my behavior was not the issue in this rejection. Additionally, I have come to understand that our manager has a history of poor management and has already received 5 resignations at this period of time. This only serves to further support my belief that this constitutes bad management and an abuse of power, as well as a violation of my rights and dignity as an intern and future employee.

&amp;#x200B;

I am deeply troubled by the situation I faced as an intern  I believe that it represents a clear abuse of power and poor management, as well as a violation of my rights and dignity as an intern and aspiring employee. My performance and dedication were not taken into account, and I was not given the chance to compete for a role that was later made available, despite my excellent work during my internship.I hope that this matter will be fully investigated and addressed, as I do not wish for others to experience the same mistreatment that I have endured. I believe that companies have a responsibility to treat their interns with respect and fairness, and to provide opportunities for growth and advancement based on merit and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and consider my concerns."

Currently, I am in the middle of my applications to different (Many!) graduate schools.

I  have asked 2 out of 3 of my supervisors to write recommendation letters for me for my grad school applications, and they have happily agreed.  We have already submitted 9 or 10 applications, and a few more are remaining. (My choice of field mostly have direct PhD program as grad programs instead of separate MS, and the acceptance rate of PhD programs is usually very low. Hence, I am sending out many applications. Please  don't judge me.)

So anyways,  currently while being in the middle of grad applications, I have found some internship opportunities and I want to apply for them since I had only 1 undergraduate research internship experience (the one I mentioned at the beginning).

These internship applications require me to mention at least 2 people as my reference with whom I have worked. My internship supervisors have already uploaded so many letters (as mentioned above), in good faith. I  am feeling a little uncomfortable / awkward / ashamed to bother them to be my reference for the internship applications as well.

Out of 2 internship references, I can manage 1 letter from one of my undergrad college lecturer, but I still need that other 1 from one of my internship supervisors.

What should I do ? How should I ask them ? Or should I not ask them at all ?

I don't want to feel like an irritating bug to them, whom they agreed to help once but is now asking for too much ?

What should I do ?"
10onhl2,401,2023-01-29,Want to become an analyst? Start here.,milwted,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10onhl2/want_to_become_an_analyst_start_here/,"Starting a career in data analytics can open up many exciting opportunities in a variety of industries. With the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making, there is a growing need for professionals who can collect, analyze, and interpret large sets of data. In this post, I will discuss the skills and experience you'll need to start a career in data analytics, as well as tips on learning, certifications, and how to stand out to potential employers.

Starting out, if you have questions beyond what you see in this post, I suggest doing a search in this sub. Questions on how to break into the industry get asked multiple times every day, and chances are the answer you seek will have already come up. Part of being an analyst is searching out the answers you or someone else is seeking.

I will update this post as time goes by and I think of more things to add, or feedback is provided to me.

**Commonly Asked Questions –**

Q) Do I need a degree?

A) Its helpful. Many job postings for DA ask for a bachelor’s degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) Will the Google Data Analyst certificate from Coursera be enough to get me a DA job?

A) No. Not even close. The course teaches you some of the basic technical concepts of the industry and that’s about it. My feeling on the course is this – If you took the entire thing from start to finish and it didn’t scare you away, you may have a chance at this.

More on this certification -- It is marketed really well as being a potential game changer.  This cert gets asked about 10x more than any other.  Again, it is not a magical key to the industry.  It lets you peek in the door to see what you are getting yourself into.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) How do I transition from X field I am in today to become a Data Analyst?

A) See the list below for the tips on how to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) I already have a degree in X, will that help me?

A) Depends on the position, the recruiter, and the company.  Most job postings show that they are looking for a degree in a related field -- Business, Statistics, etc.  The more relevant, the better your chances are that it will help.  Remember, a degree is just one part of an entire package you should have to help you transition into the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) What do I need to learn?

A) Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI or Tableau is a good place to start. I would also learn them in that order. From those, you can start branching out to learn more, such as SSRS, Azure, SAS, Looker, Alteryx, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) Do certifications matter?

A) Depends on the person doing the hiring. To some recruiters, it means you have at the minimum a basic knowledge set on the topic. To others, they may see them as useless throwaways that anyone spending 30 minutes on the Internet could get.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) Can I get a job right away?

A) Depends on your experience level.  If you are trying to break in from another career, its going to be difficult and like any job hunt, you will probably be passed up for those that are experience already.  Its going to come down to your knowledge of the field and how well you market yourself.  See #11 below.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Roadmap to break in to analytics:**

1. Build a Strong Foundation in Data Analysis and Visualization: The first step in starting a career in data analytics is to familiarize yourself with the basics of data analysis and visualization. This includes learning SQL for data manipulation and retrieval, Excel for data analysis and visualization, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. There are many online resources, tutorials, and courses that can help you to learn these skills. Look at Udemy, YouTube, DataCamp to start out with.
2. Get Hands-on Experience: The best way to gain experience in data analytics is to work on data analysis projects. You can do this through internships, volunteer work, or personal projects. This will help you to build a portfolio of work that you can showcase to potential employers. If you can find out how to become more involved with this type of work in your current career, do it.
3. Network with people in the field: Attend data analytics meetups, conferences, and other events to meet people in the field and learn about the latest trends and technologies. LinkedIn and Meetup are excellent places to start. Have a strong LinkedIn page, and build a network of people.
4. Education: Consider pursuing a degree or certification in data analytics or a related field, such as statistics or computer science. This can help to give you a deeper understanding of the field and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. There is a debate on whether certifications make any difference. The thing to remember is that they wont negatively impact a resume by putting them on.
5. Learn Machine Learning: Machine learning is becoming an essential skill for data analysts, it helps to extract insights and make predictions from complex data sets, so consider learning the basics of machine learning. Expect to see this become a larger part of the industry over the next few years.
6. Build a Portfolio: Creating a portfolio of your work is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. Your portfolio should include examples of data analysis projects you've worked on, as well as any relevant certifications or awards you've earned. Include projects working with SQL, Excel, Python, and a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau. There are many YouTube videos out there to help get you started. Hot tip – Once you have created the same projects every other aspiring DA has done, search for new data sets, create new portfolio projects, and get rid of the same COVID, AdventureWorks projects for your own.
7. Create a Resume: Tailor your resume to highlight your skills and experience that are relevant to a data analytics role. Be sure to use numbers to quantify your accomplishments, such as how much time or cost was saved or what percentage of errors were identified and corrected. Emphasize your transferable skills such as problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills in your resume and cover letter, along with your experience with data analysis and visualization tools. If you struggle at this, hire someone to do it for you. You can find may resume writers on Upwork.
8. Practice: The more you practice, the better you will become. Try to practice as much as possible, and don't be afraid to experiment with different tools and techniques. Practice every day. Don’t forget the skills that you learn.
9. Have the right attitude: Self-doubt, questioning if you are doing the right thing, being unsure, and thinking about staying where you are at will not get you to the goal. Having a positive attitude that you WILL do this is the only way to get there.
10. Applying: LinkedIn is probably the best place to start. Indeed, Monster, and Dice are also good websites to try. Be prepared to not hear back from the majority of companies you apply at. Don’t search for “Data Analyst”. You will limit your results too much. Search for the skills that you have, “SQL Power BI” will return many more results. It just depends on what the company calls the position. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Business Intelligence Manager could all be the same thing.  How you sell yourself is going to make all of the difference in the world here.
11. Patience: This is not an overnight change. Its going to take weeks or months at a minimum to get into DA.

Be prepared for an application process like this

100 – Jobs applied to

65 – Ghosted

25 – Rejected

10 – Initial contact with after rejects &amp; ghosting

6 – Ghosted after initial contact

3 – 2nd interview or technical quiz

3 – Low ball offer

1 – Maybe you found something decent after all of that

However this will probably take me a few months to at least have a good understanding of all these and have some projects with them under my belt. I could still apply to jobs, but it feels like a waste of time since I don’t have much to impress employers at the moment and I am competing against many others who have more experience either from internships or have done multiple projects in what I am trying to learn at the moment."

This is a great community and I like reading responses/posts here. I am posting this for my sibling here (I paid my dues 15 years back and I am guessing things have changed a bit by now). 

They have applied for 10 schools for MS ECE/CE in Dec '22 and Jan '23 (3 in top 10, 4 in Rank #10-30, 2 in rank #30-50 and 1 rank#50+). Profile is pretty vanilla (high GPA in undergrad, no research experience, 1 basic internship, decent SOP, average LORs,  315 GRE but none of the schools wanted GRE score). They dont expect they will get TA/RA, but at least 2-3 offers would be good to have. 

**Question: Between now and say end of Feb/March, can an applicant do something to increase their chances of admission?** 

*For example, emailing professors of dept, admissions committee, talking to existing Grad students, participating in open online courses, etc*

**Essays:**  Will just talk about common app and my two UChicago essays here. My  common app was pretty science-heavy; it was just a childhood story about  some ""experiment"" I did as a dumb 8-year-old where I speared aluminum  foil on an outlet and plugged it in. Instead of melting the aluminum  like I thought it would, it caused an explosion. I reflected on how the  experience made me recognize and appreciate the great number of unknowns  in science, as well as the trial-and-error aspect of experimentation.  In my first UChicago app I talked about how I really liked the ""quirky""  essay questions and thought they reflected UChicago's emphasis on  creative and critical thinking, backing this up with specific programs  and policies at UChicago. I also discussed a number of clubs I'd like to  join, as well as my love for Chicago the city. For my ""quirky"" essay I  answered the historical figure prompt and wrote an (admittedly  incoherent) SCP article about an extra-dimensional variant of Genghis  Khan that conquered through space AND time.

I understand my college list is incredibly reach-heavy, and my GPA is  more than underwhelming. Is it still possible for me to clutch at least  one or two of these schools?"

I’m usually the one who follows up on the day we are trying to meet and he just replies “sorry man, I’m too tired my social battery is depleted”. But he goes out with his family and with friends, and as far as I know he doesn’t cancel on them, even when he is tired. It feels like shit every time he cancels last minute.

The two or three clients I’ve had who present as disorganized *in the context of couples work* have all been among the most challenging cases I’ve had. I’m trying to avoid cultivating the narrative that “these clients just aren’t ready for couples work” when really what they need are tiiiiny adjustments — baby steps — instead of my idea of relational health which is 1,000 feet down the road. 

I want to continue developing more scrutiny about potential screening and/or goodness of fit… but lately, I have my imposter syndrome singing the “you’re blowing it, kid” song.

Just seeking for wisdom. I’m young, but I’m so stressed about my future, whatever undertaking that awaits me. So, paki-realtalk naman ako, please.

-

For context, I’m turning 21 years old this February, a 2nd year English major at UPD. Pero, matagal na at sobra akong nag-ooverthink sa career ko.

I didn’t come from a well off family. Baon kami sa utang dati, sa school ko umabot ng 110k+. Yung kapatid ko kailangan pang mag-stop kasi hindi nabayaran yung balanse niya sa school. Since I was grade 3, I’ve been familiar to our financial situation. Kaya naging pinakamalaki ko yang motivation to study, hoping to get into a public university or earn a full scholarship. Thank God, nakapasok ako ng UP. Laking tulong kasi walang binabayaran na tuition and all.

I thought my distress ended there. But it got worse.

Nag-major ako sa English (not Educ) kasi dito ko talaga naiimagine yung sarili ko. I enjoy reading books, writing stories, learning new languages, research, studying. In fact, nag-eexcel naman ako sa acads ko, although sobrang pahirapan. Ito nga lang yung alam kong gawin, tapos marerealize ko pa na ang mediocre ng writings ko. Though, I’m improving each day, pero nakakainis lang na forte ko to, pero mas magagaling pa yung non-English major kaysa sakin. Dagdag pa na paulit-ulit kong naririnig na walang career sa course ko and all.

Dagdag pa yung pressure na taga-UP ako na dapat daw matalino o mapapasok agad sa magandang trabaho. Kaso wala pa talaga akong skill na pwedeng maturing na asset.

Kaya ngayon, I’m dying to get into voluntary internships to gain experiences na hindi theoretical. Pakiramdam ko masyado na akong nagfofocus sa bagay na hindi ko pa dapat problemahin.

At kada magbabasa ako ng job description, or titingin sa mga kakilala kong may internship na, o mag-eenrol sa class na advanced para sakin, bumababa lalo yung self-confidence ko.

Sinubukan kong magtake ng online courses and certifications to boost my knowledge and probably credentials, pero di ko mahanap yung purpose kasi di ko pa naman magagamit din.

This coming February, mag-iintern ako for a small media org, as a requirement sa isang kong subject. Natatakot ako kasi baka di ako makadeliver kahit alam kong may potential at capable ako. Pakshet talaga. 

Ang nakakainis din (in a good way), pinupush ako ng magulang at mga kapatid ko na magfocus lang muna sa pagaaral at pagenjoy ng college life. Ksi after grad, puro pera at trabaho na lang daw aatupagin ko. 

I’m young. I know. Pero ang hirap. Nakakabaliw magisip. 

Please, let me know your thoughts. Be true; pero sana in a respectful way. :) Thanks!"

10p0yrp,3,2023-01-30,My boss yells every time. Is it common?,LocationMaleficent74,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/10p0yrp/my_boss_yells_every_time_is_it_common/,"I have been working for a Japanese company as an intern. I really love what I am doing, and so happy that I can be a part of big projects, like M&amp;A and making some sales team for our targets in the us. My boss is CBO/COO, so I should feel lucky to work with him because I am still an intern.

However, there are huge friction between me and my boss these days. 

1, I made a sample of the landing pages to advertise our services, and my boss said it was not good. Then he doesn’t know why it is bad, so I don’t know how to fix it.

2, My boss asked me to make some alliance plans with two companies in the us, so I did. Then after that, he said “Is it really necessary to collaborate with these companies?”

3, My boss asked me to make some documents for other companies to collaborate. I made a document and my boss presented it, but my boss hasn’t prepared what he spoke, so the presentation was so bad. (I used to present, and I feel like I can do better)

4, My boss taught me that let other people speak in the meeting and try to listen others’ opinions, but he just interrupt every time I speak.
 
As for 1 &amp; 2, if my boss tells me why my landing page is bad, or why we should not collaborate with these two companies logically and calmly, I would not be upset. But he just yelled at me, and told me that our thoughts are not synced. FYI, I asked my boss that how I could fix, tried to get some advice, but he just said he was not sure and that’s the things what I have to think.

As for 3, I just think I can present in English better than my boss, because I practiced a lot. But he said from now on, he will present anyway. (Then please practice more…)

My shift is just 3 days a week for now, but I have a lot of clients that consistently contact with me, so I do work everyday. 
It doesn’t count for my evaluation unfortunately.

This company already offered me a position, so that I can work for this company if I want to. But I am really stressed about my boss, and it makes me so scared and intimidated.

One of the reasons why I chose this company is I will be able to work in the US. They told me that in the job interviews, so I refused other better job offers. But turns out, it is hard for me to transfer to the us branch. I got these info after I accepted the job offer.

My boss created a major service in this company. So he has too much power and nobody can say anything to him even if he treats workers so badly. Even HR cannot do anything about it.

So my question is,

1, is it okay if I look for other job, or should I be patient a bit more and keep my hope for working in the us?

2, is it common to have the boss who always yell and the company do not do anything about it?

I feel like I’ve hit a dead end.",smoothmoov,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/10p2ohc/help_me_what_else_can_i_do_to_overcome_anxiety/,"Sorry for the long story, I think the last para is my main question, the rest is just me trying to provide context:

I have always had anxiety, gave me depressions for quite some time. Wasted a lot of my school years because of it. Lost a lot of opportunities. But well somehow, I made it into work life. 

When I was in school, I thought I should focus on getting into a good university and as universities usually are I thought I’ll get more opportunities to get over my social anxiety because there is no way you can get through law school without having social skills. Nope, turns out you can. I still have social anxiety. I just always found work that never required me to face my anxiety. And when the few times it did, I just made it through by focusing solely on work.

When I got out of college, I didn’t know what to do because everything required social skills, so I just went for a masters and made a point to actively work on my anxiety. It helped a little, now at least I don’t look weirdly quiet or unapproachable. I actually made some connections and friends.

But there was always some kind of blockage that stopped me for going after the bigger opportunities. And when I did, I’d lose it all to last minute panic attacks. It’s frustrating, because I know it’s not because of my lack of knowledge, information or capabilities as a lawyer. Just something about it all makes me completely blank out.

Then I actually got a job, and since it started with an internship online, it was easier for me to showcase my skills over a period of time instead of doing a short interview/recruitment process. 

It’s all great, but I thought once I got a job, I’ll automatically have more opportunities to be more social or practise my social skills. But it’s work from home, and I still have anxiety and no progress.

I have no personal life, I don’t go out. I want to move cities, but the fear of people and just fear in general stops me. What do I do? I think I can make friends and talk to anyone if it’s about work. That’s one thing I am proud of overcoming. But I still have a hard time talking to when it’s in a different setting, where I don’t have my profession giving me a sense of self worth, like in a store, restaurant, etc. I see how far I’ve come when I look back but there’s always such a long way ahead.

I feel like I’ve hit a dead end.",smoothmoov,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/10p2qjl/help_me_what_else_can_i_do_to_overcome_anxiety/,"Sorry for the long story, I think the last para is my main question, the rest is just me trying to provide context:

I have always had anxiety, gave me depressions for quite some time. Wasted a lot of my school years because of it. Lost a lot of opportunities. But well somehow, I made it into work life. 

When I was in school, I thought I should focus on getting into a good university and as universities usually are I thought I’ll get more opportunities to get over my social anxiety because there is no way you can get through law school without having social skills. Nope, turns out you can. I still have social anxiety. I just always found work that never required me to face my anxiety. And when the few times it did, I just made it through by focusing solely on work.

When I got out of college, I didn’t know what to do because everything required social skills, so I just went for a masters and made a point to actively work on my anxiety. It helped a little, now at least I don’t look weirdly quiet or unapproachable. I actually made some connections and friends.

But there was always some kind of blockage that stopped me for going after the bigger opportunities. And when I did, I’d lose it all to last minute panic attacks. It’s frustrating, because I know it’s not because of my lack of knowledge, information or capabilities as a lawyer. Just something about it all makes me completely blank out.

Then I actually got a job, and since it started with an internship online, it was easier for me to showcase my skills over a period of time instead of doing a short interview/recruitment process. 

It’s all great, but I thought once I got a job, I’ll automatically have more opportunities to be more social or practise my social skills. But it’s work from home, and I still have anxiety and no progress.

I have no personal life, I don’t go out. I want to move cities, but the fear of people and just fear in general stops me. What do I do? I think I can make friends and talk to anyone if it’s about work. That’s one thing I am proud of overcoming. But I still have a hard time talking to when it’s in a different setting, where I don’t have my profession giving me a sense of self worth, like in a store, restaurant, etc. I see how far I’ve come when I look back but there’s always such a long way ahead.

Lucrez intr-o corporatie care nu are ca main activity IT-ul, dar avem nevoie sa dezvoltam un sistem de BI intern.

Aici apar eu. Lucrez in companie de cativa ani, dar pe o pozitie de Project Manager. In trecut, am avut doua proiecte de BI unde am colaborat cu al nostru departament intern de IT. Toate au mers bine, iar acum oamenii se gandesc sa ma bage pe mine pe aceasta pozitie.

Eu sunt pasionat de data analysis si reporting, in sensul ca de formare am lucrat in research (statistica) unde rapoartele se faceau in excel, de multe ori manual. Acum 4 ani, la o companie unde lucram pe research, m-am enervat ca pierdeam saptamanal 10h pe o munca manuala, si timp de vreo doua luni am invatat cum sa scriu niste cod in Python si SQL ca sa dureze fix 5 clickuri. Aici s-a oprit experienta mea in acest domeniu. Nu stiu Tableau, I've dabbled a bit in Power BI, Adobe Analytics si Google Analytics. Stiu ca nu-s fix BI, dar vad multe asemanari.

Doar ca si statement, sa fie o imagine mai clara. Cunosc care sunt nevoile companiei, stiu unde scartaie partea de raportare, stiu unde sunt pierderi mari de timp, am idei despre ce improvementuri se pot face. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Se poate sa ma descurc pe o asemenea pozitie tinand cont de experienta tehnica care tinde spre zero? 
2. (Daca nu skillurile tehnice) Care ar fi skillurile necesare pentru a ma descurca? Ce resurse pot sa citesc despre asta?
3. Am teama ca, ne avand expertiza tehnica, o sa fiu pacalit cu ""pai pentru asta am nevoie de o saptamana"" si in realitate sa dureze cateva ore. Cum pot evita aceasta situatie? Nu vreau sa ajung nici in extrema opusa.
4. Alte sfaturi, va rog? VA ROG! Chestii care mi-ar putea scapa?
5. Care ar fi o structura adecvata pentru un astfel de departament? Sa presupunem ca la inceput ar fi vorba doar de un singur proiect, dar scopul final este sa transformam BI in business line.

Multumesc!"

I think there’s some great stuff on this subreddit but mixed with a bad advice from people without much industry experience so I’d love to give back and help mentor a few people!

I have a CS degree (originally started in a different major before switching), did undergrad research, I’ve had a couple internships, worked for a few years after graduating at a FAANG company across multiple teams (starting as android engineer and eventually switching to backend) and now I work at a popular music streaming service (primarily backend but also some full stack dev). 

Would specifically like to help people late in college, people who recently graduated, and/or junior engineers within the first couple years of starting their first job.

I can offer advice on coursework, internships, resume, applying to new grad roles, ramping up/onboarding, getting your first promotion, dealing with conflicts at work, etc. 

If you’re interested shoot me a message and we can connect on LinkedIn and I’ll make myself available to answer questions/help with whatever you need! Happy to answer whatever questions people have but will probably only have time to consistently mentor 2-3 people.

EDIT: Wow I didn't expect so many people to reach out! Unfortunately I'm kind of maxed out and don't think I can handle answering too many more people! I'll respond to those that reached out already and maybe open it up again in the future when I have some more bandwidth! If there are any other experienced devs out there willing to help out I encourage you to volunteer (and if you dm I'd be happy to add you to my discord so you can help too).

Hello friends,

I recently graduated from a 4 year state-school with a degree in Comp Sci and minor in Math. I have interned with a private company (medical industry) for the past 2 years, and will be joining their early career rotational program. I am starting on an infrastructure team, but would like to eventually do a rotation with the ML/AI team because that was my true passion in school. My starting salary is $83,000 plus an $8,500 sign on bonus and a 4% yearly incentive bonus. I have a 6% matching 401k since i started as an intern with the company. 

Coming from my background, I am very grateful for the amount I will be making,  however I do have a sizable amount of student loans I have to pay off, and if I put in 3 years at aforementioned company, they’ll pay for me to get my mba, which I plan to do to eventually work my way into a management position. 

My question for anyone who has experience navigating the field:
Other than improving my technical skills and providing good work during these next 3 years while I wait to get my mba, what else can I do to improve my financial situation/ future prospects? Are there any steps you took that worked well for you in your early career to improve your financial situation and career outlook, or steps you wish you didn’t take? 

I know this is a very subjective topic, but I come from a family and background where this amount of money out of college is unheard of, so just hearing what others did in a scenario like this would help because I don’t really have anyone to talk about it with irl.

Best!"

I know many deserving people getting rejected from UIUC and any other top uni, but does it determine your worth? No. I have realised that fit matters a lot in this process. I genuinely feel I will fit into UIUC culture easily. On the other hand,I would have never been able to fit into Georgia tech because, perhaps, it is all tech-vibe? I like networking with people from different disciplines!I have not committed to UIUC, but it is definitely one of my top choices! \*Fingers crossed\* Trusting the universe to take me where I can be happy and get strong education at the same time!

If anyone reading this have been rejected/deferred in Early Action, please have hope. I know that feeling, because I genuinely thought I won't get in anywhere after Purdue reject. But, here I am. Treat decisions like a character development arc, because you are the main character of the story! Everything works out in the end."

I realize that the market is tough right now  and that I'm very fortunate to be having the opportunities that I have  right now especially as I am leaving college. I hope that my post  doesn't come off in any way as bragging/ungrateful or anything like  that. I just simply want more opinions on what I should do.

So I have two Internship offers for my final summer in University.

The first one is for Crowdstrike and it is as an analyst for their Falcon Complete product.

The second one is for IBM and it is for their penetration testing team.

In  terms of my career I really would like to go down the red team route,  but I fear that I may be missing out on a big opportunity by not working  with Crowdstrike. It seems like a lot of people have positive things to  say about them and they are a pretty big name in the industry. I think I  remember one redditor saying that they would work for them for free if  they had the chance or something.

But  I have a slight/moderate dissatisfaction towards the role, I did  forensics at another internship last summer and I can't really see  myself doing that for years. It's a cool field, but I just don't think  its for me.

There is also the  prospect of lay offs. Apparently there is supposed to be more layoffs  around the time I'm supposed to start, so I fear that my offer may be  pulled from one or the other. A couple of people in my life, have told  me to accept both offers, but then just renege one of them like a week  before the start dates, but doing this will for sure burn bridges and I  believe that is pretty unwise especially this early in my career.

Any advice on how I should approach this situation?"

I’ve sent out 150+ applications to various UX positions since January 2022, and haven’t found much.

I applied to a small marketing company 10 months ago where they said I would be able to do some UX Design (that never happened), and I am currently running their social media for them and for their clients and I perform website maintenance as well. I work 30 hours a week and get paid $15/hr (enough to get by and build a tiny bit of savings), I work a second job at a brewery 1-2 days a week, and have an unpaid UX Design internship that I don’t have to do much work for on the side.

This marketing job that I work is mentally draining, as the bosses bully and berate us employees, so I need to get out of that job ASAP. I also want to travel within the next 5-6 years, so I need to find a job that will begin to build savings for that.

I recently expanded my job search so I can leave the marketing job, and applied to an entry level insurance sales position that has a base pay of $10/hr + commission. I have a feeling I will get a job offer, but am worried I will not enjoy sales and am worried it may not be lucrative.

I have also been toying with the idea of going into the trades (maybe plumbing?) because it is something my entire family has done and is something I know that I could excel at.

I feel terrible asking for advice from strangers, but I feel like I am completely at a loss here.

Here is my current game-plan/thought-process:

1. Take the sales job
2. Work at the sales job and if I do not like it in the next few months, leave and try to find a UX Design job or go into the trades.

I would absolutely love some guidance if any of you can spare some because I cannot seem to make up my mind.

Thank you so much."

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to find some support here. I know that my behavior is unacceptable. Therapy hasn't been helpful at all. The only thing we do is dig for the truth about my childhood. I feel like all those therapy sessions are a waste of time that will never solve my problem at all. Perhaps, I should get proper rest and time off. But we are currently facing a financial crisis, and my boss didn't give me any time to cool off.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I yelled at this girl, and apparently, this is her first job ever. She's inexperienced, and we hired her as a summer intern. She finished her internship, and our management decided to keep her because she was the best intern. I think she was pretty impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

But we expected that we would survive this crisis. Now the company has to cut down on staff quite a bit. Basically, we need to reduce the number of employees to stay on the float. So, this girl was one of those who were getting fired. Basically, today she was informed that she has 2 weeks to find another job. She will get her compensation as three months' wage, but we have to let her go. She was also fired because instead of working harder, she dealt with some personal drama with her boyfriend and couldn't focus on her work commitments.

&amp;#x200B;

She left the manager's office all flushed. After a while, I heard her sobbing in the corner. It was right next to my desk. I don't really like to share the office space with anybody because I love to work in a quiet space. Even music distracts me.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, instead of calming her down and saying that everything was gonna be OK, I yelled at her. I yelled at her because of her sobbing. I couldn't have guessed that there was our client on the phone line at that exact moment. Can you believe that? I feel so embarrassed, and still, I didn't apologize.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not the first time something like this has happened. I feel like I'm a monster. I yell at people so often because I'm tired of doing everyone else's job. I shared this story with my friends, and they gave me some stress management advice on [https://restequation.com/](https://restequation.com/). But I've also decided to ask for some tips here."

Semester started a week ago for me and wishing the best for my fellow students.

Ill cut to the chase, I'm lost. 

I'm a 2nd semester Junior taking C++, Algorithms, Systems Analysis, Calculus 2 for classes right now, C++ and Calculus are simple enough, I guess, but the other two? I may as well be taking these classes in a foreign language because I am so lost.

I'm strong mathematically, and I enjoy programming to an extent, but it really seems like I had to be doing this my whole life, because I feel so behind the other students. To be honest I don't think I have been able to do a single project in the last year without looking up answers. 

In algorithms, we had to submit a program on the Josephus problem this week and I had no idea how to start. Not to mention my Systems analysis class, where we have to do an actual Systems Analysis for a business in our area. I don't think I could actually make anything for someone other than a html site and maybe an array list if I'm feeling frisky. 

I don't even want to think about internships, which feel so out of reach with my obvious lack of programming knowledge and prior bad grades.

Maybe I'm just rambling, but I could use some guidance on what I need to be doing, or resources I should use to not feel so behind. For my first couple years of school I slacked off, Gpa barely above a 2, and last semester was my first with A's and B's. I have the ambition now, but simply lack the knowledge. And man, I know my last 30 credits are no joke; ambition won't be enough to get me through.

Sorry if questions like these get answered all of the time. This is my first time on this subreddit."

Overall, I enjoy working with others throughout the day. My only issues is actually life at home. 

Because my dad has to work long hours (for some reason, from 8am to 8pm), it’s really frustrating to be stuck at the office waiting for the time to pass. (Officially I’m done by 5.30). Yes, I could work on my assignments but by 6+pm I’m done or my work is in no rush. 

I love to play games as it gives me relaxation at home and from life. I wish I could do more but I’m not too keen on things such as exercise but may if I get more time. 

So now the issue is that at home I have to have dinner (no shit). But this dinner of mine has to last for like 2 hours because one have to wash a fuck ton of dishes incl. a soup pot everyday as well as being forced to stay and watch dramas while eating. While the shows can be fun, I’d rather spend that time playing games but my parents would get upset at me no spending time with the family of 5 and would say I act like I live in a hostel and I’m just a guest. 

Usually by 11 I get to go into my room but now I have to deal with showers and everything and I can’t even join my friends in any gaming sessions as by then it’ll be so late. If I did stay up, I’d be tired as shit and start to be dozy at work. 

To make matters worst my parents would tell me that I need to sleep more to function better and take care of my health but won’t let me do what I want with my time. What do you think should done or attempted? One friends suggested bringing my gaming laptop to work but I feel that I’d get a scolding from my mom as I should be focusing on working at work. (Also, they both don’t like working from home to be the norm, only a tool for people with extraordinary standards.

I am looking at a job that is close to home, and am trying to consider the best time to apply. I live in a really rural area so opportunities are hard to come by. The job looks like a great opportunity, and I have internship experience, but had to make a very long commute to make it. (Side note, the internship was required by my college and I'm super glad for it, will open many doors in the future. Everyone should try to find an internship while in school, I traveled over an hour one way for mine and was for sure worth it.) 

If I apply now I will have to mention I can't work full time for another 3 months. However, I commute back to the area every week and would be available to work part time now, but a very limited time. Talking 1 day a week, maybe 1.5 days.

I'm guessing they would consider this a waste a time considering I have a very limited time to work, but is it worth the chance? I don't want to wait until the job is gone, but don't want to apply when I'm not available to work full time for a while yet.

Would it even been worth it to apply in a situation like this?"
10pqanh,1,2023-01-31,Financial Internship,cfin23,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/10pqanh/financial_internship/,"Hello all, this is my first post on reddit. I am not sure if this is the correct thread to ask for advice but I figured you all could notify if I am asking in the right place. The fourth section will contain more of my questions with the first three being my background and current position.

I am currently an undergraduate sophomore student at the University of Arizona majoring in political science with a minor in economics. I am considering double majoring in economics in order to have a major that is more related to financials and it has significant class overlap with political science. Regardless, I have what I would consider a low GPA (2.8 current, expected 3.3 end of semester). I currently am working at a Fortune 500 insurance firm as an underwriting intern, and have worked at two law firms prior to that as a law clerk and legal assistant. I am starting to think that law is not for me because I really do not want to go to law school as I do not think I would get into a target school to get a big law job. Due to that I am thinking about going into finance.

When I say finance I mean investment banking or PE, however I realize that is a stretch due to my low GPA and going to Arizona. I know some people doing PWM and I am interested in that as well and some of my dad's friends have good jobs at reputable firms who I have spoke with a little regarding the subject.

\-Is adding economics as a second major critical to landing a financial job?

\-What steps should I take to network with new people that my family does not know?

\-Would it look good on my resume to take SIE exam, series 65, series 63 and just any other FINRA regulated exam that does not require sponsorship?

\-What is the recruiting period for finance internships?

\-What type of firm should I target for a first finance internship?

\-Any other advice you think I should have?

Thanks everyone. Please let me know if I am posting in the wrong spot and I am open to any and all advice."

I’m currently in my final year of my master’s in computer science. And I intend to work full-time as soon as I graduate. I am hoping for a data analyst or data science or machine learning researcher position. However, I still feel inexperienced tho. The only things I got to show on my resume are: 1) a data analyst internship at an insurance company, 2) some research projects that involve analysis of large datasets and use of machine learning and deep learning models (with publications to journals and conferences), and 3) my master’s thesis.

So now I am on the hunt for jobs, and idk how much (average) salary I should be expecting (other than the baseline from my previous internship job). I fear that I might find an offer that will pay very little and then I’ll accept because I don’t know the numbers. Would anybody be able to give a rough ballpark of how much these positions usually pay? I’m hoping to get into an entry-level (or new grad program) first, since it’ll be my very first full-time stable job. Currently living in Canada and idk how much salaries compare with that of US.

Also, just to give context, I started right away with my master’s right after graduating from my undergraduate, as I felt the need for a stronger education background before coming into the field (was also pandemic times when I graduated so it was just tough to find jobs then).

And any advice you could give for a noobie? It would be appreciated. Thanks!"

How should I approach system administration to an organization that doesn't have servers set up and Microsoft Server licensing? I can use powershell to make a script to automatically install software, but then I get stuck after that. Most of our systems are web-based and don't need to be virtualized.

I'm about to be a teacher and I've got many doubts about it because of my neurodiversity.

When I was as a teenager I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and it has always been difficult for me to relate with people in general. The fact is that I'm great lately, it's been years since I went through that moment and thanks to my constant therapy work (apart from the medication, which I no longer need) today I am a fully functional and productive person.

I have always really liked artistic expression and I ended up graduating in fine arts and doing a master's degree in high school. I know that I am fully capable and that I have a lot to offer students, especially since my master's internship period was great. 

My only concern is about the possibility of being in class and feeling overwhelmed without my internship tutor, who was a very sensitive and sociable person who always used to take the initiative. 

What if I get overwhelmed in front of the students? What if I am not able to organize class times or the bureaucracy of work well? What if I do not project my voice well or one day I am especially sensitive and cry in front of the students? 

I have a lot of doubts and fears. Have you faced these issues or do you know where I can ask for help? How can I put myself in a situation where I feel safe and in control?

My coursework involved learning how to run regression models in STATA, clean a couple of types of data, ""tell stories"" about data in a succinct manner, and do some basic things in Tableau and geospatial mapping programs like ArcGIS and GeoDa.

The whole reason I'm interested in this field is from my internship, where I wrangled data about housing demographics across my state and distilled it for insights on a campaign for the nonprofit. I taught myself a bit of R and Python in that internship as well.

Is this enough to eventually say I have a Master's degree in something relevant to data analysis and visualization, or is it a bit of a stretch?

I'm working on building a personal website that hosts its own SQL database where I'll have some interfaces that allow people to do their own queries, and I'm hoping to be able to present that to employers as part of a portfolio. Building that from the ground up is taking quite some time and learning though, so I'm wondering if it's going to be crucial for me getting a foot in the door.

What is that more like for information systems students? I'm still going after internships and everything, but what kind of certs and projects should an undergrad be doing to prepare for an entry level role?

I am \[AGE\] years old and I currently live in Brazil, where I work as a Software Engineer at \[COMPANY\]. I am looking for an apartment in \[CITY\], because I signed a permanent employment contract as a Software Engineer at \[COMPANY\], which starts on \[DATE\]. I found a short term accommodation from mid February to April, but now I am looking for a long term rental and yours seems to be exactly what I was looking for.

I am married to \[NAME\], who is also \[AGE\] years old and currently works as an \[PROFESSION\] in Brazil.

I have already lived in \[CITY\] from \[DATE\] to \[DATE\], when I did an internship at \[COMPANY\]. During this time I rented a room in a shared apartment and had a great relationship with my landlord, of which I would be happy to provide you with a recommendation letter.

I think that my profile will fit very well in your apartment as I am a friendly person, very organized and responsible, non-smoker and have no children nor pets. From a financial point of view I can provide you with proof of income with my salary and a savings account with the required deposit.

If you think that my profile fits your apartment, I would like to arrange a video call so that we can get to know each other and discuss further details of the apartment and renting agreement. Due to the time zone difference it is easier to contact me between 12:00 and 22:00 (CET).

I hope to hear from you soon.

I couldn't even see my hands in front of my face. *That* kind of dark place, where seemingly endless blackness closes in on you. Still, I pushed on, fumbling through the gloom until, eventually, I made it out. Getting my degree promised a fresh start! I enrolled in a great university after getting accepted. I knew that attending said university would take extra labor on my end, however, but I didn't let that scare me away. I worked the entirety of my undergraduate studies, like many other students, to fund what financial aid could not cover. I come from a single-parent household, and my Mom doesn't make good money as a teacher. 40+ hours a week I worked, all while juggling classes and clubs, as well as new friendships that needed nurturing to continue to grow. I barely slept a wink but I was so, so happy and hopeful for the future. I was grateful to be on campus, and grateful for my newfound independence, as my Mom and I have never had a particularly healthy relationship despite my gratitude for her having raised me. Then, COVID-19 hit. I had to move back home, away from my friends and my campus, and my routines. I lost my job, of course, seeing as I couldn't live on campus anymore. No one could. My internship was canceled. Even so, I pushed through and forced myself to adapt to online learning and, of course, to learning in an environment where I didn't feel particularly wanted. Because I was a full-time employee, I was granted unemployment until things gradually started opening up around me and a local coffee shop was hiring for a barista, which I gladly accepted at the time. The job wound up being a nightmare, equipped with an asshole for a boss and disgusting work conditions, but I needed the money to finish school. I even had to pick up *another* job, as well as an unpaid internship, because I had no internship experience yet and desperately needed some build up my resume. I hustled like that for months and months and finally, following the conclusion of my first internship, I landed another one - a ***paid*** internship this time. Remote. $15 an hour, 28 hours a week. I was too excited to speak! I was able to quit one of my in-person jobs - the shitty one, of course - and only work two while I continued on the grind to finish school. And what do you know? I did it. I did it, several jobs later. I did it, 5 internships later, 3 of which were unpaid despite being a ridiculous amount of work per week. I didn't care how burned out I felt, or how horrible the dark circles staining my under eyes seemed to look. I was genuinely grateful. I still am! I am grateful for the people who gave me a chance, for the professors who were endlessly patient with me, and for my Mom for keeping a roof over my head despite our differences. I was sure that all of this hard work would undoubtedly lead to a full-time job. And yet, last month, I was laid off from my internship, alongside my other fellow interns, by a company who had basically promised me a job would be waiting for me after I completed my internship. I have applied for hundreds of jobs. I have made it to the final round of several interviews, and completed projects for said interviews unpaid, only to be told that they chose someone else who has more experience and that *because I'm young with my life ahead of me, I should be fine, right?* No. I shouldn't. Because I have yet to be approved for unemployment. I am in boatloads of debt from school. I can't pay any of my bills because all of the money I was making was going to help put groceries on the table, to help with other household bills, because we're in a recession and merely being alive is expensive. I know it's not all bad. There is so much in my life to be grateful for. I'm only 23. I have so, so much life left to go, I have had immense luck with landing internships at awesome companies in a very difficult industry to succeed in (book publishing.) I am not blind to my privilege in having even been able to go to college, despite needing to hustle to make it work. Not everyone has that privilege. And yet, I guess I just hoped that I'd have some stability by now. Doesn't everybody hope for that? I hoped that I'd finally be enough, do enough, and succeed enough to make my Mom feel proud of me, to gain her approval. I thought I would have my own place by now, however small, to fill with plants and all of my favorite books, resting safely and cozy on a towering bookshelf. Yet, the only thing towering over me is the $45 I have left in my account, the credit card bills I can't even pay now because I have no income, and just the stress of it all. The not knowing. The want to get out but not knowing how, when, or where I'll go. The guilt of now no longer being able to help out my Mom like I was, and the bitter shame of it. Not being able to see my friends because I have no car anymore, either. I'm just frustrated. I feel like I've been going and going and going for years, positive that it would pay off, and now? Silence. Sending in applications but not hearing back. And honestly, the worst part of it is that I just want to lie down and not get back up, sometimes. Because I'm so tired, you know? I'm just tired, is all."

Oh and I applied for PR to improve my chances btw (advice that I got from current UT students)"

Why I'm confused?

Bocconi is World Rank 6 in Business in QS whereas UCL is World Rank 90+. Bocconi is World Rank 20 in Business and Economics in US News whereas UCL is World Rank 40+. In overall rankings UCL is in the top 10 for sure. Should I be looking at overall rankings or subject specific rankings? As far as I have heard, in finance and consulting the Financial Times rankings are considered the best (Is this true?). There Bocconi outranks UCL by a huge huge margin."

I'm a 4th year CS student in the US that's slated to graduate this May. I've got a fantastic paying job lined up where I'll be making more money than I even thought was possible when I was a kid. I'll be living in the SF Bay Area, exactly where I've wanted to be, too. 

I should be happy, right? I can't help but feel like I'm going through the motions. I worked really hard to get here, and yet I feel so unfulfilled. I have it all now: financial security, a loving partner, and a job a lot of people would kill for. 

Yet I can't help but feel empty and pointless. I even have hobbies; I love to draw, code, learn to play the piano, and do marathon running. Do I really care about the ""mission"" of the company I'm going to be working for? Am I going to find fulfillment being yet another SWE cog in the corporate wheel?

All I feel is oncoming dread. I know I'll continue to learn things on the job, but I just don't think it will be what I *want* to learn. I always wanted to study machine learning more in-depth and how it applies to computer graphics. I've always wanted to work in the creative animation, videogame, or film industries, but with my cookie-cutter full-stack SWE skillset, it seems so out of reach to me.

Sure, I can code an MVP of a full-stack web and mobile app on a weekend, or integrate with a giant legacy codebase. I learned these things because I *needed* to get an internship, a job, or any light at the end of the tunnel for college. I never got the chance to learn the things I'm genuinely interested in, like computer graphics, animation, etc. because I was too busy trying to stay afloat.

And sure, I've been passionate about making web apps before, but more often than not it feels soulless and dispensable to me. Like anyone else could do what I am doing and it wouldn't make a difference.

I know I'm probably overreacting, but I just can't help but feel dreadful, feeling like I wasted my time studying what would make me employable vs. studying what genuinely fascinates me. Where do I go from here? I am feeling genuinely lost and would like some advice."
10qa3um,0,2023-01-31,Who is right?,dumbelco,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10qa3um/who_is_right/,"Hi!

I am a soon to be 20yo studying software engineering. I love programming and don't think I would be happier pursuing any other career path, and I know I made the right choice when it comes to that.

Now, I am a first-year student, soon to start my second semester. I focus on studying web development on my own as much as I focus on my college. I try to have a 50/50 balance. I strive to maintain a fairly high GPA, but also study web dev as much as I can. If I only focused on college I know I could have one of the highest GPAs in my college's current generation of 250 students, but even as I am doing now my GPA is still fairly high and I am among the best.

My father on the other hand thinks I should focus 100% on college, with which I strongly disagree. He thinks my GPA should be my primary focus in life and that recruiters value it a lot. For some background, he is an electrical engineer with like 20 years of work experience, so I am having a hard time debating him on this topic because of his status. Doesn't matter what arguments I say, he is more experienced and therefore he is always right.

I applied for an internship a few days ago, still waiting for a response (it is still open for applications), and when I told my father about it he started yelling and told me that I am an idiot and that I should just focus 100% on college. He also keeps telling me to study math more. I don't mind math, I am fairly good at it, for eg. despite passing Calc I on my first try with a B, 76% overall, and even though only 20% of the generation passed, he tells me that I should take the make up and try and get an even higher grade, which I don't want to do, since I am working on a personal project during this 30ish day brake we have and don't want to focus on math atm.

His mentality is a big problem for me. I would like to start working as soon as possible, but I also know that this wouldn't be possible without his blessing, since, until I get my foot through the door and start making my own money, I depend on him financially.

Like, even if I get this internship, I could not decide to start working even if I wanted to if it was against his will, since somebody has to give me money for food/gas, etc until I start getting paid and I doubt he would be up for that. Of course, I would not drop out of college, this internship offers a hybrid work model with flexible hours and I would try to balance both work and school, but, as I said, I don't think he would be up for that, since he thinks 100% focus on college is most important.

He doesn't understand how valuable it would be for me to spend time with people that made it in my line of work and learn from them, and he would rather have me lose brain cells listening to idiots in college (by idiots I mean my peers, not the profs, I still love going to college). This causes us to quarrel with each other a lot, and he really underminds what I do. Also, he keeps telling me how so many other career choices are better...

What are your thought on this, who's mindset is right?"

18 months ago I knew literally nothing about programming. Today I have a six-figure SWE offer. Am I lucky? Yes. Should everyone expect to be as lucky as me? No. But when thinking about what got me here... I owe a huge chunk of my success to this community.

We in this sub can be toxic, overly competitive, and a little circle-jerky... But that stupidity is also what made it so effective at catching newbies like me up to speed.  Y'all taught me what kind of skills employers look for, what a strong personal project or internship looks like, and what the best resources for finding great jobs are. The elitism and insanity in this sub pushed me to try harder, shoot higher. And I did.

The knowledge and advice y'all provide is valuable and appreciated. Even if we don't know as much as we might pretend to, I think this sub is so much more than just ""the blind leading the blind."""

Most internships I look at require experience which I currently have zero.  By the time I get the knowledge required for an internship I will basically have graduated already.

Are there any places who will take a person in school who has no experience?  

How else would you suggest someone in my situation get some hands on experience?  I have four days off a week from work so lots of time to commit to something."
