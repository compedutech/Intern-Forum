10qgc2m,4,2023-01-31,Entering DE as a grad with no experience?,infiniteAggression-,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/10qgc2m/entering_de_as_a_grad_with_no_experience/,"Hi everyone. I'm currently enrolled a Master's in Software Engineering and have been very interested in DE since my undergrad and completed various projects and an internship within the space, and I definitely plan on pursuing more internships if possible. 

I've read a lot that getting a job as a DE right out of university with no professional experience is very difficult due to the nature of the job. From what I've read on this sub, people recommend going through a different role in Software Engineering and then transitioning into a DE role. 

Is this accurate? If so, what other role is the best suited for this transition? Backend development is something I've seen mentioned a lot.

Thanks!"
10qgp1i,13,2023-01-31,UMD or HBCU for CS,International-Art-61,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/10qgp1i/umd_or_hbcu_for_cs/,So i’m a Black Girl and I got into umd early action in state. I didn’t get into the cs major but ik it’s not hard to transfer once I get there. I also got into NCAT’s and Hamptons CS program which are the best for HBCUs. I’m trying to decide wether to go to UMD or one of the HBCUs I got into for cs. Ik UMD is ranked higher technically but HBCUs often provide alot of internship support for there engineering majors. I also got into UMDs FIRE program and got a full tuition scholarship from Hampton. If it matters I do plan to pursue my masters in computer science after my undergrad degree. Any advice or help is welcomed thanks.

I am a sophomore college student who is interested in Cloud. So far, I have completed a Udemy certification in Linux, studying for the Linux Professional Institute Exam. I completed Azure Fundamentals and I also completed the Google Data Analytics course. Unfortunately, I don’t have much IT experience besides working for 2 months at Geek Squad before I quit because of an issue with my boss and the work environment. Everytime I see IT jobs for helpdesk, it is ALWAYS full-time. I just want a part time job at IT (idc what - i just want to learn and get experience). I keep applying for internships but it never feels like they are going to pick me due to my lack of experience and I never have been. I would sincerely appreciate any advice. Thank you."

The tough part about getting one is that i only have the intro to cs class completed (i wanted to do cs classes my last 2 years). If I started an online course for a certification, could i use that for an internship? i hope i’m making sense lmao

if so, can y’all recommend me some websites i could use for certifications, where to find good internships, and what are the best online resources to help learn cs please. it would be highly appreciated"

Haven't seriously thought about an MBA til recently, but am interested in how it could provide a path to HF/PE/Management in tech. Currently have accepted offer for SWE. Just wondering whether it would be worth it to get my stuff together and apply in the third round for deferred programs. Here's my background/stats:

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * 3 SWE internships (2 at pretty small shops and 1 at big tech)
   * Quant trading internship at top firm
   * Accepted offer as SWE after 2023 graduation
* Extra curricular and other experience:
   * TA'd for a few CS/Math classes at my university over the past 3 years
* Undergrad school/major:
   * Ivy, CS (have taken fair amount of econ/entrepreneurship classes fwiw)
* Race/nationality: White/US
* Sex: M

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: Haven't taken yet, had 1580 SAT
* Undergrad GPA: \~3.7

I know that I need the test scores for a better picture of whether I'll have a good application, and at this point it's late to apply to deferred programs, but like I said I just want to see if it's worth a shot. I also don't really have any concrete leadership experience that I could put on an application, so I guess that's also a weakness.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts, thanks!"

10qjaku,0,2023-01-31,Is it worth overthinking which master's to select in my position?,wardrobe_creator,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10qjaku/is_it_worth_overthinking_which_masters_to_select/,"I am an incoming new grad Data Scientist and I recently got some of my admissions listed below. If cost is not a **primary** issue which of these programs are worth pursuing for someone who already has DS in undergrad?

* My undergrad degree included a good amount of CS (like discrete math) /Stats (like statistical modeling or mathematical statistics) /Math courses (Calc 1/2 etc) and I had done 2 data science internships where I mostly did MLE, not Analytics, and worked with P.h.D Data Scientists.
   * Although I feel like I don't know enough stats and I want to learn more to interpret models.
* My main goal is to pursue MLE in any domain instead of analytics but open to DS, and analytics if companies prefer P.h.D's in the future (I am aware of the whole P.h.D's are much better than MS candidates and I witnessed that in my undergrad internships)
   * However, I am very passionate about DS and want to become a better DS in the future, I did a lot of projects in my internships that consisted of utilizing advanced NLP and Traditional ML algorithms.

I have U Chicago and U Penn on my top 2 as I met with the students in these programs and they are all in tech or fintech companies and doing great in their fields. And of course, I have a bias toward getting a top-10-ranked university degree. I have to do an online degree as I have a DS job lined up and I have to make money to live to support myself. Right now I am only thinking of waiting for U Penn's decision since it's cheaper.

**Edit:** U Chicago also calls the admitted students to campus twice to meet with faculty and other students which I really value.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Got LOR from my CS, Statistics, and Media Studies teacher. I did well in their classes and have extracurricular connections with them so I'd say all are pretty solid. 

**Interviews**

Cornell: 7/10. Lasted for 30 mins. Mostly me asking her questions but it was non-evaluative. 

UPenn: 7/10. Lasted for 40 mins. He only asked generic questions (e.g. what do you want to get out of the Penn experience) and then I got to ask him questions for the remainder of the interview. 

Northwestern: 8/10. Lasted for almost an hour. She asked a lot of questions but none of them were extremely tricky. I felt like the interviewer wanted to test my understanding of Northwestern's (and McCormick's) offerings but more importantly me as a person and my values. Had some good insights there but the delivery wasn't the best due to nervousness. 

**Essays**

Personal statement: A pretty personal piece about my political involvement and personal growth. Think it showcases resilience, leadership, and intellectual vitality. 

Supplemental essays: I did some pretty thorough research into each university's program, research opportunities, extracurricular, traditions, and special offerings, and was able to tie back to my own experiences and interdisciplinary passions.

Because of this, I missed out on both learning and career opportunities and I honestly feel like I wasted my degree. It's been difficult trying to find SWE internships and even when I do get an interview, they don't ever go well. I have an offer for tech consulting this summer which will probably turn into a full-time offer, but being a junior analyst at a publicly traded company won't yield too large of a salary at all, at least not for having completed a CS degree.

So my question is this...if I really wanted to become a software engineer, would it be worth it to pay for something similar to a coursera/udemy/code academy software engineering course in order to increase my likeliness of getting a SWE job once I graduate?

I just feel like I've wasted away my entire degree not even having the skills to get a job without this additional support and I would appreciate the insight."

Context: I am a gap year homeschooler who applied to 18 schools, most t20s, HYPS, etc. I got a 1540 sat, took the most APs I could in my schooling structure and got all 4s and 5s on the exams, and have what others say are rlly good ecs- developed a quant trading system that made me and my fam a lot of money. One of Amazons most sold finance magazines wrote a profile on me and a 1 billion dollar financial media network interviewed me. Both were regarding my trading. Also ran a different business that made 22k,75k revenue. More of my ecs below 👇 

For rd, I have only received an interview from Dartmouth- which I absolutely nailed he even told me that he would “obviously write a very strong report abt me.” I live in a large urban city in the south. However, I have not received any other interviews. I am especially concerned about Yale as it gives interviews to applicants who they need more info on. Do you think I haven’t got many because I was homeschooled? Will colleges hold being homeschooled against me considering my stats? Will my academics/ stats check the box for t20s?

Also one person told me that an AO at a top university said homeschoolers don’t get that much consideration because of potentially underdeveloped social skills. However, that couldnt be further from the case for me: I have done 3 internships- one of which was a congressional one- have one more lined up, run a financial literacy nonprofit, led an advocacy group that has made a big difference in my city, and founded a finance  and gov club. ALL WERE DONE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. Furthermore, I know of and know homeschoolers who got into Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, mit, Stanford, Cornell, and UPenn.

Thanks for reading and I would appreciate your honest thoughts and feedback."

I really fucked up sophomore yr  (2nd sem) and it really effected my gpa. My dad was sick, I'm an only child, it was finals time, just a total shit show. Straight A's freshman yr aside from B- in gym (online gym, long story). First sem sophomore yr I had A's for the most part (1 B I think). 2nd sem is a different story, I got 2 C's and 2 B's it was so bad, I honestly think I could have talked to my teachers abt it and that's something I regret.

Now it's junior year, I stepped it up straight A's (1 A-) first sem and I thought my gpa would go up more but it's literally a 3.65. I think I could get it up to a 3.71 uw or something by next year, maybe a bit higher by 2nd sem senior yr, but that's about it because I'm already on a course overload. I go to one of the better public schools in my state so def on the lower end w/ gpa.

Rigor wise I've taken/taking 11 AP's, few honors and this will probably go up by 4 - 5 AP's + some dual enrollment w/ senior yr courses. The AP's don't help w/ gpa though bc my school doesn't do weighted which sucks ass because I haven't gotten below an A- in an AP course.

EC'S!! nothing too crazy, and this is the section I could use some advice w/ because this + test scores (35 act) is all I've got going for me.

3 yrs of debate - leadership but no notable awards (i hate pf)

2 yrs forensic - we'll see how this congress season goes, I have some little awards nothing crazy

3 years coding club and stem club- leadership and hrs from teaching kids how to code and stuff

1 yr amnesty - maybe leadership?? idk

FBLA, HOSA, first year so we'll see

Link crew

Internship w/ small data science company (have some more interning stuff planned for summer and later in the yr)

150 hrs + w/ this camp teaching little kids stem stuff

I like making pretty graphs on tableau maybe this will go somewhere

I'm working on a roblox game and app

umich, wash u, berk, cornell, vandy, nyu were all kinda dream schools until the gpa shit happened but if anyone has any insight on what ec's I should focus on, target schools (in state for uw madison?), passion projects, internships, any of that stuff it would be greatly appreciated"
10qnvb7,0,2023-02-01,"Chances of Organic Chemistry PhD Admission? (Very stressed out, lol! :/)",OrganicEvelynn,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/10qnvb7/chances_of_organic_chemistry_phd_admission_very/,"**About Me**  
I'm a second-semester junior BS Chemistry candidate at a top-20 public university for Chemistry... and I am stressing myself out like crazy over graduate school admissions. If it matters, I'm also an American. I'm aspiring to get into a PhD Organic Chemistry program. If you care about specifics- synthetic organic chemistry (want to work either in academia or in synthesis relevant to pharmaceuticals). I try to think I have a well-rounded undergraduate career, but I killed myself trying to graduate a year early, and now I'm afraid I just haven't done enough. It seems like every time I compare myself to other people, I feel incredibly behind-- despite also feeling like I've been working my ass off as much as I can.

So I'm here, writing this post. Seeing what you people think. I'm more than happy to answer any questions. I'll try to make everything digestible for you, because I know there's a million people asking for feedback every day.

**What I've Done**  
University

* Overall GPA: \~3.5 (I \**think\** I can push for 3.6 by the time I'm done?)
* Expected Graduation: Fall 2023
* Coursework: Good on the organic chemistry courses (A's and B's), but iffy on some of the non-organic chemistry science related courses. (C+ in physical chemistry *due to non-academic related reasons ((but cannot be retaken at my uni)\*\*\* also see Letters of Rec!)* and genetics, pretty much B's in other chemistry fields.) But what I do have going for me is...
* Graduate Coursework: Three organic chemistry related graduate classes... 2 A's, 1 B.

**Research Experience/Extra Uni Stuff**

* Research and Publications: Started research at my uni last Fall or so. So by the time I graduate next Fall, we're looking at about 1.5 years of research. Going to be fourth author on a publication within the next month or so. (Going to try and get another pub in before I graduate.)
* Positions: I've been an Organic Chemistry I TA (1 semester), an Organic Chemistry Lab TA (1 semester), and an Organic Chemistry Tutor at my undergrad's tutoring center (1 semester).
* Professors/Letters of Rec: I have really good relationships with two professors- one of which is my advisor for the group I'm in, and the other is a fairly well-known author in a certain subsection of organic chemistry. I plan to have them write my letters of rec, and while I obviously can't read them, I'm sure they are very good. *\*\*\* One of these letter-writers has already kindly offered to address this personal issue to make it less of a big deal in my application (was very understanding of it). Are there any thoughts on this?*
* REUs: None yet, but I applied to multiple universities for this summer. So there should be one.
* Chemistry GRE: Haven't done yet. (Should I? Is it worth the time investment?)
* Internships: None

**Other Stuff**

* Certified Pharmacy Technician: Passed the PTCB, got certified, have been pharmteching for 1.5 years (used to think that was the path I wanted until I got into a pharmacy.. lol.)
* Sterile Compounding and Aseptic Technique Certified: I'm IV certified, but this is also applicable to any lab that would require aseptic technique, I presume.
* Other Positions: I used to write chemistry lessons for an international Khan Academy-styled website.

**Where I Want to Go**  
I honestly really want to go to either UNC Chapel Hill or UT Austin. Of course, I'd be more than happy to go to a higher tier university like Columbia or Harvard, but those two graduate programs (and some of the research they do there) specifically stuck out to me. And I'm worried that I just haven't done enough to even get into those programs. :/

**TL;DR (but go back and read it D:&lt;)**  
BS Chemistry at top 20 chemistry public uni in the US, 3.5 GPA overall, 1.5 years of research by the time I graduate, 4th author on a pub (maybe a second pub too), some non-ochem chemistry grades feel iffy but 3 ochem grad classes (2 A's, 1 B). Have been an ochem 1 and ochem lab TA, as well as various other uni and non-uni teaching positions. Also certified in aseptic technique/sterile compounding and a certified pharmtech. Is this enough for UNC Chapel Hill/UT Austin for a PhD in synthetic organic chem?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm more than happy to discuss more details in DMs. For obvious reasons, I don't want to be more specific on here. But the point of me writing this out is that I constantly feel as if I'm not doing enough. I still feel as if I have time left, and I need to use it wisely to maximize my chances. I still feel as if I have a chance to turn things around (if they even need to be??). Have I done enough? What is the best usage of my time? I intended on graduating Fall 2023, but if I have to stay the extra semester (4 years instead of 3.5), I will.

I never intended on making a post like this-- ever. But this has started to eat into my mental health. Again, I'm more than willing to talk privately if anyone wants to reach out about organic chemistry or this admissions process.

Thanks a bunch. &lt;3"

* My bad luck was that my manager used to pressurize everyone a lot. He used to assign tasks with very short deadlines and me and my ADHD brain were not able to cope up. I was putting in from 9 AM to 9 PM i.e. 12 hours and even then I was not able to complete on time. I even worked on the weekends on some occasions. Others used to leave early while I used to sit rubbing my ass for the entire day and couldn't meet expectations. My manager got fired because everyone used to complain that he stressed everyone on the team.
* I was made fun of because I was spending so much time in the office and everyone used to say ""Get a life"".
* After my 3 month probation ended, the CTO extended it for another 2 months saying that he is giving me the benefit of the doubt that because of my manager I was lost and not performed well.
* Firstly, my brain couldn't focus because it was distracted all the time and secondly, the fear of getting fired used to stress me up a lot. Every single morning I had anxiety and it was a depressing experience. 
* Again, I failed to meet expectations and eventually got fired :(
* Everyone in my company used to go to play football, basketball every week except for me. I used to postpone it saying that I will go next week and this continued until I got fired.
* This is not the first time someone was disappointed in me. Even during my internship, the CEO used to look at me with disappointment because I failed to meet the deadlines. I worked EXTREMELY HARD, I don't know what is wrong with me.
* I was bullied and made fun of in every phase of my life be it school, high school, college, university, work, etc. 
* I have a very poor working memory and now that I am jobless, I keep getting suicidal and wish I should have ended my life early on because these thoughts were consistent throughout my life right from my childhood.

Just wanted to vent it out. If you have any suggestions or if you can relate, let me know."

Let's just say that this recruiting cycle for internships has not gone the way I wanted it to. I basically got resume rejected from every single MANGA/Big Tech/Well-known tech company that pays over 140K TC except from the one from my school's career fair. I got rejected after the onsite interview for that company. I do not believe it was a resume issue since I had one previous internship at a F500 non-tech company and I was getting callbacks from non-MANGA/Big Tech companies. It stings quite a bit seeing people I know get these amazing offers with potential return offers of 180K+. The only offer I got this recruiting cycle is from JP Morgan Chase, who's new grad TC is from 100-120K depending on location.

I don't care about prestige but these companies pay a lot. I am especially concerned because with the economy, getting a good new grad job is going to be so much more difficult, and I'll only have JPMC on my resume while everyone else has these Big Tech and MANGA companies.

I have accepted the fact that I will not be working at a MANGA/Big Tech company out of college.

My question is how's the Big Tech interview process like for people with 1-2 YOE? Also, what's a good starting salary out of college for the NYC area?"

Hi all, i have another job offer where id like to ask my current employer to match the compensation. This is my first fulltime position so i just want to know what to expect and whats fair. 
When should the new compensation become effective? Immediately?
The yearly raise amount has not been announced yet, so would getting this compensation match mean i wont get the yearly raise as well?
How long do i give my boss/HR to figure out if they can match it? 
Please let me know any other tips in navigating this conversation for the first time! Thank you!!

Edit; update: thanks everyone for all the amazing feedback  a little about my situation: first full time engineering job out of college (have 5 years of good intern experience though). This February with be my 1 year with the company. I severely undervalued myself in the initial interview when asked my expected salary(i know i shouldnt of told them a number now, and i also know this is my fault). My group not including manager is 5 people and since ive started, three have left and been replaced(slowly). All of us are overworked working 12 hour days and needed changes are being thrown at us left and right last minute. I wouldnt say im invaluable but i would say my team would suffer extremely without me doing my work. This was a bit of a money grab but again i severely undervalued myself by around 20k which is affecting my financial situation, but i also do kind of want to leave because of the horrible work life balance. I also didnt think i would get an offer this fast

Anyways, because of all your great input i have decided to just turn down the offer and wait until i get an offer im more excited about so if they dont counter offer ill still be happy with the new job id be accepting. Or who knows, maybe at that point ill just take the new job. 

Appreciate you all!"

I took a semester off during remote instruction due to the pandemic so I’m technically a semester “behind” everyone else, but I‘ve been planning to graduate in 3.5 years in order to minimize the financial drain of out-of-state tuition. 

I’m currently interested in working in ML or Data Science, but I was considering grad school and law school until very recently so I have some (tangentially related) research experience but zero internships and nothing lined up for the summer. 

I’m really concerned about how this will impact my chances at new grad recruitment next year. I‘ve been applying to a whole bunch of internships since July but only heard back from quant firms and a few DS recruiters, who eventually also rejected me. I’m trying my best to flesh out my existing projects to show competency for new grad roles next year but I’m not sure if that would be enough to compensate for the lack of real work experience.

I am from Electronics stream my grades are average. I am in my last year and we have to do an internship during this time.
I know JAVA , SQL and Version Control  basics.


My college mates are getting placed i didn't have any luck in college placements. Now i am getting an internship offer from a very small startup which will pay me around 7k per month for four months and are going to train me as a backend developer with tech stack as java and spring boot.
I am getting nightmares seeing that number(7k) while my friends and other Students got way too good offer from campus placement. 


Should i join here as an intern or prepare for interviews  and make some good projects so that i can get a good offer. Will this internship help me in my carrer or will i get nothing out of it i am really confused right now."

I didn’t want to but it’s one of those instances where I felt like I had to or else.. 
About two years I mentioned that I wanted to take my name off the property so that I can get my own. The verbal abuse came running in and everytime I bring it up.

She has tried to sell the property but due to cladding issues it was never possible. The housing association is currently changing the cladding and due to finish in about 2 years.

She mentioned selling the flat which I’m fine with as it’s a step closer to taking my name off but now she wants me to agree to signing a document so that she can seek permission to sublet. 
Her reason…it’s quicker and can possibly sell when all the work is done on the flat. I don’t have a good feeling about this.

 I’m 27F and fortunately my partner was able to purchase a house on his own thanks to a 5% mortgage but I still want my name take off so I can join him on the next purchase or get one one my own.

What do I do?

I’m thinking to say no to renting but I’ll sign the document to sell."

I'll be working full time while progressing through this program and I'd love any and all feedback on how realistic the below schedule is:

Some of my goals with this schedule are:

\- target recruiting season of Fall 2024 for summer 2025 internships thus I want to get data structures, algorithms, and codepath technical interview prep done before Fall 2024. I really need the structure of codepath and classes to force me to practice leetcode since I've had so many years to practice and never do on my own.

\- participate in as many codepath programs as possible to beef up my portfolio and get skills for hackathons / work

For CS 161, I applied to transfer in credit but I am still waiting to hear back. This schedule assumes I get credit for prior CS classes I took in undergrad.

For CS 261 (and other C based classes), I already took a course in undergrad in C and got some exposure to basic data structures from an intro CS class (linked lists, binary search trees, heap, hash table, etc.). So I'm not concerned with pairing with Web Dev at the same time, especially if I can do the codepath version of the course first.

For CS 340, I already use SQL for work so I imagine with web dev experience this class won't be too difficult.

For CS 344, I've heard operating systems is hard and this is something I don't have experience in. Are there any courses to do beforehand that people recommend? One plan for my last two electives are to take intro to networks then cloud computing. I don't know how to fit in operating systems though if I take those two back to back.

I was very sad because I could not find an internship, trainee, assistant, etc."" It is a very academic and specific area, but unfortunately I only realized that now. I don't want to be a scholar/researcher. The classes' subjects are cool, but I always end up having the feeling that this course would not take me anywhere. I know English at an Advanced Level, and I know a little about French. I intend to learn other languages. However, none of this helped me to get an opportunity.  


I sent out many résumés, and few responses came.  


I am 21 years old and I intend to finish my degree, but I don't have any prospects of continuing with this ""career"". The only thing I think of doing with my diploma is to try a diplomatic career in the far future, but that's it. Seeing this, I understood that my area was useless and I should have chosen another one. I think a lot about IT and Systems Analysis and Development, because I always liked technology (although I'm not so good at math, I'm fixing that). I'm considering taking a technologist course in the IT field. However, many people say it's questionable, since technologists are difficult to be validated abroad (working abroad is my dream).  


It's very frustrating because I thought things would work out for me, but the result was: I'm still living at my parents' house, with no money and studying to get an opportunity. Also, I live in an emerging country facing an economic crisis.  


So, redditors, could you help me? I need advice regarding the new career I am going to follow. Thinking about working abroad, is it a good idea to take a technical course or a bachelor's degree? Are there any opportunities in the I.R. field for an undergrad like me? What should I do?

I’ve been applying to 100’s of places to intern as a software developer, but as you may know the economy for that sector isn’t the best, thus the layoffs and hiring freezes. 

I started applying to Electronic Technician roles to just see if I would get any bites, and I was quite surprised by the responses. Right now I work only as an Electronics Assembler for $21 an hour, but a hospital wants an interview with me that ranges from $25-$40 an hour as a Electronics Service Technician. The only problem is, I forgot like %95 percent of the shit I taught in regards to circuits, using a the DMM and Oscilloscopes, etc.. 

I only remember what I was taught in Java, C, and Assembly because I was way more interested in it, however I feel as if I’d be stupid to not try out this interview for a better pay. I mean I know how to solder shit and I know basic electronic components like resisters, capacitors, transistors, etc.. I can also follow a schematic and blueprints, but idk the calculations at all.

Should I just try the interview anyways or will I just embarrass myself for an hour?"

**Background:**

* Indian male
* Freshman applying for sophomore fall transfer
* Currently english major, looking to major in philosophy and maybe business

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats/Honors:**

* 3.94 GPA first semester of college (aiming for a 4.0 second semester)
* 3.87 W HS GPA (First year: pretty much all B’s. Second year: B’s, C’s and D’s. Third Year: B’s and A’s. Fourth Year: All A’s.)
* APs
   * Two 3s and 6 4s
* Dean’s List
* Honors College
* English Honors Society (High School)

**ECs:**

* College
   * Mock Trial teammate
   * College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Ambassador
   * International Research Organization Intern
   * Summer School Teacher’s Assistant
   * YMCA Initiative Leader
   * Honor Board Infractions Panel Member
* HS
   * Food Pantry Volunteer (12th grade)
   * Academic Team Officer, Varsity (9th, 10th, and 12th grade)
   * School’s Jazz Band, played Guitar and Bass (9th and 10th)
   * Summer School Student Aide (11th)
   * Varsity Lacrosse (sucked ass) (9th grade)

I’m heavily thinking of dropping pretty much half of High School ECs

**Essays/Reasons for transferring:**

* I never had a true drive to excel in my studies until recently last year, where I begun to develop clear and solid goals and believe in myself.
* Working at my research firm internship I had to look into the academic fields of philosophy and history a lot, becoming fascinated with it. This tailored my drive into what I would like to interact with during my undergrad years, and Cornell, UChicago, and UVA all are very active in this field. Currently I am at a Tech school, so I would like to move to a school that supports my interests in liberal arts.
* I would like to pursue a career in law and these schools would provide me with the challenge necessary to live up to in order to meet my grander career goals

I still need to work on my essays and reasons, I am confident that I can make my explanations stronger so this isn’t too much of a worry for me.

Realistically, what are my chances for being accepted into these schools? I’ve never done nor even thought about applying to T25 until this year, so I’d like to level my expectations to reality. Also, do you guys have any recommendations of what I could do to strengthen my application?"
10ratw4,1,2023-02-01,Moving Out of Home,Rando_Rohi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10ratw4/moving_out_of_home/,"Hi!

So, I'm in a bit of a predicament in terms of moving out of home for uni.

1) I'm now a 2nd year students, have lived at the dorms but moved back home between academic years. Late last year, I decided to go to the uni provided cottages for 2nd year since it'd be easier with furniture and utilities already provided. The cottage was suppose to be filled with 3 other of my mates, but 2 of them dropped out and the 3rd I'm having issues with since she has a kind of ""middle-class"" mentality despite being a broke uni student.

2) The rest of my friends have already decided to find flats, but they waited until they worked in their home towns for the summer to find a flat. 2 out of our friend group haven't found a place.

These 2 friends are good mates of mine, and I don't really want to live in a cottage with 2 strangers and 1 friend that I'm lowkey starting to dislike. I want to move into a flat with my 2 other mates who are still on the hunt, but it's the timeframe and money thats an issue.

I've already paid my 1k move-in costs for the cottages, and due to the design of my summer internship I get paid monthly. I could inquire about receiving a refund for my 1k move-in costs and waiting for my paycheck next week to find a flat with my mates, but I'm unsure. I won't have any other source of money besides student benefit that starts on March 7th, and I know we'll have to buy furniture and utilities if we move into a flat.

In hindsight, it's a bad idea even tho my mates agreed to help me out until I get any income in. So, it's like picking the worser out of the two: stay in the cottage with people I don't know or like, or move last minute with my mates that might put me in a financially awkward decision?

Any advice?"
10rawoc,1,2023-02-01,Should I still try to apply to internships after graduating?,attacker101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10rawoc/should_i_still_try_to_apply_to_internships_after/,I'm currently in the process of applying for my first job in a comp sci field after graduation. My issue is that I never managed to get an internship so my experience is limited to the few projects in my portfolio and whatever I learned in school. It seems that when looking at any junior or entry level jobs just about all of them expect you to have some years of working experience but almost no internships will hire students who have already graduated. Feels like I'm in a weird limbo of experience where my selection of jobs I can apply for is pretty limited. Should I still be applying for internships hoping maybe one does pick me up? Where's the best place to find jobs without much real professional experience? Any help is appreciated just not sure who else to ask about this.
10rb06y,36,2023-02-01,"In retrospect, I was a bit hasty.",HadTo87,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/10rb06y/in_retrospect_i_was_a_bit_hasty/,"As the title goes, I think I was hasty to conclude I wasn't fit to be a therapist. What I mean is, I wrote posts on here a while back about how I was going to leave the field. I thought I just wasn't... enough in all sorts of ways. I was afraid I wasn't empathetic, or expert, or fit enough to practice.

That changed though after several months. What I want to share here is some insights I've gotten in that time. I hope they resonate with those it applies to, and if they do, that they're helpful in alleviating similar feelings of inadequacy.

The first is, unchecked stress made me think I was incompetent. You might have heart of the acronym, 'H.A.L.T'? Hungry, angry, lonely, and tired. Well, of these, I was really tired from the amount of work related stress I had. And because I didn't take opportunities to reflect on what I could actually control, I internalized the frustrations that came up. My takeaway, to offer here is: be mindful of your need for rest, and really account for what responsibilities need to be yours. There's a good chance you might take on more than is necessary, and in doing so, become frustrated with your inability to do it all. Reward yourself with rest, and reflect on what you have achieved, and honor what your limits are.

The next is related to the first, in that if you don't feel empathetic enough -- that may not be the case. What I experienced was that my tiredness led to feeling weary. I had internalized a certain dread about caring for myself -- and so that led to me worrying that I can't offer support for another. My takeaway here is: your physical and mental fatigue can turn into emotional fatigue that *needs to be cared for.* I'd encourage you to ask yourself, ""How do I see myself caring for, and empathizing with others when I don't, or can't do it for myself?"" I've learned that self-care actually exists. Go figure. Special consideration here: mental and physical fatigue may not be got at your own expense -- check to see if situations, relationships, or extra curricular commitments could use reprioritizing in your life.

A third thing I learned was I will never be expert enough. It was be a sad state of affairs if I believed graduate school, life experience, and scant bits of info I learned from is enough to create an expert. These all play a role, but I firmly believe that being an expert of any subject is really going to require focused study. It will occur over a relatively extended period of time. And it should take as much effort as, say, graduate school and internship took. Cue a special consideration here: I was BURNT OUT on learning after graduate school. And you may be too. Growing as a person, student, and expert is real work. Work necessitates rest to build bigger muscles, be they mental, emotional, physical, relational, spiritual, and so on. My takeaway here is: becoming an expert is just that... a 'becoming', overtime, with effort that warrants mindfulness to received needed rest for growth.

Oof, being fit to practice is something I'm realizing is, for me, a highly subjective judgement call to make. I realized I based my goodness of fit to practice therapy on several factors: self talk, comparing to others, unrealistic expectations of self and others, lacking insight of my strengths and needs, and really... the list could go on. Any one of these are important enough to get help with -- and altogether? They make a case for either understanding a little grace will help me develop as a good fit for therapy, or a case for all manner of distress. My takeaway here is from that great Ford quote: ""Whether you think you can, or think you can't, you're correct."" Of course I believe there are objective grounded factors that make a person good at being a therapist, but that's not what I'm getting at here. What I'm saying is, if, like me, you said to yourself ""I want to practice but, (**insert negative cognition here**.)"", repeatedly, then you might just need to lean into that. Ask why you would discount yourself from doing something you *want* to do, and why you'd struggle to do that instead of seeking help, answers, support, or alternative paths to meet the same goal. My suggestion is to consider that changing careers altogether isn't the answer, but rather, consider small changes that can be made to make your life as a therapist better. You deserve a good life even though it's not all good all the time.

In a nut shell, if you questioned getting into a different field from therapy -- based in some things I've mentioned here... hopefully my reflections can be helpful for you. I really struggled, and now that I'm in a better place, I'd like to honor that part of me that didn't have hope not too long ago.

10rcubd,68,2023-02-01,UConn or Stanford?,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/10rcubd/uconn_or_stanford/,"I found out yesterday that I was nominated for the Presidential Scholars Award, and from people at my school who've gotten that award in the past, I basically go to UConn for free. 

However, I also got into Stanford, and Stanford has been my dream school for pretty much forever. The campus is INSANE, and when I visited I felt like I clicked so well with the students there. I can still afford to go there due to generous financial aid, but the plane tickets, expenses in California, etc would make it expensive. 

I want to be a math teacher, and will probably teach in Connecticut because there is higher pay and more benefits, and from a financial standpoint it makes sense to go to UConn. The NEAG school is very highly regarded, and I like how they have a lot of opportunities for student teaching and internships. 

Going to Stanford would be amazing, and if I decided in college that I didn't want to be a teacher having a Stanford degree and alumni connections could possibly open me up to career paths that I may not get from UConn. 

I still have a few months to decide, but I am very torn about which school to go to so please give me your advice!!!"

So the final deliverable was for a zip file of CSS, HTML, and js code/templates kind of like what you'd get when you download one online. So I submitted my final template as professionally as possible, as you'll see in a GitHub repo or downloaded online, it was clean code with a [README.md](https://README.md) and a static folder alongside the templates in a zip file. An intern came along that jumped along the project and complained that it's not best practice because it doesn't have comments in the code or CSS files so it's poorly documented though it clearly has a [README.md](https://README.md) file that they didn't see before making that statement.  I have more years of experience in coding, working on professional software engineering projects, and producing better quality work but because I don't have a CS background the managers tend to devalue my opinion and value the opinion of anyone else that does. I've never seen a professional zip template file I've downloaded online have a bunch of comments in the code and have authorship comments on top of the HTML file as the student complained about..I think it's unclean to present a final deliverable like that .. but I'm not sure anymore.. how do you guys deliver final deliverables?"

For starters I’m a first year teacher that literally just started mid-year . I understand that I lack experience and assume things will get better with time. I have advanced and ESOL 8th grade ELA . They’ve had substitute teachers for months and are academically really behind. 
4 out of 6 of my classes are absolute chaos . I struggle to get control of the room most days. 
I especially struggle with my last ESOL class, where I have a group of kids that literally ignore me and talk very loud over me no matter what I do. 
I have a point system in class , like a game where kids get points for positive behaviors and lose points for negative behaviors. The group with the most points gets a prize each week. It works for most classes. But this particular group has no care in the world . I’m at my wits end with what to do with them. 

It all feels really discouraging. My internship experience was so positive, I felt that I was doing well, I saw test scores increase under my teaching. I believed in myself and my abilities. 

Now I feel that I am not a good enough teacher, especially for my ESOL students. Especially because I don’t know any other language besides English and Spanish. My Turkish students have no clue what’s going on. 

It doesn’t help that I’m 24 with the face of a 17 year old. I feel embarrassed when admin peaks in my room . I feel like everyone can tell I’m struggling. 

I love this profession. I believe in this profession . I want to stay here. I just need help. 

How can I improve ? 

Any advice is welcomed and greatly appreciated."

Before actually doing ML, I was fascinated by the subject but as soon as I started taking courses on core ML topics such as NLP, DL, I found it quite tedious and felt like I should be knowing a lot before doing this. The pre requisite list is huge. And most of the times I feel overwhelmed and sometimes discouraged.

On the other hand, I know of a few guys who speaks confidently on ML topics and convinces others that they know ML. Few of them even have a lot of papers published. One day, I happened to be a part of a group activity where we needed to solve a bunch of questions on ML and to my shock some of these guy could not even understand those questions fully. Yet they keep on publishing papers, seems excited about the topics, some of them are doing internships as an ML engineer. 

I appreciate the fact that these people are trying but I can’t comprehend if they are doing this just for the sake of looking good or they are actually learning things. Reason I am writing this is because it gives me FOMO sometimes. 

Do everyone follow such approach or you clear all your basics say in linear algebra and maths first and then attempt to work on these niche fields? Also what do companies asks during ML engineer interviews coz they guys seem to get internships easily?

Am I missing something?"

And just to be clear, this is definitely final and not just some fight that will blow over. I am currently staying at a cheap motel.

I would like some advice on how to proceed with my life from now on. **Details about myself and my situation:**

* Second Year (51 out of 120 credits to graduate so far) Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University in the Metro Vancouver area.
   * \~3.0 GPA. No internships yet.
   * Was on track to graduate \~August 2025. This situation might derail that plan.
   * Current school term ends in April and the next one begins in May.
* **Possessions:**
   * $2800 CAD in my TD bank account.
   * 2020 m1 MacBook
   * Phone
      * Phone Number is under my parent's plan. It will probably be cut very soon. (This is a concern since my bank and other services I use are linked to this phone number)
   * I have 10 shirts, 2 pants, 2 jackets.
   * No car. And I have a Novice driver's license.
* No debt, besides my student loans.
* Before this situation, every 4 months (3 school terms in a year), I applied for a student loan.
   * Because of my parents' low income, I get on average a $3000 federal and provincial student loan that pays off the entire term's tuition of \~$2900.
   * Additionally, in the past 2 school terms (8 months) my parents' income decreased even further. As such, in the past 2 terms I've been getting \~$1300 through a student grant (not a loan).
   * Prior to those 2 terms, my university allowed me to apply for bursaries that have awarded me \~$500 (not a loan). However, whenever I get a grant from the government, I don't qualify for the bursary.
   * I have $10,000 in student loans that I have accumulated so far.
   * I'm not exactly sure if StudentAidBC will still require my parent's tax information next term.
* Student housing is provided by the university. However, you need to apply before every term.
   * Student housing is around $3400 a term (4 months)
      * However most require you to also subscribe to a meal plan of \~$2800 a term
   * I've heard that it is a lottery to get a dorm and is unlikely, but that was first year.
* **No job.**
   * This is very much my fault for being complacent and expecting to not have to work until I graduate university, but I have never had a job in my life.
   * Never paid taxes in my life due to this.
   * Don't even know how to start looking for a job.
* Have absolutely no idea how to purchase a rental place
* Absolutely no financial knowledge
* No friends that can provide me a couch.

Right now, I am thinking of looking for an AirBNB to stay for the week and eating one meal a day. Also, googling about everything I lack and listed on my list. I am also thinking about dropping all my courses this term to focus on my current situation... I would just like some advice on what to do now. Particularly on finding a job and finding somewhere to live.

EDIT: Thank you all for all the advice that you guys have given. I have been awake for 30 hours now and about to pass out. Will make sure to read everything when I wake up. Again, thanks everyone."

1. First, as a R&amp;D intern on a training and management consulting company.
- Lasts for 6 months.
- Output-based, we do have weekly meetings and consultations.
-Let's me be super flexible with my time since I am not required to clock in hours.
- Learning research and data analytics would be a great learning opportunity.

2. Second, I got in as a Business Operations Intern from an on-demand service app company.
- Needs to render at least 480 hours or 3-4 months
- Requires me to clock in hours and have a schedule from 4 days a week, 11:00am-6:00pm
- Indicated that I can be flexible with my time and don't have a minimum hours per day as long as I complete the 480 hours
- The one who interviewed me said that I can be mentored into different teams, not limited to 2 teams.

Now, here are the problems. Would it be bad for my resume if I did 2 interships on the same timeframe? Is the hassle and strain on my health worth having the 2 internships? Can I still cancel my internship since I haven't signed anything. Thank you for the advice!!"

There is also The Rowdyruff Boys that fans keep bringing up about with Brick, Boomer and Butch like why can’t they get along or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides they always ship The PPG with RRB which I always find a a bit odd. Well there is an episode, or was supposed to be till it was locked away or thrown out. My friend worked there as an intern when he heard about this episode.

&amp;#x200B;

It started as a rumor during his time there when the creator of the show, Craig McCracken, said he was gonna see a new review of the episode he was told about and came out a few minutes later looking like he saw a ghost.

&amp;#x200B;

When he was questioned about this, he refused to answer and just walked away. Before he did however, he told the people in the room to lock that thing up and never let it see the light of day in a more disappointed tone. I think some people managed to peek at whatever he was watching since the rumors said, ‘I think one of the Rowdyruff boys did something.” or, ""Was it Boomer or Bubbles that did something?”.

Of course they were rumors so my friend didn’t mind but he still was curious. Apparently to my friend, he went to a room full of episodes that were scrapped, cut and removed and he managed to find it. He then put up a computer in the room where he downloaded the episode on the computer on a mp4 format and put it in his Media player to put it on my computer and play the contents(This was back in 2004.) And it was just called sadboomer oddly.

&amp;#x200B;

How he did it with no one watching is beyond me, but what is known is that we are gonna see what the contents of this episode holds. My friend went to my home so we could watch it but most of the video was corrupted. Since I know how to fix a video, I fixed it mostly since there was too much to work on so we had to watch what was on the video.

&amp;#x200B;

The video started out with a normal intro like any other episode except with a few glitches here and there. Then the Title, ”Hurtful words” came on screen but there were no flashes of the Powerpuff girls flying in the screen, it just faded in as the pop music that usually plays in the title cards was replayed with just a slow piano music piece as if we’re gonna see something sad. It continued to fade into the opening credits but the names were absent as if it was unfinished as the last card just had no names at all.

&amp;#x200B;

The Episode starts with the usual, “The city of Townsville!” then cuts to a calm street with people walking and cars driving while the narrator continues, ""Has been pretty calm lately this past week.” It then cuts to different scenes of people doing different activities in the street as the narrator continues saying, ""As citizens like workers, bosses, joggers, shoppers…” It went on until it cut to Boomer just having a drink while walking as the narrator finishes by saying, ""And even villains just taking a stroll in the day!”

&amp;#x200B;

Boomer then finishes his drink as he just throws it on the street and steals another from a random person as the Narrator then says, ”Well…mostly strolling.”

&amp;#x200B;

The scene just continues as Boomer drinks from someone’s cup that he’d stolen just to at least do something while his brothers are away doing well whatever they are doing. He then bumps into a girl with long hair over her eyes as she falls to her knees as Boomer just keeps walking. “Hey!” The girl said, ""Watch where you’re going!” Boomer looks back at her, mockingly saying, “Oh I’m sorry! I didn’t see you there!” He then casually laughs as he walks over and snatches a snack from her.

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey, give that back!” The girl then shouted. “Or what? Gonna beat me up?” Boomer says in an amused and mocking tone as she stands up. “No.” She says offscreen as Boomer just looks at her. “Yeah I am sooooo scared by a stupid gi-” Boomer suddenly paused and jumped a bit at something offscreen. It then cuts the girl’s face. Her hair no longer covers her face as her eyes are shown. Her eyes were oddly bloodshot as we looked at the screen more.

&amp;#x200B;

She looked at Boomer with mild anger in her eyes as she just said, ""But I should be mindful of what I’m doing if I were you.” Boomer then awkwardly looks around as if she was talking to someone else and then looks back to the girl just gone as if she was never there.

&amp;#x200B;

Boomer starred as the spot for a while with a weirded out expression. ""Freak” he said as he rolled his eyes in annoyance as he walked off with a stolen snack and a stolen drink. Me and my friend both look at each other with confusion both asking ourselves, “What was that about?”

&amp;#x200B;

The scene continues as Boomer walks for a bit until he spots Brick and Butch fighting The PowerPuff Girls. He then literally throws the drink and snack aside as he flies to fight the girls as he says, ""Finally! About time!” since he was waiting for something to happen. He then meets them as they ask him where he was. He then says that he was just taking a stroll as they looked at him with disgust.

&amp;#x200B;

They then yelled at him for not being there with them when the Powerpuff Girls were fighting them for about an hour and Boomer did not know this. Boomer then said he’ll make it up as he charges head first and hits the leader several times before getting pummeled by them as there was a montage of him getting beaten up till he fell in an alleyway with a bruised face with a black eye and had messy hair.

&amp;#x200B;

He tried to apologize but was cut off with Brick yelling at him of how he’s an idiot for not only leaving them alone with the girls and getting beaten by the girls. Brick then starts to verbally insult him so much that he starts tearing up as Brick smacks him in the head as Butch just laughs at Boomer’s misfortune. We were shocked while watching Boomer just getting abused like this, especially by his brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles fly in frame and question what in the world are they doing to Boomer. Both have an argument about why you shouldn't hurt your brother before they begin to fight again. Bubbles did try to ask whether he was ok or not before she was pulled into the fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Boomer then looked at the sky with the fight taking place before flying offscreen. It then cut to Boomer’s expression and he looked like he was about to cry as he just walks off somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

We then see the fight still going on and both teams are getting tired. Both stopped as Bubbles pointed out the Boomer isn’t with them or at all since they fought for 2 hours. apparently Bubbles has been try to get their attention but no one listened till now. The Girls are a bit worried while the Boys were not concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

Both have an argument again till finally Bubbles suggested we should find him since they didn’t see him after what happened in the alleyway. Both agree pretty much but Brick is still less concerned about but still agrees to. Both then try to come up with a plan of how to find him quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

The scene then fades to Boomer walking alone on a street with a gloomy expression while sad music plays in the background. A small montage plays with Boomer going to a candy shop, basically eating loads of sugar, punches a hole through a vending machine to get some drinks, then lays down in an alleyway as it cuts to black.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend then asks, “Is this what Craig saw?” To be honest, this is what he probably saw. The scene then cuts to night where the girls are in their room, wondering where Boomer would be. Bubbles and Buttercup are concerned about Boomer while Blossom is a bit worried about it but is sure that Boomer might be found by the police.

&amp;#x200B;

This conversation goes on for a minute or two till it cuts back to Boomer walking in the street looking depressed, messy and…drunk? It turns out that the drinks Boomer stole from a vending machine earlier was actually beer cans since he is stumbling and is slurring with his words a bit as he rants on about how he was bullied by his brothers everyday no matter what he did.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus he ate a lot of sugar he was also jittery but more mad then happy as you see in cartoons where a character eats sugar (Mac from Foster's home for imaginary friends for example.).

&amp;#x200B;

As he ranted on of what he might do to his brothers when he gets the chance, the Narrator suddenly responds saying, “Boomer I think you might need to think about this and-” he was then cut off with Boomer telling him to shut up as he stares at the screen as we just realized that the Narrator was listening this whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

He continued to rant until the screen glitched for a few seconds and came back to Boomer just staring at the screen. We were both caught off guard because of how fast it happened. The first thing we noticed was his eyes. His eyes were replaced with what looked like photos eye's placed on his eyes which were just black.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that this creeped the hell out of me and my friend when we first saw this. It was like this for what seemed like a few minutes, just nothing but staring, no music, no sound, just silence. It glitches again and comes back to the scene of where it was before. Boomer stops ranting and looks down with tears in his eyes as we get to see flashbacks of previous episodes with the Rowdyruff boys having fun wrecking stuff and hanging out like brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

The flashbacks suddenly end as Boomer just looks up and says, ""Where did it all go wrong?"" and then after a while, he realized that his life was nothing more than just a ""Punching bag"" for everyone. As he made that realization, a smirk appears on his face and starts to laugh, and laugh and laugh uncontrollably. The scene suddenly cuts to black for a few seconds before cutting back to the Powerpuff girl’s house at night.

&amp;#x200B;

We get to see Boomer almost tripping on his way to a door to the lab since he drank beer and ate candy which I don't think doesn't blend well and he also was kind of giggling a bit when he entered. When he gets there and places his hand on the knob, he then looks back still looking quite tipsy. The scene shifts in the dark living room where we could’ve sworn we saw a figure around the corner and faded away leaving Boomer worried. Boomer opens the door and walks down the stairs still tipsy with the beer he stole earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

He looks around for a bit till something appears on the screen for a split second so we pause it and rewind back to what it was. It was a message saying, “What are you doing here?” We looked at each other confused over what it meant.

&amp;#x200B;

We resumed to Boomer still looking around until another message popped up, this time it stayed on the screen longer for us to read. It said, “You know you shouldn't be here.” We were really creeped out at this point but I thought it had something to do with Boomer being in the lab without permission or something like that but who is saying this to them?

&amp;#x200B;

The scene continues as Boomer walks up to the screen as we begin to see his eye turn to Bloodshot as he moves closer to the screen. He then looked up as the scene cuts to a shelf with Boomer looking up. As he reached to grab it, a sound can be heard as Boomer suddenly stops and turned to see what made the noise. We both got to see something around the corner but it was so dark in this scene so we couldn’t tell. Boomer continues to stare at the figure for a while before asking, ""H-hello? Who's there?” We cut back to the figure up close but it was still too dark.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly another figure popped into frame emitting a high pitched screech making us both jump as Boomer was scared out of his skin, put his back on the shelf. There were loads of figures, all of which were so terribly drawn and deformed we couldn’t even make out what they was supposed to look like, Although it did look like some of them were the girls and Boomer's brothers. Several messages appeared on screen and all of them said terrible things as the whispers grew louder and Boomer covered his hands on his face while crying, clearly terrified.

&amp;#x200B;

The figures and whispers then slowly fade away leaving an empty room with Boomer shaking of what he just saw. Boomer then looks up again as the scene cuts to a object he was reaching for which has a big red X on it as the scene gets covered in static.

&amp;#x200B;

The scene then cuts to Boomer walking in the opposite direction in the streets as he carries the flask from the previous scene with him. He also has a smirk on his face, but it looked forced, not to mention his eyes were slightly bloodshot since he was crying from the last scene. As he walked, the whispers from before appeared again and the figures appeared behind objects.

&amp;#x200B;

It looked like Boomer was being tormented by hallucinations from what happened and his realization. It was like this until he reached a building as he flew up to the top. There was what sounded like the wind in the background save for the whispers.

&amp;#x200B;

As he reached his smile dropped to a frown and teared up even more. The whispers were deafening in this scene as it continued. And then without warning, he chugged the flask in one motion and threw it down as the whispers went silent completely as he drank it but the wind still played.

&amp;#x200B;

A few seconds pass and he starts convulsing as dark brown spots appear around him as his skin turns pale. Me and my friend knew instantly what he just drank, he just drank Antidote X. He then falls off the roof from the pain and starts crying loudly. And then a few seconds later, he hits the ground with a sickening splat as the scene suddenly stops and repeats for a while. ""Oh my God...!"" exclaimed my friend who was horrified at the scene presented before us, Did Craig McCracken really see this? The wind sounded more distorted as his face faded in the screen, horribly mangled.

&amp;#x200B;

And then everything suddenly stops. Everything was white except for Boomer’s entire outline was just blue. There was soft orchestra music in the background as he opens his eyes and looks around confused and dazed.

&amp;#x200B;

He then looks in front of him to a familiar figure. The figure looked like Bunny from the episode Twisted Sister. The Bunny ghost looked at him with some concern and sadness as it asked him if what he did was really worth it. He opened his mouth to answer but stopped, frowned and looked down. The music stopped and the screen cut to black as Boomer said one word, ""No.”

&amp;#x200B;

It was just silent for a while until we started hearing Bubble's voice calling for Boomer with her sisters and his brothers. As the voices drew closer Boomer’s face fades in with blood on his left side of his face.

&amp;#x200B;

Bubbles then suddenly screams as Boomer’s left face distorts on screen. The screen comes back to a disgusting sight. It was Boomer, or just his mangled corpse laying on the street. The left side of his face is torn, his limbs were broken, just everything about him was broken. I let out a loudest gasp then I ever did in my whole life. My friend was just shocked at the scene.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while, a figure in the shape of Boomer started to rise above Boomer with those same eyes we saw before Boomer went to the girl’s house. I immediately suspected to be Boomer’s soul that looked over his corpse.

&amp;#x200B;

The screen cuts out to a black screen again but with only the sounds of police sirens. And then a message popped up saying, ”1 day later.” before fading out. We then get to see Mojo and Him in Mojo’s lair just sitting and looking down. Both have a conversation of how they would have known something like this would have. Mojo then asks, ""Were we good creators?” Him tells him yes and they did everything they could.

&amp;#x200B;

The next scene shows what appeared to be a hospital with Bubbles, Buttercup and Butch. Buttercup and Butch were having a fight over who’s fault it is that caused Boomer to die and Bubbles just looked traumatized. The argument lasted for a few minutes till it finally cuts to another scene. Though I did see something around the corner during the argument.

&amp;#x200B;

The last scene shows Brick on the building looking over the city. Blossom soon joins him and asks how he's doing. Brick really regrets what happened because he was angry about fighting the girls that his anger harmed someone, especially someone important. Both share their condolences and have a meaningful conversation as Brick contemplates if he wants to be a good guy maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

The screen then plays the normal ending scene but cuts abruptly afterwards with a black screen. Two distorted Photo realistic eyes appeared in the darkness as a spotlight appeared over it. It looked like Boomer, or at least his ghost. He looked at us for a few seconds until it cut to nothing but a message saying, ""Your words have your own consequences.""

&amp;#x200B;

And after that, the episode ends. We were both shocked by what we just saw. After watching it, we immediately put it on Facebook so that anyone can figure out what it is. No one really viewed it and the ones who did thought it was a messed up parody of the PPG so we kept it and kind of forgot about it.

&amp;#x200B;

We didn’t get anything important until years later when Craig messaged me and my friend. He was confused over how we got hold of this episode and was worried about what we saw. We asked him what happened on that day and he explained that he had this idea of that episode and put two new animators to work on it and the result was not what he intended. He immediately fired the new employees and got nightmares for a month because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

He also urged us not to share this to the internet but we already did that years ago for answers. However, as far as I know, I haven’t seen any mention of that episode on the internet and it should stay that way.

&amp;#x200B;

At least I learned one thing from the experience, everyone has a breaking point, some are weak and some will hold but will crack under pressure. It’s also important to be respectful around people you don’t know what they are going through.

&amp;#x200B;

After all, most people who reached their breaking point break stuff, shout angrily, and just have a breakdown, but some are silent and just go to a place that calms them as they let it out. Unfortunately in this case, this one was abused and wanted to leave this place by committing suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it’s true of what they say. What you say does have consequences so be mindful of what you say because you don’t know what they are going through."

However, I also got into Stanford, and Stanford has been my dream school for pretty much forever. The campus is INSANE, and when I visited I felt like I clicked so well with the students there. I can still afford to go there due to generous financial aid, but the plane tickets, expenses in California, etc would make it expensive.

I want to be a math teacher, and will probably teach in Connecticut because there is higher pay and more benefits, and from a financial standpoint it makes sense to go to UConn. The NEAG school is very highly regarded, and I like how they have a lot of opportunities for student teaching and internships.

Going to Stanford would be amazing, and if I decided in college that I didn't want to be a teacher having a Stanford degree and alumni connections could possibly open me up to career paths that I may not get from UConn.

I still have a few months to decide, but I am very torn about which school to go to so please give me your advice!!!"
10rtfxh,0,2023-02-02,"Looking to re-enter industry, a bit lost on what step to take next.",General-Ad9304,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/10rtfxh/looking_to_reenter_industry_a_bit_lost_on_what/,"Hi, over the last few months I’ve been looking to transition to the IT industry. I have a few years experience from the mid 2010s working as a web dev, although in practice it was more of a general webmaster more focused on troubleshooting and providing solutions for a small business’ web presence that was already in place. I left that position as I grew weary of the sort of work and had other plans, then life happened and I’m now married with a child and a gap in employment due to some life circumstances that obviously doesn’t help, but more importantly seeking an IT career once more. 

My issue is I’m a bit lost on how to proceed from here. I’ve been applying to helpdesk positions as I know they’re effectively necessary for someone like me with a non-relevant degree, but no luck so far, I often see positions expecting 3 years experience at entry level. I underwent some training through IBM to develop skills using their z/OS mainframe that is also meant to help provide a path to a career working with those systems, though the agency hasn’t found a place for me yet and online listings all seek senior positions. 

I’m confident that at the least I can work in a helpdesk or support/technician role, and I understand lacking a degree that certs help, however the A+ cert will cost somewhere between $375-500 for me. I want to be sure before committing to doing that before finding a job offer, will it provide me appreciable help in securing a job on its own? I’ve not had luck even with apprenticeships or internships. 

My other concern is a CS/IT degree. Demand for a CS degree even in entry level positions is quite high, particularly in Europe. Would I be best served getting such a degree despite the timeframe and cost (in potential income, not study costs)? Or focus on certs and my profile? I’m open to most fields, though I was leaning towards SysAdmin if not mainframe, as admittedly my major reasons for working in IT are salary and remote opportunities. 

As I say I’m pretty lost on what to do outside of continue applying. Back to uni? Acquire certs? Self-teach? Will I be disadvantaged down the line without a degree even if I get some years in helpdesk or similar? Would really appreciate some insight. Thanks."

Thought of giving some information about what a cybersecurity internship can mean . It’s usually not clear from the job title/description.  Depending on the company, here are some of the areas a cybersecurity intern may work in:

1. Software development:   Cybersecurity does lots of software development (Identify and access management,  vulnerability management, shift left  etc) .  

2.  Penetration testing. This usually doesn’t involve coding.   

3.  Cyber engineering:  you get to work with cyber tools. May involve some scripting 

4.  Security Architecture:   No coding involved. You may deal with security architecture for applications, cloud , and do security assessments 

5.  Cloud Security.   You will work with one or more cloud vendors on securing cloud assets 

6.  Identify and Access management.  This is a large area and you can do many things. You may develop software or scripts 

7. Vulnerability management, cyber defense, SIEM 

8. Data science and engineering.  Cyber tends to deal with very large amount of log data and they may have  big data platforms (Hadoop, Kafka etc)

9.  Public key infrastructure 

Of course this not the complete list of job areas . Hopefully it gives you an idea. 

I am not sure how the pay for cyber intern compares to SWE or data engineering interns .   Friend of mine (CISO at a tech company) said he pays $60/hour for his interns. That’s a very good pay IMO.

Talk to the interviewer what you will be doing as a cyber security intern to determine if it’s interesting to you."

I have a masters in economics and want to get an econ PhD so I can become an economics professor. I am planning on applying to programs this fall, and am retaking the GRE, TAing for an old prof, and taking math classes to prepare. I really only need a position until (assuming I get in somewhere), fall of 2024. 

That being said, I am currently unemployed. In into economic and political economy research, but more on the qualitative side. I did fine at my internships, which was all of my work experience up to grad school, but after I graduated from grad school and had to get a real job, I went from one job that didn't fit me to another. They were all very quant heavy and involved a lot of data work and coding, and I went into them with the wrong expectations. The first job was at an international organization where I was a research analyst, but spent my time doing mundane, procedural work, that I wasn't good at, and despite my best efforts, couldn't do well enough at. They didn't fire me, but the contract ended and the didn't renew it. I thought that I was going to do policy work and have more opportunities to use my qualitative analytical skills. 

I got another job a month after I left, and the second job was at a think tank where I thought that I would be doing policy work, but instead was a spreadsheet monkey, again doing data work, which is something that I can do, but I eventually lost interest, made mistakes, and was fired after six months. It took me 5 months to get a job after that at a government statistical agency, where I knew going into it that I wouldn't like it, but took because I thought that everything would be fine once I had mastered the workflow process, given that it was also just a big stack of instructions. However, I lost interest again, and, honestly, screwed up by not paying attention to detail, but not showing interest in my work in other ways as well. I was fired after 6 months from that position. 

Since then it has been 9 months. I have been looking for a job and have received 15 interviews from 100 applications, some of them leading to second interviews and reference requests, but never an offer. I have started doing freelance consulting in October of last year, and have the TA position that I started this semester that am getting a bit of money from. I also volunteer with the homeless community and have taken it upon myself to pull economic and public health data related to homelessness to try and figure out trends and come up with policy solutions. I have published a few blog posts on my organizations website about it, to glowing reviews. 

Just to clarify, my resume looks like the following in reverse chronological order:  


Work Experience:

Grad TA (1/23 - Present)

Economic Consultant (10/22 - Present)

Gov Stats Office (9/21 - 4/22)

Think Tank (10/20 - 4/21)

International Organization (9/19 - 9/20)

Post-Grad Internship (6/19 - 8/19)

Various Internships (2014 - 2019) (all listed out on my resume, but shortened in this post)

Education: 

Grad School (7/18 - 6/19) - Ivy League Economics Masters

Undergrad (2013 - 17) - Econ and IR from Top 40 liberal arts college 

&amp;#x200B;

***I know that I screwed up***, and that I have to redeem myself before anyone will hire me, but I feel that I have been doing everything that I can, and I am not getting any offers. I've learned from my mistakes in terms of learning the importance of putting in my best effort, knowing that before I can do what I want, I have to do the grunt work, and choosing a job that is right for me, where I can use my qualitative skills. When I do get interviews, I practice extensively, and always put my best foot forward in terms of demeanor and research into the organization. However, I haven't gotten an offer. Is there anything more that can I do besides to keep applying? Am I just fucked?  

Thanks for your feedback."

- No CS/engineering degree (I got a BA in math)
- I signed up for some CS classes but dropped out of most of them
- Not a top CS school anyway
- No internships, just one mediocre summer research project
- No referrals. As a math major I didn’t have access to CS career events and I didn’t know anybody in the industry

After I graduated, I took a job doing mostly web dev. A year later, I got the job at Google in a totally different area with a completely new tech stack. I didn’t ace the tech interviews, as I had only spent a few hours practicing leetcode.

I’m not saying that these things aren’t important (they are, and they really help your chances at getting the job you want!) but I’ve noticed a lot of people on reddit and at my alma mater who feel enormous pressure to hit these milestones “on schedule,” as though their career depends on it. If you don’t get the perfect internship, it is at most a mild setback.

Work hard and keep your goals in sight, but don’t be discouraged if something doesn’t work out exactly the way you had hoped."

I'm in a bit of a pickle, I'm into my first semester in the DEA Msc. at TUM, and I'm honestly miserable and quite tired of studying. I have a CS Bsc from a good uni and 2 SWE internships under my belt, and potentially an AWS internship in the coming months. I'm originally from Sweden, so I would prefer to move back there sometime, preferably sooner rather than later.
 I'm mainly interested in Data Engineering/Data Science/ML Engineering jobs, and I have some relevant experience (both professional and educational) in all three noted areas.   

So my questions would be:

* Would I be able to land a decent job with just a Bsc?
* Do I stand to gain anything by sticking it out and finishing my Msc instead of jumping ship and actively looking for work?
* Would doing projects using relevant frameworks and languages help my case?
* Does it, in your opinion, make sense to start looking for work in this economy?

I would tremendously appreciate any and all advice."

For a bit of background I'm graduating in May from Texas A&amp;M University as an EE. I have a very good GPA. I don't have any personal projects but I have some experience/projects through an internship at Texas Instruments as well as through classes and a school organization. 

I'll also preface this post by saying I have a full time position at Texas Instruments which I've accepted and am extremely grateful for. The issue lies in my failures elsewhere which gives me some concern for my long-term career prospects. I've interviewed at SpaceX which is a dream company for me for PCB design work (similar to what I've done at TI) and they where wholly unimpressed, although part of me feels that's just because I botched the interview. I've tried some FPGA/digital roles which I'm very interested in, more so than PCB design, but have had no luck. 

I'm a little concerned that I won't be able to transition elsewhere after I start at TI and I'll be stuck. I feel like I can perform well at most any entry level EE job, but that my resume isn't technically impressive enough for a lot of what these companies are looking for, which, compounded with me being a nervous interviewer, makes me worry I'm never going to land a job in the company/field that I want. Does anybody have any advice in this regard?"

Hello!

So I’m a MSc Organisational Psychology student about to start my dissertation. Normally, in my school, this is a solo project, meaning you organise all the research - and the nature of my school means that the ethics approval only covers typical work related studies e.g., surveys and interviews.

I am interested in human factors psychology, an albeit smaller branch of organisational psychology, and by pure luck I managed to land an internship at an aerospace organisation, doing some human factors research on cockpit performance(!). Anyway, the study is an experimental design, and unfortunately is not covered by my schools ethics approval, meaning that I have to seek approval through the central ethics board at the university. On top of this, the research I will be conducting is outside of my home country, so not only am I gaining approval from my university, but also from the organisation itself.

In order to meet the timeline of my internship, I am now bound by a very tight deadline, and have to get many affairs in order (proposal, ethical consideration etc) as well as liaising between both my university and the organisation, and I am well and truly in over my head. I have never done this before, and the limited research experience I already have did not include ethics applications. My suggested deadline is 8th March.

So, what I need advice on is organisation. How can I organise myself in such a way that I can be both flexible if something goes wrong, but also able to meet my deadline. For me, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and if successful, will open up many doors for myself in the future, but I feel as though I’ve been thrown in the deep end. Please can anyone suggest ways of organisation that maximise productivity and working to a tight deadline?"

A little about my background, I have 3+ years in a support role for a bank and it is becoming monotonous, hence I am looking for a switch to dev. 

My undergrad degree had little to no exposure to programming. So, I'm finding it a little difficult to understand. But going through the stuff in codecademy along with a few short explanations from YouTube, I'm able to understand little by little. 

My plan as of now is to use codecademy to complete the basics of coding. I have started with python from codecademy since it was shown to be quite easy to code with

My goal is for Full stack development by the end of the year. 

I would appreciate your suggestions about 

1. The programming language, python, is it a good start for full stack dev. 

2. How can i improve my problem solving skills, because my understanding is you need math and problem solving to do well in programming? 

I just don't want to code, I want to be good at it. 

3. Being a Non CS grad, how can i improve my CS knowledge by atleast until the end of the year? 

4. Critical thinking, how important is it? And how will it help? 

5. Studying for GATE and to try for masters using gate, will it (Masters) help me land a good SDE role? 

6. Cloud (Gcloud, AWS, Azure) tech, is it worth learning while trying to get into the industry, or for later? 

7. What kind of internships can i get started with? 

Apologies for such many questions and Thanks in advance, I'm just lost, hence looking for suggestions. 

PS: If anybody could mentor me on hows and whats of the industry, a dm would help.

I have been very lucky to have been able to get an offer from NVIDIA for this Fall, but I'm not too sure if I should accept or not. The situation is that I am currently enrolled in a 1 year Master's Program at like a T25 school. Typically I would just take a semester off, but if I did that, I would have to graduate in the Winter, and I don't want to stay at school for an extra semester. So I've decided that if I take the internship, I would just drop out of the Masters's program. But after talking with the recruiter and discussing my options with her, she said that it was a requirement to go back to college after the internship concludes. I really want to take the internship because I think it would be an amazing experience and I got placed on a very interesting team, but I'm not sure if it is worth pushing my full-time back a semester. Additionally, this summer I will be working somewhere that I will likely take a return from this company over NVIDIA. But I feel during this job season it might be beneficial to have as many full-time offers from internships as possible. 

I believe that my options would be:

1. Take the offer, push the Master's back a semester, and graduate in the winter of 2025. 

2. Take the offer, find out if it's really required to be enrolled in college afterward, and enroll in 1 credit at some college during spring 2024. 

3. Don't take the offer, complete Master's degree and graduate spring 2024, then go full time. 

4. Don't take offer or Masters, just go full time after internship if the company lets me.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I have to decide between a Fall internship at NVIDIA and a Master's Degree."

I am scheduled to graduate in June of 2024.

I still don’t know if I would enjoy going to work if these opportunities were to present themselves. On the other hand, I have been looking at potential internships for this summer that are in-line with my degree. The problem is that they are all temporary and around 60-90 days. I can’t be left without a job at the end of the internship. The pay is the same if not worse than what I make now also.

Should I take an internship, risk losing my position in my current job, and hope that I’m hired on to potentially kickstart a career? Or stay where I have a secure job currently, suck it up and hope for a promotion?"

I graduate in May with a M.I.S degree. I will also be finishing a one year IT internship.

I have been struggling with what I want to do. Have had some family things going on so I am late to job hunting. 

I think software development is a great career but I am not prepared enough to get a role since M.I.S doesn’t concentrate just on development and I haven’t done so myself. 

I thought about database administration but it seems to me as a smaller job market and from speaking to coworkers it seems to be a very high stress position.

This has brought me to a possible career in cyber security. I know this career can also be very stressful. I think it has greater potential financially, a large job market, and a variety of roles. I just started to study for sec+ as I noticed many companys require or prefer that for entry cybersec.

Do you have any advice for me? Is the cybersecurity path realistic? I’m open to any comment at all, just stressed about getting a job after graduating."

I’m writing this post for my sister, who has been having panic attacks on the daily because of the threat of losing her job likely in the near term and not being able to find her way forward. 

For background, she is relatively fresh out of college, academically smart when she has structure, and she ended up graduating from a top state university magna cum laude. On the down side, she has never had any real career guidance or mentors, and ended up going with a BA in general business. She has had one internship but it was for a insurance agency as sales intern, which provided little to no experience. 

Her current role is in technical recruiting in Tampa where she has greatly seen the reduction in work load and has had coworkers let go. She’s not sure how much longer they will keep her, maybe weeks, maybe months, but has a feeling her time is running out. Tampa has seen one of the highest cost of living increases, and her current job is barely paying the bills, so when talking to her, that is a main driver of what she wants to do next (I.e make more money lol) Like I said she is a great learner, and is willing to put in the time to study and learn new things, so we have explored business analytics or data analytics as a next career path. But with that new career path she would heavily need to up skill, and with her potentially being cut from her current role, the pressure is on to line something up in the near term. I have pointed her to taking a Google data analytics course to even see if that’s something she would be interested in, and that has been going well so far. Albeit, she’s not going to land a role with one certification. 

So that brings me to this Reddit community… I’m looking for advice that I can pass on to her to a) bring her some clarity in the near term to reduce her anxiety, such as a role that could help her get into data analytics and b) start putting together a longer term plan to help her in her career.

10smz8f,0,2023-02-03,Profile evaluation and some questions about the role of family business in my mba journey.,Career_Throwaway92,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/10smz8f/profile_evaluation_and_some_questions_about_the/,"This is going to be part profile review and part asking advice on what is the best way (if any) to leverage my family business situation to get a good post-MBA career and also how can my MBA help me seek a better outcome for the family estate if possible.

I'm thinking of applying later this year. I'm a South East Asian National, late 20s M of Chinese heritage. I have a MEng from Imperial College London, second class honours upper division. Haven't taken the GMAT yet but I'm targeting a 720+. My gut tells me I for sure can at least get a 680 on first try. I wouldn't mind taking it a few times to reach my target and beyond. Not sure if the ACT is a good proxy for this sort of thing but I did take the ACT nearly a decade ago and got a 34. 

Now, onto my career - which is quite a mixed bag. I had a 3-months internship with a spinoff company from Imperial developing a filtration media for removing a niche class of persistent pollutants. A mix of desk research and some lab work, not much by way of transferable skills to business and engineering. I then become an engineer for 2 years in an EPCC arm of a listed conglomerate in my home country (think 3-4 B market cap), working in proposal development and basic engineering . Got disillusioned, quit to pursue my dream of becoming an indie game developer, and am presently 1+ years mired in the development hell of my own making and hoping to finish (or the very least, announce) my first ever commercial indie game before this coming application cycle. 

Not exactly your typical career path, right? Looking back, I haven't been planning my career all too well. Being from Imperial, I had the chance to take on typical post-MBA careers right after undergrad if I had played my cards right, but back then I was naively leery of the finance/corporate world. I thought I would be more fulfilled working in industry, but that turned out to be not the case. The lack of a clear career progression and backwards Southeast Asian work culture proved to be death of me. I also  harbored pretensions of doing something creative, hence teaching myself to become an indie game developer. My parents however, have a problem with that and I must confess I do feel a bit lonely, being a sole developer. It is for those reasons I'm looking to wrap up my current game by the end of this year and make a pivot. Long term, I'm looking to dial back on this and only pursue gamedev as a part time endeavour. Considering all above, which schools do you guys think I should target?

Now, onto the situation regarding the family business. My dad founded a real estate development company and carved out his own niche developing commercial and residential properties in rural and semirural towns of our home country. Starting from a relatively humble paid up capital of 132k USD equivalent in the early 2000s and some land, he had rapidly grown his business to a size of NTA 10 mil ( \~6 mil under his own name, the rest held by the extended family) in the present day. I know this pales in comparison to some of the numbers thrown around by some family business applicants in this subreddit, but I think it is still an achievement that he can be proud of.

He's in his late 60s now, still in good health, healthy enough to occasionally make the multi hour commute the business requires. The day to day management of this company is jointly handled by him and my elder brother. They have been at it together for close to a decade now. My brother is also an entrepreneur himself, having founded a coworking space business and a (I think) lifestyle e-commerce business. The extent of his success however, is not that well known to me.

Why did I bring all this up? Because in recent years dad has repeatedly hinted at me that I could have  a position and inherit some of his businesses directly if I really want, after learning the ropes of course, and I'm at a lost of words on what to tell him. I hate the long commutes, and I don't care for the challenging business environment either. My father spent his life dealing with, shall we say, interesting characters. There's also lots of norms that I'd have trouble getting used to - business is conducted in at least three languages in this part of the world, and up to four dialects on top of those languages if you're unlucky. In other words, I rather seek better employment in the states if I can.

My dad also happen to be a strongly supportive of me pursuing a MBA to the extent that he would be financing it if I don't get any scholarships. For this reason I felt that I owe it to him to find a way to add value to the family business and estate without necessarily taking a leadership role. I've got some ideas and I am asking y'all to rip them apart:

1) Idea 1: Raise capital for future projects. The exact manner can only be determined after more due diligence but I have been told that my dad had raised a debt to the tune of \~ 1.5 mil USD for operations in the past so I think there will eventually be demand for new capital some time in the future. 

2) Idea 2: Persuade our family (Mostly my dad and bro) to sell/swap a significant minority stake of the businesses for a diversified portfolio of US financial assets to reduce the exposure to the local real estate market. I also see an opportunity in becoming an RIA post-MBA and manage it on behalf of the family but am not too sure if me being an international makes this less realistic.

These two ideas will most likely have to be executed with the help of a PE firm. With that in mind, does anyone think I have a realistic chance to leverage a post-MBA position out of this by providing this opportunity as a lead for the firm? I know the deal size is small and PE is typically a no-go for internationals, but I read somewhere that more than 40% of deals at a PE firm are  &lt;25 M in size. So... what do you guys think?

That punt aside, I'd still want to target traditional roles that can sponsor internationals. I honestly have a hard time making up my mind which to target among Consulting/Tech/IB, my generalist work experience really doesn't help me to decide. I think I can make a good case to spin my experience towards any one of them. Advice?

Finally, my father explicitly told me to find someone to fall in love with while studying my MBA. 🤣 Does anybody have suggestions which school has the best dating pool within and without the campus?

Thank you all for your attention!"

I am 24 yo currently earning around $75K/year living in one of the Atlantic provinces. Recently, my cousin, her husband, and 2 young daughters moved to Vancouver, Canada to settle down and start a new graphic design company there.

I knew about the high housing costs in Vancouver, but since her husband and herself had 2 successful businesses back in our country of origin, i figured that both of them would be fine. They used to always post photos of themselves traveling and dining at expensive restaurants and hotels, etc.. I also worked as an intern for them 7 years ago, and they seemed to be doing good at that time as well.

Fast forward to now, my cousin recently reached out to me asking for a $10 000 loan because she has ""cashflow problems."" I know that her husband studied in Los Angeles and is very smart. She has a really good business flair as well and winning multiple international awards. 

I have the money to loan to her, but she has a tendency to only know people when she needs them. I know she has already registered her business here, and her husband is already working a part-time job while setting up the business.

I talked about this with my parents, and they also asked me to help her but without compromising my well-being. How should I proceed to give her the money in this case? Should i give it to her gradually? Ask her to put her business as guarantee?  Maybe treat this as an investment and ask to be a co owner of her company?

 What would you guys do in my place knowing that their business has a high chance of succeeding?

Edit 1: Thanks for all your replies. I'll help them but I'll reduce the amount to $2000. 

Fun fact: They used to pay me $300/month when i worked for them 7 years ago after high-school.

Edit 2: There's so much good advice in this thread that I might just make a future post about ""What should you do if a family member asks you for a loan?"". Thanks again everyone!"

I was wondering about whether you felt this way and if so, how did you deal with it? I've recently gone through a burnout phase where I couldn't even bear to hear about anything programming related and I've recently started to feel like I'm recovering. Today, I went through the GitHub repos of some of the possible new interns at work and felt immensely incompetent. It's been a year since I've started learning to code and got lucky around the sixth month mark and got an internship, and for the past 4 months working as a junior frontend developer. However, the repos I saw felt like I was WAY beneath/behind where I should be in terms of technical capability.

I am open to any recommendations as I really want to return to my rather ambitious and curious self, as I really can't stand feeling like I'm crap in terms of development skills.

TL;DR: Saw some github repos of the new interns, felt immensely inferior, looking for anything to get out of the burnout and rut.

Thank you very much, and have a nice day!"

Asking for further information just gets the typical feedback of ""lack of technical knowledge"", but nothing specific. How can we get these companies to give specific feedback? Can someone give tips on how to ask for this without sounding rude?

I'm currently in my last year of high school (sixth form), based in the UK. At the moment, I'm considering career paths and I'm planning on securing internships during my years at uni.

 I've been considering HFT as my interests mostly lie in competitive programming/algorithmic problem-solving, and I'm most familiar with C++. Any advice/guidance for breaking into this field? Like what are some noteworthy project ideas that I could work on and eventually include in my cv? 

Thanks."

10spsoq,1,2023-02-03,Seeking Career Advancement Advice (out of Entry role) + Resume Advice,ProficientPineapple,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/10spsoq/seeking_career_advancement_advice_out_of_entry/,"Hey folks! Would appreciate any feedback I can get, I feel like I know what I need to do but I may need a little push.

To preface, I am a recent college graduate (Class of 2021) with a degree in Cybersecurity. During my junior year, I was able to secure an internship that gave me really valuable skills and I am very thankful for my manager and team for mentoring me. I was never intended to be hired as a full time employee, but I was able to have been brought on. I love my position (IT Systems Associate) and working for a smaller company, I'm able to experience and touch on a lot of cool technologies. The benefits and flexibility are great, coworkers and awesome, and I'm overall happy besides for one thing: pay. I get paid $21.06 living in Virginia Beach, which was not an issue when I lived under my parents but now that I want to plan for the future and be able to support my girlfriend while she finishes up nursing school, it is a problem now. As anyone who works in IT, especially an entry level position, my issue is valuing myself and facing imposter syndrome. I've been interviewing with a few places and I seem to do pretty well and even surprise a few interviewers with my knowledge, but I am afraid of stepping into a new role, not doing well, and being let go. I have gotten offers from $25-30 in positions that I feel like would not help my career progression (helpdesk type roles, IT associate roles with less responsibilities than I have now).

One thing about my job now, I have reviews coming up and I have spoken to my manager about my expectations, and I would like to have a straight-up conversation and ask if my expectations are realistic ($30 an hour / $62,400 a year). Due to not being planned to being brought on full time, my full time position was able to be leveraged by taking the IT Intern budget, Because of the drastic percentage difference, I am preparing for the worst. I do have a very strong belief that it is not really a limitation by my manager (as he values his team and myself really well) but upper management.

I would like a security clearance as a lot of jobs locally require one. I may be able to get hired for a Help Desk position that will sponsor my clearance. They only pay $21 an hour but I think the doors that it may open up outweighs the pay. Although, I've been searching for a higher role that can sponsor me (been difficult).

I would appreciate insights regarding:

&amp;#x200B;

Are my expectations too high?

With the experience I've been getting, is it worth the lower pay?

What am I valued at?

What positions should I look for, for career advancement?

How is my resume? (I would really like feedback in this)

Are my aspirations and plan good?

&amp;#x200B;

Important information:

Have been at the same place since 2019, I did a majority of my responsibilities of my position now (IT Systems Associate) as an IT Intern.

No security clearance (would have no issues being approved)

No set job outlook (Ideally, I'd like a System Administrator position or SOC Analyst role)

Sec+ and Azure Fundamentals certified

Studying for CySa+

Willing to work in Va Beach, Chesapeake, and Norfolk (not open to relocation at the time)

It sucks. I feel like my life hasn’t even started because I’ve been living with my parents for so long. It’s a long story full of plenty of fuck ups but I least I’ll have a CS degree soon I guess I’ll be almost 27 by then? I’m trying to get my first Internship over the summer but I think I might have started applying too late. I just feel so self conscious around my family and I feel like I can't do the things I want to do around them and it has kind of led to me staying home a lot.

My home situation just isn’t great right now. I’ve never gotten along with my stepdad; part of that is because of me, but he’s not a good guy. Yeah, he does the conventional father figure things, takes care of his family, protects us, and provides for us, but it’s a different story when it comes to his other character traits. He’s never wrong. Disagreeing with him is the same as disrespecting him. He has horrible, hateful views. He’s a hypocrite, has a huge ego, lies, gaslights, etc.

So we’ve always clashed heads and it all came to a point again New Years Eve when he wanted me to ride home with my sister late at night to protect her from drunk drivers. I told him I wasn’t comfortable going home that late either and he got mad. Now in a normal healthy relationship, you could try and talk to them more and explain your view, but to him, that would be disrespectful and arguing so I just STFU, especially since we were around other family members. Until later he looked at me in front of everyone, and he told me I was going to do it, and I told him no. He got really fucking mad, and I ended up calling him an asshole. Shouldn’t have done that, but I didn’t care at the time because he had been really fucking rude the past couple of weeks.

Whenever my dad and I fight it always leads to my parents fighting because my mom almost always sides with me and backs me up.

Later that night, I was in my room and I came out and my sister told me mom was stumbling and almost fell down. I panicked at this point because my mom has tried to kill herself before. I’m constantly worried she’s going to do it again because she’ll get really down and so erratic things like going on a walk late at night and not answering any texts or calls. Anyways, she was passed out in bed and my dad was downstairs in the garage messing around with a box. I got pissed that he wasn’t taking care of her and checking on her, and it just made everything worse.

I won’t get into the fight too much since this post is already so long. I guess I’m just venting.

I ended up panic calling family members because I don’t trust my dad to take care of my mom even though he used to be a nurse because when my mom tried to commit suicide he didn’t call 911 and I had to walk into her basically unconscious in my dads arms. He has a massive ego and thinks he’s Superman. I can’t trust him not to overestimate his abilities. So I just call 911. I didn’t this time though

It turns out my mom took a couple of benzos and drank a bit. I over panicked and called family members completely hysterical. I even thought my dad went outside with his gun because I thought I heard him rack it and then turn off the alarm at 1 am and go outside while my mom was passed out in the bed. I was just in such a panic, and it’s embarrassing.

Anyways I can’t do this shit anymore. It’s been a little better the past month, but everyone’s so fucking angry and toxic all the time. My mom is constantly stressed and complaining, and my dad doesn’t help. His tone is shit, and he treats her like garbage. I just don’t want to be around it anymore. I want to start my life.

On top of all this, just the other night, my Dad left the house with nothing but his gun after sending my mom texts about how he's going insane and can't take it anymore. We had to call the cops and have them find him. I just can't live in this environment anymore. I have my own mental health problems that I feel like I can't even address.

Also, I just worry that I won’t be able to bring home a wife or a girlfriend because of my family's views and how judgmental they are. I’m going to bring someone home with similar ideals to me, and they are just the complete opposite of me. It’s mainly my dad, but he influences my sister and mom a lot, and my brother, who’s away at college, has the same views as my dad. Like they stalk my cousin's Instagram page and basically call her fat and a whore for the pictures she posts. They’re not even that bad, and she looks like someone I might end up dating. I don't know. It sucks, I love my family, but I can't keep doing this.

I don't even know how I would go about moving out. I need to get a car, and I don't have a job. I have 20k saved up (took out extra student loans), but I want to get a nice car with modern safety features to help with my anxiety around driving. I don't mind financing a car, but it's impossible to do without income despite my 750 credit score. I have severe anxiety, and as much as I want to leave the house, do more with friends, and get a job, I easily have panic attacks.

I’m so sorry for the long post and if you look at my post history I'm sorry. Just know that I have improved over the past couple of years, but I'm still not where I want to be."

I've  been going to community college for the past 3 years (by the time I  transfer) and after a few degree changes, I'm finally set on computer  science. The schools I am looking to transfer to are University of  Illinois Chicago (USNews#97) or Illinois State University (#219).

UIC Pros:

* Better CS program, well funded
* Big city experience

UIC Cons:

* Graduate in 5 semesters
* Commuter school, little community
* Huge class sizes
* Less safe
* A few thousand more dollars per year.

ISU Pros:

* Graduate in 3.6 semesters
* Small city with college town feel, lots of community
* Already have friends who go there
* Still high employment outcomes for CS students
* Smaller classes
* Safer environment

ISU Cons:

* Lower-rated program
* Small city (bloomington-normal) likely a bit more boring

I  have about 1.5 years of internship experience doing software product  management for two large S&amp;P500 / Fortune100 non-MAANGA companies  where I've worked on big projects worth millions.

Will  going to the Illinois State University notably negatively affect my  career / future internship opportunities compared  to UIC, even with  requiring me to take an extra semester and a half? I'm not too humble to  admit I'd like to work somewhere making good money after school, either  in development or product management."

One of my new year goals is to grab an internship in embedded electronics or the VLSI domain in the next 6 months.

I am applying to new grad roles, my current experience section is, have an internship from summer 2020, worked a customer service job summer 2021, and an internship from summer 2022.

My question is does the customer service role detract from the two internships since it is sandwiched between? Should I just remove it and have a summer gap in my experience,  and add another project to fill the space on my resume?

I completely understand the difficulty of getting an engineering internship so early on into university, but I'm trying to get any internship possible for this summer. Any pointers on changes that I should make would be incredibly helpful.

10swu4m,0,2023-02-03,Need a bit of career advice.,poopstar786,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/10swu4m/need_a_bit_of_career_advice/,"Hi everyone, hope y‘all are doing well.

I came to germany with a bachelors degree with 0 work experience (no internships either). I started my Masters in Mech and management at a good technical university. 

It has been 2 years since I started my masters degree and I have worked as a working student for 6 months at a renowned research institution. I have another working student job lined up which will probably be for 1 year and I will be completing my thesis as well during this period.

So effectively I would have gained 1.5 years of working student job experience during my entire studies. 

When I look at my friends, most of them came from 3-4 years of full time work experience from their home countries and also worked 1-2 years of working student.

I have tried to apply to several internship positions here in germany, but most of them rejected me wither for lack of experience or because internship is not mandatory for my course (freiwilligpraktikum).

I wanted to know what are the things that recruiters look for while hiring fresh graduates after completing their masters. 
(Somehow deeply I feel that due to less amount of work experience that I have, I might probably have lesser competitive edge compared to other candidates. Is there somethings that I can start doing from now to improve my chances for employability?)"

2021 May:

* Graduated from t400 university , no internships
* Pretty shit in most concepts of cs except for web dev
* Didn’t know you’re supposed to apply for new grad roles 6-9 months prior, found 1 junior and one new grad amazon position

2021 June: -Got amazon OA , didn’t except to get anything, got excited realizing I have an opportunity to get everything I wanted

* Did leetcode for \~10ish hours a day, was pretty trash, couldn’t do 2sum without 2 loops
* Looked up OAs from discussion sections before the interview
* got 7/15 on both, passed (lucky I guess?), was very nervous, barely could read the question

2021 July:

* Continued doing leetcode daily for 10ish hours
* had a terrible phone interview, the guy was from my country so he helped a lot (lucky 2)
* Landed a web dev job at a local company
* Got into masters T350

2021 August:

* Got good at leetcode easy questions, like 3/10 on mediums
* 4 onsites interviews, did decent, rejected with semi-okay feedback and 6 month cool down

2021 September:

* Got another OA from new grad role, neglected it because it had no javascript, saved until last day and tried to relearn leetcode with python
* Realized new grad interviews are much easier then junior interviews even though they are the same role?
* Headcount reached (Didn't know this was a thing) 

2021 November: -Bloomberg invite

* A job and masters, so did leetcode whenever i had spare time \~4 hours a day
* Realized i forgot a lot and struggle mediums and some easies again
* Passed phone and onsite round 1

2022 January:

* Read 4-5 books, watched a ton of videos and read medium articles about system design and ODD
* Passed system design round

2022 February:

* HR round reject : did not communicate/collab with interviews well and some other feedback

**Gave up on interviews until June**

2022 June:

* Contacted by amazon recruiter
* Started leetcode grind again, found this sub, planning to mass apply
* Passed 2 interviews, recruiter told me that we should continue closer to my graduation date

2022 August:

* Contacted by google (dream company)
* Was doing leetcode once a while, stopped caring about school and work, and focused just on leetcode for google

2022:September:

* Passed 2 rounds, then stopped due to hiring freeze(unlucky)
* Contacted amazon HR, also hiring freeze
* everywhere, hiring freeze
* Mass applied to wherever I could in big tech

At this point :

* I had like 9ish month of leetcode practice, and i was feeling way better about it
* Could solve all easies, most mediums, still no hards.
* Showed more personality and was less shy in interviews -Solved most anxiety issues with interviews -Mass applied to all top tech

# Results:

Tiktok: Ghosted after perfect OA

Goldman Sachs: Ghosted after perfect OA

Palantir (I was desperate): Late apply, headcount reached

HRT: Didn't attend the interview after researching, I am not that smart

**Bloomberg: Offer**

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on this sub for 6 months and found comfort finding people who were going through the same problems as I was, got motivated by seeing other peoples posts and wanted to write my own one day.

Some advice I could give:

1. Grind leetcode, you don't have to be good at it, watch videos, read discussions, whatever you do, do it a lot and stay consistent
2. Do mock interviews, interviews get easier with time, panicking and anxiety is normal they go away with time. Leetcode contests helped to re-create that environment for me
3. Networking helps, reach out to people on linkedin asking for a referral, ask ChatGPT to write you one
4. Focus on leetcode basics if you have a lot of time, if the interview is close by, get leetcode premium and sort by frequency on company tagged questions
5. Apply early and pick earlier dates for interviews
6. Don't neglect behavior part of interviews, culture fit is a part of hiring someone
7. Don't be a shy nerd, show some personality, vibe with the interviewer
8. Make a good cv where you can talk about and answer questions in detail (past projects &amp; experiences)

Moral of the story is, you don't need a top 10 school, a lot of internships, or to be a genius, sure they help a lot, but I believe if you got into a CS program you are able to  do this. Good luck to everyone with their job search! &lt;3"

I am forth year student  at UGA studying Finance. I started interning with RippleMatch this spring as I was able to secure a great summer program at a fortune 100 company this past summer through the platform after applying to 100+ internships and struggling to even get responses from any employers.  I was introduced to RippleMatch by a friend who was interning last spring and it was super simple, the website tailors the job/internship options based on your interests, major, and year. It was convenient and many of my friends now also use it to find a full time job after graduation this May. 

If anyone is interested here is the link! Its truly something that all college students should know about before wasting time applying and writing cover letters just to not hear back.

If anyone finds a job or internship through it please feel free to message me! I would love to hear about it!!"

I can’t really do an internship right now as I’m in class.
10sz2nb,1,2023-02-03,"Fiancé hates my friend, don't want to destroy friend group",IrishCreamTheNerd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10sz2nb/fiancé_hates_my_friend_dont_want_to_destroy/,"Alright, so, to start with I have a friend group from work that's two guys and a girl. My fiance absolutely *loathes* the girl, this is partially my fault. 

When girl coworker (GC) started where I work, she was an intern and I helped her and all the other interns learn the lay of the land. We became friends, she and I are into a lot of the same video games and we'd talk Pokemon at work. In truth, had tried several times to get her and my fiance to be friends because they're both pretty nuts about Animal Crossing. One Christmas GC got me and several other coworkers small gifts.

I did not immediately tell my fiancé because she can be a pretty jealous person. 

Later, my fiancé found out about the gift when she accidentally opened up my facebook messages and saw me thank GC for it.

My fiancé is not very self confident and loathes GC because she likes video games, works in the same industry as me, and she believes GC to be pretty.

Now, if it was just a matter of losing one friend and just dropping all contact, this wouldn't be an issue- whatever, she can find other friends. 

The problem here really starts with my two other male coworkers/friends have effectively made us all a ""friend group"". We all go to a restaurant together sometimes, we hang out at my male coworker's new house he just bought. We all spend time together. Anything I'm invited to, she's invited to as well. 

I have been wracking my brain trying to find a way to exclude either GC or myself from any situation in which we might be in the same vicinity. I don't want to lose my two male coworker/friends because they're really good people and I like hanging out with them.

Fiance gets extremely depressed/mad when I hang out with all of them to the point where I've gotten extremely flaky any time they try to hang out. I am under **no circumstances** allowed to tell GC why I can't be friends with her, and I'm hesitant to talk this out with my two male friends because GC hasn't necessarily done anything wrong. She has had her own fiance (now husband) that goes to our hang outs with us, and she's not a mean or bad person.

I don't want my friends to have a low opinion of my fiance, I don't want to come off as being an asshole for no reason. 

Anybody have any ideas that can help me navigate this situation?"
10sztcb,2,2023-02-03,I feel like my friend is mean and I don’t know why she treats me this way,66East,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10sztcb/i_feel_like_my_friend_is_mean_and_i_dont_know_why/,"This girl is pretty much my best friend. We do everything together, I’ve spent a week at her parents house with her where my parents didn’t let me pay for anything and showed me around their city. But there are some things that really irk me about her and that I can’t stop thinking about. 

For example, I recently broke up with my boyfriend and she was so happy stating I could’ve done so better. (Mind you she always begging me and him should break up) I was explaining the situation and she said “oh he definitely cheated.” And I asked for evidence, she said oh I don’t know but innocent guys are always not innocent. Mind you, me and my boyfriend ended because his mental health. We are still on good terms and we trusted each other very much throughout our relationship. Our relationship was very healthy  and we were like each other best friend. She actually had an extremely abusive boyfriend that I hated but she would never break up with. 

Second, I’m currently interviewing for a lot of places and I always tell her. However, she scoffs at a lot of the places I mention. In a kind of “wow that isn’t really a great internship place” kind of way, which is really annoying considering she can’t even get interviews for internships. 

Third, anytime I mention a friend she asks like oh who’s your friend? Or what friend are you talking about? Idk I find it weird because I don’t ask people like who’s your friend when you mention them. It may because I don’t have too many friends. The one friend she does know she said “doesn’t seem like that great of a person” which I don’t know why she would say that considering they’ve never really talked before??

Last, we used to be a huge friend group back in the day with these two other girls. A lot of shit hit the fan and basically these two other girls started to hate me and call me all sort of names behind my back for really no reason. And it just irks me because she would lie about hanging out with them. She would tell me excuses and pretend she wasn’t with them, then go out with them. I only knew because of instagram stories. and she never told me but confirm they were talking about me after she stopped being friends with them. She still does stuff like this with other people. Says she is doing one thing and then I find out she was doing something completely different. I’m not really sure why she does it. But it makes me feel very excluded and I talked to her about it and she says oh that isn’t the case at all. 

Tldr: just read the last part and state if I should cut off this friend or not. I just don’t know if I’m overthinking. Sorry for the long post, there I just so much that happened"

**Letters of Recommendation**

counselor (5/10) - Never really had a close relationship with my counselor, I met him once or twice for my mental health checkups, and went to him a couple times a year for scheduling issues for my classes. Chill guy though, and I filled out a really long personality/interests survey so he could craft my recommendation letter.

AP English Teacher (7/10) - Did great on my AP exam, but once again didn’t really have the closest relationship with my teacher but she was also super nice. She asked for some of the best writing pieces I did that year and I think she wrote a decent letter for me. She also helped for a scholarship rec letter.

AP Calc AB teacher (7/10) - Wanted to ask another AP teacher, okay ngl I did ass on the calc ab exam, but it’s because I didn’t study the cumulative exam because I didn’t care for my AP test grade. But I maintained my class grade/test pretty well (ended with a 98) wasn’t close close with my teacher and struggled to participate but I did pretty well in the class and sometimes cracked jokes with him after class

**Interviews**

Northwestern (10/10) - I rescheduled my first interview because I got sick and I thought I was basically f-ed for the interview. But she was actually so nice, and shared a lot of common interests with me- she likes writing and did cello too. We had a great 30-40 min ish conversation, it wasn’t awkward and it felt like a conversation instead of an interview

Uchicago didn’t offer me one

**Essays**

commonapp (7/10) - It was okay I think, kinda milked the personal essay obviously and wrote about how my ___ experience changed my outlook on ___ and how a failure shaped me as a better person in the future. Could’ve had a less cliche idea but I was pretty satisfied with it at the end.

supplementals (9/10) - I researched a lot (A LOT by watching tons of YT videos online, going to their websites) of college - specific things for my “why us” essays and wrote about why I really wanted to be part of the college. Also poured my nerdiest heart out into my weird uchicago supp.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Northwestern (ED)
* Uchicago (EA) - was rly surprised by acceptance 
* Macalester (EA)

*Waitlists:*

* None

*Rejections:*

* None but I withdrew George Washington University (RD as a safety), Northeastern (EA) applications because they come out later and my counselor requested me to withdraw those after my other ED/EA acceptances 

**Additional Information:** 

I studied a decent amount in highschool because I would panic and get scared but I also procrastinated a ton, averaged about 5 hours per night because of procrastination and didn’t try my best. Yes I tried, but I didn’t go full out (I’ve failed quizzes/tests and didn’t care about it too much, and I also didn’t give it an all on my APs, failed one in fact LOL) which I kind of regret now. I can kinda flex because didn’t feel the pain of rejections BUT part of me has tiny regrets because I probably would’ve ED/REAed to like UPenn (dream school) or Columbia but I just wasn’t confident enough of my stats so yeah. But I’m all in all satisfied with my results.

* Further, I think I may have caused some anger/misunderstanding about the title of me saying “mid,” (I am so sorry regardless but please hear me out) but truly, from my highschool, and the profiles around me specifically, the competitiveness made me think my application was pretty mid. I’ve grown to be insecure of my SAT score because people around me have told me to retake it, saying 1510 is nowhere close for me to be satisfied compared to people around me (literally all of my friends) who scored a 1550+. There were so many kids around me literally doing everything, presidents of the most popular clubs, doing well on and handling 10-12 APs. If I went to my college counselor and asked about my profile, he would, quite literally call me an “average” or a “mid” applicant at my school specifically. I swear. 
But again I learned through the college process the good thing about America is it’s literally the land of opportunities. Good scores and ECs are not all, it’s more of the personality, realness, and dedication you craft through connecting your whole application together: a big portion of it being your essays. If I’m being honest, I think my essays (specifically my supps) really helped to give me a personality and stand out in the midst of everything, and that’s one part of my application I am truly proud of."
10t15zq,1,2023-02-03,Electrical Engineering vs Computer Engineering vs Computer Science at UF,USMCRunner,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/10t15zq/electrical_engineering_vs_computer_engineering_vs/,"I'm currently at Santa Fe College enrolled in the AA in Engineering program and plan to transfer into Electrical Engineering at UF in the summer or fall of 2024. If I do, I plan to minor in CS through the school of engineering at UF, since I don't want to completely eliminate the flexibility to pursue software-based jobs upon graduation. 

For the longest time I was focused in pursuing CS in college, but as the years have gone by, the major is not only becoming increasingly competitive due to its popularity, but also the relevant job market is becoming saturated and too competitive as well. Eventhough I calculate I'll have a slightly above 3.5 GPA once I apply for transfer, I don't want to ruin my chances of getting into UF simply because I decided to apply to a competitive major. Does anyone know how competitive CS (both through the engineering and CLAS departments) are?

This originally made me consider CE, but from what I've heard from other students that study/have studied CE (not at UF) is that CE has the same job outcome as CS. So, they advised to instead pursue EE, since the difficulty of the major will be slightly higher than CE, but at least I'll qualify for a range of jobs that are exclusively hardware-based.

Now, since my goal is to have the flexibility of picking from a wide range of jobs selection (hardware and software-based), I think EE with a CS minor is the smartest move. Since it comes down to what I want to do when I graduate, to put it in simple terms: I'm a veteran with secret clearance, so I want to work for a defense contractor, but the hardware-based jobs is something that I'm completely ignorant about, and would like to see if it's something I'd enjoy doing, without completely alienating the ability to switch over to software-based jobs if I choose to.

Have anyone here studied any of these majors at UF? What have your experiences been like? What have you heard from the other majors? What are internship opportunities like? What about job availability upon graduation? How heavy are the workloads? As you can see, I've thought this through quite a bit, so any type of information is welcome, thank you!"

I have an okay amount of programming knowledge - I've built a few programs that use object-oriented programming, built a sorting program for my school that sorts students based on preferences, but most of my ""projects"" are just me building apps to help myself, nothing that uses a lot of ""cool tech"". Just python with some libraries. Not communicating with anything or any of that.

I am not sure what ""kind"" of software engineering I want to do yet. I have yet to really look into mobile app development, web dev, DevOps, or anything like that. I honestly have no idea what I've been doing. Just kind of making stuff for myself?

Along with taking CS classes in University, I plan to learn these things outside of school (in no particular order):

1. Continue learning Python
2. Git and how to make unit tests and such
3. Data structures and algorithms
4. Look up frameworks and APIs (going to build some projects that hopefully make me do this)
5. Databases
6. Design Patterns
7. Linux/ssh/bash
8. Django
9. How to have applications interact with each other
10. New languages - JS, TS, Java/Kotlin, Go

I'll mostly focus on Python for right now and learn topics 1-9, but once I have at least some level of knowledge of those, I might venture out into new languages (CS courses will also make me do that)

Are there any other ""general concepts"" I missed or should add? How does the plan look when combined with a CS degree? Hoping to get an internship while in school.

Thank you"

However, I decided to still go for job interviews and recently managed to land an offer that made me feel like I'm at cross roads.



Return offer at top BB (GS/JPM/MS):

- Internal audit department, ~60k base with discretionary bonus

- Better branding



New offer at a French IB (think SocGen/CA/BNP):

- Rotation in the finance department, ~62k base with target 2 month bonus

- Slightly more annual leaves than top BB



Frankly speaking I really liked the firm's culture when I interned with them during the summer. However the new offer stood out to me due to better transparency of the total compensation, as well as it being less cut throat than the top American banks.

Would appreciate some advice on whether to stick to the return offer or take up the new offer. Also happy to hear about the consequences for reneging the return offer if I do eventually take up the new offer.

Thank you.

Update:
Likely sticking to my BB offer. Thank you all for the wonderful responses. Cheers."

99% of jobs that are hiring data scientists require a sh*t ton of years in experience as a data scientist. I acquired the common skills (including python,SQL, machine learning, tableau, excel) that are advertised as a MUST to learn to land a job (or even internship). But during my job search, i was proved otherwise. 

 I'm unsure what job roles i can apply for, with my skill set and would like to hear your suggestions (i can share my resume if required through DM). As someone shifting careers from economics to data science, i feel low-key scammed by post graduate programs because of the gap between my experience and skills, and those that are required. 

I believe that big data engineers, SQL developer, python developer, business analyst and data analyst would be potential career options for me. Particularly, data engineering is interesting but I am going to invest more time in learning other skills like azure (which is so vast with so many categories, it would take me very long to master..), mongodb, Linux, Cassandra, spark, Hadoop, etc. 

I see these skills mentioned frequently in job roles i apply for:
- power bi
- Apache spark
- Hadoop
- mongodb
- deep learning
- data pipelines
- opencv (i find this very interesting, but not sure jobs would be there for freshers)
- git
- databricks? 

What would be some skills that I can quickly grasp the basics of, and master on the job? Especially jobs that would be open to freshers?"

i have this weird thought that i must try out different things to figure out which career i must go  before settling for one ,( as career is something which is long term ,which i will be doing for next 3-4 decades ,if we choose wrong career it will be very difficult to be in the top )and i think this is the right time as we have not much responsibilities .

what do you guys think ,is this right approach ?,because

i have seen one relative who is working in IT saying 'i encourage you to go for government jobs' btw her salary is 2 lakh/month , 

my cousin works in army he says dont come this path 

or what if you figure out you are good at some other skill/profession at the age of 35 ,at that time you can't do anything right?

 like that many people say different things

i know i don't have choice, has i don't come from rich family nor i have top tier degree but my wish is atleast i must do a job which my personality matches or which i have interest  

if this approach is right ,then see what i have planned and do share your opinion,if no tell why

1)as i am in my first year i will learn 1-2 different software skill from which i can get job like web dev, web design,data science, etc..by the time i reach 3rd sem i will try to get good enough to get job and will try to get remote intership

from this i will have idea about software/tech industry 

2) after 4th sem/2nd year  i will apply for an intership at IIM ,as i also have plan to do MBA ,

from this i will have idea about jobs after IIM/MBA (which specilisation like finance,operations is good}

3) for my good, companies like goldman sachs,ey,etc come for intership/placements for analyst job and for other roles ,i may or may not get this opportunity but i will have opportunity to get intern in MNC 

from this i will have idea about different career opportunities other than software in india 

4) another intership i was very interested is NITI AYYOG ,they offer 1/3/6 month internship which sadly is unpaid(i have to fund this myself)

from this intership i will have idea about government jobs like civil service(ias/ips..) etc .

durning this period i will try to upskill the skills ,

if i have time then i will do some other interships / i also have plan to apply for research internship aboard(which i think is not possible)

if every thing goes right then fine,at the end i will have skills to apply for offcampus jobs/(remote jobs) or worst case i have to depend on college placements 

what do you all think ,also tell how to save money to fund these internships myself 

any field i missed ??

However I still like to plan for things and hear everybody’s experience.

Alright so here is some context first,

I’m **18yo** and I live in **Canada, Quebec**. Next year I’m going to university (Polytechnique) to be precise to study **software engineering**. There is this thing in quebec for certain programs like engineering called **""Bourse perspective""** which gives me 2500$ per semester I complete at Uni in my program. My tuition is gonna be 1800$ a semester so roughly 3600$ a year. Including the books it’ll prolly be around 4000$ a year. That also means I receive 5000$ a year from the ""Bourse perspective"". The software engineering program is 4 years (8 semesters) and im planning to do 3 internships during that time in summer which is very doable in my field. Each internship is usually paid around 20-30$ an hour 35h a week for 16 weeks. which means I get a minimum of 11200$ (with 20$/h) each internship x 3 comes down to 33600$. I don’t know if I’ve been clear up till now but in short I would come out of University at 23yo with roughly (33600$ + 1000$ x 4 from remaining of the Bourse perspective) **37600$** in the bank. **Also note that my parents will let me live with them till i’m 25, free of charge.**

Now here are my questions : 

I want to hear every piece of advice that you have for me so that I can retire as young as possible. 

What would you wish you had known at my age that would have changed your life drastically (in a positive way of course…)? It could be financially or anything else.

Which are the credit cards that you would advise me to get and what is the best way that I can manage my credit? And on the same subjects which are the best banks to deal with? I’m with BMO right now.

When should I buy my first property or should I even buy one considering the inflated prices?

Should I buy a car considering that Polytechnique is connected to a subway station and I live near a station myself?

How can I profit as much as possible from the system (I’ve heard about TFSA, RRSP and some other shit like that)?


Thank you to all those who will take the time to answer! Much love everyone I wish you all success.❤️"

So i am a CS student right now and will graduate on may 2024. Due to personal reasons my GPA isn't the best, somewhere around 3.0. But, last summer i had internship in a mid size company and i have been working as a student developer in the school for over a year. I have built a web app with react for the school and i am also responsible for maintaining a mobile app built using react native. On top of that i do maintain a lot of small web apps the school and employees use. It is just me my manager and one full time developer. Will this experience help me in the future? What should i do now that can help me for the future? 

Thank you."

Last semester we had data structures and algorithms class which was pretty hard, but I passed it. In a year I need to take an internship, and I already have a few contacts that promised me at least an interview at their company.

I started doing some basic leetcode, even though I didn't expect to know everything of course, since I'm just 4th semester. But oh man I am terrible at it. I keep getting frustrated even with some questions marked easy. When I had enough I looked at the solutions and could understand them with no issue.

Should I keep on trying to understand the solutions, or find DSA course online to get more knowledge and try leetcode again after that? I thought the DSA course last semester was comprehensive, but maybe not."

10tpqlt,1,2023-02-04,Hiring Advice Needed,Ailyra,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10tpqlt/hiring_advice_needed/,"My team is incredibly short staffed due to a series of unfortunate timing of events/contract timing.

I need to make several hiring decisions in the next week and I'm really perplexed as to what the best course of action may be.

I have 2 temporary positions (6 month contracts) and 1 Full-time position to fill.

Recently I had an employee who has been amazing and I've been advocating to open a FT position for them for 6 months (at the time I didn't have any open positions so I was trying to make one).  They also possess many amazing skills beyond their actual job duties and skills that would benefit us as they grow.  Unfortunately, at the end of December we had a series of very strange issues with this person as far as insubordination, lying, strange bouts of attitude (becoming cocky/belligerent/argumentative), using their position to intimidate junior staff/interns, and asking people to be implicit in hiding their violations of protocols (that they knew were protocol/SOP violations because they told these people it was a violation).  Nothing was an overt safety concern, but there was some fall out that led to us having to clean up some processes, and mostly us having to do a lot of HR work.  They were formally written up, actions were taken to reduce their responsibility such as requiring them to work only under supervision (ultimately not a sustainable practice for us as this really cripples our productivity if we have to do this for more than just a training period with our paid staff), and their action plan states they will be terminated for any future SOP violations or insubordination issues.  My higher ups and some teammates view this as a concern but largely chalk it up to a younger employee making a mistake, maybe just getting too comfortable.

In light of recent events, I am not personally certain if I can trust them to work independently and not violate future protocols. I'm not confident they learned their lesson - I just know they were caught and feel ashamed by that.   It may also be possible that they would learn from this and also be fine in the future.

This person was on a contract, and it just ended.  A week later, our hiring situation changed: we opened 2 temp positions, and one of our team is also leaving, so I am now in the position to hire for the 3 positions I listed earlier.  Previous to the issues from the last several weeks/month, I would have hired them for the FT position without question.  Now I have doubts.

No candidate that I interview will know our area/department-specific tasks.  I will at minimum need to spend 2 months getting someone up to 50% of the capability of where this person has been at, most of that time not being able to have them work unsupervised (so large training curve and staff cost).  The reality is we are down nearly 50% of our team right now (also due to some medical leave).

For the temp positions I also have 2 candidates who would be great choices - 1 with more general background in our field, 1 with more background specific to our exact job duties but less overall experience (but either I think would probably do well).  I have a 3rd candidate who is very mature and has actually been our intern, so knows our actual area/tasks.  They have the least experience of the 3 but are already here, we like them a lot, they want to be here longer term, and would require the least amount of initial training.  It's probable either of the other 2 candidates would be able to do higher-level tasks sooner, but would require more work initially to train (minimum 1-2 months of very hands on training - and its a 6 month position).

The FT position hasn't posted long enough for us to see what the candidate pool will be.  I'm just trying to figure out what to do now because I need to make a decision on all temp positions in the next 5 days.  Also I have the authority that I could bypass the formal process and emergency hire - offer the FT position to the previous employee if we desired (since they were already here until last week).   I also can't wait on the candidate pool of the FT position, and then decide who to offer the temp position, because I have to fill those temp positions first.

Of these options and candidates, what would you do?  Who would you offer the temp positions to?  What would you do with the former employee?

TL/DR: Would you re-hire a potentially valuable previous employee/candidate who has recently been in trouble for protocol/SOP violations and insubordination?  Between this person, a less advanced, known candidate, and more advanced, unknown candidates, who would you hire for 2 temp positions?"
10tqbcw,14,2023-02-04,Is it worth it to do a second degree just for access to internships?,bingbaddie1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10tqbcw/is_it_worth_it_to_do_a_second_degree_just_for/,"Hey all. I already know how to program very well--I've read books on and taught myself advanced DSA. It's pretty fun stuff; I do leetcode problems for fun, etc. 

However, I'm graduating from college with a degree in MIS (It's more of a business degree than an actually relevant degree) this semester, which I read is not good for seeking swe jobs; I didn't get any internships in college because I didn't know I wanted to do programming, and I hated business. As a result, I'm leaving college likely without a degree that's good enough to get my foot in the door for programming-related jobs (or a well-paying job), and also without much of a return offer. 

I know the advice here before was that you don't \*need\* a CS degree to get your foot in the door, but my goal is to end up with a high-paying job (preferably that's WFH, but again, not really picky). Obviously the jobs along the way aren't going to be like that, and if I just wanted \*a job\* that would be acceptable. But I'm wondering if now, more than ever, especially with the uncertainty in the market, it's worth it to just do a program like OSU postbacc, just to get a degree in CS, so I can get access to internships at those firms that provide those high-paying jobs I seek."

Sure, there are a ton of STEM olympiads i have participated in, but none of the actually good ECs like internships or other things of the sort. Would appreciate any suggestions any of you might have for ECs.

Just started learning JS and TS and the various frameworks/APIs. For some reason I find algorithms and math-heavy topics far more interesting and easier to pick up compared to the popular frameworks for Web apps. Had some personal projects related to ML.

I was finding an internship for months with little to no response. Just around 50 applications. I know that the way to do is ""widen my search"", but what kind of terms are out there? The ones that I know are ""software engineer/developer"", ""data analyst/scientist"", but what else?

I have an end goal in mind, which is to build computer sensing/simulation technologies (e.g. Video analyser to help render 3D environment), it's just that I don't exactly know where can I find those opportunities. Still gonna invest in Web dev skills at the moment"

4. Presidential Service Award: Gold, Silver, Bronze (11th, 10th, 9th)
5. National Merit Semi-Finalist

I’m not 100% sure which additional five I included on my MIT application, but from my notes I probably included: All-State Alternate on Flute, All-County on Flute, Rensselaer Medalist, a slate of high school-level “awards for academic excellence,” and USACO silver division

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang Teacher (very good) - I think this letter contained really good insight on my intellectual curiosity, participation, and character.

Scientific Computing Teacher (very good) - I had a very good relationship with this teacher and he said he included “quirky stories.”

AP Calc BC and Pre-Calc Teacher (good) - I only knew her during COVID years and I had her in 9th/10th grade, not 11th, but I think I had a good relationship with her. But I also know that if I was a teacher, I would’ve forgotten any specific details about me a year later.

Professor at SSP (good)

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Harvey Mudd and Case Western (7/10) - I didn’t end up applying to either of these, but I did an interview over the summer for both. They went pretty well, but nothing special. They probably wouldn’t have had any effect on my application.

MIT (9/10) - I was worried because my interviewer was pretty old. I messed up a little near the end but recovered quickly. The interview went extremely well overall–she liked my interest in the humanities and collaboration.

UChicago Video (8.5/10) - I had a quirky and interesting video, but I was bouncing around too much as I spoke and said the word “magnets” oddly (I know that sounds strange, but I really did say it oddly). I think the video was overall positive.

**Essays**

Overall (9/10) - My essays were good. I don’t have any truly unique life experiences, but I think I took what I had and wrote well with it.

Common App Essay (8.5/10) - About playing pretend and using imagination/creativity. In hindsight, I’m not sure it’s exactly a “common app essay” but I still think it’s good creative writing.

UChicago (9/10) - I thought these essays were some of my best writing and I put a ton of effort into them. I did a past prompt and discussed music as a portal, with interesting description and reasoning. I also liked my Why UChicago essay a lot, since it had a well-executed metaphor.

MIT (9/10) - These varied in quality. I rewrote my “culture” essay (7/10?) about 10 times and I’m not truly happy with the result, which was me discussing how I reached out to my French background through language. My “what you do for fun” (9/10) was about creative writing, both fanfiction and in general. I also talked about my family sparking my intellectual curiosity (10/10) and my community service project (9/10). I’d give my why major essay a 9/10.

WPI (8/10) - This turned out better than I thought it would, but I didn’t put nearly as much effort into it than the others above.

RPI (8/10) - Same assessment as WPI.

Stony Brook (8/10) - A shortened version of my RPI activity essay.

UMASS Amherst (6.5/10) - These essays were pretty mediocre. I’m honestly surprised it didn’t get me rejected from the honors college. I do like UMASS Amherst and I was definitely interested in attending, but I found it difficult to articulate why.

Edited this section slightly to fix me mixing up my essays for WPI and RPI.

**Portfolios**

Music (7/10) - Music is important to me, so I submitted a music portfolio for my flute wherever I could, but I’m not amazing at it. I don’t think this impressed anyone.

Maker (7/10) - I threw stuff at a wall and I don’t know if it stuck or not. I didn’t have anything super interesting, but I included some of my individual coding projects and my programs from SSP.

Research (7/10) - I submitted my bioinformatics research poster and presentation. It wasn’t very impressive. However, as a computational neuroscience project it related to my intended MIT major very well, so I included it.

My essays for these three in the MIT portfolios were pretty rushed. I’m not sure if the portfolios added to my application, but MIT was my dream school so I included everything I possibly could.

I decided not to apply anywhere else RD and withdrew my deferred UChicago application after getting my MIT decision. I plan to decline most of my acceptances soon, when I have the emotional bandwidth.

**Reflection:**

I got extremely lucky with MIT. I was planning to do a targeted shotgun in my RD round (I carefully chose only schools I actually liked, but I was planning to apply to 10 more reaches) but I had procrastinated, so I would’ve had an awful holiday break filled with tears. I also wished I had looked at the MIT portfolios earlier; I missed school on the 1st and still submitted my last rushed portfolio at 11:57 pm. However, this is partially due to a COVID infection over the long weekend where I was planning to do a ton of college app stuff, which completely derailed my EA plans and backed up my RD applications. So, future applicants–plan for unexpected stuff like that, I guess.

Overall, I think my essays and letters of recommendation “got me in.” My ECs and awards were good, but they definitely weren’t as insane as a lot of the stuff I see on here. I could’ve probably done more (independent research, USACO gold, etc.) that would’ve helped, and I would’ve regretted that if I didn’t get lucky. I guess I’ve seen that even if you do some stuff wrong and let some opportunities pass you by, it can still work out. I'm overjoyed about my acceptances and super excited about next year!

I'm slightly insulted that I didn't get yield-protected out of Northeastern, though."

While Leetcode helps me prepare for interviews, I often struggle to comprehend and execute projects once I start working on them, and that's why I did not get my return offer :(. I feel like I am more of a ""Leetcoder"" than a software engineer. Can you provide tips on how to enhance my abilities in working on projects during internships and full-time jobs? This includes how to adapt to new programming languages, comprehend others' code, code according to industrial standards, and continually learn new things. I understand that asking colleagues for help can be beneficial, but in fast-paced companies like Meta and Amazon, they may not have enough time to guide me step by step."

I have apologized, done what I can, and just can’t stand the anxiety anymore and calling my work HR has been slow and difficult. 

I was talking to a girl online for a few months, got ghosted, sent her desperate messages asking what I did wrong, was laughed at, had a psychotic episode, and I sent a link of her NSFW twitter account along with screenshots of suggestive pictures from the account (not fully nude) to some of her family members through facebook.

After I DM’d her on twitter saying “I hope your family are forgiving” to which she said something like “i am being threatened, men are crazy” on her twitter. I texted her that ‘“I’m not threatening, I already did it” and that’s where I realized I’m going fucking insane and unsent everything and deleted the facebook account. Luckily, none of her family members saw anything to which she has confirmed, and I am thankful for.

One of her friends then instagram messaged me that I’m sad and pathetic, to which I agreed and tried to sort out as much as I could through him. I decided it was best to end everything, told him that I unsent everything, and wanted him to ensure her that I’m gone. I wanted to message her an apology, but we both agreed that I was the last person she would want to hear from.

The next morning, I get a lengthy email from her older sister with explaining that I have been reported to my school dean, my work HR, and was threatened about my future because they had my face, address, name and friends with social media presence etc. Weirdly at the time I wasn’t scared, I just wanted to fix everything and tell her I was sorry.

Since then I’ve discussed with her older sister  and have properly apologized to the girl, and have been cleared from my school because I shared public photos on twitter that were not fully nude. I am now waiting for my work HR to get back, but the anxiety is getting to me and the girl and sister are not willing to close the case because I deserve whatever consequences my work decides on, which i can’t really complain about.

Now that the backstory is done, I work at a hospital as an inpatient pharmacy intern and am in my second to last year of pharmacy school. I love my job, and the anxiety of getting fired or even keeping my job and having my director know what I did is genuinely making it difficult for me to sleep at night. What is the likelihood I get to keep my job? That HR reports everything to my boss? I don’t know what to do, any advice would be appreciated."

Then September 2022, I managed to get an accounting intern job in a different state.  However, I had to resign recent Thursday due to the most toxic “sun”-high turnover rate environment fostered by management. I think I got the job only because they needed to keep filling bodies in positions. 

I am moving back to my family home. Gonna give myself some resting time with some looking into jobs to apply. I am worried if it’s gonna take another 50 interviews and 800 applications or so to find a job. I don’t really remember my accounting degrees so if interview ask me any accounting specific question, I won’t be able to answer well. I don’t have tangible accounting experience to this date. 

Right now, I’m taking course #3 of #8 Google’s data analytics certification program on Coursera. It’s interesting. I recently purchased data science class on Udemy. Something for me to keep busy and learning. Mom suggested I go to school and learn something IT related. Should I?

Here’s my drawbacks I worry about: $80k federal student loan, hearing impaired (cant hear). So it’s naturally harder to find a job and going back to school will increase more debt.

I said I'm coming as a consultant and charging $1200/hr. I check with my friend at HR and said I am not legally obligated to come back as my contract ended on the 30th of Jan. If I am coming as a consultant, they are obligated to pay me. And she asked me to go to the highest amount I can think of because the company is on the verge of bankruptcy and they cannot afford that.  

I also lodge a formal harassment complaint with the Head of HR about my boss and ex-colleague calling me on social media and the words are that they are getting suspension because previous persons also lodged that type of complaint and I was the one that was one too many.

My dad also lodges a formal complaint about this by the way.

Let me tell you the background that why I am asking this.

Currently, I am an undergrad and heading towards to data engineering for my career. I've just decided to go on that way before almost half a year ago. Before that, I experienced with andorid development for about 2 years. I will point what's the relation between my cv and the topic.

I live in Türkiye and junior level data engineering/analysis positions do not open frequently here. It's a total pain to find an internship on that. Generally, big companies open roles for intern/junior data engineering positions; however they generally require a relavant job/project experience before. I've just started to involve in projects in my school. So I could not get any acceptance from those companies.

2 months ago, I applied for a startup here in Turkey. Because my lessons for this spring term is so heavy and that also decreases my chance to find a job, i accepted to be their slave (i mean i work for free), at least just to write it down to my cv.

Although i do not have a strong background, i know programming concepts better than most of internship applicants. While my friends do not even know functional thinking, it saddens me to be classed with them. 

Sure, i am thinking to find another less of a slave position in a few months. But I wonder, what happens if I apply for competitor firms. Rather than applying for a data engineering position whose needs and background information are pretty different for the data, i think it is easier and more productive to get a job in a competitor. You would be familiar with the concept they are dealing with, and easily adopt it.

If I start to write to hr of those competitors, how will this behaviour be seen from people? Is it a shame, or cheating, or disgeace etc? I work for free and that's a disgrace. Please enlighten me"

I was hoping for a bit of advice as to where i should begin my SWE career after Uni. For reference, i graduated back in July 2022 with first class intercalated masters, from a top 10 UK Uni in CS.

The past 4 or so months i have been applying to various graduate schemes and startups.
Unfortunately i have made little progress, with me failing the technical, or passing the technical but the position closing during my application (due to me submitting and progressing my applications late/slowly).

As a result, i have been offered two positions so far:

* One being at a startup that has a reasonably strong history and is certainly a pioneer in its space. They are just opening an office in London and growing their team. They gave me an offer for 40k as a frontend engineer.

* The other an international aerospace and defence company, under a 2 year graduate scheme, also based in London for 30k, rising by 2.5k each 6 months.

Ideally i would want a graduate scheme, offering the 40k mark, which i feel i can definitely get, only now almost all are closed and i would have to essentially wait another year.
I am very passionate about SWE having many robust personal projects, so there is no shortage of drive, but i have limited experience with only about 3 months internship at a small local company during Uni.

Whatever i choose, i want to be sure it will allow me to have a very strong career, allowing me to gain enough experience (as quickly as possible) such that i can ultimately work in FAANG/ have a good salary, ideally in 1-2 years time.

Can anyone offer advice here?

tldr: should i take a 30k grad scheme, 40k start up position or keep searching?"

I had an internship last summer and I realized this while working. I tried very hard to get back into it but I have to just accept that it's not for me. The problem is that I am graduating and I feel (financially) like it's too late to switch my major. I've always been an avid reader and I have over the last year reignited an intense passion for humanities. My last few months have consisted of hours and hours a day of reading literature and learning a language. My mom, who worked in academia, has been telling me that graduate school is very open and that I should finish undergrad and then I can pursue what I am really passionate about (for far less money than undergraduate school). I don't really have anybody to talk but I'd like to know if what my mom says is true and that I can redirect my career once I graduate undergrad. How realistic is it for someone who studied computer science to end up studying a subject in the humanities in college? To me, it sounds ridiculous yet I feel my desired future is depending on such a possibility."

I am a recent graduate (end of summer 2022) so thankfully I’m still eligible for the new graduate programs. As I was only there for four months I’ve decided to position the role as a COOP/Internship. I understand nowadays people understand that everyone is being laid off but I am a bit worried of perception. A lot of people in the comments who work in banking were asking - how many others were laid off? The answer was I was not the only one and there were more people involved. The issue is that since this happened at my boutique and it’s typically taboo for BB banks/EB to lay off analysts, I don’t want questions to be raised even though it wasn’t my fault/performance based. 

I have worked on several deals while I was there — $200M in EV, they closed while I was there. I have the hard skills and learned a lot while I was there and am confident I can go through recruitment again but I’m worried about perception. Would I be taken more seriously in an interview if I said I was laid off? They’d maybe look at me as more mature and ask questions about my real exposure etc. or would it be better to say I was an intern? I’m worried if I say I was an intern they may not take my experience as serious and think I’m bsing what I did there because SA’s and coops typically don’t do a lot. What is the best way to go? I am recruiting for Full-Time/Entry level/New grad programs in IB."

I could see benefits to taking each one and how it could help me with my goals. Which one would you take if you were in my shoes?

My mom has relapsed back in her addiction and each day at home is a living hell. She is constantly high, making messes, screaming, or trying to kick me out of the house.

Most of the jobs are centered in New York so I’m trying to move to that area but it’s impossible to find a landlord to find a studio without a job first and I’m worried of I get a job offer, I won’t be able to get to work without housing first. I have a little less than 5k saved up so I have the deposits ready as soon as I can find employment.

I was in a different major,  but switched to Software Development in the middle of my degree. I graduated with my bachelors in Software Eng., a Certificate in Web Development and got 4 months internship I did through my school's CIT Department. 

I consider myself competent but I do not have nearly as much experience as other graduates that started programming from their very first semester in their college education or even before that. I have applied to hundreds of places for my first entry level job with no luck. Everywhere I apply, it is required to have at least 2 years of experience, even for entry level jobs. Would it be stupid to get another internship to add more experience or should I persist on trying to get that entry level job? Are internships after college a good idea?"

10ur2z2,25,2023-02-05,Associate-level woes: Isn't this job hard enough on its own? Why do we have to make it so much harder on newbies?,Few_Sherbert8395,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/10ur2z2/associatelevel_woes_isnt_this_job_hard_enough_on/,"This is partly a rant, partly a cry for help (lol), and partly a curiosity to see how others are managing/have managed the time between graduation and licensure. Sorry in advance if this comes across as too whiny or complaining - it's like four years of pent-up frustration and sadness. I'm usually more measured than this, I promise, lol.

I'm an associate-level therapist (MFT) and while I love the work so much, I feel like this field can be so exploitative to new clinicians and it's becoming a serious drag. 

I spent three years going into a ton of debt, getting professionally hazed by faculty, and up-ending my entire life just to go into this field. I spent a year in an unpaid internship in CMH, raking in TONS of cash for upper management at an agency that exploited me, over-worked me, and also collected a portion of my tuition. I have never experienced a level of burnout so profound as what I experienced in my internship. It sucks too because I entered this field wanting to work in community mental health, but I don't think I'll ever work in CMH again and I know I'm far from the only one. I'd rather just not be a therapist than go back to that setting. And that really sucks for the community and for clients, because it funnels more experienced clinicians out of CMH and into PP, leaving unpaid students and new graduates with the least amount of experience to do some of the most complex and high acuity work.

This next part is just my personal experience. I know that there are group practices out there that are wonderfully supportive, collaborative places who pay well or take a portion that is genuinely fair, so I hope group practice owners don't think I'm shitting on them - but after I graduated, I was looking around at jobs and talking to my classmates about their contracts, and found that a lot of the group practices in my area a) have non-compete clauses and b) take over 50% of the revenue associates-level clinicians bring in. I understand that part of that cut is for supervision, admin, liability, and other benefits, so I don't begrudge that entirely, but more than 50%, sometimes 60%??! Of every session? I'm in private practice and my overhead is not even close to that large a percentage of each session fee. Not to mention, there are some very shady group practices out there - I've seen so much weird unprofessionalism, and I have more than one ex-classmate who is barely making ends meet. 

Because I was so burnt out in community mental health and the group practice contracts were looking so bleak, I decided to immediately go into private practice when I graduated, but that's no picnic either. Associates can't accept insurance, so I lose a ton of the clients who are interested in working with me, which then means it will take me longer to get hours, so I feel like I'm being pushed into CMH or a group practice, which feels exploitative. It's such a vicious cycle and I'm feeling so discouraged. Ironically, I love my clients and I feel zero burnout from the work I do with them - it just feels like all this other stuff gets in the way of the actual work.

My school has a reputation in the community for being very intense and abusive (sure wish I knew that ahead of time! lol), so maybe part of it is lingering resentment and hurt about what that has cost me and others. They made the whole experience so much worse. I sometimes wonder what it would be like for me right now if I didn't have all this additional crap from my program to work through, and if it would be easier. Is this type of thing just normal for all therapy grad programs?

I took a lot of time off after graduation to deal with the worst of the burnout and I have a wonderful, supportive supervisor now who is really encouraging and helpful, and I love the (tiny) caseload of clients I have, but I am not making much money, I still just feel so tired sometimes, and I feel like I want to scream. Anyone else have similar feelings? Any licensed clinicians with advice for making it through? It just feels like I can't win sometimes, but I truly love this work and I want to keep doing it.

tldr; Why does this field have to suck so much at the beginning, when we have the least amount of resources and the least amount of experience? Does this actually benefit clients (or really anyone except for CMH upper management, PP supervisors, or group practice owners)? Any words of wisdom to help a tired associate therapist get through it?"

10uu8to,8,2023-02-05,My Hope In Learning Bioinformatics (Questions I have about the field),SnooChocolates1573,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/10uu8to/my_hope_in_learning_bioinformatics_questions_i/,"Hi everyone,   
I'm a Junior in high school right now and I believe with the current technologies, this field is on the brink of many major world-changing discoveries, in theory. But when I look into the path to becoming a Biochemist/Bioinformatician, it seems closer to becoming a doctor where you help small groups of people at a time, rather than making a startup and creating the next instagram or uber.   


My expectation for what bioinformatics and chemistry should be able to do is based on my experience creating apps and websites, where a small team or just myself can create something really cool to help some people (small enough to be counted on two hands) with some task, or get a laugh out of several thousand online strangers.

Can someone with experience in the field put these expectations in context or put into perspective the amount of work required for some output? How close is it to medical work and how close is it to computer science? Also, if there is anything I can do now with bioinformatics that is similar to creating an app/website? I am currently taking Biotech where I learned lab skills like PCR and modifying genes (what I understand are the ""basics"" of the field), and I am currently AP Bio, Chem, and Phys. I also have a strong background in coding (websites, games, competitive programming) which might help you in answering your question. I am not looking to do this for college, just to build up my portfolio/understanding of the field and maybe meet some cool people or learn some techniques that I could apply to a future job.  


TLDR/Questions:  
\- How transformative do you think Bio(informatics, chem, engineering etc) will be in 20 years  
\- How would you compare this field's growth and usefulness to the rise of the internet(Google, facebook, Uber etc)

\- Is there anything I can learn now similar to a coding language for CS that could get me an internship somewhere in bioinformatics in my senior year/freshman year of college  
\- Are there any projects I can do in Bioinformatics that are similar to Apps/Websites in usefulness (I don't care about time commitment, any amount of time commitment is okay)

\- What is a job in bioinformatics like compared to being a doctor or software engineer"
10uufay,55,2023-02-05,"There's a Ghost in the Pharmaceutical Department, and it's ALL his Fault.",cance11ed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10uufay/theres_a_ghost_in_the_pharmaceutical_department/,"Even as a resident, I knew the story of James Gain. Dr. Gain was a doctor at Haven Port Hospital for over thirty years, working specifically in the pharmaceuticals department. He was beloved by his patients, nurses, doctors, management, the janitors, even people who came by only once to pick up a single prescription. Winter of 2012, Dr. Gain was fired after giving the wrong medication to a nine-year-old boy with a heart-defect, Edward Richardson. Edward died in his house a week or two after the medication was given to him. The Richardson family was extremely wealthy, and threatened to close the entirety of the hospital, and serve every single person in the hospital who had even interacted with Edward a lawsuit. Management knew they were going to be sued into oblivion anyway, so to soften the blow they ended up firing Dr. Gain.

On the day of February 5th, Dr. Gain was given the notice of his firing, and, while you're not supposed to use the word ""insane"" in our hospital, Dr. Gain literally went insane. He took a scalpel, went down to the ED, and stabbed three patients and a nurse. Two of the patients survived, while eighty-seven-year-old Marta Sanders, a woman who had taken a tumble down her stairs, and Nurse Jacobs, a man with a wedding in less than five days, tragically passed away. Before security was able to stop Dr. Gain, Dr. Gain took his own life by shoving the scalpel he had just used to kill two people on himself, jamming it into his neck.

The story made mainstream news, about the horrible tragedy that had happened at Haven Port Hospital, yet the story seemed to disappear after a few days. Life was expected to go back to normal, people were supposed to go back into the ED without the vision of Nurse Jacobs blood on the walls, Marta Sanders body fallen out of her bed, and the silver scalpel sticking out of Dr. Gain's neck.

They say on the anniversary of Dr. Gain's death, something always goes horribly wrong in a single department. Last year, the radiology department left a metal tray table inside the MRI room. Once the machine was turned on, the table rammed itself into the machine from the magnets and put a patient into a permanent coma. The year before that, psychology had a patient suffering from anorexia randomly, and suddenly grabbed a chair and threw it at a doctor, and then jumped out of their rooms window, plummeting to their death. Nothing ever good happens on December 29th. Most people try to skip that day, pass their shift off to an unsuspecting intern, or resident.

I got stuck with the shift on February 5th. The ten-year anniversary of Dr. Gain's death. Something bad was going to happen, everyone in that hospital knew it. I won't lie, even I tried passing off my shift to other people, but I had no luck. I parked my car in front of the hospital that day, got out of it, and genuinely contemplated not going in at all, and just faking sick. I'm not that superstitious, I swear, but I did not want to go in. But I still did.

At 8:00 AM, a light fell in the OR, falling directly on a patient having open heart surgery, as well as one of the surgeons involved, knocking him out, and killing the patient.

At 9:00 AM, a printer in the finance department explodes, and gives one of the employees a third degree burn to her face, as well as injuring a few others.

At 11:00 AM, the long-term care center was hit with four different patients going into cardiac arrest at the exact same time. All four elderly patients died.

At 12:00 PM, a car rammed into the front doors of the hospitals waiting room, luckily it missed all of the chairs full of waiting patients, but it still hit the secretary head on, the driver was thrown from his seat through the windshield, into the brick wall directly in front of him. Both died a few hours later.

At 2:00 PM, a heater in the pediatrics department set fire to a curtain nearby, and then a wall, and then multiple patient rooms. Five kids, four parents, and two doctors were stuck inside those rooms. Three kids, two parents, and one doctor walked out.

At 5:00 PM, the skyway connecting the hospital partially collapses, injuring seven, and killing two who were on the skywalk. Underneath the skywalk is the hospitals parking lot, the skyway crushed three people inside of an SUV below, killing all three.

At that point, the hospital directed all calls out of the hospital, we just couldn't take anymore. Only a few departments stayed open, including pharmaceuticals.

At 7:00 PM, two lab assistants, and the head of epidemiology are exposed to a life-threatening disease when a vial falls to the floor and breaks. They're still in quarantine, one of them in critical condition.

My shift always ends at 9:00, and the time was 8:45. I'd been giving out drugs and medication all day, hearing about the disasters unfold in the hospital, one, and then another, and then another. I'd had enough that day. After the first two incidents, the pharmacy closed to only patients who needed necessary medications, ones that couldn't even survive a day without their meds. Surprisingly, that was around forty eight people.

When it comes to the most necessary of drugs, people reserve times for when they want to pick theirs up. I'm an extremely organized person. I line up the medication in a perfect line, based on the time people come in to pick their medication up at, so I can just grab the closest one, give it to the person, and go on with my day. I was rushing back and forth between pharmaceuticals and the ED all day, helping the nurses and doctors there with the mass amounts of patients that had came in, and quickly delivering people their medications.

Nearing the end of the day, I was able to finally just relax, and sit down. Out of the forty-eight bottles that used to sit on the counter, only one remained now. A man then entered the pharmacy, requesting his normal medication. I walked up to the counter, grabbed the orange pill bottle, and threw it to the man. He caught the catch, and waved as he left the pharmacy. Before he could make it to the exit, however, he turned back, and placed the bottle on the counter.

""Hey, this isn't my prescription. I can't even read whatever the hell this is.""

He passed the bottle to me, and I read the label, ""Acetaminophen-hydrocodone""

""I need warfarin, not whatever the hell this stuff is. C'mon man, I could've died.""

I looked to my left at the counter. I was out of pill bottles. I couldn't have made a mistake, though, I knew exactly where I placed those bottles. I knew the exact position they were in, the order they were in, I knew almost everything you needed to know about those bottles.

It wasn't my fault.

It wasn't my fault they got the wrong medication.

It wasn't my fault.

They should have checked the name on the medication.

It wasn't my fault.

They should have been more careful.

It wasn't my fault.

It was Dr. Gain.

It wasn't my fault.

It had to be Dr. Gain.

It wasn't my fault they all died.

Is this what Dr. Gain felt?

It wasn't my fault every single one of them got the wrong medication.

I'm outside the ED with a scalpel right now as I post this.

The reason I posted this, though, is that I have a question.

Was it my fault?"

I ended up hating it and dropped out in the middle of my third year. I ended up taking the rest of the year off and doing a gap year before starting computer science at a no name university with no co-op program. I had to start over. All of my peers in high school ended up at UWaterloo’s co-op program. Browsing their LinkedIn, I see that they all managed to secure a FAANG internship, some of them interning at HRT, Two Sigma or Jane Street. I feel like I lost 4 years with nothing to show for it. Never had a job during all 4 of these years. The majority of students at my university are either older students or students that are not what we would traditionally describe as being driven or ambitious. I severely regret not enrolling in a co-op program at any less prestigious university. Work experience is clearly much more valuable than a Masters in the current market. I feel in despair on most days because of my empty LinkedIn. I have grinded 400+ Leetcode questions, have reached out to 100+ recruiters via cold emailing and LinkedIn and have many personal projects using modern tech stacks - in addition to a personal portfolio. I cannot seem to get any half-decent internship interviews at any tech company. Looking for advice to cure my depressing mental state and unfortunate internship hunt experience. What makes it worse is that I used to outperform a lot of these people in all fronts in an academic context at a top school. I had a 1600/1600 SAT and 35/36 ACT if that is relevant at all.

I can code in Python/R/C++/LaTeX and have helped building a small computer vision project using Python (identifying and tracking projectiles). I just received an internship offer from a tech company here in NZ. I've got some experience in data analysis and setting up cloud servers.

I have heard that anglosphere academia is extremely competitive and am wondering if that's true also in Europe. I've guessed that it would be very hard to break in for someone who grew up in an English-speaking country. If so, would it be better to look to Canada/the US instead for academic positions?

Alternatively I'm also considering working in industry — how is the job market for computer scientists, machine learning/AI researchers, or software engineers in France or Switzerland?

We moved in with him during covid when our lease was up and we wanted to buy a house but the pricing and interest was insane. My husband and I have agreed to buy the house from my dad this upcoming winter. Here's where things get tricky. My dad primarily lives at his girlfriends house so his room is used as a guest room, or a sick room or if the baby need to nap down stairs while I clean our room (the attic). The only other bed room is my youngest sisters (20f) who has trauma from a bad past relationship and from my mother (we all do) and has a hoarding problem. She has bins of unwashed dirty clothes in the basement  her room door cannot open all the way with clothes and trans on the floor and her room stinks of bad food. My sister is working on her issues in therapy but admits that if I ask her to do something she gets very defensive and won't do it.

None of us pay rent to my dad. This is an important factor. Now this will be important later but we have a third sister the middle (26f) who lives in Florida and will be leaving her job soon to come back home and go back to school. She will be moving into the basement and will be paying to remodel it into a bedroom. Fine dandy even. Here's the issue. We all never learned to clean. Please don't judge we grew up in a chaotic environment and it was survival everyday. Our rooms were trashed. And my youngest sister blames me for her disgusting ways today saying she learned it from the best.

In all honesty I was really gross and struggled with anxiety and depression. But my dad for about a year now would come to the house once a week and clean all the high traffic areas, living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom. This wasn't fair to him and we all (my husband, myself and my sister) agreed to keep a sepific room clean. I got the kitchen which later I learned included the dining room. My husband got the living 4oom and my sister got the bathroom now this is a tiny bathroom like 8x4, toliet sink tub. My sister wouldn't clean it   it would get disgusting. Absolutely filthy. Meanwhile I found myself cleaning the dining room, kitchen and living room. So my dad started charging my sister 100 dollars a week if he came home once a week and needed to clean the bathroom. When I tell you. It takes 15 minutes tops to clean the bathroom top to bottom, surfaces, tub trash sweep mop I'm not even kidding. So he started charging her. Then I asked him if I cleaned it if I could get the money. So that's how I started  getting paid to clean the house. 

Honestly we cook for my sister clean up after her so it's a pretty good deal. I work a free internship and I'm in school full time to it helps me have some pocket money to do swim or gymnastics for my daughter. Anyways. 

I realized my daughter was seeing us live in a home that would get dirty all week and then I would spend all weekend cleaning complaining the entire time. I looked at my sister and realized I don't wa t my daughter to end up like her or my hoarding mom. So I did the fly lady 31 day babysteps with lady Diane on YouTube. (look her up this is life changing stuff). Now the house is beautiful everyday. I do a load of laundry every day and put it away, the sink is nice and Shiney, dishes are done, surfaces are wiped off, toliet is sparkling, floor is swept and vacuumed ect. My life feels good. I'm finally proud of my home and it's not perfect but it's so amazing compared to how we used to live. And best part is my daughter now picks up behind herself and likes to help me clean in her own way 

Now my middle sister is moving into the basement and is very adament that we hire a cleaning lady. To her own admission (she lives with roommates) she is not very tidy and hires a cleaning lady with her roommates chipping in to come once a month and clean their house. She offered to hire a cleaning lady once a month. I told her I don't mind keeping things tidy but I would charge a cleaning fee for her and my younger sister. She seemed okay but wanted to rather put thr money towards a cleaning lady so I had more time. 

My husband and i both thought this wasn't a good idea for reason like the counters need to be wiped off daily and not monthly, my youngest sister is notorious for dumping a weeks worth of dishes in the sink covered in hair for her room ect. My you gest sister agreed as well we would at minimum need a weekly cleaning lady. My middle sister agreed but then I said we are just swapping my time for her money and we should all be chipping in. 

Anyways. My middle sister wants to try for 6 weeks just having a cleaning lady. I'm worried about my habits. I've built these beautiful cleaning habits to keep my house tidy. I'm worried
 1 that my sisters won't clean up after themselves and be fine with the house looking gross until thr cleaning last comes 1x a week. 
2. My daughter will think it's okay not to clean up after her self since we have a cleaning lady and she won't clean with me anymore
3. Me losing my cleaning habits and not wanting to go back if the cleaning lady doesn't work out
4. I'm going to end up cleaning in between the cleaning lady and be out of money
5. I don't have any income and my husband is saving up for our down payment I don't think we can afford a cleaning lady currently. 

My you gest sister is fine paying a cleaning fee to Me or a cleaning lady but my middle sister is very passionate about me cleaning up after them not being my problem and just hiring someone. 

I personally think it's a waste of money and would rather get paid to do it. My husband agrees. 

TSIU: I've built great cleaning habits i the last month and I get paid by youngest sister to keep the house clean. My middle sister is moving in and wants all of us to chop in for a cleaning lady since she thinks I shouldn't have to clean up behind everyone. I think that's a waste of money and I don't want the house gross I between cleaning sessions. What should I do"

I am doing an internship as a research assistant in which we are writing a paper. I really like the field of research and I'm almost sure I can get into a PhD fairly easily: I'll try to keep the average high, research assistant internship and recommendation letter from the professors with whom I'm doing the research and moreover I appear as author in the paper (and not in the acknowledgments as is usually done). For now I have taken the 4 exams scheduled for the first semester: two 30 cum laude and two 30.  

The only doubt I have is about money, I wouldn't want to spend another 3 years earning very little money (1000/1100) when, working in the same area, I would easily earn 2k in Italy and who knows how much outside. I know I could do the PhD outside but I think it's much more difficult to enter and in any case also in other places they don't pay who knows how much better (like in Switzerland they give around 3.5k, a salary equal to 1100 in Italy).  

What would you advise me to do?"
10v589g,12,2023-02-06,Advice on: Grad Scheme vs Startup vs Keep Searching,A_GOOD_NOODLE,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10v589g/advice_on_grad_scheme_vs_startup_vs_keep_searching/,"Hi all,

I was hoping for a bit of advice as to where i should begin my SWE career after Uni. For reference, i graduated back in July 2022 with first class intercalated masters, from a top 10 UK Uni in CS.

The past 4 or so months i have been applying to various graduate schemes and startups. Unfortunately i have made little progress, with me failing the technical, or passing the technical but the position closing during my application (due to me submitting and progressing my applications late/slowly).

As a result, i have been offered two positions so far:

* One being at a startup that has a reasonably strong history and is certainly a pioneer in its space. They are just opening an office in London and growing their team. They gave me an offer for 40k as a frontend engineer.

* The other an international aerospace and defence company, under a 2 year graduate scheme, also based in London for 30k, rising by 2.5k each 6 months.

Ideally i would want a graduate scheme, offering the 40k mark, which i feel i can definitely get, only now almost all are closed and i would have to essentially wait another year. I am very passionate about SWE having many robust personal projects, so there is no shortage of drive, but i have limited experience with only about 3 months internship at a small local company during Uni.

Whatever i choose, i want to be sure it will allow me to have a very strong career, allowing me to gain enough experience (as quickly as possible) such that i can ultimately work in FAANG/ have a good salary, ideally in 1-2 years time.

Can anyone offer advice here?

tldr: should i take a 30k grad scheme, 40k start up position or keep searching?"

**IMPORTANT**: I have added a 4 step method on how to compare 2 schools down below, it's really good IMO

God bless you!

# Finances:

* Does the college **meet full need to admitted students** and does the college have **a track record of giving out significant financial aid**? If not, that could be an indicator that your chances don't look very good if you have a very low budget to play with
* Do financial aid packages **include loans**? This sucks because nobody would like to take out a loan with an 8 (!!!!) percent interest rate
* Do financial aid packages **include campus work**? This can be important because your free time and spare money for other things can be influenced
* Does the college tell **what price range students usually pay**? For example, at the College of Wooster, many students are required to pay 25k or more because they have a limited budget

# Social Scene:

* Does the school offer **great clubs** and are there students who participate?
* Does the school have **varsity or club sports** you could watch or even participate in?
* What's the **party culture** like? You probably don't come all the way to the US just to get drunk every other day and/or simp until dawn
* Does the school have **greek life** and how much does it dominate the social scene on campus? Many students at small schools with a dominant greek culture say it can be very ""toxic"" and boring if you don't participate. And are you ready to pay chapter fees and attend chapter meetings if you do so?
* What **activities are offered off campus**? An NFL stadium, Beaches, Museums, Parks etc.

# Location:

* Are there **other schools nearby** to socialize with?
* What is the **setting**? Do you prefer a smaller, relaxed setting with nature and hiking trails or a big city with shops and public transport. **However, Bigger isn't always better, trust me, I've experienced both sides in life and I personally have to say that a small to medium city is the best to socialize and have less stress but still experience a city feeling with shops, public transport, and restaurants**
* How far away is **the next city**, if the school isn't in one?
* What's the **crime rate** in the area?
* Are there good **companies nearby** or in the area where you could intern?
* **How accessible is the school**? Do you need a car ride or can you take the bus/train to get to the airport or next city

# Academics:

* What **majors or minors are offered** if you decide to switch or would like to take on a Double-Major or Double-minor?
* What's the **student to faculty ratio**? I've read that 15:1 is the max. for a good ratio
* **How big are the classes**?
* How many **people are in your intended major**?
* What's the **graduation rate**? I've read that 70% is the baseline
* What's the **retention rate**? 
* Are there **academic success programs** that could help you with classes or other things?

# Other:

* What's the **alumni network** like and **do they hire students** from their alma mater?
* Are the **dorms** reasonable? I.e. no mold, air conditioning
* Is the **food** good? Nobody wants to eat bad food for 4 years
* **Is the campus beautiful** so you can realx?
* **How diverse** is the school? Minority enrollment, financial background
* What is the **endowment** like? This can tell how much alumni donate to their school, how future proof the school is, and how much the school can invest in faculty, financial aid, or new buildings

# How to compare two schools:

1. Draw a table with 3 columns to compare two schools from your list. 1st column is for all the factors you remotely consider and give each a score from 1-10 (if financial aid is extremely important but you don't care about the dorms at all, write a 10 for financial aid and a 1 for dorms).
2. Then, grade each factor for the respective school from 1-10 ( UCLA has an excellent location, probably the best, so that would be a 10, whereas Dartmouth is in the middle of nowhere, so that would be a 1)
3. Multiplicate each grade you have given with the value of the factor (Harvard is need-blind and is generally very generous so that would be a 10 for it's grade and an importance factor of 10 like in Step 1, resulting in 10\*10=100). 
4. Repeat Step 3 for every factor, then add all the products (the result of your multiplication) and the school with the higher total sum has won and would be more of a priority than the other school you compared it with"

10v6oev,91,2023-02-06,Been praised all year by my manager but told at performance review that I was “meeting expectations”,outofnowhere_,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10v6oev/been_praised_all_year_by_my_manager_but_told_at/,"I started at my current job back in January as part of a new team as the only developer where I was tasked to bring stability to a new application and deliver new features, which I have done in what I think was more than expected of me. In parallel, I have been mentoring interns who were hired later which I’m still doing. 

Despite being praised for my performance all year by my manager, in casual conversations and also in our 1-1s, I was told that I was meeting expectations and that’s what he’s told his superiors, even though I feel I have been doing well above beyond the expectations set for me. His reasoning was that he felt I have a lot of potential and can’t wait for it to come to fruition. It left me a bit disappointed to be honest. Shouldn’t my performance be judged on what I delivered rather than what he thinks I can do in the future? How should I go about this?

Note: we were looking to hire a developer to my team in the summer, where I referred my friend who just graduated. He negotiated a higher salary than me (my own fault I suppose), but was eventually ghosted due to a hiring freeze at the time. Just feel a bit let down that my manager was willing to meet my friend’s salary expectations before the decision was out of his hands, and then tell me something I was not expecting at the annual performance review. I’m ranting a bit here, but I guess I’m just looking for advice from people more experienced than me. I like working where I am, just didn’t expect this turn of events."

I'm sure this has been answered at some point, but I've been unable to find anything that really matches up with what I'm looking for. At the moment, I have the title ""tier 2 help desk"". I graduated with a bachelors in cybersecurity last May, had a year internship in my last year and worked full time since until this job (9-10 months). The internship was a IT Technician internship at a school system, working with lots of Chromebooks, Macs, the server room, deployment projects, and imaging. Most of that job was repairing hardware in the Chromebooks or Macs. The job prior to this tier 2 one was a Help Desk/Desktop Support position, but it was more of a jr system admin position experience-wise (AD management, server installation/upgrade, patching, end user support, imaging, inventory tracking, GPO management and application, smart card setup and certificate creation/renewal, technical procedure creation, etc). I could be wrong on that last part about jr system admin, but what I listed seems beyond the scope of most help desk positions. Also was in the process of getting a secret clearance when I left, don't know if that helps my position in any way.

This new job is more of the classic ""help desk"" for this organizations internal system, working almost entirely through email and ticketing system performing hardware upgrades, account management, computer deployment, imaging and desk setup. I've polished a lot of my ""help desk"" skills like troubleshooting, researching, communicating ideas to non-technical people, etc. I also have my A+ and Sec+, and studied for the net+ but never actually sat for the test (I learned it for the practical aspects, correct me if I'm wrong the cert won't help get a soc analyst job but still need to know networking). 

Last thing, I have a home lab with an AD environment using certificates and smart cards, and had a pentesting lab until recently. I repurposed that over this past weekend to include an elasticsearch/kibana stack with suricata alongside the pentest lab to begin learning how to use a SIEM more efficiently. 

The main question, is given this information, what certification would make the most sense with the end goal of breaking into information security (other than net+)? Although I'm willing to go the system admin route as an intermediary step as well. I'm eyeing the CySA+ but I know it's a newer cert without as much recognition, and don't know much about the value of certs other than CompTIA. Thanks everyone!"

For example, embedded experience, something in cryptography, oop heavy personal project or app maybe, some project to deal with multithreading or something, maybe a project that’s community service based etc. 


Like what were the categories of your experiences that landed you a good internship? 




In terms of coursework, dsa, oop, security, compilers, os etc. are the basic requirements right? What courses should you have on your resume before junior year summer? Is 3.0+ gpa really okay or is it always the higher the better? What was yours?





Finally, do you have to have the specific experience they are looking for? For example, let’s say it’s some banks swe position, do one of your projects/experiences have to be related to finance, or does it help?




Any tips for getting faang tier internships? Apply online and wait, or interact at career fair? Reach out on LinkedIn or cold emails? Referral? How do you break the pool of the thousands of resumes to get noticed and stand out?"

***GT PROS***

T5 in computer science

Better chances to get internships early as an international students

Many things to do in Atlanta

***GT CONS***

They don't give any scholarships or aid to internationals so it would be 50k/y, I could afford it but will be left without a single penny.

**Gettysburg College**

***Gettysburg PROS***

Small liberal arts college

Got into the Lincoln scholars program so more opportunities

I could apply to Columbia / Uwash St. Louis for 3 + 2 engineering ( In this case computer science ) ( If  I take this the price will probably to 180-200k so similar to GT )

COA 13.5k/y because received 71k scholarship

***Gettysburg CONS***

Really small computer science department

Not ranked for CS

Worry about job prospects

**UNSW - Australia**

**UNSW PROS**

Just 2 general education courses, almost nothing, so I can take more courses for my major

Seems better country to **live in,** but this is subjective

Easier to get residency **IF** I get a good job

**UNSW CONS**

43k/y not really a con because cheaper than GT but still really expensive

I have read that is really hard/impossible to get internships as an international student because companies prefer residents.

- I'm finishing a degree in German with a minor in math this summer. In Denmark.
- Was going to do a 2.5 year MA in German and math with the intention of teaching. The degree is mainly math and stats classes + a 4 month internship.
- Realised I want to work with coding instead (not data science).
- I can code in Python, if I do the MA I'll learn R and lots of statistics too.
- I've applied to part time IT-related jobs but no luck so far.

So I'm considering applying to a BSc in CS instead of the MA: 
- The degree sounds much more interesting and useful for what I want to do.
- I can get a BSc in just 2 years. 
- If I want to get a MSc (unsure) it would take me 3.5-4 years.
- No tuition fees and I'm not struggling financially.

Alternatively there is a 2 year MA degree in IT and communication I could do but it sounds less interesting. It consists of 2 software development classes, and the rest of the degree is about project management, communication etc.

It’s lonely and hard, I feel like I will never be understood or reach anywhere in life.

I love them but I feel like they don’t love or understand me?

* Computer Science degree
* MBA
* Have one to two years to start/ master a new skill
* Happy to enter the market as an intern and start a fresh career (at 35).

What I'm looking for:

* Remote/ Hybrid working is normal
* Part time opportunities in the future when I choose to start a family

What I've seen so far (of interest):

* Data Science
* Data Analytics?
* Software Developer (no idea which language to learn)

Interests:

* None (Depres).
* Programming like, Python and Data science a little bit.

But I don't know what this skill will even be used for, perhaps another language like Java or C# would be more valuable in the long term? I do not know. Ultimately, I don't believe any job will make me happy, so I may as well try to find the best ROI for my time as possible :)

I'm extremely scared of professional life. I have been avoiding having to work summer jobs for now two years since I've been old enough, but now that I've left home, I'm gonna have to work to pay the bills, plus, my cursus requires that I do two internships during the year (and the 1st one is next week).
Thing is, it gives me so much anxiety to even think about it because I'm really bad at being autonomous and I am not very talented with my hands. So I'm scared that it's gonna go wrong, and there’s simple things that I don't know and am way too afraid to ask (like how do you process payments, how do you even look for a job?). 
Since my psychiatrist told me that it was plausible I had ADHD and I identify a lot with the symptoms I see, I wanted to post this here.

I graduated one year ago but had to leave the job market almost immediately to be a full time caregiver for my mother. 

Thankfully she has gotten better so I have been searching for a job for the last 2-3 months again but it seems no matter how many jobs I apply for almost no one reaches out for interviews. I have made it to third or fourth round interviews with 3 companies but they have all gone with more experienced hires at the end of the day and I am just losing hope. 

All I want to do is be able to help financially support my mom as she is a single mother and has given the world to her children, but it feels like every day that I dont find a job, the less likely that anyone will give me a chance. It has gotten to the point where I feel like I should ""exaggerate"" on my resume to add some form of work experience to just be noticed by companies because I have no previous experience.

I have fixed up my LinkedIn, redesigned my resume to be much more visually appealing, included important and relevant projects I have completed in college, as well as designing a website with links to some of these projects and am just not sure what I am doing wrong or could be doing differently. Maybe my job search has been too narrow but I am not sure what Finance jobs to apply to other than basic positions such as Financial Analyst because I dont really have much guidance.

My biggest regret was not getting internships or looking for work sooner during college, but I was going through so much personally, both physically and mentally, that I did not realize the importance of it until it was too late.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Does anyone have any advice? I just don't know where else to turn to so I am making this post. Thanks."

A bit of an overdue post since we've already had a couple events this semester (^(oops, sorry if you missed our ""Chungus ML Training"" talk by PhD Student Vijay Thakkar &amp; our ""Behind GT Supercomputers"" talk by Research Scientist Dr. Aaron Jezghani')).

**As a quick recap:** Supercomputing club @ GT (Suco@GT) is relatively new student organization under the College of Computing &amp; our mission is to create a casual community for students interested in high-performance computing (HPC)/supercomputing. A lot of our events are focused on **exposure** to GT resources, GT research, industry or national lab, and providing insight into HPC. We usually meet Wednesdays @ 6:30PM. 

See [our recent newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/1c95ec066209/supercomputing-gt-club-newsletter-13786397) for the compiled info of February Event updates. I've also written out summaries below on this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

    This week 2/8, we have a Sciences x Supercomputing Faculty Panel event. 

* Event Summary: Learn how research faculty at Georgia Tech apply high-performance computing to solve interesting and important problems in fields of bioinformatics, chemistry, and physics! 
* Date: Wed Feb 8th @ 6:30PM
* Location: Weber SST Classroom 1
* Ray's Pizza dinner provided **if you** [**RSVP on this form**](https://forms.office.com/r/B2hSTizMXN) **by today, Monday evening**. 
* **All students and faculty welcome!!**

&amp;#x200B;

    On 2/22, we're co-hosting an NVIDIA Tech Talk. All GT students welcome :)

**Register for the talk via:** [https://events.nvidia.com/gt22223](https://events.nvidia.com/gt22223) . 

* Event Summary: Come learn about NVIDIA's Math and Quantum Computing Libraries from Director of Engineering Harun Bayraktar. The talk will discuss the challenges of research, design, and development of high-performance numerical software that accelerate a broad range of applications in science, engineering, quantum computing, and AI.  
* Date: Wed Feb 22nd @ 6:00PM
* Location: VIRTUAL
* NVIDIA University Recruiting is hosting the event. In addition to the talk, the University Recruiting team will provide more information about NVIDIA, NVIDIA culture, and additional resources.

&amp;#x200B;

    Logistics. How do I stay in touch with Supercomputing club events? 

Here is our link tree! It has a lot of links to our platforms. [**https://linktr.ee/supercomputing.gt**](https://linktr.ee/supercomputing.gt) 

I'd recommend that you sign up on the Spring 23 Form to receive the email newsletters, and either refer to Discord or Instagram for weekly meeting updates.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic rundown:

* The **Spring 23 Form** is a ""lite"" member application, we use the info to plug you on our MailChimp. We send regular **newsletter emails via MailChimp**.
* For more instantaneous club announcements and communication, we host a **Discord server**. 
* We also release weekly **Instagram** posts/stories for club meeting announcements.
* We try to update our **Google Calendar** so that you can integrate it into your own calendar. 
* **HPC Internship Opportunities List on Github**. We've compiled a list of over 100+ opportunities in the high-performance computing (HPC) space. 

&amp;#x200B;

    That's all. Hope to see you at future meetings!"

I see this every time I open it and I took it to Apple in November just for them to tell me I ""broke"" the storage system in the computer and it will cost around $400 to fix. This laptop has not been dropped, hit, or scratched since I first fixed it, so I can't really believe that I broke the storage. I have no money to fix this right now, and I am doing internship work this summer as a CS intern, so I feel like this needs to be fixed before then.

I can turn it on and use it completely fine, but it takes me about 20 minutes to turn it on, and I can't stand it.

What else can I do besides cold applying 200+ times and attending upcoming career fairs?

If I manage to land a single interview but no internship at the end of it, that's still a win to me. "

Last year I got my first internship as a AX/D365 developer (x++) and after 2 months I got employed at the same company. I've been working for 6 months now and I am not fully satisfied because there isn't much coding and also feel like I am not upgrading my developer skills. The salary is good and the company pays for us to take Microsoft certifications exams which could be useful (?). I live on the Balkans and would like to have options to work abroad in the future. I am afraid if I stay at this job I will have hard time getting jobs in the future because it is very specialized.

Should I stay in this job or try to find an internship as a .NET developer as I am still early in my career?"

I have been applying to SWE jobs since but no luck. It's been very hard lately as the one-year ""deadline"" is coming and I haven't gotten close to an offer. My parents want me to pursue masters in spring 2024 if I don't get anything by summer. I'm content with their request as I planned to eventually do CS masters but problem is that I have no internships, no research papers, and no relevant work experience (yes, very stupid of me). I'm afraid that this plus the unemployment gap will heavily affect my application to grad school. What can I do to accommodate for my shortcomings? Would greatly appreciate any advice."

I’m a new therapist (intern) and some mornings i feel so shaky, sick to my stomach. i can definitely relate it to certain things such as a specific client I feel unqualified to see due to her being my very first client, or struggling with imposter syndrome. I imagine this is a common struggle (or maybe I’m just wigging out). i can end a day feeling so good, so confident, but the next morning I want to cancel all my clients. I do not have a therapist, money is tight, i have supports, a supervisor, and having coping skills like working out and church. Any advice would be great!"

As the title suggest, I'm looking at learning how to actually make use of C/C++. Not the languages themselves, but how to do things with them. 

I'm an engineering student, about to finish my degree in Information technology and I have a decent amount of programming experience in general. I have been interning for the past year, maintaining some C code and I have picked up a lot. C++ is a fairly new language, but I did try the W3Schools quiz and finished it without any problems (I'm aware the quiz doesn't cover everything). 

What I don't understand is, how do you actually use these languages to build applications? I've tried to comb through the architecture at my internship place, but it's layers upon layers of advanced C code and it won't get me anywhere. How do I get to a stage where I can even begin to understand this? Is this even about engineering or is it about design?

Thanks"
10vo84z,10,2023-02-06,Which internship should I accept?,Luketium,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/10vo84z/which_internship_should_i_accept/,"So, I am having a little bit of a dilemma and would like some advice/perspective. I know this is a decision that comes down to myself, but the ideas of others may help me a bit. I am a chemical engineering junior, and this will be my only internship.

I've recently received two offers.

Offer A) - in the industry I aspire to work in after graduation, or at least long-term. The company is mid sized, and I enjoyed my interactions with the engineers. I am more passionate about this position, but the pay is surprisingly low.

Offer B)  - not an industry I'd accept an offer for after graduating. The pay is insanely high almost 2.5x as much as Offer A. It is a very highly regarded company in terms of name-recognition. It will likely be more stressful.

As this is my only internship, I worry that picking Offer A will give me less strength in my career search next year even though it is in my preferred industry. I know in Offer B I will not be as happy, but it is only 3 months and the pay return would eliminate my need for loans next year. The name is a powerful one on my resume.

Any advice? Would you suck it up for 3 months or go with your passion?"

Could you please put down some Reddit magic answers to my questions. 
1) Are there any recruiting firms who hire for intern positions in IT?
2) What are the best strategies to apply and secure a Co-op?
3) What are the chances of international students securing a full time job in their desired field? And how long is it after you complete your grad.

Here are my stats/demographics currently: 

Race: Mixed (Asian/White) 

State: NY GPA: 3.7/4 

Major: Computer Science 

SAT: 1460 (idk if it's enough) 

I also only took 15 credits this semester, idk if this is enough for an acceptance. (it's barely above the bare minimum i'm pretty sure)
HS Stats: Not too good!

ECS: I really don't have many since I was very involved with getting a decent gpa and sat score, but I had an internship over the summer at Brookhaven National Laboratories. My HS ECs we're pretty average, if you're interested i'll tell you.
I also want to mention I have a first cousin that went here, though idk if I'll mention that in my application.

Thanks!"

I am currently a junior and once again sending out my applications for summer internships and the wave of imposter syndrome is flowing over me. I get good grades, I understand the concepts, yet every time I get ready to send off an application I have that feeling it’s gonna get rejected. I look online to see what others are saying and feel I am always too late to do it and there will be no more spots for me. I do leetcode all the time yet still feel inadequate to my competition. As the semester gets closer and closer to the end with nothing for the future secured it is a cycle of feeling left behind and not being able to climb out that I’m sure so many are feeling right now. Just wanted to see if there are any words of advice, or at least reach out to someone feeling the same to let you know you’re definitely not alone."

At that point, I will have the trifecta, two internships at the same MSP, and will be 2 classes away from my bachelors.   


What should I do to go about maximizing my chances at that point/successfully interviewing and resume building?

I am already an admitted student into NUS with a double major in CS with stats. However, Ill only be joining in 2024. I am just looking for advice from seniors who have taken the same route as the one above.

1. Should I stick with this DMP or apply to CS and Math DMP instead?
2. Should I apply to CS and Applied Math DDP instead? or should I do so after 1st year.
3. Would this DMP open more internship opportunities, career prospects for me? (given that I actually put in effort)
4. will I still have enough credits to do a minor
5. After Y1, will I have the choice to upgrade to a double degree?

\^\^ these are the ins I have for nowww

I look forward to your replies!"

More info below.,LostNConfusedHelp3,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10vu6nh/smaller_lesserknown_company_with_more_aiml/,"I’ve been lucky to get two offers. A smaller company which I liked the team and project of more, working on ML/AI modeling which is something I would like to explore as a career path. Or the larger company where I have no idea what team or project i’ll be working on, but the name is pretty well known. I’m a Sophomore so I have one more summer of internships following this one so I’m not going sure what to do. Pay wise I don’t mind to much although the bigger company pays slightly more, but I’d value my experience over pay atp in my career. I’d like to explore AI/ML and doing this in the financial/economic sector is appealing as I’m minoring/double majoring in Economics, so I’m leaning towards the smaller company, but power of the reputation of the other company is far greater in the finance sector albeit with no AI projects for me.

Smaller Company
- 2-3hr commute total depending on traffic (but traffic is typically bad during the rush hours)
- Better experience and exposure

Bigger Company
- At most 2 hr commute total 
- Less experience, Worse Project

I'm an international applicant to both NYU and Columbia MS in Data Science for Fall 2023. These schools generally don't give any application fee waivers to intl' students. However I got my fee waived by both of these programs based on a request I made by submitting my internship documents and talking about my financial problems.

Now to be clear, I'm not writing this post to look down upon other applicants or give them anxiety. I just wish to know if getting a waiver as an intl' applicant is a good sign?

Do you think that having ML knowledge is super important to land a job as a data analyst ? I am currently pursuing a masters course in business analytics. 

If not then I can drop this course and take up an easy  elective such as managerial decision making that uses excel (solver, linear programming, simulation models). Taking the excel course will free up some time for me to devote to my internship search and udemy courses on tableau"

Hi people of singapore reddit!! I will be graduating from poly soon but sadly my cgpa won’t be sufficient to enter the top 3 (SMU, NTU , NUS), and perhaps only low chance of SUSS or SIT (in my pov).

For some background info, I am currently studying cybersecurity, with a decent portfolio. 

I know my portfolio isn’t as great as compared to others. Will share abit:
1) I have a leadership position (participate in events such as open house &amp; orientation programmes, etc)
2) volunteered few times (in which one of it i was one of the 5 in charge of the whole volunteering).
3) I manage to score an A in my final year industry project that involves lots of coding. Some things that i have done would be to design &amp; implement a cryptography infrastructure in a system that i have created and being the leader, I was in charge of managing the project progress etc.
4) I have also took up the google certificate in data analytics that my school offered

My cgpa was ok (cgpa 3.37) initially…However, something happened to me that took a bad toll on my mental health in my year 2 semester 2 &amp; I lost all focus for a whole good sem…which eventually took a bad toll on my cgpa..dropping to only 2.95. Didn’t manage to fully recover (&amp; the dip in gpa took a toll on me even further) but in the end i decided i should do whatever I can and only manage to pull it back to 2.98 sadly…

I am considering the various routes I can take, with I hope eventually ends with a degree.

1) Private university. I have considered SIM UoW or UoL to continue in the cybersecurity sector. However I am hesitant about this option as there were many that said private university graduates have difficulty finding jobs. If i were to eventually choose this option, my plan would be to take up as many internships position as possible throughout my studies in there to give me a better chance of securing a job once i graduate.  

2) Specialist Diploma in devops. As my programming is decently strong (scoring mainly A’s with 1 distinction), I am considering if i should switch. The specialist diploma would take a year to complete (full time work, part time  study), gain some work experience before trying to apply for a university in software engineering.

With that say, i am also currently in a dilema in 2 areas; whether 
(1) i should continue taking up cybersecurity or 
(2) should i change my career path to something that’s more heavily on programming; therefore the specialist diploma

I am unsure if i should just switch, though both fields are still in IT. It took me some effort to enter my diploma.
1. Didn’t score well enough to enter through DPP
2. Failed EAE 2nd round
3. Didn’t do well for O’s so decided to enter the common ICT before choosing cybersecurity

However after 3 years, I am unsure if i should continue in cybersecurity…as i find that if i was good, I would not have any worries about applying/entering university or pursue something where programming is more heavy on, which is one of my stronger areas though I understand there will be a lot more programming language that I have to learn.

Would appreciate any advice, especially if you have taken up specialist diploma or are currently pursuing a master in a private uni :’) !!!

those that are in the fields i have mention, isit possible to share more about what you guys are doing :D !!

thank you in advance!!"

Internships:

**AMD -** I have a software engineering internship offer at AMD where I'll be working with FPGAs and low level C-code.

**Fintech Firm -** I also have an offer to work at a smaller fintech firm that creates software for hedge funds and ultra high net-worth individuals. The fintech firm has less name recognition, however, the company does have 3 global offices and the smaller firm means that I'd have a more significant impact and be only 1 of 4 interns so the learning opportunity is greater.

**Things to consider:**

I'm experienced with C++ (computer engineering major), so whilst the AMD role could strengthen this, working at a fintech firm would force me to learn Java and the entire JVM.

My goals are to get a fintech or quant junior internship so which internship would best prepare me for this? Also my eventual goals are to start my own company in my home country. The fintech firm has a head office in my home country, so I'd be able to make connections with other employees, my bosses and the firm's clients (hedge funds, UHNW people) which could be helpful in this endeavour. However, I still believe AMD has a strong brand name but I'm not sure if that's relevant to finance firms. What's the best internship for my situation?"

During this time since Grad School, I applied to almost 1000 jobs on LinkedIN &amp; Indeed, and of those jobs I got to the final rounds of interviews with 2 of them and was not chosen in the end because of my lack of professional experience. This was a huge blow to my confidence and I was really ready to give up on life so many times during this application process. 

To give some more background, I was Class of 2020 for undergrad (BS in Marketing) and instead of getting a job since there were not many options due to the pandemic, I chose to go straight into Grad School. During my two years in Grad School I still could not get a full time job because I was full time in school and no employers wanted to hire me unless I were to cut down my hours in school. I did however manage to get a paid 4 months internship, but unfortunately no offer for a full time position. 

But overall, this subreddit helped me so much with any questions that I had, and thanks to r/Resume I was able to get amazing advice on my resume &amp; this helped me land my first full time job with salary and benefits. 

My whole process for this job was 6 weeks long, it started with 100 applicants, 3 different interviews, and they made me provide 5 references.

Graduating with my BS in Social Policy at 26, not sure what’s next for me but I’m beyond ready. I’ll be graduating from a top 10 undergraduate university with a strong social policy program (also referred to as pubic policy). I want to jump STRAIGHT into the workforce once I graduate.

I had a unique undergrad path that probably makes employers question what went on during this time. Came in as a full scholarship student athlete, always assumed I got help on admissions and wasn’t “smart enough” to be at my uni, and my family certainly wasn’t wealth enough lol. Major imposter syndrome. Completed my first 3 years, then beginning of senior year I took medical leave due to medical and mental health problems plus some intimidation by my peers’ having already arranged very impressive post-grad plans while i felt I had no prospects or sense of direction. My GPA definitely suffered from all this. Once on medical leave, I sought treatment, worked several restaurant jobs and cleaning jobs, took care of dying and disabled family members, and was a customer service rep (hourly job but $44,500 annual pay per-tax and not including overtime). I have also worked as an research intern and project management intern with a youth/education non-profit during my junior year which was several years ago now.

Eventually came back 3 and a half years later, got a 4.0 first term back, placing me on the Deans List. Proved to myself my mental health is solid and I deserve to be here. I do worry that despite my change in trajectory, i have limited my career options due to my unique path. Many peers from my graduating class are already established professionals. I am getting the Sunday Scaries but the life &amp; career-version. I know I bring a lot to the table, maybe not as much as other candidates on paper, but I like to think im an excellent person to work with and be around.

What im looking for (I think):
- a mix of collaborative and autonomous work
- can see the fruits of my labor and help people in some capacity
- make more money than I did at my CS job (graduates from my school w/ my major make $60-80k within a year of graduation)
- solid vacation time so I can take snowboarding trips which I’ve never been able to afford before 
- interested in non-profits(?)
- interested education world (not teaching, maybe administration?)
- considering grad school but low overall GPA :/
- maybe something in the snowboarding/ski world? 
- maybe philanthropy in the gaming world?
- fundraising for various political causes or philanthropic funds?

I’ve met with the litany of career and academic advisors that my school has to offer, but I really have no clue what I want to be doing. I’ve been applying for policy consultant, policy assistant, legislative aide, project management, legal assistant, executive assistant, community outreach, financial advisor, etc etc etc. just based off what I think I would be good at and am possibly qualified for. Unfortunately, due to poor health in the past I have limited experience. I’m healthy now and ready to start my professional life. Maybe gaps in my resume are the reason I’m not getting interviews, maybe it’s the labor market, who knows. Hoping to find something by June bc my family is low income and would like to support them and myself. I know the job market isn’t great even for college grads right now.

Thanks everyone, hope someone has some advice for me. Cheers :)"

I’m in my final semester of my counseling program - currently in my internship. I love my internship and this program a lot!! At the beginning of the program, I felt relieved that I would be able to embark on a new journey and be able to pursue what I’ve been wanting to do my whole life. 

But…in this final semester and being in internship, I can’t help but feel completely scared and unsure of what I’m going to do or what’s going to happen. I hope to stay at my internship site, it seems like they want to hold onto me and hire me but I am so bent out of shape that I won’t have any benefits. I’m single and am hoping to move out this year, too so I’m worried about finding a new place and being able to afford it. As most of you know, clients can be pretty flaky and as a pay for service job, I would be nervous I couldn’t make ends meet. 
I’ve considered community based mental health but there aren’t any good centers near where I live. I’m currently working full time while I’m in my internship and have pretty much accepted that I’ll probably have to stay at my full time job and work at my internship site in the evenings still so I can have stable pay and health insurance. And then I get stressed because then it’ll take even longer to get my hours to become licensed. 

I don’t want to work two jobs. But I guess I’m going to have to and the grind is going to have to continue until I meet someone. I just feel so hopeless and bummed out and thought I would be set after graduation but it just feels like it’s just gonna be even more of overworking myself. I just wanted to have one job after graduating. I love to work hard but not to this point of ultimate exhaustion. 

If anyone has any ideas or thoughts, I would appreciate it so much. Thank you ❤️"

Big Company: Has 20+ years of experience, is the biggest on my country on this specific subject, pays a little bit (not much but after 4 months i should accumulate around 1k euros), has some protocols for interns, it's a decent choice because i'll learn to work on a big company environment and that experience is good

Small Company: 5 years of experience with maybe a dozen people on the job,does not pay me but lets me start my own project, in this case they want to start a project for implementing some safety on businesses that are either considered small or medium, now the phishy part is, that project was exactly my end of year project (got the highest grade (flex)) so to me they just want free labor to profit quite a bit and pretty much sell what i did for school to other companies, not like the big company, sure it's also almost free work but there won't be major profits especifically from whatever i do there, in this case we would only work on their Security Operations Center, Small company also offered to pay a few training courses on the National Cybersecurity Center (i think each one is valued at around 1k)

So yeah i'm torn, sure it's cool to create my own project but would just feel like a whore tbh.

10w7wk3,3,2023-02-07,Should I transfer schools?,Amristars,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/10w7wk3/should_i_transfer_schools/,"I've been thinking about this a lot, so any thoughts would be really appreciated!


Right now, I'm a second semester freshman at a well-rated school that is top 20 in my major (CS). So far, it hasn't been too bad.  My roommate is nice, my classes and professors are all pretty good, and I've gotten decent grades so far. There are lots of clubs and events on campus and good opportunities for networking.


I am also on a club sports team that I love. I enjoy playing and my teammates are some of the nicest people I've ever met. Even though it is hard on my body as a very unathletic person, it's easily the best part of my week and a big thing keeping me from transferring.


There are some problems though. One thing is that this college is very expensive. I have a decent scholarship, but even if I graduate in 3 years (my current plan), get a job every semester from here on, and get an internship every summer until I graduate, I will likely still be in debt. I feel like everything is going too fast and I don't have the time to think about where I want to go in the future and what I really want to do.  It also doesn't give me much time to make friends, since I haven't so far (I love my teammates, but we don't hang out outside of practice).


I also am very homesick. My current college is 16 hours away from my home, so I can't visit very often. My family is everything to me, so it's hard to be so far away (plus I miss my dog lol). Also, my sister has always had a lot of mental health issues, and it's been pretty bad this past year, so it's very difficult to be away when that's happening.


If I did transfer, it would be to the state school in my hometown. It's not bad but definitely not as highly rated as my current school, and from what I can tell there are less events and things on campus. I do like the location better and it has better mental health resources. I would also be able to do a lot more with a car. Since I'm able to graduate from my current school in 3 years, I'm hoping I would be able to graduate at the new school in the regular 4. I would be living at home, so even if I didn't receive any financial aid, it would still be much cheaper, and I would have an extra year to get it paid off. Plus, I would have more time to explore my interests, make new friends, etc. It's also the school my sister goes to, so we could help support each other.


It's hard to imagine leaving my team behind, not to mention having to completely start over in a new place, but I also don't want to feel lonely and stressed the next couple of years. I don't regret coming here, I've grown a lot and I think it was the right start to my college experience, I just don't know if it's right for the rest of my time. I wish I had more of a gut feeling, but I'm very torn."

Last summer I interned as a software dev for a very large defense contractor in the US and absolutely hated it. I did not feel like I belonged within the company and I was not assigned tasks that fit my skill set (I was given a project that would have been great for someone looking to go into business analytics, not so much someone who has been programming for years). However, I did the work, and I got a return internship offer for $27/hr. The company has explicitly told me that they’re desperate to get new hires since most people don’t want to work for their uncompetitive wages, which definitely sounds like a red flag to me. 
As the summer approaches, it’s looking like returning to this company will be my only choice of work. I was really hoping that I would have other choices, but for context I have received about 20 rejection emails this week alone. Should I suck it up and go back to the company? I am afraid that since this is my last summer before I graduate I will get stuck working there full time.

I feel like I like programming decently, but I am considering other IT directions as well, and at the same time entirely different directions as well. As I'm not sure how much I'd be able to stomach doing it 9 to 5... but I don't know if I could stomach doing anything 9 to 5, or how much more I would stomach one thing over the other, and at least with IT, I'd have a better chance of finding part-time work in that. It would be stable enough so I could do another job on the side, let's say. I have a few years of delay behind me along with multiple gap years. At one point I dropped out of a CS degree when I was 19, and it's pretty unbelievable it's already been that long. Part of me really wishes I had stuck with it, I'd at least have a degree now. The regret blows. I did learn a lot in those gap years, but career-wise, things hardly budged. And it really needs to improve.

Then, gap years ensued, I finally decided to do this, with a lot of fear about job security behind it. I actually like working on code with people in teams, alone I'm finding it a bit harder. But I just see so many options that it's ridiculous. Analysis paralysis, analysis paralysis, option paralysis. I want to really dig and dig the coming few months to figure out if there isn't something that 1) really suits me and 2) has enough job security and pay for me to take on. And who knows, maybe I end up deciding that IT indeed is fine, or that I'll choose a different direction within IT. Or maybe... something entirely different. I'm also trying to think of ways to actually experience said jobs a bit, but it's hard to do so, you can't really go by descriptions and what you imagine it to be like.

I've always had lots of creative interests and can be very analytical, as well as outgoing, and I like to work with people. I've considered something in art, architecture, sales, graphic design, some other IT things, I don't know how many of you subscribe to MBTI, but my MBTI type is ENTP and they are known to struggle very much with finding a career, as has been my experience in the past years, frustratingly. I'll be turning 26 in some months, will likely just have an associate's degree by next year, and would really like to turn this situation around. The pressure really sucks. I have yet to get tested for potential ADHD, too, but even outside that, I really want to figure this out. Maybe I'm just FOMO'ing and few jobs would fit me anyway, or maybe that's the wrong way to think about it, or maybe I was right to place job security so highly on the list of priorities, or... Yeah. There's a fire that needs dousing. So, what to do next..."

But I have not been promoted at all for the last 5 years as I am slow at coding and my manager tells me that I lack technical prowess to receive a promotion. Even interns with less than a year of experience perform better than me.

I like the problem solving aspect of coding but I think searching solutions and understanding them is difficult for me. I oftentimes fail to see the whole picture and understand things in depth. I have received years of coaching/mentoring from senior developers but I find myself to be a slow learner still after 5+ years.

I am someone who values growth and as much as I like the problem solving aspect of my job, I can’t see any growth in my career if I stay as a software developer.

Should I pivot to another career in tech?"

Miami is an expensive place to live and if I find an internship, it'll either not be paid or not be paid very much I would assume so the option of moving closer isn't good for me right now. My university has advisors and resources provided to help find an internship but has anybody had experience with finding one outside of your school? What would be the best resources to look into?"
10wdivo,2,2023-02-07,Feel Qualified but Scared of Rejection -- How / Where to Include Self Study,schulingkamp,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/10wdivo/feel_qualified_but_scared_of_rejection_how_where/,"First, a quick overview of my background: I graduated with majors in Finance and Japanese from Penn State, and had a 3.86 GPA. Like many others, I decided to take advantage of the pandemic to make a career shift, and landed a developer position after self-studying. I have a little over a year of professional experience using Python and Java.

As I was filling out the application, I started to feel really bad about my chances. My answers to the following questions were all ""none.""

\- Describe your **CS-related** academic experience.

\- List any **CS-related** minors (or equivalent ACADEMIC certificates) earned with your academic degree. Enter ""None"" if none.

\- If you have a non-CS/Computer Eng./Electrical Eng. Degree, list ALL (both undergrad &amp; grad, if applicable) CS course titles that you took for **ACADEMIC** credit.

\- Describe your **CS-related** internships, if any.

My plan was to initially explain my situation in the statement of purpose, and to list all of the online courses I went through. Unfortunately, the SOP is now gone, and I recently just found out that one should ""NOT list non-graded, non-academic-credit MOOC-type coursework."" As it turns out, this is where all of my ""qualifications"" come from. For example, I would say my grasp on data structures and algorithms is quite solid. I've gone through the MIT OCW lectures twice, the Stony Brook lectures once, and have completed 350 unique LeetCode questions, most multiple times. I've also read textbooks on other topics.

Other than my high GPA and AWS Certified Developer certification, I feel like having four unanswered prompts in a row makes my application seem like a joke. On the contrary, I am quite serious, and for personal reasons really want to be admitted this fall.

Is there anything I can do about this? Should I just defy the guidelines and list all of the studying I have done under CS-related academic experience? Where can I include the fact that I've practiced LeetCode? I also plan to study full-time, and think including that fact might help my admission chances as it makes me more likely to succeed, at least in theory. Where can I include that?

Thanks for reading and in advance for any comments."

I have  3.28, which I thought was okay at best but I didn’t think it would limit my opportunities so much.

Do I apply to these companies anyways or would I just be wasting my time?"
10we9t6,1,2023-02-07,(Urgent) What internship choice do I choose?,throwawayy2039400,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10we9t6/urgent_what_internship_choice_do_i_choose/,"Hi all,

Throwaway to avoid identification. I need advice on what internship to pursue for my junior year internship. Long term goal is to be a PM in FinTech (ok with taking up to a decade to break into FinTech but would like to break into PM within 3ish years). I come from a finance/business undergrad so I believe building a technical foundation is key to diversify my resume.

Things that are important to me: securing a return offer, compensation and more or less work life balance.

1) PwC — Cloud/Tech Consulting Intern (would have to renege)

2) Walmart — Product Manager Intern

3) AWS — Solutions Architect Intern (leaning towards this but worried I might get stuck in the cloud industry)

So far I’ve been considering reneging PwC and then pursuing AWS since 1) I already have experience founding two companies which I believe may help me switch into PM at a later date and 2) the roles are similar at AWS and PwC but I think AWS will open more doors for me. I’m not sure if my assessment is accurate so any guidance is appreciated!"

10wejah,6,2023-02-07,Just got asked my salary expectations for a summer internship - Input and experience wanted,Hardrive33,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/10wejah/just_got_asked_my_salary_expectations_for_a/,"I just got asked what would my salary expectations be for a summer internship placement. I don't have much of a clue what to say. I am a second year comp sci, with good grades and a few interviews for various places. (Usually I'd assume all students are at the same salary?)

If anyone has done a summer internship / hired for one, could you let me know what the going rate is below please?

I know a quite similar role in a different company is at 25k annually, working out to be 14.80 euro an hour with a 35 hour week. 

Thanks for any help!"

Well it does have some advantages like it’s flexible, pays better than my previous job, not that physically demanding and I can focus better on university but I’ve been applying for 6 months now to get a better good paying part time job but I’m still disappointed. I feel like a failure and I don’t feel good enough at all because most people I know in university have better good paying part time jobs and are probably doing paid internship but it’s hard for me to have that because no matter how much I apply, I just never get accepted"

I was only able to get one offer for this summer as a software testing intern and I am wondering if it is worth it to accept. It is at a very large company but I have read about QA engineers being ""pigeonholed"" into testing positions on this sub and I am worried about that happening to me. My career goal is software development so would this internship be a good networking opportunity and stepping stone into a dev position junior year or would this negatively impact my resume and make it harder to land a dev internship in the future? If I did accept this position, could I try to speak to  developers and managers about potentially working as a dev intern for the next summer? 

My other option would be to take summer classes and work on personal projects."

As the title states I had my first job offer rescinded and am now back out looking for another position. I should have kept applying after hearing the ok from my recruiter back in November but I put all my eggs in one basket which turned out to be a major mistake. 

Attached [here](https://i.imgur.com/dAb61bx.jpg) is my anon resume. I am open to where I went to school however everything else is anonymous. I struggled to find an internship and my only experience as shown is at a small company and as a college tutor. 

As a U.S. citizen I am open to relocate and work remote for any time zone and any location in the U.S. I value experience and am willing to take on contracts or work for a starting pay of min: &gt; $60k/year

I need advice from my peers in this subreddit on how to approach this awful market and come out on top. Here are some things I am doing and have done at this moment:

* Apply to 25 job postings a day preferably fresh ones on Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter
* Apply to entry level full stack roles, devops roles, QA roles that fit my tech stack
* Work on future projects and learn new languages (Trying to build a backend in GoLang for my first project atm)
* Neetcode 150 in python (completed)
* Blind 75 in Java (completed)
* General DSA preparedness for every major Data Structure

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I understand the job market is bad for entry level people yet I still am happy I am able to potentially work everyday doing something I love. If you are a senior/mid level or even a fellow graduate of 2022 and have any advice I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank You,

10whx04,0,2023-02-07,Need help choosing a tech stack for remote work,CollapsingPulsar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10whx04/need_help_choosing_a_tech_stack_for_remote_work/," 

Background

Recently  graduated and I have 1 year internship experience and 5 months SDE work  experience, all of which was done during studies. During the internship  I did mostly LAMP stack development while work experience was in MERN.  The problem stems from the fact that I'm not exceptionally good at  either one. I can do both decently but that's about it. I have always  been the ""idea"" type wherein if something interests me, I'll learn the  tools to build it. However, a mentor mentioned to me that if I wanted a  remote job at my stage I'd need to be really good at a particular stack  and perhaps even have one or two things at a production level which  would be a major plus. Additionally liking my tools would also help in a  job hunt so I don't end up not liking my job if it focuses on one  thing.

Where I am now

I  have two MERN based projects, one of which is nearly complete and needs  tweaking to make it more production ready while the other still has a  lot of work to be done. On the other hand I have one LAMP stack that is  pretty much done and can be deployed alongside an app done in React  Native. But.... I'm not sure how to proceed as I spread myself out.

Should  I rebuild all projects in one particular stack and sell myself based on  that? I have no qualms with it but I do want to at least be application  ready in 3-5 months. On top of that I did have a bit of design  oversight for the MERN projects using Mongo instead of an Sql database  since Mongo was just a nice thing I wanted rather than what was more  appropriate for the data these apps handle.

So between LAMP and MERN in addition to the market's state and being able to get a remote job quickly, what should I do?"

So I’m feeling down in the dumps. I have been working at this place now for five years almost. I started off as an intern, then got offered a job, but I have not been promoted since.  I have been promised a promotion since last summer, and I just got an exceptional performance evaluation, but my boss said I would need to wait another 6 months for my promotion. 

It’s upsetting because I just finished migrating our a giant old work system for a new one and have automated important work processes. In addition, I’m always training senior employees.

It’s sucks, I was tense and quiet during my performance evaluation and my boss caught on to it…. I just was devastated. 

Anyhow, do you guys think it’s worth to wait or just move on? What would you do? I just feel so sad."

I got my first result and got admitted for MSCS Columbia. They want to hear back in 2 weeks which is unfortunate since I don’t think any of my other decisions would be out by then. Still grateful though! Big relief. 

I haven’t seen any posts about MSCS Columbia admit. Has anyone else gotten in?

Here are my stats:
GRE 335 v168 q167
GPA 3.8

- Some research experience - 2 conference papers + various posters (not very big conferences)

- 1 lab internship that didn’t really go anywhere 

- 2 see internships - one industry, one more research based (that continued co-op into the school year)

- TA for a couple years

- Various coding/modeling/business presentation competitions

No idea if I’m going to go because the financials look rather dire. Is the program worth it? I’ve heard differing opinions.

Has anyone gotten an extension or deferred?

Good luck everyone! I hope everyone gets into their programs."

10wllex,7,2023-02-07,Job Shadowing - Worth it?,Critical_Guidance_70,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/10wllex/job_shadowing_worth_it/,"I'm currently an undergrad CS major without prior internship experience, and I've recently landed the opportunity to shadow a software developer at a tech company for a few hours.   


I want to make the most out of this opportunity and I'm curious if it's appropriate to leverage it as a networking chance for potential future internships?  


Additionally, I have a list of local companies that offer job shadowing but many of them are not related to the tech industry. Is it worth checking them out anyways as perhaps maybe they need software/tech people?

Can anyone offer advice or insight on how to maximize the benefits of job shadowing and determine if it's worth pursuing these other opportunities? I'm definitely going to ask a lot of questions and learn about professional experience, but I'm curious about the networking/internship side of things  


Thank you"

I anticipated today would be a pivotal moment for one of my clients. We have been working on a project together since we started counseling during my practicum semester, and today the client finished the project. It was a perfect opportunity to process how the client has grown and changed in the last three months. I've recently noticed my client is meeting the goals we established during our intake, and I have reflected that to them. Toward the end of the session today, my client and I agreed that their counseling journey with me was complete. My client reported feeling better overall; I could sense that it was time to terminate. I will meet with this client next week for our termination session. 

I am beyond proud of my client and the growth I've seen. This is my first experience with a (soon-to-be) termination where it feels complete and wholesome. It's hard to be a beginning counselor. Although I don't doubt myself as much as I did during practicum, I still wonder how much I am actually helping my clients. Today's experience helped me see that I'm really doing something. *I can do this*. I tried to share this wonderful feeling with friends, but I am not sure they understand how big of a deal this is to me. 

I know not all my sessions will flow this nicely. I won't always get closure or a chance to process termination with clients. So, I'm going to cherish this first one a lot. 

I am curious to hear other perspectives on termination. Any ideas on how to make this final session impactful?"
10wm45p,1,2023-02-07,Life Advice,college-girl-22,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10wm45p/life_advice/,"Hi All

This is going to be long so I want to preface this by saying thank you to those who read it and who respond. I would also request no negative comments I honestly cant handle that rn. Thank you again!

Anyways I just got my B.S this past spring and I have no idea what I am doing. I got an incredible job in my field and I hated it, my boss was unkind and unwilling to teach and the commute was almost 2 hrs each way. I quit after a very sort period of time. Now I am lost. 

It feels like every week I have a new idea for a career from conservation to teaching to nursing. All noble careers and ones that I would be willing to put the work into. But I am so afraid of making the wrong choice again and ending up in a bad situation again. My anxiety is horrible about this, I wonder every day if I should get another job in the field of my degree, but when I look on the job boards the ones I see sound just as bad as the job I quit. 

I did have experience in my field as an intern while at college and I loved it but the dynamic was so different when I was at a job opposed to the internship. My internship advisor was so willing to teach and didnt make me feel anxious. My boss did neither of those things and now I feel as though I have no confidence. The thought of walking into a lab the way I feel now feels unbearable. I did follow my advisors advice and asked about the lab dynamic and about my boss's teaching style before I accepted the position, the answers I was given were rehearsed because what I was told did not match my experiences. 

I guess what I am looking for is if anyone has had a similar experience to lmk how they figured out what to do, or how to gain my confidence back? 

TLDR: I have no idea what I am doing for my career and I no longer have any confidence to do anything remotely important."

I'm a freshman. I came into university with no knowledge of programming, and I wasn't an exceptional student either. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness which made it hard for me to focus on school in the fall semester, so unfortunately I have to retake intro to computer science again (I have a placeholder grade so I did not fail the course) because I missed so many lectures towards the end of the semester due to a flare up of my illness.

I have made a rigorous schedule for myself where I am getting ahead of the other people in the class, and I tried planning it so that I can learn the entire course material a month before the lectures wrap up. 

The reason why I'm doing that is because I want to be able to learn data structures as fast as possible so I can have time to practice LeetCode and work on side projects/contributing to open source code before the recruitment cycle begins in August. While I still am taking data structures in the summer, I wanted to get ahead and teach that stuff myself for the reasons mentioned. I am desperate for an internship after my sophomore year, and I am so behind because I got my illness and I have to retake intro to CS. I need as much time as possible to work on projects and stuff so companies will even look in my direction, because I wasn't able to do extracurriculars in fall semester, so I really have nothing going for me right now. And I'm taking CS50 alongside retaking my intro to CS course.

Anyways, I am experiencing some hurdles right now, and I would appreciate some advice.

So far, none of the things we are learning are new to me. But, I wanted to take this course as if I'm a new student and learn the material properly.

But I am so stressed that I am not quite understanding the material well enough or giving myself enough time to actually process and learn the class material.

My professor assigns us textbook readings for every week of material. It's an intro to programming in Java textbook. Now, other upperclassmen at my school including my learning assistant for my recitation has told me they didn't really use the textbook and that they used videos from our official class website that are basically condensed versions of what the textbook is teaching. 

The thing is... I'm worried that I'm not learning EVERYTHING that I'm supposed to learn, so that's why I'm using only the book. The videos are pretty easy to understand, BUT the videos only teach according to our university's curriculum. And I heard bad things about my school's CS program, so that's why I'm worried about ONLY using the videos as my only source of learning. For example, we are not even expected to learn how to use switch statements, AND we are only tested on *reading* recursive code but not writing it. Isn't that stuff that CS majors and software engineers are supposed to know? 

The textbook practice problems mostly consist of asking me to use concepts from the section for math and science applications. There are *some* slightly easier ones which are probably 30% of the entire problem set for the section. I am ONLY able to do the slightly easier problems and \*maybe\* a few of the more creative exercises. 

And it's fucking stressing me out... because what if that means I don't even understand the material well enough??? But the thing is, THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT EVEN ASSIGNED. I am only doing it for extra practice. Our actual assignments consist of three programs (for one assignment) we are asked to write, and we get one assignment every 1 or two weeks, so in total for the entire class we have 24 programs as homework. I'm so worried that's not enough practice. There's practice problems for recitation that I do, but still, I am fucking worried I am not actually gonna be good enough of a programmer to stand out against the thousands of other CS majors who want the same things as me.

I'm able to get 100s on all of the assignments and do well on the exams. But  the actual assignments AND the recitation problems are not as hard as the textbook problems at all.

BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'm just worried that I'm worrying too much at the same time. The upperclassmen + my learning assistant both told me the textbook problems are way too hard and not too useful.

But fuck, I'm worried about not being able to use a loop to turn a decimal number into a binary number or write a program that uses Newton's method to find the square  root of a number or replicate Euclid's algorithm in a program. What if that shit is easy enough for me to figure out and me and all the upperclassmen who talked to me are just garbage at what we're doing?

I think my overall concern is that I'm not sure if my CS program is not rigorous enough or if I'm genuinely trying to teach myself too much and trying to achieve an unnecessary level of understanding for the topics I'm learning.

Can someone please offer me any advice? Thank you. I apologise for the unprofessional post."

**Essays**

* Why Us -- Talked about wanting to strengthen my Swahili skills with the on-campus professor, and take *Life in the Universe I: Development of Life on Earth* and *Philosophical Perspectives* so I can find other people who love the show *Ancient Aliens.* Talked about the Computational Analysis and Public Policy Dual Degree Program and how it's the only one in the country. Talked about how I wouldn't stare because of all freshmen being required to have unlimited meal swipes their first year

* Uncommon/UChi essay -- Submitted the wrong essay the first time lol. Don't worry if you do this, you can hit up your AO.

Answered: **In Homer’s Iliad, Helen had a “face that launched a thousand ships.” A millihelen, then, measures the beauty needed to launch one ship. The Sagan unit is used to denote any large quantity (in place of “billions and billions”). A New York Minute measures the period of time between a traffic light turning green and the cab behind you honking. Invent a new unit of measurement. How is it derived? How is it used? What are its equivalents?**

&gt;!BTW: I got accepted into UChicago ED1 as an Odyssey Scholar, just wanted to see how accurate this sub would be. Feel free to ask about whatever whether it's now or five years from now. I love to read essays and help! !&lt;

&gt;!My biggest advice for applications is it doesn't really matter what type of student you are (obviously to an extent) what maters most is your ablity to sell yourself. This vid was recently dropped (after I applied) with new common data sets that can give you a bit of insight into UChi's application process: !&lt;[Video](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRGV3n6P/)

I'm a freshman majoring in CS with a pretty good GPA. I'm mainly interested in cybersecurity and want to get an internship in that, however, I don't have any prior experience with security and only have done front-end dev projects and python projects, so I'm pretty open to anything tbh. 

I applied to 3 internships last week because I was pretty scared of not being good enough for any. I got one of my rejections today as I was not eligible or something.

I just wanted to know if it's even worth my time to apply for an internship as a freshman or if should I just focus on building more skills in the field of CS I want to ideally work in."

Started grinding in 2020.

Did around 1k leetcode and 1k codeforces, am \~1900 rated.

Internship is approximately $120/hr, high return offer rate. New grad offer is about $450k first year, $300+ recurring.

Feels like all that time spent was finally worth it. Planning to coast for the rest of undergrad and hopefully pay my folks back for tuition.

edit: had some referrals and previous faang internship experience

edit 2: yes, this was a dev/swe role and I'm a CS major.

the leetcode questions ranged heavily in difficulty. Overall, they range from simple common mediums to maybe 1800 level codeforces questions (rare). Seemed like there was an emphasis on streaming algorithms and data structures, as well as DP strangely.

across all of my interviews, the biggest topics besides leetcode questions were C++, linux, OS, computer architecture, and to a lesser extent networks. These questions were mostly just knowledge-based. I crammed for these topics a lot in the past few months. I'd recommend doing your leetcode practice in C++ to at least get used to the syntax for the interviews. If you can, do your class projects in C++ as well.

I feel like interviewers were somewhat impressed when I brought up lower-level implications of the code I was writing: things like being aware of cache coherence, avoiding branches, and rewriting loops to take advantage of things like vectorization."

I am a student in Kazakhstan doing BSc in Computer Science and additionally doing a python developer course. I wanted to move to the EU for a long stay and potentially get citizenship.

I only speak English and Russian but I am willing to learn a new language depending on the country I am moving to. I do not have work experience but I am planning to get one in the summer(web dev, python-dev, or internship). I do not have friends in the EU, only one relative in Germany.

I prefer warm or hot climates but I can deal with UK-like the weather.

My parents can support me financially but only for one year when I move out.

I would like to receive some advice on which country is the best to move to with a strong IT industry.

I do not want to move out now but I want to start planning now and move out in around 3-4 years."

And the stressful environment of dealing with agitated people who are in pain or dealing with loss or even stressed colleagues is draining me so much.
The thing is, med school was the wrong choice from the beginning. It was never for me, I was never passionate about it, but I kept going on out of fear of change or dropping out. 
Now my intolerance has grown much more than my fear, I want to change my life, I want to get out at any cost. I've already lost so much pursuing something I dread. 
However, I have no idea where to start and how to navigate it. I desperately need some advice because as much as my heart begs me to be reckless, end it all and then deal with the outcome, I don't want my emotions to cloud my reason and get the best of me.

Tech is or was doing layoffs which cut job security. 

Consulting hires are benched which means even if they make it a year exit opps might suck. 

IB deal flow is low and bonuses are generally trash right now. Jobs could be hit unless flow picks up.

If someone had an offer to join any of these three fulltime this summer, which do y'all think would be safer for longterm career? Agnostic of their career goals.

My vote is either tech or banking. In tech you will at least get some work experience as a PM or whatever on a legit project since you don't rely on external clients. If you get laid off you leave with experience. In banking, there are hard skills related to finance that probably carry over well to corp fi or something. In consulting, if you don't get staffed, you get screwed upon forced exit. What do y'all think?

Recently I saw someone post asking about a mentor. I'm looking for the same, or at the very least someone who can help validate or improve my plan for the next \~6 months.

A bit of context: I'm a lead Data Scientist at a startup. When I joined, I was an intern and we were 3 people. I grew quickly into the role and became the lead, managing a team of 6 in a company of 35 people.

While my title is Lead Data Scientist, we do a lot of data cleaning &amp; data validation, build ETL pipelines...our tool stack consists predominantly of python, django, pandas, airflow, GCP. We do statistical analysis but no machine learning, very little predictive algorightms...

I actually feel more like an Analytics Engineer/borderline Data Engineer depsite my title. However, I still have a lot to learn. For example, we use pandas far more than SQL (so I have basic sql querying experience but can improve), and I've never used Spark or Hadoop...

I've loved the company and helping it grow, but we're based in Paris, France, and believe it or not I miss a lot about America (I'm originally from California). So a while ago I discussed with our CTO and have let them know that I'll no longer work for them starting April 2022, so I can focus on moving my family to the states.

I'd like to transition into a role as a full-fledged Data Engineer, as I think it's very interesting and has the best future. I plan on moving to the states by January 2024 at the latest.

So essentially from April - December 2023 I'm saved enough to be able to focus on personal projects and developing data engineering skills in addition to networking and applying to places later in the year.

If someone could mentor me, I would love to chat! If not, here's my plan for these months:

* Do the entire DataEngineeringClup Zoomcamp 2023 (despite not being able to start with the rest of the students this past January)
* Reading: Fundamentals of Data Engineering- Housley and Reis, Designing Data Intensive Applications - Kleppmann, Data Warehouse Toolkit - Kimball
* Maybe giving Data Engineering with Python a go?

&amp;#x200B;

This is a huge personal project that'll change my life as well as my family's. I wanna set us up as nicely as possible, so I'm taking a shot in the dark here and asking for any help I can get! **If you read to here, thank you**

When I got a 1600 on the SAT my junior year of high school, I was in shock because I didn't see myself as being a particularly exceptional student. I had always been an average student who focused on balancing a rigorous academic schedule with a variety of extracurricular activities. However, that score was a turning point for me and made me realize the impact of my hard work and dedication to my studies and extracurriculars.

One of my proudest achievements was participating in the USAMO (United States of America Mathematical Olympiad) my junior year of high school. This was an intense, six-hour math competition that challenged me to think creatively and outside the box. I was proud to have been one of the few students selected to represent my school and state, and the experience allowed me to meet and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the country.

Additionally, I was fortunate enough to intern for Senator Chuck Schumer the summer after my junior year. This experience provided me with a firsthand look at how government policies and decisions are made, and I was impressed by the Senator's passion for serving the constituents of New York. I was able to assist in research for upcoming legislation and was even given the opportunity to present my findings to the Senator and his staff. This experience not only solidified my interest in political science, but also taught me the importance of public service and advocating for the voices of the community.

Lastly, I have been passionate about finding cures for autoimmune diseases, and I have dedicated a significant amount of my time to conducting research in this field. I have been amazed by the complexity of these diseases and the challenges faced by those who suffer from them. I have learned that while there is still much we do not know about autoimmune diseases, every little discovery can lead to a significant breakthrough in our understanding and treatment of these conditions. My goal is to use my knowledge and passion to make a positive impact in the lives of those affected by autoimmune diseases.

In conclusion, my SAT score was a testament to my hard work and dedication, but it was only a small part of my journey. My experiences in the USAMO, interning for Senator Schumer, and conducting research on autoimmune diseases have all shaped me into the student and person I am today.

10x5pvn,3,2023-02-08,Need help regarding an internship situation with a friend,LordPsycho99,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/10x5pvn/need_help_regarding_an_internship_situation_with/,"Some Context: I have a friend who is interning as an embedded software intern at a startup, he came to me asking for help with a data science-related project he was assigned to in his internship, and I don't know how he even got such a project as two fields are pretty far apart. I did pretty much most of his project as he didn't have any prior experience with python or data science.

Now during my sem vacations, I was sharing an ml project idea with him and he insisted on making it together, after that, I got to work on the project but he didn't do a single thing and was freeloading all the time he was asking for web series recommendations to me rather than work on the project. After that, I confronted him about it saying he wanted to help in this project but isn't doing anything to help, he began saying as he is not from CS he can't give much time to these kinds of projects which bummed me out as I have previously helped him many times in his Electronics assignments. I spent all my sem vacations on this and he was not even sorry. And the worst part was this was happening During our semester break and as far as I knew he was not busy with anything else.

So Now a month later he comes to my house saying they have a vacancy for an ML intern at the startup he is interning at but he told me we would have to work together on the project. Now I don't have any problem doing work together as we would have to collaborate with others, But my concern is that he won't do much and I would have to do most of the heavy lifting. But I also am looking for an internship rn and this could be a good opportunity.

TLDR: A friend is asking if I want to join him as an intern at the startup he is currently interning at but he is a huge freeloader and I am scared that I would also have to do his work. But also I am looking for an internship and it would be nice to get the experience.

Please help me make a decision regarding this."

ChatGPT - Part 2,Tall_Strategy_2370,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/10x5s9j/please_critique_essay_chatgpt_part_2/,"Please help! I was deferred by Northeastern and I don't know what my chances are for other schools! All T20s. Northeastern was my dream school :(

Growing up, I have always been motivated by a strong sense of ambition and a thirst for knowledge. This drive has led me to achieve many notable accomplishments, including an internship at Google at the age of 12, passing the bar exam during my freshman year of high school, and being a star basketball player with a promising future in the sport. However, my journey towards success has not always been easy, and I was once brought to my lowest point by a single exam score.

It was during my high school calculus class that I received a 99 on an exam and felt as though I had brought shame upon my family. I was devastated by the thought that I had fallen short of my own expectations and those of others. However, I soon learned that the only way to truly overcome this setback was to confront it head-on. I approached my calculus teacher and showed him my exam, seeking a clearer understanding of what had gone wrong. To my surprise, he was the one who had made a mistake, and I had actually received a perfect score of 100.

This experience taught me an important lesson about perseverance and resilience. It showed me that success is not always a straight path, and that setbacks can often be temporary. It also taught me the importance of having the courage to stand up for oneself, even in the face of adversity. By sharing my exam with my teacher, I was able to clear up any misunderstandings and ultimately prove my mastery of the subject matter.

This newfound confidence has served me well in my many achievements thus far, including my internship at Google. At the age of 12, I was given the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the technology industry. This experience not only gave me a glimpse into the world of tech, but also helped me develop valuable skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. It was during this internship that the CEO of Google even went as far as to tell me that I had the potential to one day take over his position. This recognition only further motivated me to work harder and pursue my passions.

In addition to my experience in tech, I have also achieved success in the legal field. Passing the bar exam during my freshman year of high school was a remarkable accomplishment that showcased my dedication to my studies. This achievement opened up a world of opportunities for me, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of the legal system and the ways in which I can use my skills to make a positive impact in my community.

Alongside my academic and professional pursuits, I have also excelled in the sport of basketball. As a star player, I have had the opportunity to play in numerous high-level tournaments and showcase my skills on a national stage. It is this love of the game and my natural talent that has caught the attention of Duke University, who has expressed interest in recruiting me for their basketball team. This opportunity not only represents a chance for me to further develop my skills on the court, but also to receive a top-notch education.

In conclusion, my journey towards success has been marked by both challenges and triumphs. However, it is through these experiences that I have learned the importance of perseverance, resilience, and courage. I am confident that these qualities, combined with my academic and professional achievements, make me a strong candidate for admission to your esteemed university. I look forward to the opportunity to continue my journey and make a positive impact in the world."

I got my master's in physics / quantum information 3 years ago and worked as a research intern at uni for a while. I've been looking for over a year for a job but most companies ignore me. I tried applying to data science and quantum engineering positions but all companies think I'm a worthless piece of shit. I have most of the skills they're looking for, like python, c++, Linux shell, analytical skills, algorithms, etc, I've spent years building up these skills but they're absolutely worthless cause I don't have any professional experience. I need experience to get experience so I'm stuck in this hell. I'm a waste of space and of no use to anyone. They tell me how interested they are and how ""nice"" my CV is and then ghost me. I had like 10 interviews with one company and did 3 assignments for them, only to hear that 'unfortunately' they can't hire me cause they don't have the budget.

I've been suicidal since I was a child, was abused and considered worthless by my parents, brother, teachers, 'friends', 'boyfriends', strangers, etc. I really regret not ending it back then, I wish I could go back in time and save myself from the suffering. I really don't believe that things get better, they haven't for over 20 years.

I put my everything into getting this degree, had to deal with depression, crippling anxiety and adhd (just found out about that one), I would stay up nights in a row, self medicate and self harm just so I could take the hard classes and still get a good grade. I thought that maybe it would make me seem a bit less worthless but clearly it was of no use cause my worthlessness is inherent.

I have no future, I'm out of money, I'm out of options. I can't go back to uni for another degree and I don't qualify for service jobs either cause they also require professional experience. I can't ever have a place to live or a family cause you need a job for those. There is absolutely no point in living this life, there's clearly something seriously wrong with me considering everyone I studied with has a job and a life. I chose my method, now I just need to set a date. I really can't do this anymore."

These are not violent offenses, nor do they deal with illegal substances. I committed these crimes as a juvenile, but was tried as an adult. I am a very hardworking computer science student (junior, soon-to-be senior). 

I had 2 offers (Fidelity and another company) for 2023 summer internships. Fidelity rescinded my offer immediately after the background check, and that really hurt. I’m not too surprised honestly, it just sucks that I’m working harder than all of my peers yet I’m just getting denied for my past (crimes were 6 years ago). It was going to be the best thing that had ever happened to me. I’ve never been “successful”, and this was the one of the first things I did that made my family proud of me in a long time.

Am I in the wrong industry? It seems most companies do “point based” background checks and a felony automatically bars you from employment. If I lose this second internship, idk what I will do. Computer Science / Software Engineering has been my entire life for the past 2-3 years. Idk if I can keep doing this application/recruiting process, I am so burnt out from it now. I just wish I could get offers and know that I’m not going to be rescinded based on something I did 6 years ago. I just want my degree and years of hard work to be worth it."

I recently posted in this sub for some advice about a job switch,  but got a lot of queries and DMs about how I got into Data Engineering, how to get better and go from entry level to senior position or from Data Analyst to Data Engineer \[DE\].

I'm working as a Senior Data Engineer in a Unicorn Startup in India. 

Trying to give back to the community from my experience in Data Engineering since 2019. Still surprised that not many are aware about what actually are the roles, the expectations from Data Engineers are. Most of the stuff is available online, videos from many youtubers, still posted it for people who might not be aware! :)

Will answer FAQs about Data Engineering. Feel free to correct or improvise. 

**Warning: This is going to be a long post.**

\&gt; DE means Data Engineering

&amp;#x200B;

I. As a fresher, I'm interested in Data Engineering, but how to get a job in this domain?

A. Getting a job directly as a full-time DE is pretty tough. Try to apply for DE internships and maybe it will get converted to full-time or with that experience try to apply for Associate / Junior DE positions. Build a network on Linkedin with many Data Engineers and connect with them about their experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.  What are the required skill-sets to become a DE?

A. From my experience companies expect you to be good at any one language

* Python, Java or Scala
* Strong SQL skills
* Data warehousing
* Spark
* Cloud experience - AWS/Azure/GCP \[good to atleast have an idea on how to spin up a cluster in any cloud vendor, setting up Network rules, firewall, etc.\]

&amp;#x200B;

3. Is DE in demand, is it better than Data Science?

A. Even though all the hype on the internet is for Data Scientists, the role of Data Engineer is equally crucial and critical for companies to enable Data Scientists. 

* Even the pay is lucrative! 
   * Salaries may vary, but mostly ranges look like this
   * Entry level DE - 4 to 10 LPA
   * 2 - 4 years - 12 to 30 LPA
   * 4 - 7 years - 25 - 60+ LPA

4. How do the roles differ, Data Engineer vs Data Scientist vs Data Analyst

A. My understanding - In the Data ecosystem

1. Data Engineer - Process starts here, collecting, cleaning and transforming, ingesting data into Data warehouses or datalakes.

2. Data Scientist - With the collected data in DW/DL, understand business logic and build useful data science techniques / ML models to identify key patterns, insights that can drive revenue.

   3. Data Analyst - Final part in process, Visualize the insights from Data Scientists using BI tools like Tableau, Looker, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. How to prepare for DE interviews, Most commonly asked interview questions?

&amp;#x200B;

* **NOTE: In most companies, even Data Engineers are expected to be strong in DSA, since first rounds can be OA tests like Hackerrank and F2F Coding rounds before you can enter technical rounds about topics mentioned below. So, still need to Grind Leetcode to some extent!**
* **That being said, there are still companies that focus mostly on SQL, Spark for interviews and pay lesser attention to coding skills.**

&amp;#x200B;

After attending close to 40 interviews in last 4 years, the most asked interview questions for 0-3 years of experience were mostly on the following.

**Must have knowledge on these concepts to crack any DE interview:**

I. SQL

* Aggregate functions - AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.
* Joins - **important!** types of joins and their output.
* Window functions - Ranking functions, LAG, LEAD
* what is &lt;**following**\&gt; how do they **work**, how to **create** this and why is it used, **pros** and **cons** for the **following:**
   * CTEs
   * Views, Materialized views
   * Index - also types of indexes, index behind the scenes.
   * Partitioning - types of partitioning
* Normalization / Denormalization - rarely asked but important

&amp;#x200B;

2. Data Warehousing (DW) and ETL

* Star vs Snowflake Schema
* DB vs DW vs Data lake, when to use appropriately
* Choosing Columnar vs row oriented Databases
* Facts, Dimensions - understanding, examples
* Steps to implement a Data warehouse (for example in Bigquery)
* Best practices for DW, reporting
* Slowly changing dimensions
* Handling duplicate records, inconsistencies in data.
* Understanding ETL vs ELT process, data cleaning, ingestion techniques. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Spark

* Understading Architecture
* YARN basics
* Sparkcontext, session, worker, task, job, stage, etc
* Spark dataframes, actions, transformations, reading and writing data, specifying schema options
* Repartioning vs Coalesce
* Partioning
* Handling OOM error in spark
* Broadcast variables, broadcast joins
* Best practices of Spark, best tuning practices
* Different persisting strategies in spark

&amp;#x200B;

Cloud experience

* Not much questions but it is vital to have an idea on different big data tools and services available in any one Cloud platform and their use cases.
* Most commonly used services in Cloud for Data systems
   * AWS - S3, Redshift, Glue, RDS
   * GCP - Cloud Storage, Bigquery, CloudSQL, Dataflow \[for streaming\]

**Linux skills - I think this is also a very important skill and a basic requirement**

 

Other skills to learn to become a better a niche Data Engineer,  if have the above mentioned topics covered, check these out:

1. Orchestration tool - Airflow \[slowly becoming a must have skill\]
2. Streaming data - Spark Streaming / Flink
3. Pubsub systems like Kafka
4. NoSQL databases - MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.
5. System Design for Big Data

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I studied frontend development in a Ukrainian online academy (I moved to Germany when the war started) and it was not a big deal there to work as a developer without a degree if you have great skills. But seems that in Western Europe it's impossible to get a job without experience or education.

10xcizk,3,2023-02-08,I am finding it hard to have my first stint in the legal sector. I moved from India to Uk and currently doing LLM at KCL London.,OneGaurdian,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10xcizk/i_am_finding_it_hard_to_have_my_first_stint_in/,"Hello, I am new to Reddit, so please ignore my mistakes.

I don't know what to do as everything I try to do is turning out to be not working and I am constantly being rejected without any insight into the reason for which I was rejected. I have tried to amend and reshape myself and my approach so as to improve myself to the level where I am able to match the requirements. However, nothing seems to work and I don't know what to do, or where to look, there is certainly self-doubt and I have to rethink my whole life as I think I am a complete failure,

I am a Student at Kings College London studying LLM\[ Master of laws\]. I moved to London in September 2022 from India where I did my bachelor's. I thought London will be a great place to start a legal career as it has a lot of job opportunities. After getting career guidance at king's I sorted out my career path to be a Solicitor. To get qualifies as a Solicitor here in the Uk, we need to undergo a 2 years training contract at any firm. Getting a training contract is a very competitive and long process as the firms start hiring 2 years in advance. I found that the chances of getting a training contract increase significantly if you are able to secure and attend a vacation scheme \[which is a 1 or 2 weeks internship for current students to have some experience of the life of a trainee\]. Now, getting this vacation scheme is also a very competitive task in itself.

In October 2022, I got career support from my College and prepared my applications accordingly as per the firm's demand. However, I got rejected by all of them. Their response would generally be the same ""Unfortunately, we are unable to take your application further. Due to the volume of applications we receive, we are unable to provide feedback.""

I thought I might be making some mistakes, so I tried to learn and got more guidance from those who are already trainees, attended careers fairs, met recruiters, and talked to representatives of various firms. But there answer was 'Be Yourself'. Now I have been myself and got rejected every time.

I told myself I won't give up. So I decided to find the firms which match my personality and background. I have a degree in Civil Engineering apart from a law degree. I decided to apply to firms that work in infrastructure and all. I took almost a week's time for each application to prepare them to the best possible standards, and made sure it had no errors. However the response was still the same.

So I decided to seek out what was I missing or what quality do I not have to be accepted. I started to look carefully at my previous applications and changed my approach completely. I would research the firm deeply and would frame my applications as per the requirement, culture, and values of those firms. The result was still negative.

At this point, I was a master's student in a russell group institute, who had two bachelor's degrees and had 2 years of experience working at a Trading Company in India. I am from the rural part of India and I have also been responsible for running activities at my family's farm in India. I attended a 3 weeks internship in India at Advocate General's office during my bachelor's degree in Law. After completing my bachelor's in June 2022, I moved to London in Sept 2022. I thought that I am being rejected because I don't have enough experience working in the UK. But later, thought that this is a vacation scheme designed for students who are currently in their final university year. If, I can't compete with them, what chance do I have in open recruitment placements where people with much more experience are competing against me?

But I decided to give it another go, by looking into myself and seeking career guidance again, rewriting the CV and application questions such that all of my skills and capabilities reflect upon my application. At this time 2023 has already started and I gave everything I had to write my applications. However, the result was still the same.

So, I decided to start applying to entry-level intern/paralegal roles. However, now I am not even able to get a single positive response. Some cite that I don't have relevant background, while others say I don't meet the requirements.

I am so confused and disappointed. I have tried everything and talked to everyone. I am exhausted, depressed, and have no hope. I am doubting myself. I don't know what to do.

I'm seeking advice concerning internships. I am a third year CS student in Canada and I just got offered a really nice internship opportunity for a Sales Rep position during the summer, and I am very excited about it. It pays really well and I think I would have a lot of fun. However, after talking to my brother about it (he's 29 and majored in Graphic Design) he told me to not take this internship and to look for an internship related to my field. He warned me about taking this internship because it can hurt my chances of a better job position in the future since it is not related to my field. I'm also looking for a CS internship but I have been unsuccesful so far. My university has a Co-op degree so I'm trying to do the co-op by next year. I am not sure whether to take the Sales Rep internship or try to find a different one more related to CS. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

Best wishes to everyone else who is awaiting decisions, I know how stressful it can be. It just feels like we are all good applicants competing for a small number of open seats. It feels so unfair. I had never been rejected from a college before as I got into my dream undergrad school, so I did not realize how much it really does hurt to get rejected! It is just really frustrating as I can’t help but feel like there was nothing more I could have done during my undergrad. I went to an Ivy League school, double majored and double minored, had a great GPA, worked and had internships throughout my entire college experience, I had leadership extracurricular positions, and I conducted independent research. I had great professors who I was close with who wrote me great letters of recommendation and I cannot help but feel like I’ve wasted their time! I reached out to faculty I was interested in studying with at the universities I applied to and received positive responses. I edited and re-edited by statement of purpose and all my other essays. I don’t know what more I could have done! And I’m sure others in this thread feel this way. 

I forgot to mention, I applied to humanities PHDs, and was warned by many other grad students and professors that funding for humanities departments has been cut and cut. I just feel really stuck because I had intended to apply last year (during my senior year) but because of mental health issues I was advised by other grad students I knew to wait another year. Since graduating, I’ve been living back home and working a really shitty job just to make money. Ever since I was in high school, I knew I wanted to go to grad school to study history because it is what I am passionate about. I am still waiting to hear from other schools, but I’m just really afraid I won’t get in anywhere. Maybe it’s too soon to speak because I’m still waiting on some other schools (I’m still waiting on my top top choice), but man, this has been a heartbreaking process. Just wanted to share how I feel for others who might be in the same boat!"

It's a 2-year program and is meant for people without a CS background and is like a conversion masters. 

Cost: 80k tuition + 25k living expenses = 105k total

My parents can give me 30k to help which will make it 75k debt.

During the program, I will likely get an opportunity to TA for a semester. Also, everyone does a software engineering internship in the summer between first and second year. Internship salary ranges a lot but I think typical ranges are 30$/hr to 9k a month+housting stipend at Amazon (a lot of masters students from this program get an Amazon intern offer). I also will try to do another internship fall of the second year while taking the easiest 2 masters level classes I can. I can't say how much all of this will help reduce my total debt from 75k, but I'm hoping this will reduce it by 10-20k.

Total compensation for a full-time offer after completing the program is between 130k-200k depending on the level of company I get an offer at. Getting an offer at a Capital one type of company should be fairly easy and will pay about 130 first year, but getting an offer at Amazon will be harder and thus will pay 180k first year. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on whether this is reasonable?"

The question is:

I have code working experience, but my latest code working experience is back in 2015. Then I work as a production manager for years. These experiences were not in the US. So that may be not useful in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 3 strategies to write my resume.

* **Only list the coding work experience. (I prefer this)**

**Pro:** Make the resume clear and related. May have some advantages compared with new graduates.

**Con:** A BIG GAP in the resume. Will take time to explain.

**Will a big gap fail in the automatic resume filter?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **List full working experience.**

**Pro:** Can show a full timeline, no gap on the resume.

**Con:** Too long, and less informative, hard to compress it to one page. May cause over-qualify for an intern?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Don’t list any working experience which was not in the US.**

**Pro:** Don’t need to explain the gap.

**Con:** Have no advantage compared with new graduates.

The thing is: I'm dumb. I thought I was smart because I get good grades but I am veeeeery much slow.

More people just joined the lab this semester and some days I have to ""teach"" them some stuff and I just feel so lost and I can see that they noticed that. I either forget easily some stuff or need constantly for someone to be giving me clear instructions so I can do stuff in a confident way.

I feel like because of that I will never thrive in such a competitive and demanding field and this makes me so depressed. I fear never getting a job and just being a disappointment that wasted 5 years on a degree not suitable for her. Am I overreacting?

I've (F22) been trying to float the idea of me moving out when I graduate university to my parents, just so they get used to the idea. I think it's not unreasonable, especially when I (hopefully) will be working after graduation.

I brought it up to AF that I was thinking of renting an apartment with my friend closer to my school to cut down on commute. He immediately accused me of not loving him and AM anymore, saying stuff like ""How are you going to show that you love us? With a phone call? Talk is cheap, you have to show your love through actions!""

My school isn't even far away, it's twenty minutes by car. I wasn't planning on going NC or anything, I would have visited or come home to help them out if they asked.

A day or two later, AM came into the kitchen while I was doing the dishes and asked if it was true that I wanted to move out. I said yes and she tried to guilt me saying ""You have to stay and take care of me and your father"" They are both fairly healthy, and while they've had health issues in the past I was never able to help anyway. And I've offered to help with chores around the house more and they reject me saying it'd be easier if they did it themselves. How exactly do you expect me to take care of you when you're doing just fine now?

More recently, AM asked what my friends' plans are after graduation. I told her that most of them are going to stay in the area since there are a lot of job opportunities around here and that I'm hoping to move out after graduation as well. AM said, ""You should wait until your sister (20) graduates. She'll be lonely without you, and she'll need your help with school."" Again, I don't plan on moving far, and second, my sister and I are studying two completely different majors so I haven't been much help anyway.

There are so many reasons I want to move out. To name a few, AM makes me a mediator for every fight she has with my sister, AF is allergic to apologies and blames me every time I get upset with him, and AM makes me her therapist whenever she gets fed up with AF or my sister.

The biggest reason of all is that it is so fucking suffocating to live with AP as a lesbian. I'm planning to come out to AF once I've moved out, just to prepare for the worst-case scenario. I'm out to AM, but after her pressuring me to come out over a year ago she still tells me she ""needs time to accept it"". She didn't seem to need any fucking time at all to out my (then) girlfriend to her AM and sabotaging our relationship. The excuse she gave was that if she would want to know that about her daughter and she was just looking out for the other mom. What about me, your daughter!?

I've been dating around for the past several months, but when one girl who I was seeing came to my house to pick me up for a date, AM stood on the lawn watching her from outside her car. And when I didn't come home at the exact minute I said I'd probably be home she blew up my phone and texted me accusing me of breaking my promises. When my date drove me home, sure enough my mom was there poking her head out of the side door watching us. I refuse to have that happen again for future partners. It's made me suicidal at times knowing that I can never have a normal relationship that neither of them will accept, no matter how ""good"" of a daughter I am with my grades or work. I so badly want my parents to be happy with whoever I end up with, but I know it's pointless with them.

All in all, they make it really difficult for me to *want* to stay with them, so why are they getting upset when I want to leave? Just because they take good care of us physically, they think they can get a free pass to manipulation and control. Not to mention, all arguments against me moving out are for me being a caretaker for the family. Not once have either of my AP considered my happiness and how suffocating it must feel to live with them. I've given up on them completely and spend as much time out of the house as possible and live like a zombie at home.

I don't have much, but I put my savings into a certificate of deposit that'll mature by the time I graduate. In the meantime, I'm working at a paid internship and hopefully that'll get me where I need to be next spring."

I've been resisting by keeping busy with school and planning and internships and such. I'm graduating early so recently started considering law school and the only job that really pays ""well"" in my field is HR which can get you about 70-100k based on a bunch of different stuff in my target city of NY. I've recently been doubting if I can live off that as everyone seems to be telling me with only 60k which is my absolute lowest I'll basically be destitute even if I get roommates. For a long time all I've wanted is to move to the city and experience lots of new things the thought of it has been keeping me alive for a while now my friends tell me to do it. But my family (besides my brother) is not supportive and I've realized if I can't have a decent life in the city I love and travel every once in a while what's the point of living. And so I considered law school it's good stable money and I could still help people like I wanted. Like I said I'm graduating early so it's really a crunch time between grad school and law school I know this all sounds stupid and privileged and it probably is but I took a practice LSAT today just to see where I am and I only got 50% of the questions if that right. Then I realized I'm not smart enough for that test and I'm certainly not smart enough for law school if somehow someone was dumb enough to let me in. I won't be able to make the life for myself that I want apparently and if that's the case my reason for living is dead and I want to be too. Part of me is so afraid to fail I'm almost certain it will happen so I don't even want to try in the first place. I feel like everyone was right about me all along there's no point for me to keep trying when it's never gonna happen. Although I still am stuck on my roomate I told her about my feelings in a joking way of course cause I don't want her to worry but she said we'll be okay together. If I do this I'm making sure to leave all my tuition money so she can use that money to do something she wants maybe move herself as she wants to start living in a city too and for making up for breaking our promise I suppose. I don't want her to feel guilty and I want her to know I was thinking about her anyway at this point I'm just rambling."

I will be graduating June 2023 currently pursuing CS from Tier-3 college. I  had secured an internship in Unicorn startup as Business Analyst intern. I worked their for 12 months and the work ex was of FTE even though we were interns. I was very much interested in Data Science role and the work. But amidst the recession and layoffs the startup is on hiring freeze and I feel stranded and no hopes for PPO. The on-campus opportunity are for testing roles or else with bonds which are major red flag.

 The first part I am worried **should I keep on looking Data Science Roles?** because of recession the opportunities are skewed. 

and second part would be **What should I learn new to upskill myself?**  I tried learning Android Development before entering Data Science domain because I love the backend not the frontend creative part. I have heard react js and JS in general is trending. I love coding and building also has very keen interest in microservices and system design.I would really love your advice on both the problems. Thank you for your time.

I elaborate on three incidents that have shaped me and were followed by sleepless nights by describing the context and the resolution. I end on the note that ties to my first paragraph. Everyone that read it (guidance counselors, some friends at ivies, my English teachers) said that the essay said a lot about me. I worked on it for over four months.

Would applying to grad roles now, in my final year of uni while doing an internship, be a good idea?

**MBA Info**

* Why I want an MBA: For future startup/entrepreneurship opportunities and to round out my strong technical background with business skills. Would also like to pursue a MS in CS alongside an MBA if admitted (i.e. take advantage of MS/MBA programs).
* Why I want one now: Applying to deferred MBAs since it's an option and could be a good for when I want to leave my company (a lot of people leave to form startups)
* Target schools: Deferred MBA Programs at M7 + Yale SoM + Haas

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * After graduation: Software Engineer at a notable, selective Post IPO Tech Company (think Snowflake, Palantir, Airbnb, etc.)
   * Internships: One of Facebook/Google SWE Intern, F500 Fintech SWE Intern, Yearlong undergrad research.
* Extracurriculars and other experience:
   * Started and lead program to teach advanced programming concepts to students at my old middle school. Been doing this for the past few years and grew the program significantly.
   * Fraternity and other School Clubs
   * Various small prior volunteer experience
   * Various side CS/programming projects done in my free time. Have a few that could be considered noteworthy.
* Undergrad school/major: Computer Science at a T10 School for CS 
* Other education/coursework: Skipped several grades (admitted early to college) so I'll be graduating at age 19. Is this good to mention? I'm leaning towards no since younger age could be viewed negatively
* Race/nationality: White/Asian
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT/GRE Score: GRE Not yet taken but I imagine a 320-340 (\~160-165 Verbal, 165-170 Quant). Crushed the ACT and got a 33 in 8th grade after 2 weeks of prep so GRE shouldn't be too bad.
* Undergrad GPA: 3.69 as of now, can probably get it to 3.7 by the time I graduate but senioritis is kicking in.

Thoughts on what my chances might look like? I feel like my GPA is a bit on the low end and I lack extracurriculars but I feel like my work experience is very solid and I think I can clutch up on the GRE. From my limited understanding I would put myself as a tossup leaning towards probably not getting in (hence my post) but would appreciate any insight from you all. Thanks!"

I was super stressed during college and didn’t think much of the future, I wanted to just get my degree over with and then find a job after a breather. 

That’s what I did, took a quick breather during Christmas and new years, then went out on my job search. I was a business major so I was looking for various jobs in finance, sales, energy, gaming industry, etc. (all over the place). 

I went to a very well regarded school, graduated with a 3.4 and have some decent experience under my resume but never worked in an office (because I could never get accepted for an office internship). 

I made some immature mistakes when I was younger and early college. Nothing too crazy but I feel like some of that is lingering on me. Got arrested freshman year for being drunk and got fired from a job due to stupid and bs reasons in high school. 

So back to now. I’ve been applying and interviewing at a million places. Sometimes when I apply to a place where I think I’d be a great match, it’s an immediate no from them. I just don’t understand how I can’t get a decent job for a college grad. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a quick search database that tells them to stay away from me. Is this delusional? If not how do I fix this. 

Where do I go from here? Is the military my only option? Or do I just stick it out with a local less prestigious job? Thank you everyone, I appreciate your input."

My bf is 27 and can’t seem to make inroads in his career. He got a masters in a well-regarded art/technology program and has a beautiful portfolio but does not have any work experience in this field. Since he graduated 10 months ago, he’s been applying to hundreds of jobs in our city and other cities, mostly based on listings found online, but a few through friend connections. He’s has about 15 interviews which seemed to go reasonably well, but 0 job offers. He’s starting to get desperate, depressed, and doesn’t know what to do next. 

Any advice?

From my perspective his resume, cover letter, portfolio are all very good. Maybe he could learn to be a bit more engaging at interviews.

Is his lack of work experience holding him back? How to overcome that hurdle? He’s also been applying for internships in addition to real jobs but still no luck. 

One problem is perhaps these jobs in tech, gaming, entertainment industry, graphic design, etc are all looking for technical expertise, whereas he knows all the relevant softwares but is more of a generalist rather than an expert in any single subject. 

I also know jobs are best found through networking rather than internet postings, but he doesn’t have much of a network. How to expand this? 

Thanks for any insights on next steps."

Because of my disability, it takes me more time and energy than my neurotypical peers to do the same amount of work. As a result, the idea of doing any kind of overwhelming task, including academic ones, causes anxiety that leads to procrastination. It kicks in almost instinctively whenever I read the prompt for an assignment. 

So, in reaction, I shut down. I don’t do it. I laze around. I watch YouTube on my phone. That is until I can’t ignore it anymore because it’s due tomorrow/next week/a few weeks from now. I pull my hair out. Then I somehow eventually muster up the courage to finish whatever it is in 1-2 days. And yes, it really is 1-2 days. Often without sleep. 

Then once I’m done, and get the good grade or whatever, I deflate. I tell myself that to avoid the mental trauma of last semester I will make sure to be on top of things from day one. I look forward to that enthusiastically. Until I see my next assignment at start of the next semester, and then it all happens again.

With a few exceptions, this has been every academic semester since the spring of my sophomore year of high school, when I started taking AP classes. And while my academic skills have definitely gotten better over the years (the coursework for AP classes are super easy for me now, but they were soul crushingly hard for me then) I have never been able to break this vicious cycle. 

I barely survived high school in terms of stress and had one semester so bad that I crashed and burned and got two Cs in my AP classes. Having to deal with an unhappy mom didn’t help. 

Once I got to my freshman year of undergrad, I had a semester so stressful I started going bald. And then every semester after that the ugly cycle repeated itself. Yet over the years burnout slowly set in.

 By the time I reach my upperclassman years, I was turning in assignments late, and by the end of my last semester, which was when COVID hit, it got to the point where I got an email from a professor saying that I was about to get a D and needed to improve my grade. Luckily, I was able to raise it to a B, but not without a last little dose of mental trauma. 

Yet in undergrad, as hard as my homework was, especially writing essays, reading was the easy part. And the fact that I’m good writer didn’t hurt. So, even in my worst moments, I managed to pull though in the end, and I was always prepared for class at the most basic level. 

That’s not the case anymore. Now in grad school, I can’t read everything from front to back like I used to, because it’s impossible. At first this was making me pull my hair out, as usual, but then I was given the usual advice: skim, pick and choose,take notes, etc. 

The thing is, even though I don’t have to read everything, skimming, picking and choosing etc. is harder than reading front to back, and I have no fucking idea how to do it properly. Reading now takes just as much energy as essay writing, and I don’t know if I can handle them both. I feel like I am never done working, even if I skim and pick and choose, etc. like I’m supposed to, and that scares me shitless, because I feel I need to be done at some point in order to keep my sanity. 

I often feel like an embarrassing idiot in my classes, even compared to my classmates who also procrastinate and bitch and moan about how much work they have to do, like me. Yet somehow they manage to be competent, despite everything. 

I, meanwhile, am stuck in the same vicious cycle. Last semester, which was my first semester of grad school, I managed to get straight As, but not without a great cost. The cycle repeated itself yet again, and after everything I’ve been though, it got so mentally painful this time that I had a suicidal meltdown that escalated until I inflicted self-harm on myself for the first time in my life. 

This was my second suicidal meltdown last year. The first one was triggered by all my undergrad friends moving away and my last attempt to get a full time job between undergrad and grad school falling through. Now I believe I just botched my first major assignment of the semester and am doomed to get a B in the class, if I’m lucky enough to break the cycle. 

Now, I know technically if I just *manage my time* breaking the cycle is possible, but if I so much as think about whatever assignment I have to do, before I can even blink I’ve already had a subconscious panic attack and I shut down. And so the cycle continues. 

And I’m so burnt out at this point after all these years that even when I know something is due soon, even if my brain gets nervous, my body’s fight or flight response will not activate because I just can’t handle it. Once you throw applying for internships and plain old adulting into the mix, then things start getting super ugly, super fast. 

What am I supposed to do? If I keep going on like this then I don’t know if I can finish grad school without doing a number on my mental health. But as hard as I try to will myself to break this vicious cycle, I always end up coming back to it. 

And yes, I know everyone procrastinates sometimes, but I really don’t want to keep up the status quo in this case. But, I’m scared. Scared that I have to use just as much energy reading as I do when writing. Scared that I can’t rely on one, universal structure or strategy for my all my readings/assignments. Scared that no matter what I try to keep up with my work, I’ll still look like an idiot who doesn’t know what he’s doing or be brought to the brink of suicide or both. This alone is enough to make me shut down. 

Oh, and on top of everything, most of my cohort has full-time job experience in my field, while I don’t because I was never able to get anything full-time between undergrad and grad school. So yeah, I feel they have professional experiences they can draw on that I just don’t, and I am insecure about that. 

I’m not sure I’m happy in my program, but I’ve already paid for it with a great scholarship. And I am happy in the city I moved to for my program. Even though it was an adjustment at first, I have gotten used to it and am just now starting to put down roots. 

I’ve been getting full-time job offers from an employer that I applied to a long time ago that has great benefits, but I can’t accept because it would involve leaving my current city. And even if I drop this program and start another one that I enjoy more later on in life, what if I still haven’t broken the cycle by then? Also, I don’t know if another program that I enjoy more could get me the full-time job I desperately need. 

What the fuck am I supposed to do?"
10y517w,3,2023-02-09,The Benefits of Reverse Mentoring for Entrepreneurs,GabeXav,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/10y517w/the_benefits_of_reverse_mentoring_for/,"Hello Entrepreneurs!

Have you heard of the concept of reverse mentoring? Reverse mentoring is a process in which a more experienced individual, such as an entrepreneur, is mentored by someone less experienced, such as a younger employee or intern.

You may be thinking, why would an experienced entrepreneur need a mentor? But the truth is, reverse mentoring offers numerous benefits to entrepreneurs looking to stay ahead of the curve in an ever-evolving business landscape.

Here are just a few of the benefits of reverse mentoring for entrepreneurs:

1. Stay up-to-date on technology: Younger generations are often more familiar with the latest technology and trends, and can provide valuable insights and ideas for incorporating these into your business.
2. Learn new perspectives: Younger mentors can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table, challenging your assumptions and helping you to think outside the box.
3. Foster innovation: Encouraging open dialogue and collaboration between generations can help foster a culture of innovation within your company.
4. Enhance leadership skills: Reverse mentoring provides an opportunity for entrepreneurs to develop their leadership skills by listening, learning and being open to new ideas and perspectives.

In conclusion, reverse mentoring can be a valuable tool for entrepreneurs looking to stay ahead of the curve and continue to grow and succeed. If you're interested in exploring reverse mentoring for yourself, consider reaching out to a younger employee or intern in your organization and starting a mentorship relationship."
10y65m2,2,2023-02-09,Is this normal?,GMarvel101,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/10y65m2/is_this_normal/,"So currently I am working as a help desk intern in a small company. First time in IT and whilst management is good, both my manager and director are pleasant to work with the actual people in the office that we support in office are rather rude and entitled. I also notice that it’s me in particular that they are that way with. I am starting to get really concerned with the environment of this office. Yesterday particularly struck me and left me embarrassed as there was an employee carrying some boxes to the kitchen area and I saw her struggling, I was trying to be kind and politely asked her if she needed help to which she said “I don’t need help thanks” very coldly. Another employee walked over and asked her hey you need help with those and same person said sure. I took notice to it and kept working.

Do interns normally get treated like this? I guess I’m just trying to rationalize the situation as best as possible. I haven’t stopped being kind but I notice that I am being treated rather poorly and am considering actually leaving. Any advice would be appreciated."

However, I need some advice on choosing which company:

1. Top 10 tech hardware company doing SW Automation (most likely QA-based) Intern for 12 Months.
2. Top 50 consulting company doing Software Engineering Intern for 4 Months
3. Top 5 Cybersecurity company doing Software Engineering Intern for 4 months

P.S. I haven't solidified the 3rd company yet, but am in the final round, so I figured I might as well add it.

Note that if I take #1 I would have to extend my degree to 6 years but sets me up for another 4-month internship in May 2024.

In terms of future plans, I would like to aim for a FAANG+. Work there for a few years to gain experience and qualifications, then transition into something I find more interesting like tech consulting or a place with good work/life balance and culture.

My previous internship was at a Top 100 tech hardware company also doing QA. I am leaning more toward #1 for the potential exit opportunities but am worried it might lock me into QA. But with #2 I think it might be more difficult to break into FAANG+. For #3, because it's an older company I heard your time here is a hit-more-miss and I am not as interested in the work.

Please let me know which one you think I should take and why!

P.S. This post was not meant to brag, I'm really grateful for the opportunities and I wish everyone the best of luck during these hard times! And sorry for being so discrete about all the companies, just trying to remain anonymous..."

A few things to note:

* I know I could have applied more, to more diverse places, or improved my resume before graduating. That is not the point of this post
* Before you ask, yes I have asked for work pertaining more to engineering rather than drafting, but I am yet to be given much more than shaping sheet metal or organizing Creo models
* I'm looking for advice from people who understand/have been through my predicament, as well as any advice on possible choices I can make in the future.
* Any general tips/tricks for job searching

**Background Information and Context**:

I graduated with my Aerospace Engineering degree in Dec 2020 and I'm not sure if it was due to covid or my skills and resume, but I had a very difficult time finding an aerospace job (got a few interviews here and there). After 9 months of searching I kind of gave up and had a Mech E friend hook me up with a job (Product Engineer) where I'm currently at just for some easy experience. I planned on leaving ASAP, but I've been here for about 1.5 years now, and I'm aware that's not long, but I feel like I haven't had and relevant experience or skills. Specifically it is a very small paving machine company, and truth be told, I'm doing next to no engineering work. At least that's how it feels. Me and my friend have both created/""designed"" steel products to improve our machines (i.e. ECU boxes, ladder mounts, rollers, steer arms, etc.) but the stuff we do is the same as what drafters in our office do. I don't think there's a problem with that, however we've NEVER done any analysis in terms of FEA, thermodynamics, not even utilizing basic mechanics or statics. Our bosses always estimate their designs whether that's weld locations, structural stability, etc (I've discussed this with my boss and he told me that our company isn't apart of the ""engineering industry""). I've definitely learned a lot about 3D modeling (Creo specifically), safety &amp; regulation standards, steel fabrication, as well as reading schematics, creating engineering drawings and that type of work, but I feel like I'm not doing engineering work per se.  I know my managers definitely do their fair share of calculations and analysis, but being a small company moving up isn't plausible unless I wait for someone to retire. Now I want to leave and go somewhere I can acquire skills and become a better engineer, but I'm starting to worry I'm both: too late to be considered a recent grad, and too inexperienced to apply for most engineering positions.

**For the Record:**

I did relatively well in my coursework in college, although recalling specific principles may be difficult, but I know I can easily relearn them if needed. I also understand most companies don't want to train their employees and waste time, so I am capable of self teaching again if needed.

**Now That You Know My Situation:**

Is it a good idea to leave? Or should I weather the storm. This is my first career job and I am grateful for the opportunity, but I have the nagging feeling if I stay too long I won't have near enough transferable skills to realistically work anywhere else (and I don't want my entire career to take place in a town of 3,000 people). Assuming I am leaving, how do I sell my experience of (at most) learning about drafting standards and common sheet metal fabrication practices? Is it possible to just start over as a new Aerospace Engineer (or Mech E) somewhere? Is it possible/a good idea to attempt an internship to switch industries? I'm not sure about how HR would view this type of scenario and would like any and all perspectives. Thanks.

Edit 1: I am also considering quitting before I find a new job, luckily I am in a decent financial position from low cost of living in the country, and I would like to really grind out applications but for obvious reasons I have not done that yet. Let me know if you've done the same and the experiences you've had doing so!"

Though I haven't received a formal offer a full-time SWE role with them, it's been strongly implied by my boss that I'd be welcome to that after my graduation. 

But, my partner and I have decided we want a change of scenery, so I've been applying to out-of-state jobs, and I haven't told my job that yet. Given the state of the entry-level market, I wanted to keep this place as a backup in case I couldn't land anything. Well, I just got offered a full-time position in a city my partner and I love. Though I haven't accepted yet, I most likely will within the next week. But, since it's an on-site role, it's understood that I won't begin there until I've graduated and am free to move in the summer. 

I'm just not sure how to navigate this with my current employer. I want to keep working at my current job for the next three months so I can cover my rent. I also want not to burn any bridges with them — after all, this is my hometown, and I want to keep good standing with them in case I ever decide to move back here. What would be the appropriate time to notify my job, without seeming like I'm deceiving them or leading them on?"

I'm looking for my first new college grad role right now. I've been applying to research engineer, ML engineer and data science roles.

Credentials:

1. I have a BS and MS in ECE (focus in machine learning) from a top 10 school, good grades
2. 4 internships, 2 in semiconductors, 2 in tech
3. Interesting post-grad award (don't want to dox myself)
4. No publications or substantial projects outside school/internship

For the past year of school, I wanted to get into ML research in big tech, or a company like OpenAI, Deepmind, etc... Unfortunately, big tech jobs are frozen right now, and the whole world has discovered these AI companies, so this dream may be put on hold. I've gotten some interviews with cool startups in related areas, but failed a lot of coding screens (before I realized I needed to grind leetcode).

Anyway, I've been graduated for \~2 months now, and am feeling antsy to start work. 

I had a good interview for a data science role in an academic lab (not EECS) that is indirectly related to what I want to work on longer term. It sounds like there would be a lot of independent python coding, data analysis and opportunities for publications. Location is desirable, and university is good (top 15).

Salary is capped at \~$85k, which is lower than I made as an intern, and lower than a job offer I got 3 years ago...

My dream is to work on a specific area of applied AI research, and I think this role could be a good intermediate role. But I wonder if another few months of grinding leetcode, and working on a side project could be the difference-maker into landing a FAANG ML job, cool AI startup or just a SWE role at a top company that would give me skills to land a better job in 2 years.  Also, this would mean a 2x difference in TC.

No problems with the SQL part, but I haven't had a formal education regarding Java and have not worked on it for over a year. I used it on our thesis, and just Googled as needed. I have a patchwork knowledge in Java, I'm confident that I can get things working if I were given no restrictions, the first time I worked with Java was on said thesis, over 30,000 lines of Java for a working Android App finished over 6 months with Youtube Tuts and no prior knowledge of Java. But I do have holes in my knowledge. For example, I was once asked (for a different internship) what the difference between an  Array and ArrayList was, since there was no equivalent in Python I was stumped. I can get thru assessments just fine, but I'm worried about questions such as these popping up on interviews. I'm doing my due diligence and studying up as much as I can, but there's only so much as I can study and I'm worried I might overlook fundamentals such as these.  So mainly what I'm asking is this: Am I overcompensating for an entry level job? What am I expected to bring to the table? Any tips for people moving between languages?"

I’ve been working here a year and I can count on one hand the amount of times she’s taught me anything. 

Anytime I sit down to study or practice on my own, she tries to distract me with silly conversation or games. She’d rather spend most the day chatting about irrelevant shit like tv shows and video games more than work.

In addition, there was a situation where our boss needed her to take on more responsibility in a different area. She complains about it and acts like she can’t stand it but I can tell she likes it since people are treating her like she’s important and our boss mentioned promoting her. In a recent meeting, he mentioned teaching me some of the same responsibilities and she quickly answered for me and told him that wouldn’t be a good idea. 

I’m not sure how to handle this situation. She clearly has seniority over me and I’m not sure speaking to my boss will go well since he’s been depending on her much more lately and is giving her leeway for things (she is often late to work but he lets it slide whereas he has reprimanded me for the same even when it’s less time). 

I’m considering leaving altogether and have been applying to places however is there a way to possibly salvage this?"
10yi7qh,1,2023-02-10,Held back by my fears for the future. I am overwhelmed and worried..,dailyveggies,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/10yi7qh/held_back_by_my_fears_for_the_future_i_am/,"I am 23 &amp; female, I have a hearing disability requiring me to wear BTE (Behind the Ear) hearing aids in both ears. I was the only one in my family who is hard of hearing. All of my life, I’ve always been at a disadvantage in all aspects of social situations, making me narrow my options for careers. I’ve worked in a couple plant nurseries, and I’ve gained meaningful, impactful knowledge about plants from learning on the job. (~3.5 years in total, as a Nursery worker/Patio Sales Associate/Buyer assistant) I’ve had accommodating people in these jobs, which I’m grateful for, but where I’m at now has not much ‘career’ growth at all. I could become a manager at the local plant nursery, but that’s pretty much it and I have no desire to get into that as it’s not my goal.
My life background and my situation is so multifaceted, but it all boils down to my strong feelings for college and my uncertainty for my future. I feel like college in a way, is a scam.
I have gone to college for one class, it was simply a course called “Intro to Computer Science” and I did enjoy it, but I have many concerns, and the most important one being, I am deathly afraid of doing phone calls because all I’ve ever dealt with was frustration and feelings of pure helplessness. And I’ve encountered many, many posts that say that you’re likely have to begin working at an IT Help desk for a period of time before you progress “up the ladder”. I do like helping people, but I cannot for the life of me deal with people that automatically treat me like shit when I can’t hear them or ask them to repeat themselves more than a few times. EVEN also in person, not just on the phone. Thus making me want to not work a career with much people or at all, but that’s damn hard to find, as it’s nearly impossible. It gets SO mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausting constantly trying to strain my ears and constantly trying to understand people and constantly having to tell people over and over that I have a hearing disability. I feel like no one has patience anymore. So this leads to a cycle of depressing feelings often. I have talked to a couple of therapists before, but found not much success. It’s very difficult and discouraging. 
This big reason holds me back from doing most things, thus stagnating my growth.. I am afraid of pursuing a college degree because I don’t want to end up in debt.. or end up with something ‘useless’. Unless I really make sure I have good connections and get an internship somewhere. I am not good at math, but I do enjoy certain facets of technology, built my own computer, but I also love to be outside, interacting with nature. I have also been told by many people that I should be a graphic designer/tattoo artist/web designer/etc. but I feel like there’s absolutely no stability in those. I also feel like people wouldn’t already take me seriously as a woman if I was to go into the tech field without a lengthy list of credentials, and on top of that already struggling with my disability. I have pondered if I could get into IT healthcare, but worried about any automation, like with data entry or whatever. So I don’t know if I should just try to get into an entry level at a healthcare company (even though most entry level positions require heavy phone communication, which I truly feel useless with), or try to pursue a college education part time while working at a plant nursery, hoping to find a better paying/stable job, that is also willing to accommodate my hearing disability. 
I have been thinking of doing an associate’s in CompSci and then getting an GIS (Geographic info. Systems) Certificate to hopefully maybe do field work type stuff, but I know that most things involving CompSci for higher positions require a bachelor’s in CompSci, but I want to at least start somewhere entry-level with a good pay and then progress from an associate’s to a bachelor’s when I can, but I don’t know anymore. :/"

Now I understand that she will want to visit me, and have some control, that's really no problem for me even if I'm not there, IF shed at least ask and respect my wishes.
Im a busy person with school and Internship, therefore things like cleaning up after myself get pushed to weekends and holidays. Things pile up because im very tired often and am still figuring out schedules and such.
For those reasons I dont want her to clean up after me at all, again and again and again and again, because if she does it I cannot learn to do it myself. I explained this on numerous occasions being careful not to upset her because when I expressed before that I would like her to at least ask or tell me when shes coming over, she got upset at me.
I need advice on how to tell her, Im getting so frustrated.
It really makes me very upset when she changes things or picks up my stuff when I already made plans and that just tears them apart. I told her, I will tell you when I really do need help, but it just doesnt get through.. I get she just wants to be nice but it really messes with my progress.

What was the point of getting me my own apartment if I can't even have that independence and privacy. I feel like my boundaries are being walked all over and I dont know what to do about it, cause I dont wanna hurt her feelings, she means well. And I also understand she pays for it, but again, what was the point..?

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing because I am in need of advice for choosing the right education path to follow.

&amp;#x200B;

About me:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  \*   attended a bilingual high school and grown up in Hungary

&amp;#x200B;

  \*   currently studying Financial Management and Services in Denmark in English, starting the 6th semester

  \*   Did 2 Erasmus semesters - an educational one during the 3rd semester in Porto at Catholica Business School and a compulsory internship in Budapest at KPMG as a VAT preparer

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am speaking on a pretty high and professional level in English, though I am not confident in it so I was thinking I might hire a speech developer or a tutor who develops my interpersonal skills in English to the maximum  for around half a year (Idea 1)

&amp;#x200B;

I have done German B2 - intermediate language exam in 2018 but I have forgotten a lot since then so I might wanna bring back that knowledge and even inprove to a professional level to discuss basics topics in the corporate world (Idea 2). I assume it will take at least one year but rather 1,5 year to achieve such a goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Since finishing my bachelor in January 2024, I am planning to do masters somewhere either in Aarhus (no need to relocate my whole life and relatively easy admission requirements), in Wien (study in English but of course have the opportunity to develop my German skills and be close to my Hungarian friends and family) or (the next big idea) in Spain somewhere (my dream was always to live in the mediterranean area, and I also have some really basics in Portuguese ).

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, it is a big decision from my side thus I want to do the Masters where I will finally settle down for a life.

&amp;#x200B;

I look forward to hearing all the personal experiences and opinions and advices.

10yr62j,1,2023-02-10,What should I do about this potential internship?,JukeBoxHero1997,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10yr62j/what_should_i_do_about_this_potential_internship/," 

First time posting here. If this doesn't belong here, let me know and where to post it.

Background:

I (25M) just started going back to college this semester after dropping out when I was 21. Back then, I didn't know what I wanted to do for a major/career, so I tried a few things before just dropping out to save some money. Last year, I got my General Studies associate's degree and took some time after to figure out my next move. I'm still not sure what I want to do, but I decided that I don't want to put off getting *a degree* any longer, so I enrolled in what I believe to be a sort of jack-of-all-trades type of degree: mechanical engineering. It seems like it would open up many doors both in and outside of engineering, giving me a wide range of options for high-paying careers after I graduate. If nothing else, it at least gets me in college to use their career services to find a career to pursue.

To the main problem:

In addition to completing around 120 credit hours of classes, any engineering degree has a requirement to complete a program (Engineering+) that requires doing any 3 out of 7 options. These are things like studying abroad, completing a leadership course, earning a minor or second major, and of course, working at an internship/co-op.

I was recommended to do the last one and told to start applying now because companies would be hiring for the summer soon. I found one that my friend also works at, so I asked if he could put in a good word for me. He did, and I have an interview scheduled this upcoming Thursday. Here's the problem: this friend heard about the details through the grapevine, and believes that, if I get the internship, they'll have me start within a week after the interview. And I don't know how I feel about this.

On one hand, it could be a good thing, because then I can knock out the Engineering+ requirement much sooner since I already completed an associate's degree. It'll also bring income, which is nice considering I'm living off of my savings (I do have a safety net for when this runs out, but I don't want to use it if I don't have to. Plus, I was planning on getting a job sometime anyway). And it's a great opportunity to get some work experience, though I have a fair amount, but in this case, in a more professional field.

On the other hand, I only just started back at college. I'm only taking 13 credit hours currently, but it still feels daunting (especially because I'm taking Calc 2 this semester). I was hoping and planning that it would start in the summer so that I could get adjusted to being in college again before adding more to my plate. Plus, I wanted to be sure I could give the time I need to pass Calc 2, since it's one of the hardest courses I'll take, according to the engineering majors I've talked to so far, and I'd like to get that out of the way. I also wanted to take the time to talk to the career services to figure out if this is even the path/major I want to pursue, or if there's something that's a better fit. There's other reasons, but these are the bigger reasons that matter to others, I suppose.

I don't want to risk the opportunity because if I do end up needing it, then I'll have it. Plus, I don't want to seem ungrateful to them, and especially not my friend who helped me. I just don't know if I should take the opportunity, and whether I'm ready for it or not. I only applied now and got the ball rolling because everyone was saying that it wouldn't be until the summer that I would even start. I just don't know what to do."

First some  context, I am intermediate-ly good at python and C but not much else.  I've been trying to go from python to AI/ML, basically machine learning,  NLP, and all that jazz but I haven't gotten anywhere, I just can't seem  to build interest (or maybe I'm just that lazy). But web dev kind of  scares me as it's quite popular and many do it, idk if that's stupid of  me to think like that but supply and demand. There are more web devs  than AI/ML coders I'm sure. With web dev, to me, MERN stack looks very  appealing, but the problem is I don't have any expertise in any of it.

1. How good is MERN stack?
2. How does it compare to the scope of AI/ML?
3. I have to apply for internships this summer and I don't know what to choose.
4. I have around 2 years left in finishing my graduate degree.
5. How good is it for internships?
6. Difference in stipend for both? Is it big? (for freshers)
7. How much will it take to build a competent level of expertise in those fields?
8. Can I be industry-ready in time?"

I've tried out all of my clothes and selected all the ones that fit me and are season appropriate. I'm going to create a top, bottom and accessory shelf. Each day I'm going to select a top and a bottom that I must wear, regardless of how I'm feeling. Of course I can pick an extra jacket or jumper should it be a bit cold out. The accessories will be my choice to make the outfit work. I'll also have a shell with ""fancier"" dress because lord knows I'm not watering a corset on a Tuesday going to the grocery store. I will challenge myself to get wear an outfit of the fancy rack once a week though, this will encourage me to go out with friends or on date- I used to love getting dressed. Shoes are obviously my choice as well and categories like gym wear and swimwear don't count (for obvious reasons). Basically I'm trying to make a ""fix my rut"" capsule wardrobe. 

Basically I'm asking- does this sound like a good idea? And I feel a bit silly doing this so if there are any fashion girlies out there who could help me with my clothing selection I'd so love that.

Thank you all xo"

I’m a teacher and I get 2 months in the summer off. I plan to finish the program within 12 months but not make the career transition for another year due to me needing 2 years to get my loans forgiven. I have great relationship with the tech at my school who has CS degree and he is willing to let me shadow him and hopefully I can intern with him over the next 2 summers.  I’m thinking I can learn from him and possibly have an in with district for other openings to get my foot in the door. The techs at my school have traditionally been jacks of all trades and severely overworked and underpaid but I think it could be a great learning opportunity. My question is how long do your typical IT internships last? Is 8-16 weeks enough to be considered valuable experience?  I’m really trying to avoid taking a pay cut (50k now) as I have a wife and 2 kids.

10yuxlp,10,2023-02-10,Should I be worried about leaving my first internship on bad terms?,murmidon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10yuxlp/should_i_be_worried_about_leaving_my_first/,"TL;DR Version: I want to leave before my contract date ends, but I'm worried about future companies calling my employer

I'm already 75% finished with the internship but I feel like I'm wasting my time, and the remaining portion of the internship is unpaid (first part was paid.)

Long version:

I signed a contract for unpaid part time software dev job from late december to end of feb, however I switched to a minimum wage full time position from December to mid January (with the same employer), with the understanding that I will continue to work unpaid part time until the end of feb.

Essentially I signed 2 contracts, the first one was unpaid, the second one was paid (and overlapped the first one by a month).

Upon starting the internship, I found out there were zero full time engineers since they all quit before I joined. There were 2 other interns, and the boss was relying on us to ship a product. I was the most productive out of the interns. (One of them was even sleeping on the job, and the boss didnt seem to care)

Early February, after getting the paycheck, I texted my boss I was quitting. My boss was very upset, he tried to offer more flexible hours but I refused and he said I can't just leave because I haven't finished the number of hours I was supposed to.

I want to have this internship on my CV but I'm worried about future companies calling and obviously I will get badmouthed. Should I be concerned about this and finish off my internship, or should I just leave?"

COVID destroyed my last years of high school and I'm struggling, I get some money from odd jobs to survive but I can't just... live. I've tried applying locally and no where is hiring or if they are, simply don't give me hours. The prime example of this is a fast food place giving me 2 hours a day, and its an hour walk away. I don't have a car, I can't even drive because a combination of my father simply not giving me the time to practice, and my crippling anxiety around cars making it near impossible in the first place.   


So I turned my gaze online, I've been trying out websites like Indeed to apply for various software development, modeling, tech support jobs. The issue is if I do get a response, which is rare, I just am told I don't meet qualifications because they want experience. 

I can't go into into college yet, I need some money in order to do so, even if I get some I could then go into college, and get a college internship. A 'I need money to make money' situation.  


So, my question is, with my skill set, how can I get money? How can I search for a job?  


Computer Science  
\- Linux Fundamentals through daily driving Linux Desktop and setting up media servers for friends  
\- IT experience through my school for 3 years  
\- Web development experience from learning how to develop on chromebooks (school issued) for 2 years  
\- Java development experience for 2 years (high school class at the college level + Coding competition)  
\- C++ development experience for 2 years ( high school class at the college level + another coding competition)  
\- Unity game engine experience (8 months)  
\- 3d modeling (6 months solo + single semester high school class)

General Experience  
\- Customer support via IT experience at my school  
\- Office 365 experience via high school  
\- Math education up to calculus 1  
\- Problem solving skills via team lead for FBLA  


I have more skills but this is the general grasp. There has to be something out there I'm missing, some company hiring or some odd job. I can't find it, I've been trying for months, I can't find anything. So please, any resources you can recommend? this helpless feeling from not progressing in my life fucking sucks."

You will work with Golang, Kubernetes, Typescript, React, and many advanced technologies to build the cloud developer workspace of the future.

About you

    You care deeply about your craft. We build to last. Our customers deploy our software on-premises, so we want to make sure we get things right the first time. And we’re going to build a SaaS product, so automated testing will be essential for continuous delivery.

    You want to work in a startup where your job isn’t just writing code but helping make the whole company successful

    You want to have a major impact and grow as a professional in an opportunity-rich, supportive environment

While not necessary, we’ll be even more excited if you have:

    Know the Go programming language

    Have worked on enterprise applications, developer tools, or on-premises software

    Like connecting directly with customers

    Have experience with infrastructure technologies like Kubernetes, Nomad, and EC2

Interview Process
We believe that the interview process should be consistent and enjoyable. We prefer the entire process to take no more than two full weeks. During these two weeks, you will be able to meet a mix of individual contributors, managers, and one of our Co-Founders. If you interview for a position requiring a take-home assessment, we will compensate you for your work and time. 

Our Values
Harness Your Inner Geek 🤓
Be who you are, use your unique talents to solve the problems you see, shout out your colleagues’ contributions and abilities, and be transparent and driven about what motivates you to do your best work here at Coder.

We’re going to fail sometimes, and that’s how we get better. Risks are a path to innovation, so we value bold, informed, fast-paced experimentation. And we also want you to communicate when it works – or when it doesn’t – so that we all can learn from each other.

Take Action with Ownership 🤝
Don’t wait for someone to give you permission to get things done. At Coder, we find leverage quickly and generate outcomes while staying lean. We don’t want you to “stay in your lane” - we want you to get curious, go after problems, and ship smart solutions together with your teammates. If you pick something up, take it to the finish line.

Don’t F$#k Your Team 🏆
We love what we do and work to achieve success together. We all win when we pitch in. We have fun and keep our goal in mind: to build a product that solves our users’ problems better than anything else.

Advice?",throwawaylobaby,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10z0zic/24f_college_senior_here_been_living_with_my_27m/,"Like the title says, I have been living with my boyfriend since May 2022. We have been dating almost a year (Feb 14), and have known each other since August 2020, when we met as coworkers.

When I moved in with him and his daughter in May, I was originally just going to stay for the summer. I'm a college student and was closer to work from his apartment than where I stayed with my great-aunt (35 Mins away). I haven’t lived with my great-aunt in a while because our relationship wasn’t the best, and she lives in a very remote area, which would definitely increase my drive time. I worked part-time (but as much as I could) and was giving him $400-$500 a month. I would also buy some groceries here and there and watch his daughter a couple nights when he has to work. I wasn't making that much but it was eh somewhat manageable. As the year went on and fall classes started again, we went through a lot in our relationship, but at that point, it was too late to stay on campus, so I just dealt with it. It especially became hard staying with him as we would get eviction notices on the door every so often as he was backed up on rent. In the fall, he realized his Rent Relief didn't get accepted so he had to pay $5,000+ of back rent. If it wasn't for his grandmother and mother, we would've been put out.

Then in December my best friend suggested we get an off campus apartment together for our last semester in college. I told my boyfriend about it, but I wasn't just ready to leave. We had been staying together for a while and developed a routine. I would miss our late-night talks and eating meals together. He decided to move to a cheaper apartment (12 mins from my college), and when we talked about if I was coming, I said yes. However, for a back-up plan, I still did get the apartment (fully covered by my tuition, except for a $15 apartment insurance and utility bill every month or too). So, I could be saving money by staying. Also with the problems we went through before, I thought it would be smart to get a backup just in case.

In January as we prepared to move, my boyfriend and I talked about bills and how much I would be paying a month (minimum of $400. Rent is $985, utilities not included). And I figured, I could do that. That was until this pay period ended and I got paid. I got about $500, which was more than I normally get ($400) because we had a small bonus. $150 went to the wifi bill (actually is $175 but I couldn't afford more), $120 to my car insurance and then $170 for a required textbook I needed. That was my whole paycheck and I only get paid every two weeks.

My boyfriend and I keep our finances separate, so I don't ask him for money. But now I'm down to almost nothing. And just thinking, I can’t afford to do this. Not trying to work, go to class, plus my internship (MWF 9A-4P) AND homework. And the store I work is very high on their hours, so asking for extra hours gets denied.

I will be receiving a refund check soon and my taxes, so that'll help out a lot, but last night, I brought it up briefly in text to him that this might not be something I can do.

I should've been a lot smarter about this situation. This was my first time living with someone and paying bills and it's a lot harder than I thought. And now, his car was recently stolen so he’s been borrowing mine (he puts gas in it), which leaves him in a tough spot if I just leave. It's been a lot of stress between us with everything going on and I can feel the relationship failing again...

I feel terrible now for not being able to fall through.

10z1g7i,1,2023-02-10,Completely overwhelmed with my first job out of college. Advice on how to cope?,thisistherealmee,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10z1g7i/completely_overwhelmed_with_my_first_job_out_of/,"WARNING: long post ahead. Skip to the tl;dr at the bottom if you don’t wanna read this whole thing.

I graduated in December and just started my job 2 weeks ago. It was my dream company in a highly competitive leadership development program. I also interned at this company last summer and actually enjoyed my internship and got the return offer.

The pay is good, benefits are great, most of the people are super kind and helpful. The issue is not the company or program that I’m in and I’ll make it clear that I do NOT want to quit.

But ever since graduating I have been suffering really bad from post-grad depression. I LOVED my college experience and I haven’t felt this empty and depressed in YEARS. 

For my first rotation in this job they have me working as a project manager for a very large scale, complex, ambiguous project. Just to give you all an idea I work for a big name large finance company. This project involves a ton of stakeholders, ton of finance terms and knowledge, and will have a huge impact on our clients. It is a lot of responsibility and tbh I’m very overwhelmed bc I feel lost and don’t really know what I’m doing or even what I don’t understand.

On the one hand I’m really flattered and grateful that they trusted me with such a huge responsibility, but I’m feeling major imposter syndrome and that coupled with my depression has left me feeling unmotivated and hopeless.

Even just getting out of bed and getting ready for work is exhausting and I have been crying every day.

The other issue is that my project sponsor isn’t very nice. She comes across kind of harsh and it seems like she’s kind of expecting me to know everything in my second week. I feel very intimidated by her. Luckily she is not my manager and my manager is very nice and understanding- but I work much more closely with the project sponsor.

The good news is, since this is a rotational program I’m only in this role for 6 months so I just need to tough it out but once again, I’m feeling so depressed, anxious, and hopeless it’s hard for me to do anything.

The other thing I’m really struggling with is how much forced socialization is required in the corporate world. I have extreme social anxiety to the point where having to attend large social gatherings (which there are a lot of in this program) literally makes me so anxious to the point that I am nauseous and having full on panic attacks. The worst part is the other people my age in this program are very cliquey and snooty and I don’t fit in with them at all. We had a dinner last week and I was literally holding back tears the entire time and couldn’t even eat my food I was so nauseous. I am stuck with these people and am straight up terrified to have to keep going to these social events with them. 

Luckily, my job gives us 18 free therapy sessions a year so I went ahead and scheduled a therapy appointment next week. I’m really hoping that helps but until then- I’ve been crying every day and feeling so much dread.

Any advice on how to handle this? Does it ever get better?

Tl;dr just started my first post-grad job and I’m overwhelmed, depressed, and anxious. Also struggling with social anxiety and there are a lot of work social events I have to attend for this job. Seeing a therapist but wanted advice on how to cope until then."

Then landed a 1 year contract 2019-2020 working for top 25 company in Forensic Accounting (which is a fancy way of saying external Auditing of businesses abroad.) My contract lapsed as the pandemic happened and the gap keeps getting bigger.

I've considered learning IT but without structure, I highly doubt I can self-teach consistently because of too many distractions.

I am tech savy. Put together my first PC at the age of 19, and can pretty much put together a computer with minimal assistance from outside resources.

I just don't know what to do.

Do I join the military? I don't want to go back to retail work.

I do well in stressful/high pressure situations. My contract work was basically that. High intensity, fast paced projects with big downtime gaps. We were given a week to absorb information to prepare for the project, and sometimes we had to do that while completing the project simultaneously. No guidance and minimal teaching basically.

My only problem was that work was inconsistent with the big gaps, while earning good money, my schedule was wrecked and I picked up bad habits.

I don't want to be stuck in this career limbo for the second time and don't know what to do."

I’m a second year cs student and I managed to land an internship at this start up as a part time gig. At first everything was fine with the internship the person “mentoring” me was patient and helpful but now it’s really stressing me out. Every time I asked a question I get a passive aggressive response which never helps. It has gotten to a point where even asking questions really stresses me out. For example they allowed us to choose our own tasks and I wanted to try something with react since I want to fully learn but when I ask simple questions I get hit with “I don’t think this task is suitable for you” or “Try asking smarter questions next time as it might break your trust with your team”. I also don’t get much mentorship I just google everything which I get is part of the job but I wish I had someone to point me to the right direction sometimes. So should I just quit or ride it out so I have something on my resume?

Am I also overreacting or this is not what an internship should be like?"

10z5o7y,2,2023-02-10,Do recruiters blacklist candidates?,cryingtomatto,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10z5o7y/do_recruiters_blacklist_candidates/,"About two years ago, I was interviewing for a major news outlet (let’s call it News Company). I reached round two of three and was very excited for the opportunity. I was also interviewing for multiple other companies, however, and ultimately received an offer from another company before News Company could get back to me about round 3. I reached out to the News Company recruiter and informed her of the situation, asking if she could somehow expedite the process or let me know if I made it to the final round. 

She politely told me that they were still unsure of who they’d move forward. The thing was, I was in a tight financial spot and quickly needed an income, and the offer I got was an exploding offer. Consequently, I declined News Company and took the exploding offer (after negotiating a higher salary, of course). 

Two years later, I’ve come to realize I now dislike my job and regret that decision. I’ve tried reaching out to the original News Company recruiter and she ghosts me every time. I’ve applied to probably ten more positions at News Company since (including internships!), and get immediately declined now. Is this because of me turning them down? Or am I overthinking it and my applications have probably just not properly fit the roles? Also, I know from LinkedIn that the same recruiter works there who I interviewed with/was in contact with. 

Thanks so much!"

Just to introduce myself, I'm(22m) a South Korean residing in Singapore, but i grew up here since I was 3. I've gone to a local school and currently hold a poly diploma. Despite the long stay here, I still could not secure a PR or Citizenship, and am currently staying here on a Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP)

And now the problem. I've been struggling to find a job with my diploma since graduating, as I am a foreigner and need to be issued a work permit, and most smaller companies that I can work in as an entry level staff doesn't have a work pass quota for me, and I'm not quite skilled enough to work at bigger companies. I've opted now to look for different jobs irrelevant to my field of study. Thus far I've had a roof over my head staying with my parents and I've been doing art commissions to earn a small income for myself. It was enough for me to survive, but not quite enough to save anything up. I am also 20k+ in debt due to attending poly under a tuition grant loan, as I had to pay for my school fees while attending school as my parents aren't rich at all.

This week my life has hit rock bottom, as my parents told me last minute that they have been extending their LTVP visa to stay in singapore, and are not being permitted another extension. They are leaving singapore to go back to korea for good, and tells me that I had 3 days to pack my things and leave the house. Well 4 days have passed, and I am temporarily staying at my friend's place (which I am not allowed to stay for much longer due to his parents, and desperately looking for a job and a place to stay. I have no savings, but am able to hustle some amount of money to survive plus secure a job within the next month or 2, which I am currently working on, after which I intend to move to a co-living environment. But due to having no savings, I am not able to down pay any deposit for a immediate rental room, and am not able to move to anywhere on my own accord. Needless to say, I couldn't find any place that I can stay in for a month and pay at the end of the first month without deposit, and frankly I dont think that kind of places exist here in Singapore. I also couldn't find any other friends with spare room, that's willing to let me bunk in for a month or 2 (paying rent + helping with chores of course) before I can move out on my own accord. I'm really out of options and quite frankly lost as to what to do. Any advice?

TL;DR Lost a roof over my head with no immediate savings to afford rent. Need advice/options



Edit: Just to clarify my current qualifications, I graduated with a diploma in Games Design and development from singapore polytechnic. Internship done at a local game company as an artist/programmer. I have also worked on several commission projects to make games and websites for clients in the past. Feel free to dm if you want more information, I just kept things brief to protect my identity.


Updates: Managed to secure a potential job interview this coming tuesday thanks to a redditor! things are looking more hopeful :). As for a place to stay, I will be staying with my friend till 19 Feb, and depending on how the interview goes I should be able to move in somewhere. Thank you so much everyone for your generosity and kindness, frankly I don't think I deserved so much from everyone :) I'll keep things updated here or maybe even post a separate post somewhere but anyways thanks so much once again!

Update 2: Job interview didn't go well, seems like I don't meet the qualifications for a Letter of Consent to be issued. I'll need to try and find a place with an available S pass quota it seems. Thank you everyone thats helped me out!! I'm trying my best to make it count!"

10za1t1,3,2023-02-10,Does Mobile Engineering have oncall?,Traditional_Break467,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10za1t1/does_mobile_engineering_have_oncall/,"I work in Backend-Distributed Systems in big tech. I have 1.5 years of full time experience and 2 internships. While I like the complexity and technicality of Backend, I absolutely hate oncall because more often than not it just boils down to firefighting, not supporting the services you wrote. 

Based on my conversations with Senior Engineers and me getting contacted for Mid-level Backend positions by recruiters, it looks like oncall will be inevitable, as long as I stay in Backend. I have done some research, and it seems that iOS/Android Developers rarely deal with oncall, if ever. Even when they do, it’s very light. I have worked on some iOS apps in the past and liked the process.

I am thinking about switching to iOS, so I would like to get some feedback from folks on this subreddit. Do Mobile Engineers have to deal with oncall?

Note: before oncall fanatics jump on me, I should say that the reason why you have to do oncall is because companies want to save money, by not hiring dedicated SREs. I like coding, but I also have life outside of work"
10zayv5,7,2023-02-10,Just had my DS internship interview — here is what he asked,NathanA2CsAlt,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/10zayv5/just_had_my_ds_internship_interview_here_is_what/,"Slightly different, but I figured since some of you aspiring Data Science, Computer Science, and other nerds might be applying for internships, here are some questions that I was asked.  

1. Tell me about yourself (sound familiar?) 
2. What relevant background do you have for the internship? 
3. Why are you interested in Data Science/Computer Science? 
4. What is the difference between Data Scientist and Data Analyst? 
5. What are 5 skills you think are essential to a good Data Scientist? 
6. We are currently trying to solve x problem, what data do you think might help with solving this problem? 
7. We are trying to incentivize people to use our new product. How would you do that? 
8. Are you familiar with a modern data pipeline, KPIs (and other industry terms), Snowflake, or SQL? 
9. If tomorrow Ice sank instead of floated, what would you do?  

This was a data science internship for context. Hope this helps! (Job found through linkedin job posts)"

3. Miss \*insert school name\* winner, basically the equivalent of being prom queen but had to compete in a beauty pageant/talent show for the title against some other girls 
4. florida senate page
5. ap scholar with distinction

**Letters of Recommendation**

International Relations teacher/MUN sponsor - really great, he let me read and edit it, I work with him heavily for MUN and I also got a 100 in his IR class

AP Chinese teacher - didn't read but she spent a lot of time and effort on it, and I have had her as a teacher for 3 years

College Counselor - really eccentric guy, he mentioned to me he wrote heavily on how ""meta-cognitive"" I come across lol

Lawfirm Internship - read it and it talked heavily about my positive work ethic and my diverse background

**Interviews**

Georgetown - first interview and it occurred legit right after dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian so I didn't even have internet to practice interview questions, was in person and went really well. He even texted me after EA decisions to ask me if I got in 

Washington &amp; Lee - zoom interview, probably my favorite one so far, we had a really great discussion and it was funny because I was doing it in an office building and the fire alarm went off during it but I persevered

Duke - zoom interview, another good interview, nothing negative to say, interviewer was very friendly and very passionate about his experience from Duke and said he would put in a great word for me

**Essays**

I feel weird about my personal statement because I wrote it 19 different times and really feel like I overthought it, but I don't think it completely sucked. I used a creative format to write about my experience participating in environmental stewardship and activism on a backpacking journey I took on Vancouver Island.  

Supplementals I'm not too sure where I stand. I was recycling a lot at the end seeing the amount of schools I applied to, but the material I was recycling was decent enough I felt. I think my best supplementals went to Georgetown, Tufts, and GW. 

UC App - I am very curious to see what ends up happening with the UC schools because I did the entire app the night before the deadline. I basically spent 12 am to 3 am doing the 4 essays, and I limited myself to 30 minutes to do each one. Despite that, I actually think my 4 UC essays were the best college essays I wrote. I completely zoned out when writing them and actually had such a genuinely fun time writing them. Due to how late it was, I felt like my true writing voice really shined through, and I didn't sound as polished as I did for some other schools. Some of the essay topics were some emotional memories of being part of my MUN team, and my progression from being horrible at dance to winning a school talent show for dance after years of practicing Kpop dances lol. Even looking back at them now, I still think the essays sound really solid.

**Additional Information:**

**I'm honestly kinda terrified I won't even land UF at the end of the month. I know my stats aren't the best considering some of the schools I applied to, and that's why I applied to so many to try to maximize my chances. Some may ask me why I didn't try to improve my math SAT score, and I really really tried my best. I actually got a 560 3 times in a row, and when I finally landed a 650, it felt like an absolute miracle to me. Just feeling really pressured rn, hopefully I will have at least one more acceptance by the time April rolls around. Honestly the UNC rejection didn't bother me too badly because I saw it coming a mile away, but with UVA just now I'm starting to feel my resolve breaking. I will do my best to remain hopeful and to remain grateful for even being accepted to a college. Will update in April.**"
10zbfgi,27,2023-02-10,so you asked me what I was going to do on my PTO to deny me?,Fleshypudge,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/10zbfgi/so_you_asked_me_what_i_was_going_to_do_on_my_pto/,"This happened to me about 5 years ago. I moved this from malicious compliance as it didn't quite fit there. 

I am a therapist that does treatment in an outpatient setting. When I first graduated college I was hired at my internship. The push wasn't great and it wasn't what I wanted to do in life (I wanted to work with kids and teens in a school based setting but this was dual diagnosis with mostly adults in an inner city setting) but the experience was growing on me and I was new to the area and didn't know what was out there.

I had a decent supervisor for internship who became my supervisor for my job, let's call her Carol.  Carol was always supportive and quirky. For 2 years she got to know me and my struggles. She saw in me supervisor potential and had me over see future interns. She had me build a relationship with the homeless shelter in the area to provide services there as well. 

I was given challenge clients from the start like hard males, sex offenders, recently on parole and severe mental health (might have been because I was male and male therapist in my area are rare. I was know as the cheer leader of the team. I stayed through 3 groups of turn over going from noob to veteran in  2 years time and mentored staff.

One of the therapist who left joined another agency with another therapist. They both frequently told me I should come. I declined many times, until .. let's call her Karen. Karen came from a recently closed office after it was shut down by the state for fraud or waste or abuse (one of them). she was the director there and had been the only staff member to not be let go (I'm not sure how.. since it was 60k in Medicaid dollars that was paid back).

At the time we had one school based program and I was not in it. We obtained a new district and I finally had the chance to do my dream job. I was offered the chance to pioneer the 4 schools in that district. It was a clunky start but was going well and the schools liked me. Then Karen came and was given the job of school based director which meant my supervisor had to be changed. 

Now I didn't know any better but I heard rumors. I was polite and worked on building a working relationship with her. One day I was invited to a training hosted by the agency that my friend worked at. I bumped into them naturally and they convinced me to do a side job with them since I was recently licensed. They stressed how much better it was in every way. 

For those who don't know, burn out and commission fatigue can significantly affect a person's performance. I was starting to feel this way about my main job and wanted to explore this option. The new job required training on a Thursday. At the time I worked s mom Georgia l flexible 4 day schedule and needed to take PTO. 

I put in the request like normal (mind you I rarely took off) and my supervisor, Karen, asked me why I needed off. Historically I had told my previous supervisor many reasons and it was never an issue. I didn't think anything of it and shared about my second employment having a training they only happens on Thursdays once a month. Karen, who frequently left an hour early because of her side job, declined my time stating it was against company policy to take PTO for another job. I was shocked. I put in a single day one month early and she declined on policy. 

Now remember I said that I was the cheer leader for the team. The team expanded beyond just my fellow therapist. It included supervisors in multiple departments,. IT (I was super close with them because I was volunteering time to help improve our records system), billing, payroll, medical, and my closest non therapist friend... THE HEAD OF HR. 

So upon seeing the email I sent straight over to review the policy. She saw how angry I was and cleared her schedule to review. Wouldn't you know that policy stated that an employee is entitled to PTO at long as the conditions are met which were. Advanced notice of 3 days or more for 1 day, having time accrued, and not being in their probationary period. In addition supervisors can't ask why I'm taking PTO and if they do I do not need to answer. I'm sure none of you will be surprised when I say I met these easily. She told me she couldn't deny it.. she had no grounds and there was in fact no policy that stated what she said in the email. I replied ""can you reply to the email I send you with this information in 2 minutes"".

After getting what I needed in writing I sent straight away with the policy and evidence in hand. I told her that she cannot be l reject my PTO and that I will be taking my time off in a month. If there is a coverage need I will have it sorted before then and that nothing will be left unfinished as I have always been efficient. She attempted to argue that I cannot take PTO for another job. I showed her the policy in writing where it said she wasn't allowed to ask what told her "" I could be going to the doctor, the dentist, a birthday, a wedding.. hell I could go take off to kill myself and you still can't ask or deny me. Please sign or I will have HR sign for you""

Karen angrily said""you will get your day, you will get your day. It's just the executive director doesn't like that people take off for other jobs."". I reminded her that she only knew because I was kind enough to share which I will not need to ever again so she should not ask and they I could also inform the executive director of your early leave times for your other job too if it would be helpful. She stayed quiet and gave me my signed paper. 

I quit a couple of months after because the new job was in fact significantly better. 


As a small side note, they almost lost the new district when I left. She didn't do any communication that they would be replacing me and I got called in by the principal and school counselor who literally said "" what the fuck do you mean your done in a week? Who's replacing you?"" I had been told that she would communicate as it was the chain of command and she never told them during my one month notice.  I saved them that district too."

Also, for those who have experience, how difficult and what are the specific requirements for switching into eecs? Just wanted to see if this option is open as the other schools I’ve been admitted to (gt, umich) allow me to pursue cs without the whole switching process.

I'm currently a sophomore mechanical engineering student at a top-5 university in Canada, who is considering an application for a Stanford transfer by March 15th.

I realize that the odds of an international transfer to Stanford are extremely tough (in addition that the \~1-5% transfer rate to Stanford is already super low by itself.)

Given my background and transfer reasons (developed below)  I was hoping to ask:

**(i)** is it still worthwhile for me to apply for a Stanford transfer?

and **(ii)** is it worth applying for a transfer to other US colleges (Cornell, Columbia, UPenn) with higher transfer acceptance rates?

**My Reasons for Applying to a Stanford Transfer**

* Proximity to a global startup hub (Silicon Valley)
* Opportunity to meet and learn from students at Stanford as part of the school's startup/builder culture
* Opportunity to contribute to research at SAIL

**My Background**

* **Freshman/Sophomore Years (Last \~20 months)**
   * Selected as a World Finalist (top 48 around the world) at the 2022 Microsoft Imagine Cup for developing a 3D-printed robotic arm for respiratory disease diagnostics in developing countries. Currently developing this project as a startup, which has received early funding and was invited to join a yearly Canada-wide program to support a small cohort of Canadian AI founders, which offers up to 6-figures in funding via a SAFE agreement
   * Hired as the first data scientist for a pre-seed startup (working remotely part-time). I built the first prototype of the core API during my freshman year. Following an investment round a few months ago, the startup now has a 7-figure valuation and received 6 figures in investments.
   * Received a 5-figure fellowship to pursue an internship in the Asia-Pacific. I subsequently worked at the R&amp;D Unit of Japan's largest industrial drone company for a Summer, developing internal visualization tools and developing neural nets to predict drone motor performance
   * During my free time in Japan, I hiked mountains and visited Buddhist temples, and I'm planning to write about experiences and insights from these experiences in the coming months.
   * Led an 8-person team that secured 5-figures in monetary sponsorship for my university's largest student-run hackathon (we welcomed \~440 selected in-person participants)
   * Research experience
      * Co-author on a paper that won 1st place (1 of 2 categories) at an AI undergrad research competition: UofT's Project X (with participating teams from Canada, US and UK). We're looking to present our research in person at an AI conference next month.
      * 3rd author of a published article highlighting clinical AI trends in dermatology
      * Got involved with 2 other CS-related research projects at my university, though no published work as of yet.
   * 2nd Place (PRHI challenge) at HackMIT 2022 for a handheld exoskeleton that can be controlled via a webcam
   * Gave a TEDx talk (currently published on YouTube)
   * Taught 2 CS-related courses at MIT Splash
   * 3.62/4.0 GPA, though had 3.79/4.0 GPA in my freshman year. Selected courses that I completed: dynamics, advanced calc, ODEs, PDEs

&amp;#x200B;

* **During high school-equivalent in Canada:**
   * Presented original research at ISEF (and won a grand award)
   * 2x Bronze Medals at the Canada-Wide Science Fair (highest level of science fair in the country)
   * 3rd Place in Canada for the Sanofi Biogenius Competition
   * 3rd Place overall at HackHarvard 2019
   * Co-founded my high school's first hackathon, and subsequently organized 7 hackathons (2018-2023) that attracted \~1,300 participants in 6 years.
   * Elected student union president from a student body of 2,000
   * Developed natural language processing tools at Expedia (through their apprenticeship program), and subsequently built REST API endpoints for a local startup the following Summer
   * Ran an IRONMAN 70.3 distance race when I was 17, and raised funds for a humanitarian group

&amp;#x200B;

I realize this is an unconventional post, and I don't want to appear as someone who lists their achievements for self-satisfaction. I genuinely hope to study and build at Stanford, and I felt that it was relevant to share my work up to this point. I can always PM my contact and socials if verification of the above info is needed.

I truly hope for some guidance on whether a Stanford transfer is feasible, or whether UPenn/Cornell/Columbia/other US transfers would be worth considering.

Thank you in advance for your help, it's super appreciated!"

My reason is my school.  My first job I got right after college.  After gaining experience and starting my masters, I got my second job.  After completing my internship and with my graduation date posted, I have started my new one.

My masters ends in approximately 11 months and so does my last internship.  After that, I will probably look for another job to get hours for my license.

CSV files are ingested and, after some transformations, analytics and graphs are provided in a web application. If I were to be hired, could my job title be *Junior Data Engineer*? What should I be doing if I wanted that to be my role?

Hi, I'm a Computer Science B.Sc, yet to graduate.

A year ago I decided I wanted work towards entering into the Data Science field. Specifically, aiming for a Data Engineering role. I landed this internship whose title is ""*Internship in Big Data Analytics*"", but I'm not sure if the experience I am getting could enable me to portrait myself as an *entry-level Data Engineer* of sorts.

I basically work in a Data Pipeline that is going to be sold as a product/service. CSV Files are ingested by apache NiFi and data is stored in Cassandra and PostgreSQL. Then, an Spark application (coded in Scala) is launched to apply some transformations, store them and, finally, a web application present results in many dashboards to the end-user.

Some tasks I've done so far:

* Deploying the solution in docker, some troubleshooting and investigating how to configure some parameters in the application within the container. Working also with Linux servers.
* Documenting the Data Model, by reverse engineering the application. Describing the purpose of tables and columns.
* Doing Performance Tests on the application, identifying bottlenecks so execution takes acceptable times. Receiving a lot of support while doing it, not really diagnosing the problem and providing the solution on my own. Documenting reports about it.
* Re-implementing an already existing functionality to make it more efficient. Basically writing queries with Scala in SparkSQL. Working with an Scala codebase.
* Making sure NiFi was able to ingest files from an SFTP server.

I'm asking this because in roughly 3 months there's a high chance I'll be hired in this company to continue working in this same project. 

Having *Junior Data Engineer* in my job title would mean a lot to me, as I would have a better stance when applying for other positions elsewhere. When the time comes, I would like to have this conversation. But I'm not really sure I calling myself a *Junior Data Engineer* is stretching it too much...

This sub helped me a lot last year (though sadly I discovered it too late to make major changes to my apps and get into more schools), so I wanted to give back and share my advice. I'm an eldest child and didn't have anyone to guide me through this, so I wrote this up originally for my younger siblings immediately after I had finished the application process so they could have something to guide them (hence, you are totally allowed to brush it off and say ""pshaw, everyone knows this stuff"". I wrote it for kids who haven't even thought about college yet and don't know the stuff you guys do).

Anyway, now I'm posting it here for you guys. Take it with a grain of salt, as you should all advice here! I hope this helps someone.

**Intro**

This is based on my experiences applying in the 2021-22 application cycle to twelve colleges. I was accepted to Connecticut College, University of Connecticut (I'm here now!!!), and Rutgers. I was waitlisted from Colby and William &amp; Mary, and I was rejected by Vassar, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Swarthmore, Johns Hopkins, and Middlebury.

SAT was 1510, GPA was 3.98 weighted/4.65 unweighted. My high school was a technical/magnet school and I was in a special program for pre-healthcare, which is what I applied to schools as. I had good extracurriculars and fairly strong letters of recommendation. A lot of people assured me I was a great candidate but I got rejected from so many schools because I applied to the wrong schools for me (too many schools with very low acceptance rates, under 15%). I also rushed some of my applications because I put things off and then panicked. And I didn’t apply to schools that would likely have accepted me, like University of Rochester and Carnegie Mellon University, because I thought I was too good for them and envisioned myself at an Ivy League or T20 school.

Those were my mistakes. Here is how NOT to make them.

**Junior Year**

● Do tours, virtual tours (if school is too far away), and info sessions (can be virtual and in-person). Take detailed notes on everything because you WILL forget. Make a pro-con list for each college you get info on; all your info/brochures/notes etc in one paper folder (+ have a google drive folder for online notes)

* **EDIT**: TIP TIP TIP. If you do in-person tours, scout around for a copy of the campus newspaper. These are typically produced by students and available for free around campus. This will give you a good sense of what goes on around campus during a typical week, both good and bad, and may alert you to any big problems going on in the school (like budget cuts going into effect the year you would be attending!) Good way to get the real scoop!

● Make your college list (aka where you want to apply, not just dream schools), get it DONE. Use Naviance or a similar site. Reference the notes from tours you went on, or go on tours if you haven’t for schools you’re interested in. Don’t just focus on one type of school during this, clearly outline which schools are your safeties, middles, and tops.

● Take SATs and send ‘em to the schools you’re most interested in.

● At the end of the year, ask for 2-3 (2 is good) teacher letters of rec.

● Follow your counselor’s process for getting their letter of rec—mine had a google form where I just put in a bunch of info for her, you might need to write an email.

● Handy tip: make note if you have any really good papers/projects/experiences from this year. I had a good English paper I used to submit w/ my Princeton app, it might be handy to have some sort of folder/portfolio of your “best work”.

● OPTIONAL: End of junior year, ask for any coach/non-teacher letters of rec. You can also do this later.

**Summer after Junior Year**

● Do an activity that will help you—a service project, internship or job that relates to your future plans is good. You want something that will give you good material to talk or write about.

● Take each school on your list and research their interview policy—if they do optional interviews with alumni/admissions, DO IT. Some of them only do it in the Junior year summer and will be booked up by fall. If you’d rather wait for fall that’s fine too. The interviews are not that hard, colleges just want to get a sense of who you are “off paper,” so be yourself and be personable. Interviews do not play a big weight in their assessment of your application, so if you bomb, don’t panic, and if you ace it, don’t get too

● Find a few scholarships that look good but don’t worry too much yet (UNLESS they have early fall deadlines—then apply now!)

● Fill out the entire common app (minus supplementals).

● Start and make good progress on any Early Action/Early Decision school supplementals.

● If you can, start the supplementals for Regular Decision schools. Keep them all in one folder/doc/place.

● If you haven’t already, ask for any coach/non-teacher letters of rec.

● Formally request your letters of recommendation to be sent to the schools you picked. I did this through Naviance, your guidance dept should have an explanation of how to do it.

● Request your HS transcript from your counselor—I used Naviance, again, guidance should have an explanation for how your school will do it

**Senior Fall**

● Focus on school and grades. Colleges do care about senior year grades.

● Finish and submit EA/ED before or by deadlines - Before is better because a), less stress, and b), possibly earlier response back.

● If not already finished, finish supplementals for Regular Decision schools—ideally by early December to save stress! Also, some Regular Decision schools (like Rutgers, Uconn) have “priority deadlines” for merit aid, financial aid, Honors colleges, etc, and those deadlines can be November/December. If you can submit by those deadlines, DO IT. Submit RD once supplementals are done.

● Research and apply to scholarships.

● Do more college interviews.

**Miscellaneous Tips**

· College admissions are HARD. Getting in to *any* school is worth celebrating, and getting rejected is not a statement about you and your worth.

· If college is something you want, then it doesn’t matter which school you end up at. This seems counterintuitive but seriously, it’s true. At any college you will find: independence, cool course offerings, new friends, a huge variety of events and clubs, parties, great academics, good stuff, bad stuff. If you want the college experience, don’t worry too much about where you end up.

· DON’T SINK ALL YOUR HOPES INTO TOP 20 SCHOOLS. Apply to state schools, apply to colleges with high admissions rates, apply to a lot of safeties. I'm so so serious about this one. I completely underestimated how important safeties are on the college app list. I laughed off the possibility of me attending one, and then after I got my few acceptances back, I was furious at myself for not having more choices--which I would have had if I had applied to more safeties.

· In my opinion, the ratio of safeties to targets to reaches should be 2:2:1. So if you’re applying to 10 schools, 4 should be schools that definitely will accept you (make sure you apply for merit aid/honors housing/benefits to make it worth your while), 4 should be “targets” (you might get into all, or you might get into 1-2 of them), and 2 should be reaches (like Ivy leagues).

· (This is my biased perspective as a student at a large school) You can make a large school feel smaller, but you can’t make a small school feel larger.

**TL;DR: If you take one thing from this, remember: wherever you end up, you will be okay. I promise. It will all work out in the end and you will find your people.**

I'm happy to answer any questions!"

I am in my first year out of four years of university. I ll not explain the subject because it is a bit complicated but for the 6 months that I ve been here I have learned C and I can say I fell in love with coding, even if the stuff that I did so far was pretty simple, it s the only subject that I ve managed to stay focused on for more than 30 minutes at a time and I want to take advantage of that. Some of you might find me foolish because I have so high expectations so early or for believing that if I did good with some pretty easy stuff, that I can manage to actually succeed, but I want to give this a real shot and I m commited to it.

My goal is to land an rock bottom internship job as soon as possible so I can gain some experience in the field before I finish my degree and I dont know where to start. These are my following questions.

1. Should I continue studying C, or should I move on to Python or another language?

Basis being, making you crack interview with least efforts. In fact, the mentality of developers, as well, is getting more and more towards somehow cracking interviews. 

This is a big problem since cracking an interview does not necessarily mean that one is good-enough for the job. Even a kid can mug standard questions for that sake. The philosophy of getting through interview with least efforts snatches away the industrious attitude, resilience and rigour from a candidate. They might make good money in short-term by switching multiple companies but in a long run, they are doomed to suffer. 

I have personally witnessed SDE-3(s) with problem solving abilities as stupid as interns. Essentially, they just got super pumped up titles by switching jobs every few years. 

Worst of all, engineers do not realise their fundamentals are weak. The shine of money they earn just blinds them."

It's way easier to understand lectures with some previous knowledge. Now I'm interested how real is to find internship during summer months? 

One of teachers said that our opportunities for finding placements would increase in the end of the year when we finish course but I really want to try find something over summer( 0% about money it's about getting knowledge) because my experience from my previous jobs(I'm in 30s) is telling me that learning while working is the best.

I sent already tons of emails, applied all around Cork and I'm giving some time to it now, but one respond got me ""... thank you for you interest in internship but you are too early in education to consider you..."". 

Fair enough I still need time to write simple programs like leap year or first 100 prime numbers, FizzBuzz etc., and using Chat GP like mad but....

I've got the drive, the passion, and a Google search bar that's been workin' overtime, but I still need a bit of guidance from ye experienced folks, should I give up finding summer placement based on your experience and code,code,code until my curly brackets buttons fall off keyboard or there is still chance to find it?"

Variety of projects for IOS dev, Python backend stuff, and an Arduino/robotics car, etc. Do well on behaviorals but tend to fail or score poorly on OAs. Will be doing the Codepath Intermediate IOS dev course in a few weeks. 

I have been offered to join my current school's Robotics team where we aim to make the Boston Dynamics robot SPOT. Unsure of my responsibilities and time needed from the team so far. 

To me, this sounds really cool but I don't know if it will really help me out in getting an internship as I feel a lot of companies using robotics will be defense companies that cant hire F1 students. Maybe I am wrong? 

More importantly, since transferring schools I am struggling to Leetcode as much due to travel time to the school (2.5 hrs total) x2 week. I average 3-4hr/week-ish now, which I know I need to improve on.

Thus, what is the easiest field to get an internship in? Web dev, IOS/Android dev, AI/ML, Cyber, etc? 

Should I take on extra responsibility to join the Robo team? I don't want to join and then back out and look bad as I am new to the school.

I use this sub as a direct resource for learning data science so your advice is very much appreciated on my end.

Currently I’m an undergraduate studying Data Science at a top 10 school globally. Although I’ve felt that my major’s curriculum has helped me establish a solid understanding of the math, programming, and analytical aspects of data science, my major has generally been focused on predictive modeling rather than inferential modeling. 

At this point in time, I have taken four different ML/DL courses where I’ve gained a pretty strong grounding in classical ML techniques, core DL frameworks, and implementation/productization. However, although I’ve learned through classes and self-studying regression analysis and hypothesis testing, I have yet to take a class solely dedicated to inferential modeling as a whole.

This coming quarter, should I take my 5th ML/DL course to further establish my knowledge and approach to predictive modeling, or should I take a course solely dedicated to Applied Regression Analysis (name of the course) to gain a better grounding in inferential modeling?

TLDR; Should I take 5th ML/DL course or 1st regression analysis/inferential modeling course?"

bio teacher - 9/10: this guy is actually the goat—we would email eachother back and forth about wordles last year, and I always talked to him about random things when I had time during class.

counselor —  -1308957215/10: I go to a massive public school where there are too many students compared to the number of counselors. Need I say more.

chance me for: RD wustl (reach)

for anyone who is wondering: nobody in like the past 8 years has gotten into wustl from my high school

**additional thoughts:**

I aimed to make my application reflect my personality and attitudes as a person and a learner. I wrote my essays about tinkering with engineering toy kits when I was younger (Electric Snap Circuits and if any of yall in the comments know what that is you are TRULY cultured) and how I broke and opened-up a ton of electronics that belonged to my dad or sister when I was like 5.  While those essay topics seem very generic as a cs major, I tied in a lot of my own voice (I had nobody, except for my sister, read over my essays to maintain my unique writing style) and niche experiences, which hopefully personalized them. I also wrote essays on other EC's like music, and some essays were on some of my more-unique hobbies like using my telescope and stuff.

anyways, let me know if I have a chance at wustl! r/chanceme can't predict my future and is most definitely not 100% accurate, but I just want to see what everyone thinks! also be nice, to me and others on this subreddit. people have feelings—even those who shotgun."

I got 2 internship offers and I'm looking for advice on what internship to go for. One of them is at a big telecom company for a software developer role. The role is focused on automation and testing of a big service which seems like QA work even though the title is software developer. I believe having this company on my resume can be beneficial for securing future job opportunities though as it is well known in Canada.

The other offer is from a medical company. The job title does not specify that it's software related (but I can always change it on resume I guess). The role is focused more on creating technical product demonstrations in Unity as well as data analysis with python. I believe this role and the company/products are more interesting to me. The only downside is that I'm not sure how much actual coding will be done and if they have a good structure for interns (they said I'd have a lot of freedom/independence on what I do). 

Right now I'm leaning more towards the medical company as it seems more fulfilling. However, I can also see how having a big name company on my resume can help in the future for securing more internships/new grad offers down the line even if the work is QA related. 

Looking to this sub for more insight. The salary for both roles is similar but the medical company is closer to where I live while the big telecom company will require relocation. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"

I am majoring in computer science and am weighing my options of trying to go to Sacramento State or trying for a UC. My issue is I am 31 and I still have 2.5-3 years of school left and I want to also have the best career options. Top tech companies like Meta/Google/Apple etc., would be nice to work for and I am sure I will try to apply for all of them as I near the end of my education.

Currently I am participating in an on again off again pre internship program with NASA and am getting great feed back from them. I also have six months of unpaid experience being a tutor for the community college I am at, tutoring programming. I will keep doing this between the times NASA needs me and until I finish my degree. The thing is however, I am still unsure what sector I wish to work for.

Another thing I have to face is that I am legally blind and I am on social security as my income while I go to school. Until I finish my degree and get ""the job"" I cannot officially be paid for any internship because it will affect my income with social security. How do I navigate this with internships? I do ""want"" to be paid and to say I have ""paid experience"" on a resume. How do I talk to potential employers about this issue without them feeling my circumstances are to complicated to consider me. Also when interviewing for ""the job"" down the road most likely I will have no paid experience to include on my resume because being paid puts me in a precarious situation. How will I discuss this with the employer then?

If I complete at least a four year degree with Sacramento State what will be my options considering my unpaid experience?

I started my first internship at a company just 4 days ago and it's pretty awesome. Everyone is very supportive and understanding. My manager set up a meeting for the interns with the principal architect of the team so that we interns can choose what to work on - full stack, blockchain, Data analytics, etc.(they would train us based on our interests).

Now here's the thing - I was pretty excited to be a Full Stack dev because of my experience with Node.js in the past. However, the tech stack my company uses is .NET and JAVA(Springboot). I'm kinda unexcited about working with these technologies because they're pretty old and I like JS much better. (I've never worked with .NET or JAVA). So I told my manager I'd like to do DevOps and DevSecOps.

But now I've started doubting whether I made a mistake choosing DevOps. Because not only does DevOps have a learning curve, but it is also a lot about just setting up CI/CD pipelines and automating the workflow. Not so much coding is needed in it. I, on the other hand, love coding with JS. I want to work hands-on on the code behind the applications and have a big-picture idea too. Plus if you're a full-stack dev you can always switch to DevOps later but the other way around is very difficult. 

In addition to this, I've also been reading at places that there's better growth in FullStack and DevOps may become boring and isn't as respected in some companies. Idk how true/false this is. However, again, my company uses .NET and Springboot. Not JS. I'm very eager about FullStack Development but in JS. Not a fan of the above-mentioned legacy tech stacks.

I'm interested in DevOps and DevSecOps because I think it's pretty cool how a person can implement his/her broad knowledge to scale applications. But I'm very lost and confused about whether it's the best choice for a fresher.

Can someone please help me out choosing the right path for me as a fresher? I don't want to make mistakes in a potentially bright career in the very beginning.

Within a week, you'll be leaving the desk for [insert M7 school] to pursue the highest of all business honors: your MBA. Your VP told you that ""an MBA is just a waste of time"" and your Senior Associate said ""they wouldn't waste $200k on a two-year party"", but you know better. You're going to be around some of the top minds in business, learning, growing and pursuing a career outside of Investment Banking - safe to say, they're just jealous.

The week before your program starts, you are in Cancun with about half of your incoming class. You look to the smokeshows in skimpy bikinis to your left and right. They... don't go to school with you, but the girls who do aren't half bad looking either. As ""Pepas"" plays for the 13th time, you take another shot with Manuel, who is in your cohort and smile - this is going to be a blast. 

Fast forward a few months, and you are midway through your core curriculum. You didn't imagine that you could be working 80+ hours a week during your MBA, but between classes, finishing group work for your lazy teammates, recruiting events, and networking events that aren't mandatory but feel like they are, you're pretty damn tired. But hey, at least a good chunk of it is drinking with your classmates. It's amazing that this counts as career growth, you think to yourself as you sign up for your 44th happy hour of the semester. 

Going through your first set of finals, you realize why MBA Associates caught a lot of flack at your bank. It's literally impossible to fail these tests, you think to yourself as you ChatGPT another answer to your operations exam. Sure, some of your classmates might fail, but those are the nepo-babies who didn't even try. The ""top minds in business"" thought you had before you started the program has all but evaporated from your lexicon at this point. 

After securing a solid internship at a Middle Market PE shop for the summer, you've returned for your second-year of the program. They needed someone to start immediately, so unfortunately they weren't able to give you a return offer. It seems a bit silly that you have to return for this second-year, but you're sure that your elective classes with prestigious, high-regarded professors will be well worth the extra time. 

In meeting with one of those professors, you realize that his thoughts on the MBA are pretty consistent with your VP and Senior Associates. ""I spent my entire career at GS, MS, and Evercore"" he mentions as you chat over coffee, ""and I've never found an MBA who knew as much as someone who stayed on the job for that same amount of time.""

You chuckle nervously at his comment, ""but you think the MBA is worth it, right?""

""Only because we make it out to be bud, only because we make it out to be"", he replies with a grin. 

Thankfully, that professor is something of a dinosaur. He doesn't know what he's really talking about, you say to yourself. You're so close with so many of your classmates who are going to McKinsey, Goldman, Google and other top firms. Those connections will propel you to the top as you head into PE and then entrepreneurship through acquisition in the long run - you know it. 

It's now April of your second-year. Your recruiting journey has largely failed, mostly due to an impending recession and turmoil in the market. ""No shops are willing to hire right now"", your career center rep tells you as you gnaw through your fingernails, ""but someone like you has the perfect resume to head back into banking - we just received a request to put out this full-time Associate role at FT Partners."" 

""Sure, I'll apply"", you say in a daze. Well, at least you'll be headed to Miami post-graduation for one last hurrah with your classmates. 

As you land in Miami, you can't help but reminisce on the last few years. You've made countless friends, learned that what one business school professor teaches another will contradict, and have destroyed 85% of your liver. You push that thought to the back of your mind and head to Club Space for a final 7am night with your classmates. As you hit the dance floor, your phone rings, notifying you that your contract for a full-time Associate role with FT partners is available for signing.

The contract says you have 7 days to sign, but you step out of the party to review it thoroughly before signing that same night. The LAW102 class that you cross enrolled mentioned you should always read the fine print, and your BCOM103 professor always told you the importance of showing enthusiasm. It really does pay to have mastery over the law and business. By the time you get back to the party, you realize Manuel has already boarded his plane back to Peru and the club had closed for the night.

Fast forward 3 months, and you couldn't be more excited for the first day of training. Your TTS instructor is going over the income statement and how NET INCOME is the bottom line. A smile flickers across your face as you realize how much more you appreciate this content now that you've gone to business school. You also realize that the same instructor taught you the same material in your analyst training program 6 years ago. You're sure the MBA Associate advanced training concepts will show up on day 2.

During lunch you start getting to know the other people in your MBA Associate class. One was a math teacher before school, and another just got out of the navy. A cute girl that also went to an M7 was in internal audit for the last 8 years. They all look at you funny when you mention you worked in IB for 4 years already with multiple closed M&amp;A transactions. I guess the brightest minds in business don't get impressed easily."

10zx05l,1,2023-02-11,Sexually Frustrated,throwaway_sefu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/10zx05l/sexually_frustrated/," 

Hey all, I'm looking for advice from girls and guys alike about the following. If you feel like this belongs somewhere else, don't hesitate to let me know.

In high school, I had no experience in terms of relationships or sex, so I decided to change that around the time I graduated. Exercise requires more motivation than just trying to be better looking, but with that, forcing myself into social situations, dressing better, and realising my natural hair looks a lot better than the forced hairstyle I did in high school, I did inevitably get more attention from girls. I have been called attractive, have been approached by girls, and occasionally get complimented.

I have still never had a girlfriend because at first I had no clue how to get one; now, for the past 3 years, my mentality has been this: Because I've never had a girlfriend, I absolutely do not want to date just for the sake of dating and will wait until I find someone I am comfortable with. Coupled with the fact that I have been moving a lot the last two years and that I just graduated college last year and started working full time, I have had little chance to meet someone I would like to date.

Meanwhile, I feel as though my sexual experience has been characterised by a string of terrible luck. I have had sex once with a girl I met online at our college, and it was not fun for either of us because we were both nervous virgins. When I was doing an internship in a foreign country, I was at a party where I was told that the girl I thought was cute was interested in me, but by the time I finished the beer pong game I was doing, she had left. At a club last year, I danced with a girl and for whatever reason I got nervous at the end when she asked if I was interested in meeting again and left (that one is entirely my fault). My very attractive neighbour of ten years and I started getting dinner together and she invited me to her apartment before I was to move out of state, then she ended up accidentally cutting herself on glass at work and her employer made her make up for it by scheduling a shift on the day we were supposed to hang out for the last time. Once I moved, I was getting drinks with a girl who I hadn't seen for a while. She was open to getting a hotel room but hadn't prepared at all because I didn't tell her I was spending the night, so she had something to do in the morning.

I have plenty of other things that keep me busy like work, hobbies, and fitness, but I do have a high sex drive, and want to have some fun. Something that I can look back on fondly, and something that will maybe give me some actual experience in being physically intimate with someone. I have changed a lot and have matured since the beginning of college, but it seems like no matter how hard I try, nothing ever changes.

A few months ago I just got tired of it and decided to get tinder. Last week I started talking to some different girls who seemed like they were interested in just a no-strings-attached thing. I knew that at least some would likely lose interest, so I was really only looking to do this once. I made plans with two of them, and both of them flaked on the same day we were supposed to meet.

I figured I finally had a good chance and now this. I know there are plenty of worse things to be feeling like this about, but I feel like if this continues any further, I am going to start falling into depression, which is ridiculous considering that pretty much every other aspect of my life has been going great.

That all being said, I will acknowledge my faults in this context. I feel like I am obsessing about having sex. Once or twice, this impatience has cost me what could have been meaningful relationships. I genuinely enjoy my hobbies, genuinely love the feeling that working out gives me, and genuinely have fun when I'm at social events, but part of me feels like I am subconsciously mostly motivated to do these things for girls' attention/to have sex.

If you've gotten this far, you now know the state of my situation in full. I am open to any and all advice you may have, as long as you are honest and serious. Am I doing something wrong? Do you feel like I have my priorities out of order? For those who feel like they've experienced this, what do you think I can do/have to learn?"

I have no problem with basic DSA, and I also have a lot of experience with a variety of tech stack as well as OSS. I am very much good around computers, especially Linux and BSD systems. I have experience with multiple languages as side projects. Presently, I am a regular contributor to GitLab, and I work primarily on the backend infrastructure.

I was able to get a job in some shoddy startup by an IIT-ian, but the pay and WLB was trash, everything I was learning was outdated and bad practice, and I hated how my employee won't respond to me for weeks, and out of whim, give me a lot of deliverables that had to be completed in a few hours time, so I half-lied that I was very sick (which was true) but did not reveal the bad work culture as another reason, and quit at the end of last month.

I'm trying to find another internship with FTE, but I am losing my hope. My luck with startups were slightly better, but I've seen people ghosting here as well. MNCs are simply the worst, because they don't even reply back. My classmates who can't even code, have gotten into great companies, and they contact me for whatever trouble they're having.

I've grinded SvelteKit, ReactJS and VueJS by completing actual legit projects, not YouTube copies. I've even worked with multiple backends like Rails, Django, and gRPC in Golang. I'm go tired and burnt out, but I'm still pushing myself to learn more.

When is this going to get better ffs?"

The plan was to do this internship, get some certs , then for my final internship next summer (degree requires last semester to be an internship so I'll graduate after this) do a cybersecurity internship, then hopefully land a fulltime role in Austin area and move there. My question is, with seeing how much swe majors are making, should I instead put my focus into getting good at coding and going that route instead? I've heard of people in my major making just as good money out of college but then you go on reddit and see people saying they can't break 50k.

1100q3o,5,2023-02-11,"As a professor/academic researcher, which qualities would you find more appealing in a potential PhD candidate?",ChillingSmite,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1100q3o/as_a_professoracademic_researcher_which_qualities/,"Hi everyone, hope y'all are having a great day!

This question is something that has been bothering me for a while now, and I would really like to get an academic viewpoint. I am someone who is doing my MS in a STEM field (Computer Science). Over the course of my MS, I have focused a lot on personal projects and practical coursework rather than heading into more research-oriented things and theory heavy courses. I wish to apply to a PhD program in the Fall, but I am facing a personal dilemma on what I should be doing to better prepare myself for it.

I find myself to be good at applying myself and getting hands on, so I really want to stand out by doing more projects that I think are interesting/relevant to the programs I want to apply for. I also have an opportunity to get work experience at an internship during the summer doing something related and relevant and I believe this is my strength.

However, I also realize that a PhD is a very academic degree that focuses more on theory than application, and maybe shifting gears into a more pedagogical direction might be more beneficial for my profile than something practical. I have an opportunity to be a research assistant as well during summer doing something writing intensive, which might lead to a publication (I also do not have any published papers at the time of writing this post). I also have the opportunity to still take coursework that is more proof/theory heavy rather than applied. However, I must admit that this is not my biggest strength and I will be pushing myself out of my comfort zone. 

With that being said, I do not want to leave any stone unturned in my pursuit of a PhD and will do whatever it takes. Do you think it would be more beneficial to continue doing practical things since I have already racked up so much experience with them, or do you think I should switch gears and focus completely on research and theory-oriented coursework (If it isn't too late for it, that is)?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read through my post."

The concern I have for this internship is definitely the remote experience as I will be working at my parent's house where I don't have a proper comfortable workspace over the summer. However, I don't have any concerns from there.

Company 2:

This company I have not received an offer yet from but I have enjoyed the interviews I've had with them. I applied to the same company last summer and received an offer. Unfortunately, I was unable to accept the offer because the timing did not work and they had sent it too late. I would have chosen that internship if that hadn't happened. That is the reason why I applied again this year and would love to work for them and will likely get an offer again. It is also a known energy company where I am from. This one is a fully in-person internship but will have lower pay and I will not get as many hours in the fall. The internship is similar to the one I received an offer from but is not as fleshed out as I would have hoped. Although I would love an in-person experience, the pay, hours in the fall, and job description is not as great compared to the above internship.

Considering both companies, I am not interested in working with either of them post-graduation. I would like a valuable internship experience and an opportunity to continue working with them in the fall only. I am conflicted between both as one is remote and the other in-person. My second round of interviews with Company 2 is the day before the deadline to accept Company 1's offer. What should I do? Any opinions will be helpful!"
1106kax,1,2023-02-11,I did some internships in biology and after 3 years and transferring to a 4 year I ended up wanting to change my major,SilentGooby,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1106kax/i_did_some_internships_in_biology_and_after_3/,"I am watching people who finished high school at the same time as me graduate this year and it sucks.


While in community college I did 3 internships and my last one was my dream internship and I needed up hating it in the end.

I realized I’d rather build technology than do field research.

I realized this too late as I started my fall semester at a 4 year university. Tried to change my major to bioengineering but the school said no because I had to many units.

Did some research and decided to go with electrical engineering instead but it’s gonna take me 4-5 years to graduate because of the math classes I haven’t done. 

I enlisted in the guard and am enrolled in ROTC to help pay for all the school I’ll have remaining but everything sucks.

I just feel like I wasted 3 years of my life and if I had changed my major sooner I wouldn’t be dealing with all of this or have to miss a semester of school to ensure I can afford everything.


I think it was the right call but I still feel unsure all the time if I should just stick to my old major 

I don’t know if there’s any advice that could help but I’d appreciate any"

11080re,1,2023-02-12,How can I remedy the tense situation with my boss?,cakemansham,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11080re/how_can_i_remedy_the_tense_situation_with_my_boss/,"There is going to be a fair bit of context, and I am not going to put a TLDR so to those that read this, thank you. 

So, I am a young female and I have an internship that is a requirement to graduate from my Master's program. I work for a small office, total of 7 employees, 4 department heads/3 interns. I am one of two females. 

My boss asked me to work from the office last week, so I went in. While there, I was having to rely on him to assign me work, since I am an intern and the only other employee there is not the same department and couldn't help guide me on what work to do. My direct boss is very very busy, and so I tried to only ask him what I can be working on when his office door was open or when he walked past my desk (quick questions, he could just say a general 2-3 word answer and I would figure it out.) Before leaving on Thursday, I went to go have my end-of-day check in with him, and I just asked that before I go back to remote work we have time to sit down and discuss how I can contribute more when I work from home (previously he had been giving me 2-3 hours of work per week, I need to be completing about 15 hours per week to be on track for my internship requirements). Chaos ensued. 

This man starts getting agitated, loud, and aggressive. He starts saying how no one told him how to do his job (a job he was hired to do based on his experience) so he shouldn't have to tell me how to do mine (an internship, to gain experience through guidance). He starts saying how if he was at the company when I was hired, he wouldn't have hired me. He says that my working there adds stress to his day, and that he doesn't have time to give me assignments, even though giving me assignments would lessen his workload. He says that I am not qualified (I am overly qualified and there is another intern who is in his first year of undergrad and I spent 2 days this week remedying this other intern's mistakes, mistakes that would have had *very very* negative consequences for our company had they not been noticed). 

At one point he tells me that I'm not good for anything other than ""looking pretty and greeting people that walk into our office."" Now, just for some context, my boss *heavily* favors the men in the office, has never said anything good about the other female (even though she has worked there longer, is amazing at her job, and is super knowledgeable).

The whole time he is yelling at me, and after about 20 minutes of him yelling and being aggressive (leaning over the desk to yell, slamming his hands on the desk, etc.) I start to cry. I haven't gotten any words in, and he calls me disrespectful (I promise I had never been disrespectful that I know of, I always do what he asks, when he asks, up to his standards, without asking questions on why. I never question his authority or knowledge.) 

By the end of this ""conversation"" (or really, verbal assault) I am ready to quit. But I know that isn't an option because I won't be able to graduate this semester if I do. I end up leaving, and not returning on Friday. A different department head reaches out to me Friday, saying he spoke with my boss and wants to hear my ""side"" of the story. I decide to be the bigger person and just say that I wanted to make sure that my role was understood and that I would be utilized as the asset I am when I returned home to work remotely. This department head is understanding, but again, he isn't my boss.  

Quitting isn't an option, so please don't suggest that. I just want suggestions on how to make things less tense between us, and how to be able to work with someone who was blatantly rude, disrespectful, sexist, and who I am honestly very very mad at. I just don't know how I am supposed to have any emotion other than anger, or how I am supposed to continue on doing his work for him, as an unpaid, unappreciated, intern."

I have 9.3 GPA, currently a SDE intern at a hyper growth database startup which will end in July 2023 (\~1 yr internship), I have a paper in computer vision in a open access journal . I have done some full stack projects and have contributed to open source and have a linux schlorship for same. I also have decent grade from School (96%).

I want to pursue masters in ML/Deep learning or Distributed Systems / Database design. I have very liitle knowledge about the process to apply for the same and have recently started searching my options. I have a few questions which I need to get  answered before starting with the entire application process:-

&amp;#x200B;

1. Which universities are best for ML/DL or Distributed System Design? I have heard of a few but am scared after looking at the the acceptance rate and the type of profiles that got accepted.(CMU, University of Maryland, NTU etc).
2. What are some of the cheapest countries to pursue MS ? (ik Germany only). 
3. Is my profile strong enough for MS in good colleges? Should I work on it more for 2 years and then apply?
4. Should I take a gap year, do some freelancing work/ get a job and save money to finance my Masters for 2025 or should I take a loan and do it in 2024 ? I have (\~5 lakhs savings currently from my internship).

I am very scared about the entire process and somehow can't find the courage to start the entire process of applying because I feel like my profile is not strong enough.

 Any help/words of advice would be really appreciated !!!"
110992i,6,2023-02-12,Airing Out My Grievances,FJKReddit,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/110992i/airing_out_my_grievances/,"I work in a medical warehouse that shares the same building with both a bakery and landscaping all under the same company.  Warehouse positions are supposed to start at $17/hr. This one pays only minimum wage. My previous supervisor was a dirty snake that I thought was my friend, before realizing that he was a lazy, entitled jackass who is beloved by one of my higher ups and despised by everyone else. I'll get to him later.

As the warehouse, and the absolute bottom line, we are at the mercy of other departments, including our graphics department and suppliers. If something goes even slightly wrong, we are lambasted by negative comments, even though it's something that is no fault of our own (graphics team not printing pamphlets on time, our orders not coming down on time or at all, or our suppliers not getting our supplies to us on time). At times, we've had to take pictures of requisitions, order forms, and supplies going out just to defend ourselves.

There are only 13 people working in the warehouse, with upwards of 5 of us doing the daily orders, and 3 girls working on filing specialized orders and kits. And I make no exaggeration that these three are our hardest working members. But it doesn't matter how much we do, or how hard we work. It isn't seen or even appreciated.

Let me get back to one of the main issues with the job. One of our managers (whom I will be calling DM - Dick Manager) is an absolute asshole. DM is an ex-detective who had a position literally made up just for him because the CEO, for some unknown reason, liked this guy and offered him a managerial position. DM knows nothing of what goes on in the warehouse, even though he absolutely likes to pretend he knows all that goes on. 

He is spiteful, rude, misogynistic, and an absolute jerkoff. He has zero respect for my current (female) supervisor, and is vindictive to her, one of my other female coworkers, and even his own daughter. He highly praises my shitty previous supervisor, who brow nosed his way to a sponsorship for the police academy, despite the fact that he was so damn lazy and left work early (he was salaried) leaving work for everyone else. I remember one day coming into work and seeing that he was sitting at his desks, watching Tik Toks at near full volume, while another coworker was shipping 90 orders of pamphlets all by himself. 

Back to DM, he is not shy about his favoritism. He was constantly rude to the graphics supervisor. Our bakery department had someone get their supplies so that they'd stop bothering us to get their stuff (because, despite being two separate departments, paid by two different sectors, their needs are our needs). He was fired for bickering with the bakery manager over stupid decision making. DM did not hide his happiness to them both leaving.

DM has been so harsh to my previously mentioned female supervisor and another female employee (whom I'll be referring to as C) to the point they have cried on the job. C, a victim of domestic abuse involving firearms, commented that DM shares the same disregard and mannerisms that her ex-husband had. She becomes physically ill whenever he is around. 

I should also mention that he has a habit of spying on us, by either looking through the window of our bay door, through the cameras he has access to on his phone, or by peering through one of the aisles. My supervisor was comforting C when she came in one day totally distraught regarding arrangements for her late father, and DM was looking through the bay door at them. Instead of asking what the issue was, DM confronted my supervisor by saying that he saw them having a conversation ""that didn't appear to involve anything work related."" 

Last week, our actual supervisor was out on vacation, and DM made it a point to come down to the warehouse when all of us were in, and be as confrontational and in our face about everything as possible. During this time, the CEOs girlfriend (GF, whom might I add is in charge of the bakery because the CEO cheated on his wife with GF and it was either this or pay alimony) requested DM to get someone to deal with some of the bakery's responsibilities. And of course DM volunteered us to deal with it because we clearly don't do enough.

Speaking of GF, she is such as sweet, sweet bitch of a living leather handbag. Sometime before my time there, she fired someone because they had the Grade A nerve to leave early to VISIT THEIR ACTIVELY DYING WIFE IN THE HOSPITAL.

So yeah, I'm sure you can imagine how great it is here. Well its gonna be even better because my supervisor is planning on leaving by early April, C is leaving on March 17, and my other coworker, who is in college, is currently in an internship which will hopefully land them a new job."

110d559,2,2023-02-12,[Poly/Uni] SP-NUS or SP-SUTD programme?,questions2093830,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/110d559/polyuni_spnus_or_spsutd_programme/,"Hey, Year 1 SP Computer Engineering student here who is interested to go to Uni afterwards. Recently I have signed up my interest for both the SP-NUS and SP-SUTD programmes, and initially wanted to apply for both programmes. However due to how tight the timings are for interviews for both programmes, the school only allows us to apply for either one of the programmes.

A little context of both programmes and myself below:


Myself:
- Singaporean
- Wants to go to Uni, wouldnt mind any tbh, wanted to go to JC in the first place
- Would like to do a Computing/Humanities related course in uni, wouldnt mind engineering tho
- Current cGPA (Y1S1 only) at 3.9, looking at current Y1S2 modules I might drop to a 3.8 but that doesnt matter too much to me
- Got A2 for Emath and B3 for Amath in O levels (should pass eligibilities for quite a few courses right?)




Both programmes:
- Push Y3 mods to Y2, thus a specialised path where I need to do Y3 mods and Y2 mods side by side together with my intended course specialisation (I picked CES, Computer Engineering &amp; Software)


- Maintain a certain cGPA (&gt;3.6 for SUTD, &gt;3.7 for NUS)


- Do SUTD/NUS ECE modules in place of our 3 electives for module expemtions in the schools itself


- All 3 modules will be graded in place of my SP electives, however all Uni grades will be up-ped by 1.5 grades for SP (Uni B- = SP A, Uni C = SP B etc.)


- Do in-house internship (no pay tho :/)




NUS programme:
- Pick any 3 of the modules below to do in Y3S2 (those ticked are those I would probably choose)

- CS1010E Programming Methodology ✔️
- EE1111A EE Principles and Practices 1
- MA1301 Introductory Math ✔️
- PC1202 Fundamentals of Physics


- Earn technical module exemptions if I were to enter NUS ECE, or earn unrestricted elective module exemptions if I were to enter any other school of NUS




SUTD programme:
- Pick any 3 of the modules below to do in Y3S2 (those ticked are those I would probably choose)

- Modelling and Analysis 
- Physical World
- Computational Thinking for Design ✔️
- Social Science ✔️


- Do a compact module during Y2S1 vacation (passing grade is C, if grade is &gt;= B-, the one unpicked above will be exempted when matriculated in SUTD)


- If grade for compact module &gt;= C, I get a conditional offer from SUTD, and will matriculate as an SUTD Y1S1 student in my Y3S2, where I do the 3 modules above


- Get guaranteed hostel in SUTD in Y3S2, however all fees (incl tuition) are at my own expense




I wouldnt mind if i get into any of the two programmes and subsequently their degree programmes tbh, 

I like SUTD's curriculum in terms of how I get to do some common modules in the Freshmore year which include design and humanities in contrast to tech and engineering, and I like how as long as my GPA is &gt;3.6 and the grades for the modules are &gt;C I basically get entry to the school which is pretty lit

I wouldnt mind NUS's programme because in case I dont wanna go to NUS after completing my diploma I still get to choose other options if i want to change career paths (I have NUS SoC, NUS CHS, SMU Computing&amp;Law, NTU DSAI and NTU PPGA in mind as well)
Also if I do choose to continue doing engineering in the future, from my research NUS's ECE is pretty darn good especially computer engineering. Better yet if I were to enter NUS ECE with this programme I can literally skip a year because of poly exemptions and the exemptions from completing those 3 modules.

However from the circumstances I need to pick one of the two to apply for by next week, thus my question. If anyone is from SUTD or NUS ECE I would also appreciate your inputs on the programmes and their modules as well. I would also appreciate inputs in terms of potential future prospects that could benefit by entering either of the programmes. thank you


I feel like i could be overthinking this but what can i do lol"

I have graduated with a masters in a STEM field. I did the masters in a foreign country. Also did internships in other countries. Past 3 years I have moved quite a bit never living in same city continuously for more than around 7 months (due to internships mostly). This was not something I really liked because each move took a lot of energy in terms of getting to know the place and finding friends. Lot's of time spent alone (almost to the point of being unhealthy). Although I am only 26, I find it difficult moving to new cities now. Initially was okay. After 7 cities and 3 countries, its not. In the city I last did my internship in before graduating and am currently based in, I have I believe a good social circle I like after a really long time.

I have some offers now and I need to make a decision. One is in the same city I am (full of mountains) where I have friends. But the topic is sub-optimal. The other one is in another city (around Mediterranean) where the work topic is actually more interesting, also makes more sense probably in terms of being on CV and skills if I want to switch in future.

My question was, how often you find yourself struggling with such choices?

Being in a place you like with your friends vs what's more optimal for your career?

Thank you for your advise.

I am visiting India right now and everyone I talk to is either doing computer science or IT. My uncle is saying that software engineering is going to be super saturated and offshored from Australia to India. I can't help but feel doubtful and scared about my career in the future. 

I'm thinking maybe I should switch to some other engineering like electrical or maybe even mechanical. 

I really do enjoy coding and maths. But I also want to ensure my career is stable and I can find employment with enough pay."

110lgxa,0,2023-02-12,I want to cut ties off with my paggro internship boss but I don’t know how. (any advice appreciated),finessez,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/110lgxa/i_want_to_cut_ties_off_with_my_paggro_internship/,"Hi hi, first Reddit post here ^^. I’m 20, just finished my internship. my boss is highly likely a parasite (or just an energy vampire). Just need advice on whether my thoughts are valid. (TL;DR: I dislike my boss because she is disconnected from reality, she wants to continue our mentor mentee rs beyond the internship but I don’t want to and I can’t get away from her right now because there are too many factors. SAVEMEPLS)

My boss is very paggro - she likes to use question marks in almost every sentence eg asking my colleague “I don’t understand what’s on your mind?” “Kindly share?” she also is the type to mass send WA messages, putting my colleague on blast IN THE GROUPCHAT when an intern (me) is present. to me, that’s damn inconsiderate bc she’s making my colleague lose face - just pm la. Don’t know if this is impt context but she is a believer of holy religion (I shall not name but she damn unholy lor she treats her subordinates LIKE CRAP), and has said on multiple occasions to the team that she strives to be a “people leader” … K.

Around the last 2 wks of my internship, my colleague started falling sick often (flu, hard to get rid of the bug). then my boss PMed me on Teams to say when one person is down, there is impact to the team bla bla. I empathised and said “yeah, the impact is evident in a team of 3” - she proceeded to say (paraphrased js in case she uses reddit idw get caught HAHA) physically is a 3-man team but not work wise, it’s not cos as intern, i am already taking less. if you are a full time staff, your work scope would be more. 

Her response pissed me off because on the contrary, I don’t quite think they made me do “less”. in fact, very bold of her to say that when i was made to design an entire website by myself, and all this yapper does is give BLOODY AMBITIOUS feedback whenever I show the draft (CLEARLY showing how she has no web design knowledge of SharePoint and its certain limitations) - she is the classic NATO, No Action Talk Only. anyw, I end up damn stressed all the time bc i’m an intern and I also did not have any background in web creation, BUT I can’t just say what she wants is impossible and I have to spend time trying to find solutions to get a good grading? sigh.. I digress. I also had to pick up workload from the colleague who was absent, such as doing up some slides for her that she has not done for quite some time and I couldn’t wait anymore since I was literally leaving in a few days at that point.

The only difference is that I don’t fkn broadcast or yap about how busy or how much busier I am to my boss just because my colleague is down, I just willingly take it unlike said boss, who seems to love stressing to the intern that she is sooo so busy (which makes me feel hella incompetent) Anyway, continuing on, I didn’t wanna acknowledge her message because I disagreed, so I just mirrored her words and said “do you mean you shoulder (colleague’s name) work when she is absent?” 

THIS BOSS REPLIES TO ME “What do you think?” SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP. I gave her an opportunity to backtrack  when I mirrored her words bc I wanted her to read how ridiculous she sounds?? Let me give more context - at that point, my boss was the same person who had been away on LONG LEAVE, IN A WHOLE ASS FOREIGN COUNTRY, and I had been the only one working in office since my other colleague was down. SHE IS DELUSIONAL TO THINK she shouldered all the responsibility - my compensation is like 1/10 of hers so obv I will take on lesser but you are seriously missing a few screws in your head if you think you took on all the colleague’s workload - huh???? and to be paggro at me and imply you are the only busy one just because the colleague is sick? News flash, miss. The world does not revolve around you. 

ok, sorry for digressing again but I seriously cannot stand the paggro “what do you think?” - I think that you should seriously re-evaluate your character, dear boss. ☺️ 

anyway, there’s more to this but obviously if I share the entire story I’m essentially doxxing myself and increasing the chances of getting caught.. long story short my dynamics w her is that we do have some personal moments tgt but wah her character at work is seriously so different from how she is IRL to the point I just get anxious talking to her - I always feel the need to type a certain “acceptable” way when talking to her bc she is just that anal??? and everytime she “rants” about the colleague to me, she always prefaces with the “holier-than-thou” speech about how she is not talking about the colleague’s character, but she is only telling me so that I can learn. She also likes to say she is only transparent w/ me because I am mature enough to handle it and she wants me to learn. Honestly, sounds like a whole load of BS and truly js sounds like she wants to vent to me but want to sound all “holy”. honestly, when I was experiencing this during my internship, I wld feel damn trapped bc I had to sit through the convo, I mean no shit I can’t shut her up - she was grading me for my internship and if I ever implied anyt negative, I can kiss my gpa goodbye 

now that my internship is over, I technically am free from her grip… but let’s just say I struggle to say no and I am now working full-time someplace else at internship pay of essentially $3-$4 per hour when I clearly said before that I don’t want to work after this internship (I’ve been overworked enough istg)

But yeah… my boss makes me so freaking anxious because I don’t know how to get away from her and she has harassed a colleague from a diff dept with spam calls and texts when he wanted space away from her - and it’s really not too easy for me to cut her off on a clean slate because circumstantially speaking, she offered to mentor me beyond my internship, I don’t want it, but I’m kinda still tied to her in some ways, hence I can only formally cut her off after 3 months. 

also, she has invited me to the place where Holy Ceremonies are held (HAHA sorry I don’t want to break any rules gotta be ambiguous) - and I met some of her other holy friends. I’m also connected with her on LinkedIn. hence, damn hard to escape from her because I damn scared to be harassed by her. I just want space PERMANENTLY away from her, and the only possibility I can see is telling her the truth and making sure she knows I want nothing to do with her and actually for many months I disliked her leadership style; and then I block her and hope she takes my request to leave me alone. 

please.. any advice is appreciated. before I left, I did tell my big boss (so my boss’s boss in a sense) about her behaviour because I didn’t want it affecting anyone else. Right now I’m just seriously damn sian bc I’m in a job that I feel forced to be in and there’s no way out so :)) if you read till here, thank you ^^. have a great day"

I have heard that they want typically a masters degree and some previous experience in the field when you go look for a job in ml/ai, but where did you get your previous experience in ml/ai before you got your first job? 

For reference I am a junior in college about to complete my first internship in swe this summer, hoping to maybe land a job in general swe for a year before going back to get my masters in CS with an emphasis on Machine learning or AI. I’m currently a cs/stats major so hopefully the math background helps lol.

I dont have the time to participate in school research due to difficult classes and a social life that I want to maintain, which is why I am trying to see what my other options for getting relevant experience in ML/ai are. I am also strongly considering doing a masters in CS online such as through georgia tech, so I dont know if I’ll be able to do research then. But yeah I’m very curious to hear how yall got into the sub field!"

110oasn,2,2023-02-12,My friend has bad odor &amp; won't change,ashren4316,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/110oasn/my_friend_has_bad_odor_wont_change/,"my (24 f) friend (26 f) of 5 years has been having odor issues, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

When we were first becoming friends, we worked in a pastry kitchen, which easily masks the smell. When we would hang outside of work, we were usually smoking pot, which already has a strong smell. Her bedroom was messy, but she also lived with other people at the time and cats, so it was whatever.

She started sleeping with someone, and I assume she did the thing where you take extra care of yourself due to new relationship energy. Plus, she was trying to be discreet.

Then she started to smell. But there are some people that no matter how much they shower, they have a distinct smell, not necessarily bad but definitely strong. It wasn't bad at first. But noticing her living alone, her home would be messy, and she doesn't clean up after herself. I can not function in a messy environment, so it became difficult to hang out there.

The person she was sleeping with (let's call him terrence, who is also my best friend) has to stay with her kn the weekends and threatened to stop coming over if she didn't clean her home, which lasted about a month.

Of course, that didn't last, and occasionally, we would clean up parts of her home. It became exhausting taking care of myself and her. Don't get me wrong, I love cleaning, but I also have Bipolar 1 (among other things), and when those depressive episodes hit, I can't even get out of bed. She also has adhd and I understand how executive dysfunction works and try to suggest ways she can remember to take her meds before she gets out of bed so she can function, but it doesn't work.

After covid, when she became an assistant manager at a restaurant, I eventually started working there for a little bit. I hung out with a few coworkers, and they called me out for being a bad friend and how it is my job to tell her that she smells bad. They were right, and I had to get over myself and let her know. But I had just gotten used to it and would let myself suffer, but they were the 2nd group to bring it up to me in that month, so I knew it was time.

So I told her, not disclosing the people who came to me. She said she would get better. I didn't think she changed, and that was confirmed when terrence came to me again about her. He would subtly hint to her that maybe she needed to shower in specific moments or whatever. I left the place we worked and got busy with school again, so I didn't have time to come over as often between school, work, theatre shows, internships, and extracurriculars. But during the little free time I had, I would come and clean her house, which would take hours. My own home begsn to get messy, I was exhausted from taking care of both of us, I couldn't function, and for the first time in my life I failed a class (multple classes). I no longer had a 4.0, I didn't get to see my friends, I was extremely busy, and I couldn't afford my mental health meds, so I wasn't sleeping, and I was depressed.

fast forward to January / February 2023, I am staying with her due to housing issues. I am the only one who has ever cleaned. I refuse to touch her room because I am squeamish and cant handle the dirty clothes, things that should really be in a trash can, and dirty spicy toys that would be left out until the next time she used it. and she also wears the same long t-shirt whenever she changes out of her work clothes. I've been here since december, and she has only showered on special nights out, a handful of times. Last night, I thought her dog #2 under the couch and was searching for the source of the smell when I realized it was coming from her. I mean, it was so bad. I completely checked out all night. Terrence and another friend was over, so I didn't want to tell her then, but I got to bring it up.

I'm aware that I used this post to rant. I am working on being nicer, and having things come across less rude than I am intending it. Obviously, Terrence's subtle ways aren't helping. It's common knowledge that if I bring something up there's no sugar coating, not because I want to be rude but because I'm so anxious and I have to get it out of my body immediately. She also has a drinking problem that we have been trying to work through. This all has to be related, of course, and she goes to therapy, but she can't go on this way, especially as a manager, because that asshole boss of hers will get her fired.

How do I bring this up in an effective way? We can't make someone change unless they want to, of course, but I only want the best for her, and shes about to lose everything she wanted in life if she keeps on smelling this way."

**English Teacher (8/10)-** Had a really good relationship w/her. Didn't read it so I can't say for sure.

**Physics Teacher(6-7/10)**\- No offense to her but I really don't know if she knew how to write a rec. She mentioned one thing about my initiative that I really liked but she mainly just mentioned trite stuff that was already on my app. 

**Online Advisor(8/10)-** Nicest Lady I've ever met. Read one excerpt of it and I can tell she tried very hard on it. 

**Interviews**

* MIT (8/10)- was my first interview. I was really nervous and it was brief, but I felt like it went well.

* Cornell (8/10)- The conversation went very well but I wish I had mentioned some more things. 
* Duke (8/10)- Went pretty well. I connected w/him on a bunch of things and he seemed interested in me and said he'd write me a good report.
* Northwestern (8/10)- The conversation flowed very nicely and we really just talked about anything. She seemed impressed by me and she said she'd write me a good report.

**Essays**

Wrote my personal Statement about my OCD and how I got over it using my education as an escape. I tied it to how obsessive overthinking translated to an obsession with academics. I spent a lot of time on it, I would give it a 7-8ish/10.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought most of my supplements were pretty good. Since I applied to so many schools I was able to recycle a bunch of them. I wrote horrible essays for UNC since it was my first deadline and I didn't know how to write a college essay- my personal statement wasn't even done. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote a lot of my supplements about my rural community and my initiative in trying to add more classes so students wouldn't feel that some schools were unattainable. There definitely is a stigma that surrounds our school so I felt like it was important to mention it.

The internship was great and I learned new technologies. But ever since I've been on a real team at \[FINTECH\_COMPANY\], I'm constantly feeling drained. There hasn't been a sprint to this point where I haven't transferred a task from the previous one. I despise daily meetings because I get to share how I'm ""this"" close to completeing the ticket (I genuinely think I am, but almost always it turns out I'm not), or I have no idea how to test my changes manually, or etc.

Oh and don't get me started on the manual testing. It's really hard to set up your local environment. Even if you do it correctly, sometimes the requests time out and apparently ""it just does that, unfortunately"" as per one of the seniors on my team. So you aren't sure if there's something wrong with the request, the data or the environment itself. Not even to mention that there are ""special cases"", like if a user is from \[random\_country\] and I broke the dev environment for a day because, how was I supposed to know that if nobody told me? Am I just supposed to ask for every flipping restriction that could possibly occur, given that I'm relatively new to the product and my domain knowledge kinda sucks?

I also have to complete a CVE training in the upcoming weeks and I've had 11 attempts total (3 at a time and they refresh every 5 days) with only coming close (within 1-2 points) to the target score twice. I've done upwards of 8 hours of unpaid, and generally unclaimable, OT to complete this stupid test and it's so frustrating.

I struggle, really. I get why people hate web dev, honestly.

As you see things from your perspective, do you think it's nigh I took a break, i.e. quit and regather my thoughts?

I'm from Ohio, and not many people ""get out"" from where I'm from. Everyone, including my parents, seemed proud of me for going onto something greater/someplace greater.

The first few months were fine. I missed home just as much as any other college freshman, but things eventually took a turn for the worst. I ended up losing all of my friends that I had made due to petty drama. The girls just said that they ""didn't think we had enough in common, were annoyed by me, etc."" Basically, mean girl stuff. 

I did my best to try and make other friends but it was so difficult. Everyone seemed to already have their own cliques. I started finding myself alone in my dorm every weekend, usually sad, lonely and crying. Even the student life/clubs here aren't great. We don't have Greek Life, which I didn't think would be an issue because I thought that I would like that it wouldn't be there to dominate the social scene, but now I wish I had the opportunity to rush. I'm in a few clubs but they don't meet a lot and I haven't made any friendships that have expanded outside of the meetings. I literally went on a Jesus retreat in desperate effort to find something to do one weekend...and I'm not even religious. That's just how alone I feel.

I'm considering transferring to either Ohio State or University of Cincinnati for sophomore year. I know my Dad would be disappointed, but my mom seems to be all for it. I live about four hours away from UC and two hours away from OSU. If I went to OSU, I could come home on weekends if I ended up having a difficult time again. If I went to UC, I could live with one of my best friends who goes there. OSU is a slightly better school for what I am interested in, Comm/Media Studies/PR, too. With all of that being said, going off of the numbers, I'd be throwing away an amazing opportunity if I chose to transfer. Fordham is ranked higher than OSU, and much higher than UC. And, maybe, I would be just as miserable being a transfer having no friends as well? I'm just really in a rough spot and would appreciate any insight. Thanks."

However, I've taken lots of CS courses through dual enrollment when I was in high school, so I feel like I have quite a bit of CS knowledge. I applied for roughly 30-40 CS internships in total throughout Fall 2022, but I've just been getting rejection after rejection. I haven't even received an interview or OA yet. I graduated high school in 3 years instead of 4, so I'm under 18. Is that why I haven't gotten a single interview (let alone internship)? I also got transfer admission for Fall 2023 to a top 5 university for CS, but even that doesn't seem to matter to the employers. I'm getting really frustrated. I was thinking of switching majors from engineering to CS because I enjoy CS more, but after I saw that no one even called me for an interview, I'm feeling glad I stuck to engineering."

I'm a high school junior rn. I used to hear such great things about CS— 6 figures entry position, no degree needed—but now I'm hearing horror stories. A couple years ago becoming a lawyer was the default lucrative career suggestion, but now it's so oversaturated lots of people with a law degree can never use it.  


Right now the entire job market is shit, but also more and more people are going into CS every year. It's only gonna get more competitive. In a couple of years, will I need a degree from a T10 CS school, internships, and networking at Harvard to break into the industry? Cause that's what I'm hearing it's like right now.

110x9cv,1,2023-02-12,"CompTIA N+, S+, Cloud+ or CCNA?",Aryts,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/110x9cv/comptia_n_s_cloud_or_ccna/,"Hi all, I am currently a student graduating this August with a degree in IT and a Diploma in Systems Management. 

Current classes I’m enrolled is:
RH134 (RedHat Linux)
Cloud+
Some other cisco class, after Net+ Before CCNA, name is Switching and Routing
And Finally a class on Active Directory

Next semester will be a CCNA prep class, along with more Cloud Virtualization where I will be building my own virtual machines, and a third class about Enterprise LANS (not 100% what this is yet but I know it’s for more windows AD)

I’m not sure how I feel about cloud as a career yet, but I know it’s hot right now, and at the moment I am enjoying learning all of the intricacies of routers and switches.

Essentially what I’m here to ask is what would be the most realistic to go for if I’m graduating in August, and would like to have either the CCNA or a 2-3 CompTIA certs before October? I have studied on my own before but i’m going to school because it’s free and a degree is nice to have, but is this a realistic time frame? I have no clue how the CCNA compares to the CompTIA certs. (More than ok with needing more time but I just wanna say I got my ccna or a bunch of comptia certs before age 21 lol)

What would be best for me early career wise? 

I’m ok with doing help-desk if necessary, but like everyone would love to skip it. I do have some experience and have been working on and off part time/full time at a phone repair shop. I plan to setup my own mail server as a little side project for my resume, as well as build a few projects in the cloud on my own time, before graduation. 

How necessary are internships? I know everyone loves to preach and suck them dry here but are they really that important? (Only asking because I am having an extremely hard time finding any in my area, more southern coastal NC)

Any info would be appreciated, thanks."

I'm tired. I'm getting extremely frustrated. I've finished my daily limbo of applying for IT jobs that is as mundane and soul-crushing as it has been for the whole of 2022 and the start of 2023 as I write this as an angry cry for help:

[Here is my resume:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y3pbhw_0m20wudOL0MyF0FdO6GKDPxou/view)

**What have I been doing wrong all these years?**

I have plenty of basic IT knowledge and have the following skills:

&amp;#x200B;

* Windows Active Directory
* Group Policy and Management
* WSUS
* Performance Monitoring
* Computer Networking
* Computer Imaging/Reimaging/Clean Operating Systems Installations
* Help Desk Documentation
* IT Ticketing Systems (ServiceNow)
* Programming
* CMD and PowerShell
* Virtualization
* Hardware/Software Troubleshooting
* Web Development
* Database Programming
* PC Assembly/Disassembly/ Interior Maintenance/Parts Replacement/Diagnosis/Troubleshooting
* Hardware/Software Maintenance
* Communication
* Leadership
* Project Management
* Teamwork
* Customer Service
* Microsoft Office Suite (All programs with 10+ years experience
* Analysis Skills
* Problem Solving

And I have the following experience in these Operating Systems/programming language (my programming language knowledge however is basic)

&amp;#x200B;

* Windows XP/7/8/10
* Windows Server 2016
* MacOS
* iOS/Android
* Red Hat Linux
* Kali Linux
* SQL
* Java
* Python
* JavaScript
* Apple Swift
* HMTL5/CSS

&amp;#x200B;

I also have tons of references from managers, colleagues, professors, co-workers who all speak highly of me and are on my resume. I have an Associate's Degree in IT. I have applied for so many jobs over the last year that I have lost count, along with hundreds of IT jobs in the last 4 years. I'll be 30 in 2 days.

I wasn't getting interviews, but now I'm getting interviews, but ALWAYS being PASSED OVER for someone else. It's infuriating. The last job my recruiter tried getting me, NOBODY got hired out of 10 candidates. I also am fairly certain I am doing well in my interviews. I am confident, I give good posture, I wear nice clothes, style my hair properly to loom professional, have good hygiene, trim my facial hair to be neat and presentable, answer their technical questions and personal questions with not talking too much but giving a good amount of detail to the question and always try to demonstrate my intelligence and education.

I don't have any real work experience though that these stupid American companies find desirable. The only thing I have is the stuff I did for my 2 year Associate's Degree in community college, the 4 years of volunteer IT work at my Australian community college, 1 year at Teletech as help desk support, and 3+ years of working as an IT person for a mom-and-pop mechanic shop where I set up their computer/network and do their IT maintenance for them while they pay me in cash for the hours I work (it's basically under the table contract work, but the manager vouches my work as a great reference).

I also don't have a Bachelor's Degree (yet) as I have applied for University and am hopefully getting a Bachelor's in Information Systems (I don't like Computer Science) with a second major in Japanese studies/the language during the next 3-4 years.

The other thing that pains me and infuriates me when people bring it up is I have permanent facial palsy, so I do have a speech impediment, however my speech is understandable and I have had years of speech therapy as a child. Technically yes I am disabled, and have been living off SSI for the last 4 years which was a terrible mistake, and I am trying to get off of it with a proper IT job. I've also been discriminated not only for my disability, but my race as well (I'm Southeast Asian/Thai) although I've never been able to sue for it due to lack of incriminating evidence that would be acceptable in court.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the experience I have:

With my LinkedIn, I took my parents who are a Business Analyst and an accountant with a MBA, studied their profiles and copied their formatting to make my own LinkedIn as professional as possible. Most of the stuff you see on here are taken from my resume and LinkedIn. It also gets noticed daily by people and I get messages from recruiters offering me job applications in IT.

Along with all of this, I constantly self-study, am always learning and updating my knowledge on technology and what's new/evolving, constantly trying to improve my knowledge and experience with learning new skills, and am studying to get my COMPTIA A+ certification.

And despite all of this... **I still have not gotten a goddamn IT job. I've wasted so much of my life trying to get my foot into this god-forsaken field but nobody will hire me for an entry-level position when I feel I am CLEARLY qualified to perform the tasks and learn to improve my IT knowledge and experience. It's a catch-22 with this field. I need the experience to get the job, but I need the JOB to GET the experience (especially since no internship has taken me). I've never gotten a single internship or job offer as I was always passed over FOR SOMEONE ELSE.**

I've built computers from scratch at home and at college, I've fixed broken computers and laptops, I've replaced parts, installed operating systems, changed operating systems, programmed basic software applications, designed websites, done ticketing systems, monitored performance on computers/networks, written into knowledge bases online and have documentation experience, led a real life IT project in college for a museum, trained myself to use Windows servers at home by virtualizing 3-4 servers and desktops with VMWare so I could learn Windows Server 2016 and Active Directory, I've taken proficiency and assessments tests on recruitment websites and took them until I got a high score to impress interviewers, I've set up my own networks and other people's networks, routers, printers, etc.

I've used so many job search websites: Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster, DICE, SimplyHired, ZipRecruiter, as well as applying to HUNDREDS of company websites and recruitment agencies. NOTHING but interviews and that's it, or not even hearing from them, or the most insulting: A damn automated message saying ""They're going with other people"".

I get good feedback from people and constructive criticism on how to improve my interview skills from recruiters and have had years of interview experience. YEARS.

What the hell am I doing wrong? I've followed everyone's advice and have gotten **NOWHERE.** What am I supposed to do to get into this field?! My career has been meaningless because it has never taken off. At this point, I have a better chance of getting better at digital art and somehow making money off that than getting an IT job and starting my IT career...

Tell me what I'm supposed to do to get an IT job and start my IT career when **The United States of America does not want to hire me for a single IT job let alone an entry-level one**"

I'm tired. I'm getting extremely frustrated. I've finished my daily limbo of applying for IT jobs that is as mundane and soul-crushing as it has been for the whole of 2022 and the start of 2023 as I write this as an angry cry for help:

**What have I been doing wrong all these years?**

[Here is my resume:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eUIt0yIvUfG5tIi2v8syp5IBOq19D4te/view?usp=sharing)

I have plenty of basic IT knowledge and have the following skills:

&amp;#x200B;

* Windows Active Directory
* Group Policy and Management
* WSUS
* Performance Monitoring
* Computer Networking
* Computer Imaging/Reimaging/Clean Operating Systems Installations
* Help Desk Documentation
* IT Ticketing Systems (ServiceNow)
* Programming
* CMD and PowerShell
* Virtualization
* Hardware/Software Troubleshooting
* Web Development
* Database Programming
* PC Assembly/Disassembly/ Interior Maintenance/Parts Replacement/Diagnosis/Troubleshooting
* Hardware/Software Maintenance
* Communication
* Leadership
* Project Management
* Teamwork
* Customer Service
* Microsoft Office Suite (All programs with 10+ years experience
* Analysis Skills
* Problem Solving

And I have the following experience in these Operating Systems/programming language (my programming language knowledge however is basic)

&amp;#x200B;

* Windows XP/7/8/10
* Windows Server 2016
* MacOS
* iOS/Android
* Red Hat Linux
* Kali Linux
* SQL
* Java
* Python
* JavaScript
* Apple Swift
* HMTL5/CSS

&amp;#x200B;

I also have tons of references from managers, colleagues, professors, co-workers who all speak highly of me and are on my resume. I have an Associate's Degree in IT. I have applied for so many jobs over the last year that I have lost count, along with hundreds of IT jobs in the last 4 years. I'll be 30 in 2 days.

I wasn't getting interviews, but now I'm getting interviews, but ALWAYS being PASSED OVER for someone else. It's infuriating. The last job my recruiter tried getting me, NOBODY got hired out of 10 candidates. I also am fairly certain I am doing well in my interviews. I am confident, I give good posture, I wear nice clothes, style my hair properly to loom professional, have good hygiene, trim my facial hair to be neat and presentable, answer their technical questions and personal questions with not talking too much but giving a good amount of detail to the question and always try to demonstrate my intelligence and education.

I don't have any real work experience though that these stupid American companies find desirable. The only thing I have is the stuff I did for my 2 year Associate's Degree in community college, the 4 years of volunteer IT work at my Australian community college, 1 year at Teletech as help desk support, and 3+ years of working as an IT person for a mom-and-pop mechanic shop where I set up their computer/network and do their IT maintenance for them while they pay me in cash for the hours I work (it's basically under the table contract work, but the manager vouches my work as a great reference).

I also don't have a Bachelor's Degree (yet) as I have applied for University and am hopefully getting a Bachelor's in Information Systems (I don't like Computer Science) with a second major in Japanese studies/the language during the next 3-4 years.

The other thing that pains me and infuriates me when people bring it up is I have permanent facial palsy, so I do have a speech impediment, however my speech is understandable and I have had years of speech therapy as a child. Technically yes I am disabled, and have been living off SSI for the last 4 years which was a terrible mistake, and I am trying to get off of it with a proper IT job. I've also been discriminated not only for my disability, but my race as well (I'm Southeast Asian/Thai) although I've never been able to sue for it due to lack of incriminating evidence that would be acceptable in court.

With my LinkedIn, I took my parents who are a Business Analyst and an accountant with a MBA, studied their profiles and copied their formatting to make my own LinkedIn as professional as possible. Most of the stuff you see on here are taken from my resume and LinkedIn. It also gets noticed daily by people and I get messages from recruiters offering me job applications in IT.

Along with all of this, I constantly self-study, am always learning and updating my knowledge on technology and what's new/evolving, constantly trying to improve my knowledge and experience with learning new skills, and am studying to get my COMPTIA A+ certification.

And despite all of this... **I still have not gotten a goddamn IT job. I've wasted so much of my life trying to get my foot into this god-forsaken field but nobody will hire me for an entry-level position when I feel I am CLEARLY qualified to perform the tasks and learn to improve my IT knowledge and experience. It's a catch-22 with this field. I need the experience to get the job, but I need the JOB to GET the experience (especially since no internship has taken me). I've never gotten a single internship or job offer as I was always passed over FOR SOMEONE ELSE.**

I've built computers from scratch at home and at college, I've fixed broken computers and laptops, I've replaced parts, installed operating systems, changed operating systems, programmed basic software applications, designed websites, done ticketing systems, monitored performance on computers/networks, written into knowledge bases online and have documentation experience, led a real life IT project in college for a museum, trained myself to use Windows servers at home by virtualizing 3-4 servers and desktops with VMWare so I could learn Windows Server 2016 and Active Directory, I've taken proficiency and assessments tests on recruitment websites and took them until I got a high score to impress interviewers, I've set up my own networks and other people's networks, routers, printers, etc.

I've used so many job search websites: Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster, DICE, SimplyHired, ZipRecruiter, as well as applying to HUNDREDS of company websites and recruitment agencies. NOTHING but interviews and that's it, or not even hearing from them, or the most insulting: A damn automated message saying ""They're going with other people"".

I get good feedback from people and constructive criticism on how to improve my interview skills from recruiters and have had years of interview experience. YEARS.

What the hell am I doing wrong? I've followed everyone's advice and have gotten **NOWHERE.** What am I supposed to do to get into this field?! My career has been meaningless because it has never taken off. At this point, I have a better chance of getting better at digital art and somehow making money off that than getting an IT job and starting my IT career...

Tell me what I'm supposed to do to get an IT job and start my IT career when **The United States of America does not want to hire me for a single IT job let alone an entry-level one**"

UIUC, UMass, &amp; Purdue (5.5/10): struggled hard writing short 100 word supplementals :/ but I tried to tie my crochet background to computer science and how I use it as creative fuel

UMich, Georgia Tech, UW-Madison (7/10): tried my best to research schools thoroughly and use it in the Why-Us essays. I think they were okay, but tying what I liked most about the schools back to myself was hard to do and felt quite stiff

Overall, very happy! UMich OOS was definitely unexpected, considering I didn't think I had the most mindblowing EC's. I'm still waiting on several RD schools, including my top choice (Udub CS!), but if I don't get in, I'll probably go to UMich. Despite the obscene amount of OOS tuition, UMich was actually pretty generous with my military benefits, even offering instate tuition after I exhaust them. After Udub, they are my second least expensive option.

Feeling optimistic for the RD round! I've overthought and fretted throughout this whole process but now it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders."

I am currently a sophomore and I am in my final semester(spring) of my sophomore year. I just completed  a rather inexpensive introductory course that is a precursor to doing a bootcamp for this institution. The bootcamp also happens to be affiliated/a part of a state university. I wanted to ask if doing this bootcamp along with bachelors is a smart idea assuming money is not an issue. I want to do both as I have never been a historically successful self learner and my school does not offer much in cybersecurity which is the career I want to pursue. I’d really appreciate some help and insight into the matter because I see a lot of people saying a bootcamp is good and other people saying that it is bad. I just feel like the bootcamp will help me improve my knowledge in the field, better prepare me for certification exams, and help me to find and internship or intro job which. I don’t see it being possible for me to not do a bachelors degree which is why I want to know if doing both will look good or be useful for me."

But, in my tired state, I couldn’t remember several things, I bombed on basic linear algebra principles after finishing partial diff EQ last semester. I just feel like such a mess right now. I put off classes preparing for this, and yet I can’t answer the most basic of engineering principles. I came out of that interview just feeling embarrassed, feeling like I wasted everyone’s time.

I received an Atlassian offer for SWE intern, but I would have to renege JPMorgan if I accept Atlassian.

With all the layoffs happening rn, and the fact that Atlassian had a hiring freeze earlier in the season, and also several Blind post where some Atlassian employees say there will possibly be layoffs soon as some people were let go of recently, I’m afraid that Atlassian might rescind offers. If they don’t, I’m also afraid that I’ll be less likely to receive a full-time offer for new grad which is important to me cause this is my last internship. 
Working at Atlassian seems cool tho and they have great WLB, and also they allow new grads to work remotely. New grad TC is higher. It’s more well known in tech than JPMorgan.

But JPMorgan is more stable, and I’ve heard basically everyone gets return offers and I would like to chill my senior year. Also great WLB, and they have an office in a location I like. But lower new grad TC. Heard their tech stack isn’t as modern? and a lot of interns work with legacy code. I would also be burning a bridge if I reneged, and tbh with how things are rn idk if this would be a smart idea.

If anyone has any advice, please let me know. Thanks so much!"

We are known for our theory-heavy classes and lack of career fairs, and I  worsened the situation even more this year. I was naive and took the  software engineering class in fall and ended up devoting the entire time building frontend, and I wanted to get the project down to get enough  experience to start applying for internships. During the winter I began  frantically applying online, ended up getting a few OAs but wasn't prepared enough to get past any of them. I realized in college that none of us really had enough time to care for proper coding style,  miscommunicated during projects and lacked a streamlined approach like TDD or SCRUM.

I wanted to work for any company during this summer that could give me experiential insight into the SWE career and pushes me to learn industry best practices, and right now it looks like I'm not going to have that crucial experience in college. Could anyone give me some advice on what should I do next to achieve my goals? I'm taking an algo camp to prep for more OAs now, and I am willing to put in as much work as possible to rectify my mistakes, and take less classes next quarter.

I’d like to make myself stand out by having *some* experience before getting a big person job by going through an internship. It will make me more marketable (for many reasons, not that it’s just an internship) as well as fill in any gaps I have leaving my boot camp.

Are there any internships that don’t have the “must be currently enrolled in a B.S…” requirement? Everything I am finding on LinkedIn or Indeed have this stipulation.

Was wondering if there is any truth to that and if it possible to remedy that?

And if so, how?",zanzarellaa,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1115yd6/should_i_negotiate_my_salary_for_an_internship/," Hi, this is my first ever Reddit post, but the moment has come for me where I need to hear multiple perspectives from strangers on the Internet.

I'll try to be brief: I graduated in December 2021, got an internship in March 2022, and was hired in the same company in October 2022 with a permanent contract and an average pay.

I can't really complain, I'm grateful for my job, but it was never what I *really* wanted to do; it's quite boring and I don't see much growth in the future for me.

I've been searching through job postings for months now, trying to be hired permanently in another company where I could get to do what I truly like, but my experience is not enough to do that, at least not in my country. Companies have always contacted me for internship positions, with a significantly lower pay compared to my current job (obviously).

Fast forward to now: I'm in the final stage for getting hired as an intern in a super cool company, where I could really gain the experience I'm looking for and with the possibility of being hired after the internship. I plan to accept their offer...

But my question is: given that I'm leaving a permanent contract with benefits and all that sh\*t for an internship position, could I actually negotiate my pay NOT toward a permanent-level salary, but toward one that is a bit higher than what they're offering?

And if the answer is yes, how would I go about that? I'm kinda panicking and I've never negotiated anything before.

Thanks for your replies!"

I am about to graduate, and the four and a half years I've spent working on my research program were the most traumatizing and challenging years of my life.

I feel exploited and want others not to fall into the trap that somebody should have warned me about. I think all this could have been easily avoided, had there been a universal platform where graduate students could freely exchange practical information about their program and share their experiences. I prepared a little immersive scenario, if you want to get to the details of the idea, scroll down to the conclusion section.

**Before the enrollment:**

You've just got accepted for a project of your dreams. You already see yourself adorned with a graduate cap and robe, holding proudly your well-deserved diploma. Finally, it is your chance to prove yourself, dive deeply into your own innovative scientific project; meet like-minded researchers and gain access to the international scientific community. You're done with the university inscription and the immigration procedures - all ready to go. What can go wrong?

Everything. Graduate students, especially foreigners, are utterly vulnerable and dependent on their research director/PI before, during, and after the program. It's hard to comprehend to what extent before one finds themselves in the position of a graduate student. Before enrolling in the program and joining the research team, we rarely have access to the testimonies of former graduates. If we luckily get in touch with them, they are often the ones chosen by the director/PI. Our whole future career is in the hands of the director/PI, and being all enthusiastic and full of optimism PhD candidates - we usually won't risk our freshly-gained acceptance for the thesis by pushing too much in the search for a second opinion.

**During the enrollment**:

Let’s say it is going not-so-well. You find yourself far away from home, with no support network, and in financial dire straits. You are left alone with the project with nobody to guide you. The only interaction you have with your director/PI consists of submitting monthly reports, and you feel that you're nothing but cheap labor in their eyes. You start to accumulate grudges and contempt for your supervisors, but you won't dare to search for help at the university. Besides, what can they do? Everybody knows that a thesis is a struggle, it's normal. The time passes, the project does not advance very well, and you struggle with motivation. Even without paying the tuition fees, you’re way below the poverty line - you must work part-time along with your thesis. You’re exhausted, but you persist anyway. You’ve spent too much time working on the project, it’s too late to give it up. You see your friends travel, buy their first house, start a family, and have well-paid jobs.

Your whole life during graduate studies depends on your research director/PI. It's them who oversee your funding, it's them who will provide you with the documents necessary to prolong your student visa (if you require one). It's they who can make the thesis either an opportunity for growth or a living hell. Research directors/PI can exert their power over graduate students with total impunity. No university (especially a paid North American university) will intervene if the graduate experience is not satisfying for the students, yet the research team still generates diplomaed doctors. No university will risk its reputation or the participation of a renowned researcher in a graduate program for the sake of a student's well-being. Quitting is always an option, but one would have to explain the hell of a long gap in the CV, as well as justify to oneself the long months of exploitation endured. Many of us hope to graduate soon, oblivious or kidding ourselves about the unpredictability of a scientific project, which can take long years to develop. For many of us, a thesis in a foreign country is a chance to enter the world of international research, would be a pity to mess that up, right?

**After graduation**: You finally got your diploma. You managed. Was it worth the struggle? Did it prepare you to enter the job market and find a post that will compensate you according to your expertise and all the years spent studying? Looks like the best you can opt for is a post-doc. It seems like after at least ten years of studies you still need an ''internship'' to refine your competencies. You'd gladly move on and forget about those years spent working on the thesis, but wait

...you need your research director's reference letter to get a job.

**Conclusion**: Why is it just us, the students, who need the reference letters? What if the research directors needed to prove that they are apt to guide the students along the thesis before they enroll a new student? Or at least, we, the students, should have the possibility to take conscious decisions on what we are putting ourselves in before we start a long-term engagement in a research team.

**The information gap must disappear.**

**The exploitation of graduate students must stop.**

We need an international platform where each research graduate’s experience would be rated, and the information would be freely available to the student community. Graduate students suffer all around the world. This platform will be certainly filled with complaints and warning signs, but we must not forget to acknowledge and share our experiences with amazing mentors who inspired us to pursue a career in research in the first place.

Science-hub changed the dynamics of access to knowledge. We need to do the same with graduate studies - to take away the power from the ones who monopolize it and wield it to our advantage. I propose an idea to create a platform inspired by Glassdor-like websites. We can call it a ‘’PhDeal’’. Specify your university, specify your program, and name your research director. Then, anonymously, share the information about:

&amp;#x200B;

**General info about the studies:**

Status in the country: Citizen/ foreign student, etc

The duration of the thesis ……… years

The maximal duration of the thesis ……… years

I am currently doing research on open-source SIEM solutions as a part of an internship. While I glanced over solutions such as graylog and Zabbix, am mainly focusing on AlienVault OSSIM and Security Onion 2.

Reading articles and going through documentations can be beneficial but since I am tasked to choose one to implement in later stages of my internship, I wanted to hear about these different solutions from a practical point of view.

For my fellow blue teamers , what is your experience with the mentioned open-source SIEMs or any other open-source SIEMs and what is the best and worst things to deal with using it?

Thank you in advance!"

I have lots of free time for the next 3 to 4 months (around 50-70 hours a week) and was wondering if I could possibly get a job before around about june if I just learn as fast as possible.

I can learn new concepts and skills pretty quick so learning in a small amount of time isnt a problem however I am questioning whether to just gain as much knowledge about python, SQL, jS and certain languages myself and then work on projects would be better than starting a bootcamp(like ofin project which I've heard good things about), which might be slower than my pace of learning through books and yt videos, will get me a job quickly.

Also, how much experience or projects (good projects too not just lots of crappy ones) do you have to have before you can apply for something like an internship which is quicker than a full on job.

Sorry if this sounds confusing but I hope you get what I'm trying to say."

Stole the formatting from this guy: [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/z3q0wf/a_summary_of_my_internship_hunt_for_summer_2023/)

I’ll try to keep it pretty concise. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about these companies.

# Background:

Education: US Citizen, Junior, T30, Computer Engineering, a decent amount of low-level courses under my belt but had barely taken any pure CS courses.

Experience: 2 internships at no name startups (one for robotics, one for web dev), and TAed my school’s algo course in Fall 2022.

Projects: I genuinely don’t even recall what I put on my resume at the beginning of the application season, but eventually I threw on some school projects. Built an emulator/interpreter for a very small instruction set (I’m talking 14 instructions, like I said, school project), a lossy image compressor/decompressor, and a pipelined CPU in VHDL.

Will provide resume upon request, but really don't want to dox myself.

# Statistics:

250+ apps (stopped tracking after like 255), maybe 20ish OAs (maybe more if you count auto OA?), 9 apps where I moved past OA/resume screen stage, 6 onsites, 3 offers. Applied to general SWE, and some embedded positions (since I have a ECE background).

Leetcode: when I received my offers, maybe I understood 50 (or less) problems. I’ve been brushing up on my LC recently as I bombed all the difficult OAs sent to me but all the offers I got weren’t that difficult on the technical side.

CodeSignals submitted: 734 (to Cap One), 751 (Databricks, Samsara), 733 (Instabase, ZipRecruiter), 823 (Square).

Bombed a decent portion of my OAs. Didn’t even attempt the following (but they were nice enough to send me an OA): Citadel, HRT, IMC, DRW, SIG, TikTok.

Other companies that sent me an OA: Cisco, Cap One, Blackrock, Valkyrie Trading, Roblox, Instabase, Databricks, Reliable Robotics, Samsara, Axon, Confluent, Addepar, Paypal, ZipRecruiter, Tulip Interfaces, Arista Networks, Verkada, Gusto, Square, Zipline, Zoox. Bombed at least 50% of these.

Here’s the application process for the six companies that I got quite deeply into the process.

The scale of 1-10 denotes difficulty, I’d say 1/10 is super easy, 10/10 is extremely difficult.

# Silicon Labs (offer)

**Position**: Embedded Software Engineering Intern

**Timeline**: 9/17: Applied, no referral -&gt; 9/27: Invitation to schedule first interview -&gt; 9/28: First interview (technical) -&gt; 9/28: Invitation to schedule second (and final) interview -&gt; 10/3: Second and final interview (technical) -&gt; 10/10: Phone offer, then official offer shortly after

**Comments**: straightforward technical interviews, I think they just wanted to make sure I knew my way around the C language and understood interrupts. A lot of embedded related questions (what’s an ISR? what’s ISR latency? What is the volatile/const/static keyword in C?). One big coding problem in second interview, not DSA, was more ISR-related.

**Behavioral**: ?/10, I genuinely do not remember much behavioral being asked if any.

**Technical OA**: N/A

**Technical Interview**: 6/10. Not hard, but domain knowledge needed, so study your embedded.

**Comp**: same as levels.fyi, 38/hr + 3k signon.

# Palantir (rejected)

**Position**: Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline**: Applied online with referral (9/5) -&gt; Skipped the Karat interview (was this a mistake? All my friends who got referred did the Karat LOL) -&gt; had to email recruiter for update -&gt; Recruiter screen (10/13) -&gt; onsite invitation (10/17) -&gt; onsite (10/24) -&gt; rejection (10/26).

**Comments:** Just flopped on the onsite. I think I flubbed my behavioral a bit, didn’t communicate nearly clear enough when writing code / doing the system design, and was overall nervous bc I showed up late (link didn’t work on my browser RIP). This could’ve easily swung the other way if I was more prepared IMO.

**Behavioral**: 5/10, pretty standard stuff: why palantir, what excites you, tell me about yourself.

**Technical OA**: N/A

**Technical Interview**: 7/10. Wasn’t too too difficult, just hard to prepare and not LC-esque.

**Comp:** no offer but imagine it was consistent w/ levels.

# Arista Networks (rejected):

**Position:** Software Engineering Intern (I think?)

**Timeline:** Went to career fair (mid September) → sent OA after career fair (10/7) → invited for final round technical (10/17) → did technical (10/18) → rejected (10/29)

**Comments:** The OA was a 5-10 liner, was very trivial to do in python (thank you lambda functions). The technical round was all in C (Arista is a networks company, I imagine their stack is in C). Some C trivia included – bitshifting / bitwise operations, struct padding, how much space an array of 0 bytes takes up, and then basic algo (I got asked a binary search question). Regarding the rejection, hiring manager told me it was a headcount issue (I did well, but others did slightly better, they could only hire 2 interns from my school, yada yada). I helped my friend interview there next week and he got the offer so I’m happy about it.

**Behavioral**: N/A

**Technical** **OA**: 2/10

**Technical Interview**: 6/10. Not inherently difficult, but again domain specific (know your C).

**Comp:** no offer but my friend’s offer was $80k prorated (\~38/hr).

# Redacted Startup (offer)

DM for company name if you’re interested in C / low-level networking / distributed systems / low-latency trading / FPGA stuff, don’t want to dox myself.

​**Position:** Software Engineering Intern

**Timeline:** Met recruiter at campus event (9/15) → applied (9/15) → OA (9/16) -&gt; Asked to schedule phone screen (10/5) -&gt; phone screen (10/10) → scheduled 3x45 interviews (2x45 technical, 1x45 with VP, behavioral-ish?) on 10/10 → did the 3x45 (10/17) -&gt; offer (10/18).

**Comments:** Again, specific knowledge of C is kinda required here. The actual technical coding questions ended up being fairly straightforward (find if a number is prime, find cycle in LL), and then they also grilled me on related low level and DS concepts (describe TCP/IP, what’s a process / thread, describe a hash table / collision resolution algorithms, when would you use a LL vs array, tradeoffs of each). What’s weird is that my two friends who interviewed here got vastly different coding questions. I got freebies. Weird!

**Behavioral**: 5/10. Standard behavioral.

**Technical** **OA**: 7/10. 2 very easy questions, one very hard one that I did not finish (implement from scratch some sorting algorithm on a given struct, with tiebreaking). All in C.

**Technical Interview**: 6.5/10. It’s very background specific – if you don’t have a low-level, systems background and a good grasp on that stuff you’ll struggle, but luckily I did so I was able to answer most of their questions.

**Comp:** 38/hr negotiated up to 40/hr.

# Verkada (rejected)

​**Position:** Embedded Software Engineering Intern

**Timeline:** Recruiter messaged me on Linkedin (11/14) → skipped a phone screen (recruiter was gonna call, but just moved me onto OA lol) on 11/30 → OA (12/1)  -&gt; Passed OA, get asked to schedule recruiter phone screen (12/8) -&gt; phone screen (12/13) → was told I would get moved on, but reached out bc they ghosted me until after holidays -&gt; technical scheduled (1/6) -&gt; technical (1/9) -&gt; reject (1/11).

**Comments:** Long process, similar to Palantir’s. Would’ve needed to pass an additional onsite after technical round (both technical + behavioral) before offer. They asked me what was in hindsight a reasonable question, but given that I was interviewing for an embedded position, I don’t know why I got asked to implement a thread-safe API. Also, having never coded anything related to threads in C++ before, this was just an hour of me frantically googling and seg faulting. At least I learned about consumer / producer threads and how they work in conjunction.

**Behavioral**: 5/10. Standard behavioral.

**Technical** **OA**: 6/10, two LC easy/easy-medium, one LC medium that I brute forced.

**Technical Interview**: 7/10. Like I said, multithreaded shit, this LC monkey was bamboozled and I wasn’t able to get a working solution. In hindsight, if I had just played around with threads in C/C++ before, I think I would’ve been in better shape.

**Comp:** Same as levels I’m assuming, no offer here.

# Samsara (offer)

​**Position:** SWE intern (rejected) -&gt; firmware intern (offer)

**Timeline:** 9/15: Applied, no referral -&gt; 9/16: Got CodeSignal GCA (auto) -&gt; 9/27: Submitted CodeSignal (score: 751) -&gt; ghosted for 2 months, no exaggeration -&gt; 12/1: phone screen with note that I had passed OA/resume screen -&gt; 12/4: Phone screen (light behavioral), verbally moved onto final round (technical) -&gt; 12/9: Did final round -&gt; 1/10: Emailed for update -&gt; 1/18: Recruiter said SWE intern is full, but if you're interested in firmware, let's set up a call with firmware manager -&gt; 1/20: Talked with firmware manager, turns out I passed technical but they ran out of HC for SWE -&gt; 2/8: got firmware offer

**Comments:** Not sure how I got this. A lot of luck, because it sure wasn’t skill. (Edit: I’m guessing it was more of a culture / personality hire—Samsara puts a large emphasis on culture, it even shows up in their annual reports to investors, and everyone I met at Samsara seems really cool / fun to talk to.) Shitty resume + shitty codesignal score but somehow moved on. The actual technical itself was the easiest of any onsite / technical round I had – it was a string parsing problem, I did it in Python. No algo, just implementation heavy. I’m guessing that to compare candidates, the difference is who can do it faster and cleaner since most people would be able to get some solution working if not the whole thing. Surprised that the whole technical process was OA -&gt; 1x45 easy, expected much more for a tech company paying as much as Samsara.

**Behavioral**: 5/10. Standard behavioral.

**Technical** **OA**: 8/10, this was the codesignal CGA and I bombed lol (751).

**Technical Interview**: 4/10. Just implementation heavy, so while I didn’t completely finish it, I chatted with the interviewer about how I would do it (it was literally brute force more or less).

**Comp:** Same as levels, 51/hr + 5k housing. FT offer also aligns with levels (\~200K for HCOL).

# Reflections/comments

Ended up taking Samsara intern offer, I was comparing FT offers and the startup (which I originally accepted) does not compare: \~130K TC vs \~200K TC. I also enjoyed meeting with the engineers at Samsara, and the internship program seems super fun.

Things that I have learned along the way:

* Use simplify.jobs, Pitt CSC repo. Thank god for those.
* You need a well formatted, descriptive resume, and even with a good one, 10% response rate is good. Resume screens are brutal.
* A lot of luck goes into this. I get rejections from places that I thought I did well on (OA, or even just interviews), and then got the Samsara offer.
* Build your network. I didn’t have much of a network this year and kinda struck out at a lot of places before even interviewing (at resume stage). If you have referrals, or recruiter info from previous years, that guarantees that at least your resume gets seen by a person.
* Referrals are hit or miss. I didn’t even get OA/phone screen after I got referred to: Stripe, Amazon, Google, Wayfair.
* Neetcode is goated.
* Communicate thought process during technicals. I definitely froze up on some interviews when I got stuck, but you have to just keep talking instead of shutting down and going silent.
* Be personable. While I didn’t get an offer on any of the technicals I bombed, in my opinion, having a good time with the interviewer means they’re more inclined to vouch for you if you did decent on the technical.
* Prep your behavioral, and have good questions to ask. Many of these technicals were 80% technical, but they start off with a ""tell me about yourself"" and end with ""do you have any questions for me?"" That's an opportunity to show that you're interested in the company, and can communicate well.

Good luck job hunting, you beautiful bastards. Feel free to PM/chat if you have any questions."

Should I start with Data analytics or Data science?,Routine-Ad-9608,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/111feq6/new_collegegrad_looking_to_enter_the_field_should/,"Hi there, I recently graduated from college w/ a major in computer science and a minor in statistics. I originally was planning on going into software development however my last semester I took my university’s intro to machine learning course and really enjoyed it and decided to pursue data science. 

So far I’ve just been going through online resources to familiarize myself with the field and how to make myself a more suitable candidate. Learning the basics of data preprocessing, wrangling, and EDA. I did an introductory course on PyTorch to learn more about ML frameworks and modeling.

I know the next step is to start building a project portfolio but I’m at a bit of a cross roads. From what I’ve read it’s pretty difficult to get an entry level data science job right out of college and you really have to have an outstanding project portfolio or resume. Although I went to a really good public university, I made a lot of mistakes, my gpa is subpar, I only have one front end dev internship under my belt and I haven’t started a project portfolio besides basic EDA and modeling to learn. 

I really want to enter the work force as soon as possible and don’t know if I have the time to build an impressive project portfolio to get an entry data science position. The advise I was given was to start applying to data analyst positions and gain experience for a year or two. In the meantime to be doing independent projects and might even do a one year masters program with a focus in ML/DS and then transition to data science.

I apologize for the lengthy post but my question is basically whether I should focus more on getting experience in querying, building data pipelines and reports to get a job in data analytics now and focus on building a data science portfolio later on or pursue an entry level data science job now?"

I just got a call this morning from the Hydraulics Engineering Center by the US Army Corps of Engineers offering me the job(computer science trainee) I interviewed for a few weeks ago. I’m not exactly sure what I’ll be doing, but when I asked them in the interview they said I’ll be using C#. So it sounds like it will be a developer position, and i’ll be working with one of the engineers who interviewed me. It should last 3-12 months depending on how long i want to stay, and i can transfer to a full time position after a few thousand hours. I have a few questions that i’d appreciate my fellow cs people to help me out with. For context, i’m a fourth year cs major with no previous tech work experience, some club project experience, and at a mid-high tier public uni(t40 overall).

Would the fact that it’s a government job hinder my future job opportunities? Like would I be tied to it? Also, would the fact it’s a government job make it perceived less well on a resume? I’d assume it’s more about WHAT I do in the internship that matters rather than the company. Finally, if I wanted to work towards the more prestigious tech industry(faang/f50), would working here give me good experience/set me up? I know it’s hard to tell from the limited info I have about the job, but I also have some limited info. Any input about working in a government job would help. Thank you!"

I hope to get into a quant company in the future and want to begin to get companies and experiences that set me up for that opportunity.

The finance company would make me relocate for the summer but at a higher pay. It also would be for mobile app development which I’m not too experienced in and may not help me for quant.

the pharma company is confirmed to be software but not sure what it is yet. lower pay but don’t need to relocate. i also might be able to do part time during the semester as well after the summer as it is very close by and has good relations with my university

really not sure which one to take as i see pros and cons for both. hope to get some advice!"

While most of my peers went into Business Analyst or other analyst positions, I was more passionate about the technical side and wanted to start my career in IT, with aspirations of eventually moving into Cybersecurity. I tried to gain experience through internships, but had no luck. Now, a few months have passed since my graduation and I have applied to over 200 jobs, but only received two interviews. 

I am targeting entry-level IT support, desktop support, and helpdesk positions and have obtained the CompTIA A+ certificate, as well as having customer service experience. I am not picky about salary or location, yet I still cannot understand why I am not receiving more interviews. Also had my resume checked over multiple times so I'm sure it's not the problem. I am now more concerned about finding a career in any field, rather than just getting into IT.

There are many posts in this subreddit about helpdesk horror stories, with people expressing depression with their job and difficulty in advancing. Would I be avoiding a potential pitfall by pursuing more traditional business or analyst roles, given my degree, rather than competing in this IT rat race? Any advice is greatly appreciated."

Ever since 10th and 11th grade, I've been really interested in CS, and have made comprehensive plans to learn web development or machine learning, etc. and build said cool projects with them and get internships. However, I've also had a really poor work ethic, and would procrastinate school work so much so that I barely had time for those things. I wanted to get into competitive programming or data science competitions too, and I didn't do that too. Worse yet, I would cheat my way through high school. I basically cheated my way through AP CSA, Data Structures, Discrete Math, and Calculus. I got the credits for these classes by taking exemption exams that I cheated on, and being placed in high level classes right now, but I have no idea what I'm doing. A lot of these projects seem really convoluted to me, and I cannot do something as simple as reverse a linked list or perform depth first search. 

I see kids who've actually learned a lot about coding in high school, people who've done really cool side projects, and gone really far with competitive programming, etc. While I sit here not knowing basic data structures and OOP taking higher level classes than many of them, I cannot help but to be consumed in regret. I wish I had the problem solving abilities and the stuff that they've done, and I get so insecure whenever I see Githubs of my friends, and my Github is pretty much blank with maybe one or two tiny projects in the past 3 years. What sucks is that a couple years ago, I had so much ambition to learn so much about CS, and do so much, and I just killed it. I feel like a blank slate, and my sense of achievement is tied to what I've done. I've had to lie on my resume a lot to make up for the fact that I genuinely have done nothing, I don't even have the base knowledge big tech companies are expecting. I cheated on my OAs and did horribly on all but one interview, that was only because barely any technical questions were asked in that one interview. 

I want to become a problem solver of their level, and have build really cool projects, stuff that's cool enough to get me into a big tech company. I want to get an internship at a reputable company and excel without cheating my CS classes by the end of this year. 

I know this is all my fault, and I hate myself for cheating like this and not doing the work. I get stuck in regret cycles and have struggled to take action for the past 2 years. But I just want to move on from it, relearn the fundamentals I missed, build cool projects, leetcode, and get an internship at faang or something similar by the end of this year. This is not a shipost. I just needed to get this out because I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about this. I know I'm a smart guy, and I am good at learning things or developing problem solving skills rapidly, but putting in the work has been really difficult for me. 

Any advice on how to go about this?"

I’m always wanting to hang out with people, but feel horrible whenever I do. I’m on my third job within the last 6 months and getting ready to quit, as my coworkers behavior is causing me paranoia. I’m going on another group tour this summer but I’m scared shitless because the last one I went on wasn’t fun at all since I barely spoke to anyone. 

I almost feel like I’m destined to live my life alone, since I tend to have to choose between being lonely and depressed and being stressed and paranoid. Whenever anything good does happen, though, I end up preparing for it to hit the fan and disappear. 

It doesn’t help that I have an extremely busy schedule as well (I work 23 hours per week, am taking 18 credits this semester, running a disability advocacy group, and doing a credit bearing internship).

Basically, I have doubts about getting a summer internship at this point and I've also been lazy on that front as well.  I'm afraid I'll gain no experience at this rate and fall behind. Seeing other people getting internships certainly hasn't helped me either. 

I've heard that research is another option for gaining experience during the summer, but I have no clue/idea where to start. I saw that SUPERB was a thing, but it seems its past the application deadline.

What have your guy's been experience during the summer (without internships)? I'm worried I'll spend another unproductive summer. Any advice would be appreciated!"

We only work with the cloud, and my responsibility is mostly the migration to gcp, but also the small usual helpdesk work.

The thing is that this position is a paid intern position, but as I'm the sole admin that makes it very hard for me to work, as most of my questions aren't answered by my colleagues as they know nothing about GCP basically.

I have no professional experience in this field, except my aws cloud dev studies (which I feel, has only given me example workshops with no real production environment).

I want to keep working here but everyday I feel overwhelmed and take too long to finish any task because I have to learn almost everything from scratch by myself.

Also it feels weird that I am hired as an intern without having any ""mentor"". 

I'm going to have a 1:1 with my manager and I don't know what to say without saying that I don't know Jack shit haha.

What would you do if you were in my position in order to feel motivated and confident?

My first two years of university I studied CS. Sadly, due to mental health reasons, I failed many of my courses in my second year. Because of this, my university is not allowing me to pursue a bachelors degree in CS anymore and my GPA put me into academic probation. This forced me to declare a major in psychology (something im somewhat interested in but not passionate about). I find job and intern listings requiring a CS degree and a transcript for checking GPA. Combining layoffs and the mass saturation CS students, I feel extremely discouraged. Transferring universities would be hard with my GPA and my parents are very persistent on me getting a “university bachelors degree” than an associates degree at a local college. I work on my side projects (almost) daily to build a portfolio and regularly enter hackathons. I apply for many intern roles and jobs but i also feel like people see my degree and skip through my resume. As much as I love CS, am I chasing a future i might not get?"

It makes me extremely sad that even after scoring high throughout college, receiving awards, and having done quite good quality internships I am at this point. I still have few results awaiting and am waiting to see what destiny has planned for me. Felt like sharing it with people who are going through the same situation.

Edit : The program I got a reject from is MS in engineering management. My college is a tier 2 college in Chennai (Kattankulathur). My SOP was reviewed and edited by a good consultancy agency. If anybody has the time and can give me a review on my SOP, LOR and resume, my DMs are open for your generosity.

Edit 2: To the people questioning me as to why I didn’t write my own SOP . I never said I did not write it , I said it was REVIEWED and EDITED ( for grammatical and continuance of flow ) . I wrote it on my own , but since I can’t put up my essay here , to justify that I don’t think it was a bad SOP I mentioned about getting it reviewed and edited ."

1125t5w,9,2023-02-14,"I want to leave my first post-college job as it is a bad environment, but I'm worried about the future of my career if I do",crime-wizard,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1125t5w/i_want_to_leave_my_first_postcollege_job_as_it_is/,"Hi Everyone, 

I started my first post-college job several months ago (I work in Finance), and I'm considering leaving as it is beginning to become unbearable, but I'm worried about how this will effect my career.

It is an American company that began doing business in my country around 5 years ago. I was hired along with two other new starters, they didn't seem to have the capacity to train three people at once and it led to some confusion with two of us doing nothing while the other was being trained and vice versa. Furthermore, the existing employees had formed a pretty tight clique and didn't seem too eager to invite us new starters in. I was willing to look past this as I understood that we were new. 

Not too long into the job I began to notice blatant favouritism from the higher ups toward some of my colleagues (some of whom are people I technically report to as they're one position above me, but not at a management level) and it became evident pretty quickly that some people could do no wrong so to speak. This wasn't really a problem until I began having to work closely with these people. We have weekly (yes, weekly) 1:1's with out managers who assess our performance (despite the fact they see very little of what I actually do as I'm working with the Senior (my job title). On several occasions, one particular senior who can do no wrong in the eyes of management has dumped her part of the work on me and when I of course wasn't able to finish it , I could hear her on the phone to my manager very loudly downtalking me just before my weekly 1:1, which went terribly and all of my counterpoints were seen as excuses. Further to this these 1:1s never acknowledge any of the good work we do, as the seniors who actually see what we're doing only pass on minor mistakes we make (such as naming a file wrong), and the whole meeting always focuses on the negative. The seniors never seem to tell me if I've made a minor mistake, they always wait until just before my 1:1 to tell the manager. 

Which leads me to probably the worst part about the job, the micromanagement. In the beginning, we had to have absolutely everything we did reviewed. I understood this initially and expected I'd be left to do my job after a few weeks but no. Nearly six months in, me and the other new starters still can't even send an email between departments without having a senior review it. As it usually takes them a while to come review it, this frequently turns a 5 minute job into a 45 minute one, and then of course we get in trouble when it isn't done in a ""timely manner"" despite the fact it would have taken me no more than 5 minutes to do it myself. I would say there is twice if not three times the amount of micromanagement compared to my internship, which is ridiculous.

The final straw for me was yesterday. I was in a pay review with my manager and her boss where I was informed I would not be receiving a raise as I wasn't ""taking up the employee journey with us to the standard we expect"". I was also informed that I wouldn't be receiving my bonus and would be given extra work to ""improve my performance"". I told them I could understand maybe not receiving a raise but taking my bonus away and punishing me with more work was totally unfair considering the amount of good work I had done which they themselves had acknowledged. Their reply to this (in convoluted corporate speak) was basically ""you're still on probation so just be thankful we're not firing you! 🥰""

I don't claim to be the best employee in the world, but I am certainly not a bad one and I am being treated completely unfairly. I have made up my mind about leaving, but I'm worried about how this will affect my career in the future as it's my first job in my field out of college. I can always temporarily return to my old barista job I had in college if necessary as I know the owners of the coffeeshop personally, so I won't be too stuck for cash while I look for another job. I'm worried that I might jeopardise my future by leaving this job so early, but I can't really bear it anymore. Any advice/guidance would be very much appreciated, thank you!"

What do I do?",AmbitiousCustard5495,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1126vy5/i_have_the_chance_of_a_lifetime_this_summer_but/,"So, I’ve always wanted to work in psychology. It’s been a dream of mine for years, and while it’s changed a little bit (I went from wanting to be a therapist to a child forensic interviewer for the FBI), the major was still the same. I’ve worked really hard for this goal. I’ve even gotten in touch with a CFI that works for the FBI, who I talked to about the steps I should take. 

This summer, I have the opportunity to intern at a Child Advocacy center, which would not only get me some of the experience I need for the FBI, but would look phenomenal on my college apps. The issue is, my dad wants me to give this up and take 3 weeks off of work to go down to Florida and visit him. 

I know, this makes me sound awful. I haven’t seen him for months, and he just got out of the hospital due to alcohol issues. I’m selfish. I know. But he doesn’t make effort to come down here, ever. it has been years since he has come to our state to visit US. We are always going down to see him, which becomes an issue for both my mother, who has to find time to do this when she is also busy a lot of the time, and the people around him, since he doesn’t have a license, is too scared to get a license, yet expects everyone to drop everything to drive him halfway or pick us up from the airport. i’ll be honest. I’m tired. Most the time we are down there he is at work or sleeping, and we never go anywhere or do anything with him. We’re just sitting in the house for weeks. 

Maybe i’ll get a lot of hate for this post, but I honestly do not know what to do. I just don’t see the point in giving up such an amazing opportunity to guy see a man who doesn’t put in the effort. he’s too depressed and too busy throwing a pity party about how horrible his life is to actually make time for us, so why should I even go down there?"

Ups and downs are part of it, but we always managed to get through it. 2022 was especially tough, since her employer decided not to renew her contract, which caused her to be jobless in November (right before the most expensive month of the year), her car was found to be not safe for traffic participation (which means she had to buy a new one) and she bruised her ribs (during a game of rugby, this was especially hard on her since she got a lot of energy from playing). All these events caused her to become somewhat depressed and this did not improve the situation at home. However, we got through it, which made me realize we could overcome anything. Therefore, during Christmas, I asked her dad for her hand in marriage. However, a few days later, on January 1st, she told me she wanted to break up. 

She was the one for me. I could not be mad at her, because she did not do anything to me which allowed me to hate her. We spend 10 years together, we been through so much together. Graduation, internships, living abroad, we shared everything with each other. Now she is gone, left me, all by myself. Our goals in life were travel, looking for a house to buy, marriage and maybe children. All those goals were terminated, I lost a huge part of myself. 

It is incredibly difficult for me to be on my own, my best mates live miles away and I do not have a car. Family is barely willing to help out and two weeks ago my sister told me she did not want me to come to her birthday. No idea why. She only wanted to talk to me about it face-to-face, but only if dad was there as well. She knew that I was barely holding myself together, with the break-up and all, but she still decided that it was a good idea to put me through more emotional turmoil. 

My ex moved out, she found an apartment incredibly quick, even though the housing-market is horrible and the estimated waiting list can be up to five years. She all about manifestation and that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. But I digress, she wanted me to put my name on the lease of the apartment where we lived together. This made sense and since I wanted to go through the entire process as adults (because I do not want to lose someone completely whom has been in my life for the past ten years and we still understand each other very well) I asked my landlord if it would be possible to change her name on the lease to my name. 

He took this opportunity to raise the rent with $300 (this is allowed since technically I am a new renter and my name was not on the previous lease). This makes my total fixed costs come up to $1800 while I only earn $2100. With only $300 left over, this is not enough to live and buy groceries etc. This means I will become homeless in a month. 

Everyone keeps telling me that I just have to get through this, but I see no point. My life has been reset. My ex took the friends, my landlord takes my home. I have no idea what goals I can set and every time I feel like I need to buckle down, there is always this inner-voice which convinces me that I am not worth it (this is also because I am still heartbroken and feel like I do not amount to anything). I have no energy to look for a new apartment, no energy to do anything. 

I do not enjoy anything I do. I work out everyday because everyone keeps telling me that it will make me feel good about myself, but this is not the case. After running for 6 miles, I feel nothing, when I plan a 'fun' activity, I feel nothing, when I think about dying, I feel nothing. 

It feels like I am already dead, at least, I feel like I imagine being dead feels like. Just an empty husk of flesh that wakes up in the morning, eats, goes to work, eat again and goes to sleep. No feelings at all. Some kind of cruel purgatory. 

Even if I find a new apartment, I am still by myself, alone, with no goals. The apartment that I leased was very nice and now I have not only lost the love of my life, I lose the one thing that I felt like I could be proud of. I will end up in some kind of dump, by myself, as a 30 year old. Starting over again. 

I do not feel like starting over. I do not want to date again, I do not want to go through the entire proces of getting to know someone. 

I think about suicide every morning when I wake up, every night when I go to sleep. I do not know how I can start enjoy life again and I am sick of people saying it will get better, because that is not guarantee. I have no balls to end my own life. Like I said, I feel like there is no difference in dying and living for me at the moment and even if I tried, I cannot even do that. 

I do not know what to do Reddit, I feel lost, see only darkness. If life is really with ups and downs, my life feels like 0.01% ups and 99.9% downs. Is that worth it?"

The first two felt like leet code easy/medium. The last one, I couldn't wrap my head around it. I sort of understood the underlying logic but the timer ran out. 

Here's the question

 You are given an array A of N integers. You can delete some (possibly zero) of its elements. Then the remaining elements in even positions are added and elements in odd positions are subtracted in linear order. What is the maximum possible value of S that could be obtained by performing such deletions? 

ex.

    S = A[0] - A[1] + A[2] - A[3] + ...
    A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
    # Removing 2 results in the array [4, 1, 3]
    # This results in 4 - 1 + 3 = 6
    
    # a more complex example
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
    # Remove 1, 2, 4, 2 which leaves you with [3, 1, 5] = 7

The only brute-force solution I thought of was doing the arithmetic on the whole array first and then removing one element. But it gets harder because you can remove more than one element or possibly zero"

112b5o3,1,2023-02-14,"Have PhD, want to become a teacher",eternally-student,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/112b5o3/have_phd_want_to_become_a_teacher/," I'm trying to figure out the process of becoming a teacher as a second career.

My background: I have a PhD in computer science. I'm 49, and have a successful career behind me working as both an engineer and manager in high tech. I've taught at the university level, taught CS on YouTube (15k subs), and I've been substitute teaching in a public school district (and thus have a California 30-day permit) in the SF Bay Area for the past year. This means I've passed the CBEST, blood tests, etc. What I don't have is a California teaching credential.

I can find lots of information on how to apply to teaching certification programs straight out of undergrad. But everything I can find about mid-career transitions is quite vague, which I believe means there is a lot of ""it depends"" there.

Due to being a stay-at-home dad without the option of moving to a new city, I'd prefer an option with online learning, but I'm open to hearing about other options in the Bay Area.

So I'm hoping you can help answer two questions for me:

1. I see many online schools offering credentialing programs, but I have no way of knowing which ones are worthwhile. Is there any form of reviews or ranking of teacher training programs like there are for undergrad programs? Or can folks here tell me if they've done an online program and found it valuable, or just meh?
2. How do I figure out my next steps? Just call up a school and ask them what their requirements are for mature learners? Or is there some centralized site I can consult to figure out what to do next? For example, the CTC talks about the ""[early completion intern option](https://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/leaflets/early-completion-intern-option-(cl-840))"" that seems like it might be relevant, but I have no idea how to find out where or how anyone is offering such an internship option.

Thank you for your help!"

Background: Was always the ""computer guy"" at previous jobs, roped into IT when we didn't have that department, small businesses, etc, so at 30 decided to go back to college and get an Associates in IT - SysAdmin. Got a couple certs. Did an internship as helpdesk for a University in town, then landed a job as Desktop Support for a manufacturing company(corporate company that owns several companies), hired by the IT Director and only other member of the IT dept at the time. 

Spent 6 months proving myself and was put in charge of all IT for 2 of our companies, as well as Product Owner/Subject Matter Expert for our CAD software for all of our companies(8 in total). Implemented policies(they had none) like complex passwords and non-shared profiles, GPOs, backups(local and cloud), fixed the steaming pile that was their AD. Got a nice raise.

Purchased and set up servers and networking for various sister companies, multiple locations. Built healthy domains, ensured redundancy of hardware and backups, VPN tunnels.

Hired another helpdesk person so I could focus on bigger picture tasks and infrastructure. Got another nice raise and given the title of Senior Support Tech.

I was handed a company card right after the 6 month mark and told I was in charge of purchasing for my ""domains"". Budget has been unlimited as long as it isn't abused. Hardware, licensing, you name it. No questions asked. 

I am happy where I am, but say I wanted to job search...what would you say my title and responsibilities would/should be at the next place? I would consider myself more of a junior Admin based on years of professional experience, but I am the only one here that does actual Sysadmin work. I am the only one who uses linux. I am the only one who uses AWS. The disaster recovery plan is mine. I configure all the Hyper-V hosts. I purchase hardware. I create documentation. At this point I've been with the company for 2 years.

Also any salary ranges with the titles you suggest would be helpful. My current salary is not reflected by my title. I make the same/more than people I know with title of SysAdmin.

Looking forward to the responses."

112dadm,67,2023-02-14,Despre programarele de mentorat,mikezyisra,programare,https://www.reddit.com/r/programare/comments/112dadm/despre_programarele_de_mentorat/,"Mereu au fost foarte multe postari legate de programele de mentorat in IT (si pe serverul de discord, si pe sub-ul asta), asa ca vom da opinia din partea echipei r/programare, si prin urmare toate postarile care pun intrebari legate de subiectul asta vor fi sterse ca spam.

In general \*NU\* recomandam mentoratele de reconversie profesionala in IT, mai ales cele care costa o caruta de bani. Desi riscam sa facem publicitate, stiti fiecare la ce mentorate ma refer in special.

Exista foarte multe resurse online gratuite (sau pe mult mai putini bani): de la carti O'Reily pe fiecare subiect, talk-uri de la cppcon, la cursuri gratuite pentru cei la nivel de inceapator (Harvard CS50 [https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0), cursurile MOOC [https://www.mooc.fi/en/](https://www.mooc.fi/en/)), si chiar si ""degree-uri"" gratuite de computer science ([https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) ,  [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/)  ,  [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)  ). Exista si cursuri pe udemy la 15-20 de euro care va pot ajuta sa incepeti in domeniu, sa aflati cate ceva nou.

Chiar daca pot exista cursuri de mentorat in IT oneste, majoritatea sunt doar bisnitarii.

Daca esti tentat de un curs de mentorat in IT, cauta red flaguri la programul de mentorat si documenteaza-te inainte. Lucrurile cele mai evidente care semnaleaza ca ceva e in neregula:

1. Cei din program te intreaba cat castigi ca sa iti ofere un pret pentru servicii. Nu suntem la targ sa ne bisnitarim si sa profitam de alti oameni. Mai multe detalii pe larg despre asta in video-ul [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_BUEWIZ\_hx8&amp;t=364s&amp;ab\_channel=VlogdeIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BUEWIZ_hx8&amp;t=364s&amp;ab_channel=VlogdeIT)
2. ""Mentorul"" nu are experienta de munca semnificativa. O persoana care are o experienta de munca de 6 luni ca intern (ca la Google sau Facebook sau oriunde altundeva, nu conteaza) \*NU ARE DESTULA EXPERIENTA\* ca sa te ghideze sa fii un developer/programator/inginer/ce vrei tu de succes. Cum se presupune ca cineva care nu are nici macar 2 ani de experienta de munca sa te ajute sa intri la o companie buna sau sa inveti despre domeniu? Nu au avut ei timp sa afle despre domeniu, ce sa mai povestim de ""ajutat"" alti oameni sa faca asta.
3. Costurile sunt absurde. Daca cineva iti cere 3-4-5 mii de euro pentru un curs de genul, e timpul sa iti pui intrebari foarte serioase. Persoana respectiva e un expert in domeniu (cum ar fi, de exemplu Andrei Alexandrescu, sau John Carmack, sau Herb Sutter) cu reputatie foarte buna? Cel mai probabil cursul e legit si, chiar daca e scump, merita considerat. Persoana respectiva e necunoscuta si are putina experienta, si posibil si review-uri rele? Cel mai probabil iti arunci banii pe fereastra.

&amp;#x200B;

Aveti grija ce alegeti si pe ce va cheltuiti banii. Suntem intr-un domeniu extrem de digitalizat si plin de resurse."

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in 2006 in a small city in Serbia. I won't of course say where it was, but it was around 5000 people, maybe less. At the time, my father worked as a translator for the army so he would be away every other week on assignments. His pay was among the best you could get without actually being an entrepreneur, and it wasn't physically straining. It was honestly the perfect job. I was born to a family of 4: me, my dad, my mom, and a brother, 6 years older than me. They had lived there in my dad's parents' estate. It wasn't a mansion, but it was a pretty big plot of land with 2 main houses and a few smaller sheds. I loved that place to shreds. It had lots of room, was close to the center, and it is just generally nostalgic to me. It had this amazing view of a church 2 streets away. Life was good for me at the time. I had toys, a warm place to stay, food, and a loving brother and mother helped of course. I had no clue what my father was about to unleash.

For this story to make any sense, I'll have to talk about my mother and my father. My mother had a boring life, and this is in her own words. She grew up with an older sister in that same town. Her family was very conservative (not in any political or religious sense, just in a social and general sense). They had no aspirations and were deadly afraid of risks or any advancements. This is why she never really got love as a child, and why she never finished college or even started it. She went to a shitty high school because her parents wrongly thought she wouldn't make it in with the grades she had. She easily could have and saw people way worse than her make it in. She was heartbroken. She started smoking. Then, at around 20-something, she met my father, fell in love for some reason, and married him. A few years later, she had my older brother, and then six years later, me. She wanted kids of course, she made it clear, and he said sure. But his reaction to getting the pregnancy confirmed was just... ok. Nothing. He never made it clear he didn't want kids. I'm sure he didn't know what he wanted himself. Hard to blame him, seeing the life he had as a child.

He was born into a Bosnian family, in a small town there, but his mother quickly left for Germany to go work there for money and stability. This is common in my country. He reunited with his mother a few years later but didn't know who she was, so it took some adjusting. She was cold. She seemed nice on the surface, but I would later, with my own eyes, see that she was a borderline sociopath. Just fake ""emotions"". Seemed friendly, but was a total jerk. She never really tried to welcome her grandsons more than just putting out some stale crackers. And it's not like she couldn't. She very well did for her other grandchildren, of my father's sister. Speaking of her, she was born a few years later, once my father help construct the very complex I lived on as a one-year-old, and one that I would come back to every summer break. His father didn't care much too, but at least he was a hard-working man. Very hard working. He was an orphan and worked his way up to pretty admirable wealth for his status. When his sister was born, my father became a total outcast in his family. He was also on pills for his mental conditions, as he had severe depression at one point. He states it was the worst time of his life. He then started wondering if this was the only life we had as a person, and he quickly discovered an alternate religion - Bhakti-yoga, which was a branch of Hinduism in India. His parents hated it, of course, and once he didn't give up on it, they kicked him out. He barely finished his studies later on, but he traveled the world, translating for various religious organizations until he came back here after the civil war and got a job as a military translator. He says his time in India transformed him as a person, and it was the best time of his life.

Anyways, back to me and my brother when I was 2. We moved into this old ""house"" in literally the middle of nowhere. I call it a ""house"" because it was barely that. Sure it looked like a small house, but the bottom floor was literally a gaping void with dirt on the ground and pipes visible, and the upper floor wasn't even carpeted. It was just bare concrete. We never understood why he went there. He claims it was for ""nature"" and ""being in a house rather than a dingy apartment"". We knew he could have done better, but he didn't want to spend more money. You see, he had this sickening obsession with music. He spent so much money on music equipment, and so much of his time listening to music and playing the guitar. He still somehow managed to be only decent. Anyways, for some reason, I had absolute pitch. For those who don't know, it's the ability to recognize tones without a reference point, and in an instant. He claims I was able to say the names of tones at 2 and a half, and I never missed. I also started playing around with his various keyboards and quickly started helping him in playing. He of course saw this and started using me like a fucking tool. Every day I would do something for him. At 4 I started fixing mistakes in his music ""production"" - on the computer, fixing faulty notes, and coming up with progressions. I was able to come up with a full composition on the spot. He always compared it to Mozart, and I never loved bragging, but this isn't bragging. It's the truth. It's just how it was. Believe me when I say I wished I was a dumbass, who never amounted to anything. At least then I wouldn't be abused for my talent.

&amp;#x200B;

Right around when we moved to the house, he lost his job. You see, we were vegetarians (and still are) and he got into a stubborn argument with his supervisor about eating meat. He got fired over it. He lost his ideal job over a fucking diet argument. He was bipolar, so this was no accident or surprise. It would only get worse over the years. He then dedicated himself to trying to find a new job and finally finishing his master's - 30 years later. He barely did it after 4 long years of procrastination, and ""initiation"" into a higher rank in his religion. After he found a job in a nearby school, he then decided to move to the city - but for all the wrong reasons. His main reason - taking me to music school. He did, and at first, he put me in violin, but it was quickly apparent I loved the piano, so they moved me to this grumpy old teacher who was famous in the school for having gifted students. She must have been like Scrooge McDuck when she saw me. I was performing at the level of year 1 high schoolers - at 4 and a half. They did exams on me, as I was the youngest student in the history of the school. I passed all of them in 5 minutes. They determined I had absolute pitch, and took me in. The teacher quickly started giving me harder and harder compositions to play, and soon enough I was playing compositions 4-5 years in advance of my age. By the time I was 8, I was playing such hard pieces I had to stretch my hands to catch certain chords. The problem was, she did nothing all day. She just forced me to practice harder and harder, but since I didn't actually have to practice, she just yelled at me when I made a small mistake, one which I corrected right away, and she was pissed at that, too. This was a catastrophe for my work ethic though. I never worked even when I should have, but I still managed to level competitions in my area, and everything was fine.

That's how it seemed anyway. I, however, started seeing more and more of my parents arguing and fighting. At first, it was just discussions, but it quickly became yelling. Every. week. I honestly gained so much insight into how not to handle a relationship/marriage. I ignored it until my mother started crying. She just couldn't take it anymore. And it wasn't just normal crying. It was screaming and crying. Horrific scenes I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy were playing out right in front of me. I was also bullied by children on the nearby playground because all I talked about was music and science. I never talked about anything else, and they just pushed me over and beat me a lot of the time. We also weren't doing well financially. My fathers' job as a teacher was not surprisingly very underpaid, so we made due how we could. My brother was even worse off. As my father was only dedicated to religion and ""me"" (not me as a person, just me as a music machine), he disregarded him completely, and beat him a lot of the time. He obviously thought my brother wasn't fucking Mozart, but he tried to force him anyway. He took him to guitar lessons, and my brother hated every second of it, but he did it anyway. He was also bullied, way more than me. Like, was seriously bullied so much, and also abused by my father, as always. Rarely physically, more just told he was worth nothing. This is something he loved to do. Tell others they were nothing, and tell them ""good luck"" in a snarky sarcastic tone. He also never allowed anyone to tell him he was at fault. He took 0 criticism. He would always get in a big fight if you told him he was wrong about the smallest thing. He was also a fanatic for conspiracy theories, as he hated the world and wanted to see it burn. He was lazy, too. He lost all his friends he had at the time. He also forced me to make only classical music for him, as that's what he wanted, and he forced me to play with him and would take me to concerts. I said nothing, as I thought it was going to eventually make us money, or something. Even at 6, I saw we needed more of it. As I went to school, I was also an outcast there, and after 2 short years, we moved to an apartment we bought with the help of his grandparents. It was honestly so shit. And I live in it now as I type this. It's decently sized, sure, but it's so far away from anything, and it's on the outskirts of the city, across the parking lot from a metal recycling facility. The dude who built these things dropped the ball on everyone and left the country, leaving them half-finished.

&amp;#x200B;

There was no socializing to be done here. The only ""friends"" I had were in a ""nearby"" school I walked to every morning. There I was just bullied as well. And I also had to take a commute every 3 days to music school, taking more time out of my pitiful days. The fights between my parents got even worse, and so much more physical. Once, he bought this shitty car that he ended up selling right back for less and losing money on it. My mother tried to convince him not to, but he literally beat her and almost strangled her for the money. My brother and I watched it from the doorway.  When he wasn't beating us up, he was either listening loudly to music on his speakers he bought for 2000$+ when we really needed those 2000$+ for clothes or just being a grumpy piece of shit. He convinced us that our mother was against us, and that women were against us.

&amp;#x200B;

I started going to more competitions until he started ridiculing me for even that. He said I didn't want to do anything, and he started restricting my access to the only thing I found an escape with at the time - video games. He made me do his chores, and he literally did nothing all day after coming back from work. My mother used to always tell him - please spend time with the kids. No. He didn't care. He barely knew we existed as a matter of fact. He didn't give a shit. He just saw me as a tool for making music that started to develop something called identity and my brother as a useless sack in the corner of a room. My brother became an overachiever and started studying the shit out of school. Like, I'm serious, he was a beast, and he still is. It fucked him up of course, and he desperately needs to get out of this apartment, something both he and I will do in half a year. I remember the only good memories I had at the time were just - Minecraft. Only my mom and my brother loved me. No one else liked me. Everyone just seemed to use me, and I just hated it. I hated life. Minecraft was the only thing - and video games in general of course. It was also the only thing keeping my brother sane for a while of course, until he quit games as they were taking over his life, just like mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then, my parents stopped fighting. But they stopped being a marriage. Sure, they were legally married, and they lived in the same house. But they didn't consider themselves this. My father just became this sack of despair and evil. He gave up on me and said multiple times that I had failed. He still tried to make me work for him in the music of course, but after 15 years of the same shit day in, and day out, I finally built up the courage to say - no. Simple as that. No. I didn't curse at him, I should have. That was the least he deserved. He fucked me up. He never supported me in anything else I had to do except music. He then bought me this snazzy new computer setup. I couldn't complain - 2 monitors, and just overall a really good computer. He blackmailed me with it. Said he bought it in return for me doing something for him - music of course. I did it. I did a track per week. Wasn't enough. He wanted more. I told him I didn't want to. He got mad. He still tries to make me play again, but I simply just tell him no. He hates my brother now, and any time he starts yelling at me and telling me I'll end up as a failure, he ends up talking about him and how he has contested his ownership over the family and house, etc. He's sick. Honestly, he doesn't see any of it. He barely starts to see that he fucked up his marriage. You see, my mother got the opportunity to break away, and she took it. She got an offer in Slovenia to work as a vastly overqualified chef (my mom cooks amazing food), and she took it and ran. She makes minimum wage in Slovenia now, and she's been living in a single room for a few months. She loves it. It's a break away from this shit country, and my father of course.

&amp;#x200B;

I started going to high school. It's my second year. I'm doing well without studying, but not as good as I could be if I just tried a little bit. I have such potential. I have such moonshots in my head, but I can never fulfill them. But I can't. I'm so exhausted. This apartment sucks all the energy out of me. I hate where I live. High school isn't much better in terms of people. I still managed to feel awkward all the time, and while I'm not being openly bullied, people love talking behind my back. Even people on the bus to school, who I've never talked to, look at me funny. I don't know why. I'm almost anorexic, so I guess that might be it. I and my brother were seeing this therapist for a while. She couldn't take it after we told her our dad would tie us to a cradle with a rope if we didn't behave back when I was 3. There are so many other things I can't even get into. When I try to study, I just hit this wall, and I just end up relying on what I pick up from class, and still manage to get an A, somehow. We will all leave him behind. My brother will move to a different apartment in our city (the capital of my country) for 1 year as he has an internship at a company for being top 2 in grades. Then he will go to Austria or Germany. I will go in half a year to my mom in Slovenia, and start to live my life. It will be hard. She has a minimum wage. I'll probably do a part time job to help out myself with clothes and other things, but it matters not. I'd rather live on the side of the road in Slovenia than in an apartment here. I'll pursue better education there, better friends, and just a place where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I started crying a lot when I'm alone. It's so heartbreaking. I had such potential. I could have been god knows where. I truly believe I could have done so much in 16 and a half years. I'm turning 17 this summer. I never had a childhood. I never had a life. When I move out to a single room with my mom who earns minimum wage, and when I sleep on an air mattress. Then. Then I will start to live. Start to unearth my potential as a scientist, a software engineer, a musician, and an artist. Only then. I cry because I missed out on so much, yet I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm still terribly depressed, and I have my doubts about Slovenia, of course. It will be hard. It will suck. I won't know the language. But that's all tomorrow's worry. And compared to today, it's nothing."

112hkjf,5,2023-02-14,Does a AS Degree from DE count as completing a semester at an acreddited college or meeting other typical STEM internship requirements?,EonsOfNever,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/112hkjf/does_a_as_degree_from_de_count_as_completing_a/,"Hello, I am a high school senior graduating this year and intending to enroll in a four year under-grad school majoring in computer science. I will be graduating from the community college I am enrolling in at the end of high school, and I will be earning an A.S. degree from them. Since they are accreddited, I feel like it meets the requirement of at least a ""semester"" (I spend 11-12th with my core classes being DE, and 9-12 on DE computer science courses).

However, as I am a DE student, I am not sure if I count as a ""Full-time"" one. I am also assuming  that most STEM internships that have criteria similar to this (just an example):

&gt;  
 Full-time student pursuing an undergraduate degree in STEM/STEAM at an  accredited academic institution with at least one semester/quarter  completed at the time of MyLINK submission.  

  
are also not looking for post-high school students. I am having a bit of trouble finding internships to do after highschool with stem, and I am wondering if doing a DE degree counts in anyway to meeting criteria such as the one above."

I would have a strong academic record at WGU, but I know that these T10 schools are highly competitive and have very selective admissions processes. I'm also concerned an online degree from WGU might not regarded as a traditional degree from a state school.

I have a friend that attended WGU and is a SWE for Google, I would ideally get 2-3 internships during my undergrad, work awhile then go back to pursue higher education to further myself and career.

$Roadrunner - Me - expert at working very quickly and efficiently    
$Wil-E-Coyote - Head of Arizona field ops   
$VP - Nitpicking     
$IT - Savvy team of 4 

One fine day of working hard to keep the IT department moving along at Acme Corp. Inc. LLC GmBH^(TM)  
the team was called up one by one by the Acme VP of Nitpicking to the ivory tower (3rd floor) who announced the unceremonious dismissal and dissolving of $IT as an expense-cutting measure.

This decision would ultimately cost them much much more in the end, but more on that later.

Mr. Nitpicking presented a non-compete agreement in full leagalease and noted a crappy stipend would be given to assist in the platform migration to an Arizona-based Bigger morer expensiver servicer provider ($BMSP) run by the renowned Wil-E-Coyote himself. 

Note that $BMSP cost more per month than it would have to give everyone a 30% raise *and* buy the new hardware that Acme needed, so it's already a slimy deal no matter how the anvil is sliced. 

He said that if one felt so inclined, we could talk to a lawyer about it and told each team member to not discuss anything about the non-compete and that we needed to make a decision within a week's time.

The official reasoning for the non-compete was that we had access to the entire company workflow and we could use that information to help competitors gain an edge for a company that holds nearly the entire market share in the US and Europe.

I contested that claim because the creaking infrastructure is 7 years old, but common tech and nothing we did day to day was exotic or unique except the one time I had to use a hammer on a printer. 

\*VP stares at me in French\*   
He then shoos me out of the office to summon the remaining minions.  
Once we read through the fine print, guess what we did?

(Met and discussed it)  

Our supervisor had a way of talking in words that the C-levels understood, so he took the lead on the revisions, but let’s just say that paper could have been wrung out with enough ink to refill   
the Acme surprise Fountain Pen (patent pending)  

The VP was a bit bothered we rejected the non-compete due to how broad it was, and whether or not the office ceiling was stained a nice shade of green has yet to be determined. 

How broad you say?

If it was signed, one would agree to the terms where you could not work for any company that sold, distributed, manufactured, warehoused, or transported products within 100 miles of the tri-state area.

Being that nobody was competing with Acme, this was a very steep agreement and we saw this was aimed at the salesweasels to not steal customers, but IT somehow was granted the privilege of enduring such nonsense.

After much consternation and groaning by the VP, he got the brain trust involved and revised the   
legal-beagle wording to have a whole lot less llama-drama and trimmed it to say just the specific industry that Acme works in - which is to provide reliable and excellent quality props for movie and film studios.

Then the whole cabinet went on holiday for most of Thanksgiving, December, and New Years. 

Conveniently enough, nobody followed up about the non-compete and I saw no reason to remind them about it, so it did not get inked when I signed out for the last time.

I went job-shopping and after the first interview, I started in the New year to make a smooth transition that ended on good terms with the team at Acme.  

\*A few months later\*    
After getting settled in at Whirlwind Computing    
(The MSP that can blow the competition away)  

One day, I hear the $WMSP interns ~~complaining~~ observing the scope of a big project at Acme Corp involving data recovery, a giant rubber band, full server rebuilds, iron glue, and forklifting a large database.

$Me - Really now?  
I ask what’s up and found that $BMSP hired them to be boots on the ground because of a massive fudge-up they caused with the file server... and it’s backup.

I share some insights on what I did there and how it was all supposed to work before they scrapped the department/old servers.

The team thanked me for the insight and said it was a total cluster of what $BMSP did as it took about a week to fix everything and get the servers and their platform running again due to the incorrect usage of Acme standard issue magnets."

MIT Interview:

I believe my interview went extremely well. They usually last about 45 minutes but my interviewer was extremely intrigued and fascinated with our conversation, and we ended up talking for 2.5 hours because we had many common interests. I also came very well dressed and offered to buy my interviewer a drink at the Panera Bread where we met. 

Other info: Two professional IT certifications: CompTIA Security+ and Network+ obtained from passing CompTIA certificate exams. I look to pursue IT internships when I'm in college, so having certifications will be beneficial.

112nwov,2,2023-02-14,What is the best option for a Mechanical Engineer looking to transition to software?,IamtheProblem22,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/112nwov/what_is_the_best_option_for_a_mechanical_engineer/,"I'm currently 22M in Canada in my final year of a Mechanical Engineering program. It was my first internship after second year when I realized that I'm not at all interested in becoming a Mechanical Engineer. I have pretty good grades and have had a few good internships, but I don't have any motivation to work full time as a mechanical engineer. Most people that I know in this program will design machines and build things for fun, but whenever I do these things they just feel like annoying tasks.

I was never super mechanically inclined as a child so I don't really know what posessed me to go into this program. I like to challenge myself, so I guess I took mechanical engineering because it was the most noctoriously difficult program at my school. Eventually I just got so far into that I wanted to at least graduate with the degree. I wanted the ""engineer"" title but there is no locally available ""software engineering"" program. Meanwhile, the most rewarding and satisfying tasks I've experienced during my work terms have been programming excel macros to automate manufacturing tasks and create metrics.

I took 4 computer science/programming courses as electives during my degree (Python, Java, C for Engineers, and Computer Architecture) and I really enjoyed them. I am planning on doing some deeper self-study when I graduate to ensure that I really am interested in working as a software developer.

I am also planning on taking my first job as a mechanical engineer after graduation, most likely at a starting salary of around 65-70k.

I have a few options available to me to transition to CS. 

Option 1: Complete a full-time CS undergrad at my university at an accelerated pace where I will already completed all of the required electives, most of the 1st year CS required courses, and one 2nd year courses. I will take 6 courses per term (I am used to it because of engineering) (2 - 3 years without working, ~$20-30000 while living at home)

Option 2: Enroll in a OMSCS program. This may be difficult with very little CS fundamentals, but many people have done it and I can self study beforehand (~$6500 USD, 2 - 5 years)

Option 3: Enroll in a reputable coding bootcamp (6 - 12 months, ~$10000-15000)

Option 3: Spend a couple of years self-studying programming until I have enough knowledge to secure a junior developer position, and work my way up from there while only having a mechanical engineering degree (~2 years, ~$0)

My main question is, if I decide to learn on my own will I be at a significant advantage over people with a degree even after many years of experience? Which one of these options will provide me with the most opportunity? Am I better off getting an actual CS undergrad since I have a reasonable opportunity to do so?"

I got referred by a friend and was supposed to work as an intern for 3 months but got cut short to 1 month because i left early. The work was basically everyday and with intern salary, they did provide compensations for travel, food, and overtime. I start from around 10am till 10pm, usually our actual day off is on Sunday and even then we would still have tasks to do. They did warn me that the current working time is everyday, but I really thought I had a choice, especially since I was interning. 

I really enjoyed working there at first and thought I made good skills and experience there but it really wasn’t cut out for me. I’ve considered not including the experience but some people told me to just include (I don’t know any better)

My family wasnt supportive of the job and that took my mental down especially they usually lock the house at night so I cant go in. My parents referred me for another job and with the pressure, I caved in to resign sooner with one week notice to start at another place. I understood my leaving made many people angry and upset, especially how i left. I feel genuinely guilty about leaving early on peak season but again I don’t think I was cut out for it. 

I’ve now started a new full-time job and they wanted to contact someone from that company. I told them about the situation and they insist they have to do it. I gave them the official HR email but some people told me to give my old manager. 

I texted him but he left me on read. Some say I should include him without his permission and some say I should call him. I’m really embarrassed to call him knowing he left me on read and I don’t want to overstep as well. I’ve read how you can request a reference out, which I did request but they said they need to do it. Phoning a friend there would not be ideal for me as I also made them upset for leaving early. Is there a better solution in this situation?

Lesson learned here that some experience can be left out :("

I am a current computer science major who started Fall 2021, with an expected original graduate date of around Spring 2025, but thanks to AP Classes and Dual-Enrollment, as well as adding in summer classes, I am able to finish my degree in a shorter time span, around Spring 2024. 

However, due to recent news, regarding layoffs, as well as personal experiences, I seem to have a more negative view on this as I struggle with finding any internships nor co-op experiences, and I am struggling as to what I should do. I do have a part-time job however in an unrelated industry, and I only have two prior job experiences beforehand that are also unrelated (except for one which was a help desk position). 

I'm wondering if it is smart to delay my graduation to around Fall 2024, however I look at the current cost of college, and I don't really see any values in getting something out of it. Not to mention, most of my friends are older and are going to graduate the same time-frame as I am, so delaying doesn't make sense for that purpose. The only reason I'd delay is if I have enough to spend cash on, which I am currently tight in my budget to do so otherwise. Is there any other options I should consider, or should I just go forward with my original path of graduating early?"

* Offer 1: Desktop Support Analyst @ 60k for a public university with amazing benefits (pension, great healthcare, tons of vacations/paid holidays, etc.)

* Offer 2: Network Engineer Intern @ 20/hr for 4 months full time with a possibility of becoming a permanent hire (not guaranteed). Half the time would be spent studying for certs (which they would pay for) and the other half would be working on projects with the senior engineers 

A little backstory: I just graduated this past December with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems. During my last year I interned for 2 companies, both of which had the title of IT Intern. Both jobs are very similar, internal IT desktop support, very basic. I am still working at the 2nd internship because they have no full time position making $20/hr. I have no hands on experience with networking or any certs, but I've been studying for the CCNA and plan to take the test very soon. Lastly, my career goal is to become a network engineer. 

I'm afraid I will get stuck working Desktop Support if I take offer 1 and I won't be able to advance my career as fast, but it is a very safe option in my head. Do I take the risk with offer 2 by gaining valuable experience to get out of support? I would appreciate any advice on this matter, thank you in advance!"

So I decided to make some changes. Hit the gym, previously weighed 63ish kilos and now weigh 73 kilos and have added a ton of muscle after a couple years of grinding. I now look big in shirts and although my confidence has improved a bit, I'm still not happy. Also grinded soccer training in this time period and got good, now start for a club and I only look forward to days I'm training and playing, everything else is painful. I started to take university seriously and am projected to graduate at the age of 23 with a few internships under my belt in the field of software engineering, leading to a job.

My feelings of inadequacy and no joy in life come from how my friends treat me. They used to respect me alot as a peer but I made some cringe videos on TikTok when I was really depressed in 2020 and they got shared around in group chats. I come from a small city so escaping these friends is not really an option. They also put down my success with women a bit (I'm average looking). The thing is, I know they like me and they constantly invite me to things, converse when we're hanging out and have included me in their futsal team, but I feel like I can't escape my past at all. I know I'm not really being picked on because if any of my friends did the same things, they would be roasted too (and are for similar things), but when they roast me although I completely take it in my stride in conversation I fall into a pit of sadness because I have low self - esteem. And I can't talk to them about it because in male friends groups like this it's looked down upon to converse about your feelings between each other if its not for self improvement/women/etc. 

I just feel like I can't escape this hole no matter what I do, bar me moving after University and starting my life properly but it seems so long away in 2024. Should I just accept this and get over the fact that in the internet age they're going to hold certain things against me because of ribbing and I'm just overthinking it, or should I cut them off and try for a new friend group (lmfao that would be tough everyone in my city has known each other since high school but maybe could be done)"

I am a third year uni student (second year in Elec eng/compsci) and I happen to have a WAM just below 50 entering into my third year. My first term last year wasn't so good but ever since then I've been trying to improve myself. I wanted to apply for internships this year and just wanted to know how much WAM matters. I am currently looking at Dolby because I freaking love music and worry a lot about audio quality and whatnot, and I know that I absolutely love programming ever since I did 1511 (got a distinction in it lol). Ive only done two proper elec courses (elec1111 and elec2134), some second year math courses (math2069 and 2089). I've also been involved in ELSOC as marketing director for 2023 and hoping to join subcom for CSESOC in 2023 as well. Aside from that, I worked as a tutor that teaches Python in a high school and pulled a job that taught stem to young children. Ik I feel like I'm listing my whole resume here but I just wanted to know how much my WAM would matter in this scenario, and would love to hear any relevant experiences you guys had. 

I am also doing COMP1531 this term along with Higher Phys 1B. I've heard that having projects on your own boosts your chances, and I've recently been researching machine learning/AI as a project to pursue on my own.

I was applying for internships last season with a 2025 grad date so I think that kind of screwed me on many opportunities like c1 which I know I could have definitely got.

I've been with a software company in Thüringen for more than a year now as a working student. I was being paid the minimum wage for 20 hours/week.

They wanted me to start a mandatory Internship with them in October last year, but I wanted to study some Master courses first and requested the company to shift it to a later semester.

Now I want to start an internship with the company from April, and recently asked for the salary. I was told, after two weeks, According to law, they(internships) don't need to be paid by the employer but they will still compensate me with 500 Euro a month.

I'm an international student and I don't think I can mange to live with 500 Euro a month. Therefore I wanted to negotiate on the payment. Is it okay to do that? Also is it true they aren't required by law to compensate for mandatory internships? Shall I consider this a sign to start looking for another job/internship?

Edit : I mean would be paid half the amount of what I'm currently being paid for twice the amount of work(40 hrs/week) I put in.  Seems unfair to me.

I got a double degree in Computer Science and Neuroscience. Both with gpa of 3.9. 

Here is the thing- I do want to become a software engineer, and I think I have the right personality for it. However, I genuinely don’t feel like I am good at coding, even if I got good grades. I struggled a lot in all of my CS classes and spent hours at office hours, reading other people’s codes online and asking help from my classmates in most assignments until they worked. And after four years, I truly don’t feel like I know how to code. I am also terrible at math.

All my other CS friends tell me it’s “easy” (they work for Amazon), and I just have to practice LeetCode for the interviews. But I don’t think that’s true, and I don’t believe LeetCode projects are that easy to learn. I couldn’t get through one assignment:( 

I’ve always had really low self-esteem about not being good enough in CS, but I do think it’s for a reason, and maybe I should just focus on getting different positions? 

I also didn’t do any CS internships during uni since I worked full-time for three years at a startup as a program manager.

I have never had any internships before so I have no experience at all, and I have no extracurricular activity that makes sense to put on a resume.

I've seen some suggest to put interest and hobbies on the resume, but even there, I'm not a very social person (this does not influence my relations with my colleagues though, I have done many successful group projects and I had no problem at all communicating there, and every member i talked to more in depth always said I was nice to work with), so the only things that I could put in such a section are either something that is somehow work related (I'm really interested in Linux and programming in general and even in my free time I build programs for my own use, set up stuff on my machines, listen to talks etc etc), or things that don't show any skill whatsoever, yes I am interested in foreign policy/geopolitical matters and I read a lot about that but such a thing does not communicate any interesting skill to a potential employer. I don't have anything to account for my soft skills, which I think exist and would make an impact on a resume.

I have 2 or 3 side projects I want to put on the resume, and finally the technologies I at least have some experience with (programming languages, container managers such as Docker, operating systems etc) and my English level (C1).

To make it even more complicated, it would be ideal for me to land an intership abroad (I'm an EU national in Italy, but want to eventually move because job opportunities here are just not as good as in most of the EU), so that when I eventually look for a full time job abroad I would already have experience outside of my native country. Do you think it's an unrealistic objective or are there possibilities even if it's my first internship?

Back to the resume, what I listed makes for a very short and empty CV. Is there something I'm missing? Is there anything that someone with more experience would suggest to make it a little more interesting? I think I'm not missing the skills my peers have, but aside from solving coding challenges at interviews and/or showing my projects I don't really know how to communicate these, and every CV I see seems absolutely full of stuff, work experience, awards etc etc. Thank you for the attention."

I thought I knew what I wanted to do, but I'm starting to realize that I genuinely despise this job and the other teachers around me. There are a few gems in the rough that I see from time to time, but every teacher is burnt out after Covid-19 and treats everyone around them like the enemy. Teachers talk behind each other's backs, work against other teachers who they should be in a committee with, and literally talk about students like they're monsters regardless of the level of offense. I've seen teachers lose their minds over kids answering the phone during class. I understand that it's an issue, but raising your voice and saying degrading things is unacceptable in my opinion.  One element of teaching I do love is the diversity my students have. They're really energetic and always offer interesting ideas or perspectives. That was a big reason for my want to be a teacher, but after everything I've seen, I can't do this for $40k a year and some decent insurance. It's not worth the money and I just don't want to be in this terrible system. Someone might say, ""Then go change it!"" but education is a merit-based system. I would be fired for speaking up against any of this, especially as an intern (Practicum) student with no credibility.

Should I graduate early anyways or delay half a semester so I can have junior summer for internship? Or I can graduate early and possibly go to a masters program?

* All four of my past roles, my title has been ""Intern"" technically. I changed them. In my last role at a web 3 company especially, I feel like this was fair. Despite being an intern, my pay was around the level of what I see mid level software developers going for. 

* My first 3 roles were during summer breaks so ~2 months long. My last role at the web 3 company was 8 months long. I felt like these were too short and looked bad so I opted to drop dates altogether.

* I also dropped the year of my degree because it's too recent. I felt like it dated me a bit young. All the things with decent pay are Senior level so I felt like that was working against me"

I'm going to be graduating this spring with a bachelor's in math and minor in community engagement. Yayy! School has been a hell hole, so im beyond excited to be done soon. 

Because I have had to work most of my way through college in order to afford it, I haven't had the privilege to do internships or research relating to fields I might go into with my math degree like my classmates have. Additionally, because of the way my program is set up, I only have one semester worth of experience in MATLAB. 

The majority of the entry-level job applications I have seen that I could apply to with my degree require 3-5 experience with python, doors, C+, snowflake, etc.  None of which I have. So I've been feeling incredibly inadequate and as if I won't be able to find a job with the experience I do have. 

I've worked as a resident assistant in a freshman dorm hall for 2.5 years, while being a GM for a local pizza shop. I recently left that job to go manage at a different pizza shop. I also interned for my city's vice mayor last year working on affordable housing projects. I recognize that some of these are valuable experiences, but I have no idea how to translate it onto a resume for a job that requires experience with programming. 

So if anyone give me pointers on where and how to start a resume and apply for jobs, it would be greatly appreciated."

I'd appreciate any help!,otaku2sday,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1138d8e/im_a_high_school_senior_looking_for_advice_about/,"(Using a secondary account, since I'm disclosing some personal information)

**Background:** I'm currently a high school senior from a semi-rural Midwestern state. I'd call myself an ambitious person; for my entire life (which, admittedly, isn't much so far), my unconditional dream has been to support myself as a tech founder. I'd say I'm fairly proficient in software development (2-3 years experience of building apps for paying clients). I have about 1 year of experience working remotely as an intern (where I trained a ML model for a company) and research assistant (again, ML), respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:** For much of high school, I've pored over every existing resource about startups (*The Lean Startup*, YC, etc.) . Over the past two years, I've also launched two startups, both of which failed.

1st startup: Launched without validation, quickly learned my lesson.

2nd startup: Spent several weeks trying to validate my app with teachers and classmates (edtech industry), built an email list + $100 marketing budget. Success at first, but users eventually lost interest and the hype died down after a month. Tried to iterate, but failed to revive my app.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:** I understand that entrepreneurship is a long and difficult undertaking, especially for high schoolers. However, for someone whose only dream is to become an entrepreneur, I'm having difficulty deciding what to do next:

* *Should I try to launch another (B2C) product?* \- I'd love to give it another shot. But I'll have a hard time validating my app, since I don't really know anyone outside of my high-school friends. I could cold-email strangers, but I've had difficulty doing that recently.
* *Should I try B2B? -* I'd love to, but I also don't have any connections in business. Unless connections aren't that important in B2B?
* *Should I just wait for college, when I'll have more connections*? *-* That's my plan. But I can still put these seven months of my life to use before I start a CS job in July and go to college in September. (Response to ""You should just enjoy your last year of high school"" - I think I can do that while simultaneously being productive with my time.)
* *Is there a fourth oprtion?* I'd really appreciate any help!"

I want to prepare myself to apply for an Embedded Engineering Internship. The interview process includes a coding task on [coderpad.io](https://coderpad.io), I have no clue what to expect - what kind of questions will be asked for an *embedded* internship? I say this because coding embedded systems is rather different from ""regular"" coding in practice. High level v low level.

I already have an embedded internship with Raytheon, however there was no sort of coding interview. Raytheon pays nothing compared to other companies, and I won't break even on the relocation (even with the stipend). I want to push myself for the new embedded internship, but I don't know what kinds of questions will be asked since embedded coding isn't quite the same as other coding.  I'm stuck with the belief that coding interviews primarily apply to high level coding.

I am a whiz at coding microprocessors, however everything (no matter how complex in the end) can be accomplished with simple C code and a knowledge of how your hardware functions. Hence why I'm spooked by the complexity of these coding interviews (internship theoretically works with C++/python). I would have flipped my major and minor had I known what I was doing, I don't like coding at a high level, really prefer low level.

Any insight into what an embedded engineering team might be looking for in a coding test would be great. Actually, any at all.

Part of me thinks I should stick with Raytheon and walk out of the internship with a secret security clearance on my resume."

On the other hand, my other offer is also a similar role as a Technology Analyst, but the project I'll be working on is related to AI/ML modeling and the team I met with is really great and insightful. Compared to MS however, the name is not as meaningful as the company is much newer (maybe 5-7 years old) and almost ""start-up"" like in a sense.

People have told me to just take the MS offer since it typically holds more prestige, but others have told me mixed things about interning there and that it is very team dependent, and I won't know my team until closer to the start. Any insight is greatly appreciated! (I will not be saying the smaller company's name just to maintain some anonymity.)

113aox8,1,2023-02-15,How can I ask my seasonal summer camp Boss what her decision planning is for the summer without sounding like an a**hole?,toottbrush,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/113aox8/how_can_i_ask_my_seasonal_summer_camp_boss_what/,"To start off, this would be my fourth year at the summer camp. I love this place because it has taught and given me so much, however, I'm scared that I will not be returning for the summer. Mostly for a couple of reasons: 

1. I am 21 years old and I do not have any type of experience for my major (ex. internships) compared to my peers.
2. I have been loyal to this camp even though it is extremely disorganized and was not promoted to a higher position when applying again for another summer. Not the issue, but I was led on for an entire year about me having a certain position and I did not even get a rejection email. The people who have hired me I am close with. I have met their family, I have been their support as they have been mine, and I have been a diligent/dependable worker. I am offended. 
3. In the past three years, I have watched my boss, Apple, hire the most odd group of counselors each year that turn out to be an absolute mess. Most of our staff don't return because of the disorganized working conditions/mental stress this job provides. In turn, my boss will hire people that look good on paper/zoom but have absolutely no experience working with kids or being in a camp environment. I understand where they come from, however, these individuals in turn always end up being major stressors for everyone. So far in the past three years, she's hired child groomers, individuals who have no emotional regulation (I had to give a talk to a 24 year old man about why screaming at a group of 8 year old children was not appropriate, even though they kept him up all night), and people who just don't care. At all. To make it even better, she will hire individuals under eighteen years old because of the lack of counselors who stay an entire summer (ex. quitting, getting fired), and genuinely, should be at camp as a camper. 
4. The buildings/environment is absolutely rancid. They don't feed us enough, at all. I lost 10 pounds the first two weeks during staff training because they did not make enough food. I watched everyone last summer grow thinner each week. There is mold in the bathrooms, everywhere. I have asked them to address it and it is always a matter of funding. Everyone is constantly sick. This camp is also in Ohio and I don't know if you're up to date, however, but individuals that live there are scared to drink the water because of the situation in Palestine. 
5. It's 500 per week. It's not a lot and I could be making a lot more money working full time. 

I understand how this camp sounds like hell on earth after reading these reasons, but, this place is also where I'm happiest for the most part because of the community. I met my now fiancee at this camp when I was 18. The children, even though they're young, have taught me strength. I cannot thank the children enough on what they have done for me over the years. 

However, at the end of the day, I have to take care of myself. My fiance is a little older than me and is working as an aquatics director there, however, he has made it clear to me that he will follow me on whatever I want to do. I have interviewed with other camps and am waiting to hear back, but I genuinely would like to go back to the camp I have been working at. It is disheartening though because I feel as if I have been disrespected/undervalued with the lack of promotion and I don't know who's going to be in charge, along with all of the other reasons I have listed. I just don't feel like the camp will serve me any good/purpose as a camp counselor. I genuinely need to get my sh\*t together and I do not feel like being at camp making 500 dollars a week like a dog (7 days a week, 24 hours of the day!!!! For 3 months!!!!!) is going to do me any good when I know I can be getting experience for my major and working a more suitable job. 

 How can I ask Apple who would be in charge of me, what policies are happening without sounding like I have resentment? I feel awkward to just call them and ask what's happening without indicating that I am upset (Apple has a bachelors &amp; masters in Psychology) and because they honestly know me, we've lived together for the past 4 years over the summer. The reason why I want to call is because I will genuinely not find out any of this information until I get there because of the disorganization (Late May), even my fiancee who is on payroll. 

Let me know if I can provide any more information?"

So I initially graduated with a liberal arts degree (BA) in one of those infamous fields that ends in ""studies"". Did about 5 years of retail work after which I did not like because: (1) pay was garbage (2) schedules were difficult to work around (3) I am naturally on the more serious/analytical side so I don't know if it was ever really a culture fit

Around this time there was a lot of hype around software careers that I kept hearing from people I knew personally. Because of the aforementioned serious/analytical personality type I have, I thought that might be a better fit for me so I gave it a whirl - first taking courses at community college in HTML, then re-enrolling in my alma mater to take comp sci courses. I was able to parlay the courses into an internship, which ended up being my foot in the door.

This was almost five years ago and since then I have been steadily employed in jobs in technology, working mostly as a generalist fullstack software dev. The work has provided me with opportunities that I never before thought I would have and for which I am incredibly grateful.

That being said...

I find that the culture in the jobs I have worked in this field tend to, over time for me, become dry, rote, and lonely and because of this I am questioning if maybe I should explore other positions that require a similar skillset. I think the biggest contributor to those feelings is due to the lack of communication and interfacing that I have had in these roles. While I am hardly a loud extroverted type, it's important to me at work that I feel part of a team. In all of the software roles I have had, I am typically tossed an assignment, do the work in isolation, and rinse and repeat.  

Are there roles in technology that are analytical *and* require regular interfacing with other people? What would getting into this role look like from the perspective of someone who is currently a developer?"

Both companies seemed like very nice workplaces are about the same distance from my home and I don't really prefer either of them to the other.

The big difference is in the type of work: Internship A is embedded systems, although they want me to work on a high level project in python first (Its a bit more data sciency, and I think the project is really interesting), after that I'd be programming microcontrollers.

Internship B would be full stack web development with a java backend. Also really interesting because I haven't done much web stuff in my hobby projects.

I don't really want to stay at either of these companies for more than 1.5 years because I want to experience different workplaces and areas in SWE during my bsc. I also don't know what Im eventually going to specialize in but its most likely not going to be web development. I still would like to have a webdev internship under my belt.

What do you guys think would be best for my career? Would an embedded internship look better or worse on my cv than a webdev internship? Considering that I'll probably not go into webdevelopment (it-sec, ml and hpc are on my ""interesting"" list).

113dpv5,58,2023-02-15,How do you avoid office politics? Are Cyber workers more likely to be jerks than other fields?,PhoenixOfStyx,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/113dpv5/how_do_you_avoid_office_politics_are_cyber/,"I've worked in Cybersecurity for 2 years. My first boss was great, but the leader was a real nasty person strong on manipulation. 

My 2nd boss was quite supercillious towards me, expecting me to know far more than I did with only 2 months help desk exp and 3 month internship. Consistently looking down on me, gloating about how much he knew, sharing little.

I should preface this with: I'm not terribly bright. But hey, I have an A.A.S. in Computer Systems, and know enough to get by, and am consistently striving to learn.

So, a side question is: If someone isn't competent enough in the field, should they just suck it up? Maybe just ""git gud""?

So. My 3rd company, there's A LOT of passive aggression. People fire shots all day long, and I feel like the team is quite toxic. It finally got to me when I got gaslit several times, and I let slip saying something I shouldn't. Mildly rude. This was taken by the company at large to mean that I'm an asshole. My coworkers seem more fond of attempting to lure incompetence out in the open, rather than helping alleviate it. They've also actively misled me and seem to be actively attempting to sabotage me.

Of course, I've also heard the phrase, ""If everyone around you is an asshole, you're the asshole."" I fully accept this possibility.

People are the most difficult aspect of this, for me. I just want to do my job and increase my skillset, and work towards promotion, but office politics seems inescapable.

I want to improve, but it'd also be bad for my mental health if it's more common for Cybersecurity professionals to be jerks more consistently than, say, programmers.

What are your thoughts/experiences?"

But I think my actual ""Why Duke"" essay had more heart.   


Duke University is a place where innovation and leadership come together to create a dynamic and intellectually stimulating environment. As a student who has been heavily involved in math competitions, served as class treasurer, and interned for a state senator, I believe I have the drive and passion to contribute to this environment and make a meaningful impact at Duke.

My love for mathematics began at a young age, and as I grew older, I found myself drawn to the challenge and excitement of math competitions. As a member of my high school's mathletes team, I had the opportunity to participate in a variety of competitions, ranging from local events to national competitions. These experiences allowed me to push the limits of my mathematical knowledge and develop my problem-solving skills. In addition, working on math problems with my team helped me to understand the importance of collaboration and teamwork, skills that I know will be valuable in my future academic and professional endeavors.

In addition to my passion for mathematics, I have also demonstrated a commitment to leadership and community service. As class treasurer during my junior and senior years, I was responsible for overseeing the budget for our class events and activities. This role allowed me to develop my financial management skills, as well as my ability to communicate effectively with my classmates and teachers. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with other student leaders to plan and execute successful events, such as our annual homecoming dance and charity fundraiser.

My experience as a class treasurer led me to seek out other opportunities to serve my community. This led me to intern for a state senator, where I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, including conducting research on legislation, writing policy briefs, and attending community events. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of the political process and the impact that public service can have on people's lives. It also taught me the importance of advocacy and civic engagement, skills that I know will be valuable as I pursue my future goals.

At Duke, I hope to continue to develop my passions and skills through a variety of academic and extracurricular activities. I am particularly interested in studying mathematics, as well as pursuing a minor in political science. I believe that these two fields of study will complement each other and provide me with a well-rounded education that will prepare me for a variety of careers. Additionally, I am eager to get involved in student organizations and clubs, such as the math club and political science society, as well as continue my community service through volunteering and internships.

In conclusion, I believe that Duke University is the perfect place for me to continue my academic and personal growth. With its strong commitment to academic excellence and its vibrant student life, I know that I will have the opportunity to challenge myself, make meaningful connections, and have a positive impact on the world. My experiences as a mathlete, class treasurer, and political intern have prepared me well for the rigors of college and have given me the skills and passion that I need to succeed at Duke and beyond. I am confident that I will thrive in the dynamic and intellectually stimulating environment at Duke and make a positive contribution to the university community"

Last quarter I was way busier than this quarter (full time work plus 3 classes, plus job search/leetcode) and I felt extremely motivated.

113jspb,1,2023-02-16,Balancing math coursework and developing programming skills,naoyao,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/113jspb/balancing_math_coursework_and_developing/,"I am an applied math major in my penultimate semester, ie I am planning to graduate either in August 2023 or December 2023. I have programming experience from high school (if it matters, I have created data visualizations using NumPy and pandas illustrating the Monty Hall problem, as well as visual art using Processing), but I never really considered a career in software engineering until fall of 2020, when I realized that working in software engineering could enable me to have an outsized impact by contributing to software that affects many peoples' lives.  I can also gain skills to work in start ups or perhaps start my own startup.  And I might even be able to pursue research engineering for machine learning.  In spring 2021, I changed my major to math (applied) and around fall 2022, I started pursuing a career in software engineering more earnestly, in that I worked on skills building websites with HTML, CSS, as learning about front end libraries including Bootstrap, React and Redux.  (I wouldn't say that I'm an expert on these.)

I estimate that in the year after graduation, I could create quality web applications using front-end and back-end knowledge.  These could be sufficient in helping me secure a software engineering role at a startup.

But in contrary to the above, I asked some acquaintances working as software engineers for advice, and four out of the four who I asked said that I should be working on my programming skills *now*, as opposed to after graduation.  They say that competition for entry-level software engineering roles can be staggering, and that if I want to enter into software engineering, I should really try to get an internship for summer 2023 (although I know that I am rather late in the game, and it is likely not possible at this point to get an offer for summer 2023, especially in consideration of my experience).

However, my dilemma is that my math coursework this semester is rather time-consuming, in that I'm taking statistics, numerical analysis, differential equations and computer science 2 (CS2 is not time consuming).  (This schedule is admittedly much better than last semester when I took real analysis, abstract algebra, probability, and CS1.)  I spend 30 minutes a day working on exercises from FreeCodeCamp, however if I wanted to spend more time developing my programming skills, I'd have to compromise on the amount of time I spend on my math classes, which will likely result in a worse performance.

What I'm wondering is whether it's worth making the tradeoff.  I'm wondering if it would make sense to minimize the amount of time I spend on my math coursework to be able to spend more time working on developing software skills and projects, but the likely result of this is I'd have a lower GPA.  This strategy likely wouldn't make sense if I can't get summer 2023 internship roles, but I suppose that there's a chance I can.  Anyone else have experience with this sort of situation?"

Coming from India, it is a very big thing to take up a huge loan to study knowing that the economic condition is really bad while also looking at your friends and ex-colleagues struggle to find internships and jobs.


Foreigners like me would definitely need a part-time, internship and full time to help us make ends meet and repay our loan on time.


But looking at the current market, it seems that there are a lot of hiring freezes and layoffs. This basically increases the competition for jobs and makes it even more harder.


Are there any economists or any experts in this community who know how things might change in the future and when approximately? (Because I keep hearing people tell that the USA hasn’t hit its rock bottom yet to bounce back soon)


Are there anyone else thinking like me who might end up deferring by a year to see how the economy shifts?

I really wanted to come in and WOW them but so far, that hasn't happened. I pick up everything very quickly, that isn't the problem. The problem is socialization. I really like my coworkers and I try to match their tone and subject topic. I feel they tolerate me. I know coworkers aren't my friends. They are very polite and kind. They have all worked together for years so I really do feel like a new character on season 5 of a show. 

 My manager told me last performance review that I was talking too much, and it was affecting work, and that I needed to work on filter with the clients, apparently I told someone during a A1C check they had big hands. The thing about being an intern is that I have an internship profile so I can't do the day to day work things like send off controlled meds for doctor approval, answer phones, send messages, ect. They want me doing only clinical things but unless someone needs a test run/ I'm rooming someone/ I'm giving a shot/preparing a shot/ or A1C then I am just sitting there looking over my notes. We are talking literal hours of re-reading the same notes. I was previously in kitchen work where there is ALWAYS something to do. I imagine it is an environment mismatch. 

I had always suspected I had ADHD and was diagnosed as a child but stopped taking the medicine as a pre-teen. This performance review was the kick in the butt I needed to get diagnosed. I am on Adderall now. I am much more focused. I started speaking a lot less. I figured well great! I am doing better. It seemed like my coworkers were being more cordial to me. I just got done with phlebotomy training (2 days, so I can do it in a pinch but absolutely not a master and need more training).

I recently had another performance review and I was told that maybe being a CMA wasn't for me. My manager was really kind. She said that I made too many conversations with the patients when I was rooming them and not everyone wanted my life story.  I asked if I had any more complaints and she said no, that the patients seemed to really like me. So I don't know what to do with this information. I was a little bummed because I thought that I was just being friendly. When my Mom had cancer it always made her feel better to be greeted cheerily and have a small chat. I asked if my rooming time was too long and she said that my rooming time was average and didn't need any speeding up. She said that I still have 3 months in the internship but she was considering seeing if I can be transferred as a full employee over to phlebotomy. 

I really like phlebotomy and being a full employee means a pay raise and I would get more training to where blood draws would be second nature. I can't help but feel a little bummed. I thought I was doing so much better. My second plan was to become a travel CMA so my self confidence has been mildly affected. She said that I was very smart and that the company does not want to lose me but maybe being a CMA just isn't for me. I feel pretty petty. I think maybe I just won't talk unless spoken to and I will just say hello to patients and get straight down to business. Forget about asking about how their day is going. The funny thing is that I know once I do this everyone would like me more in the office. I genuinely don't know how much quieter I can get and why do my coworkers get to talk about how their days are going but I can't? 

I am polite, I am not rude, and I keep on light subjects. I am a little baffled because I thought CMA would be perfect for me. Any advice about what to do? I am seriously just about to stop talking all together since it seems not skill, not intelligence, but socialization is what I need to work on and I don't know what to say or where to go. I seriously thought I was improving so much. Thank you!"

My problem is learning all these new programming languages is overwhelming, and I really would like to start narrowing down some to get good at. So far I have gotten pretty alright with HTML, CSS, Python. I have never done any kind of data analytics projects, nor have I even taken a stats course.

There aren't a lot of tech opportunities in my area so I don't want to turn the internship down, but I feel like I should find something closer to the web dev side to intern in. Internship is required for me to finish school by the way.

So I used to be premed for about 2.5 years, but I no longer want to become a physician. 

I started an intro to C++ programming class at my university, and honestly, I really enjoy it. A LOT. However, I do tend to make mistakes a lot in my code and it can get frustrating when I am stuck (which happens often) but despite that, I still love coding and it’s always satisfying when I can solve the code lol. Definitely a growing passion of mine and I want to have a career in this so much.

However, because I struggle and make mistakes often in code, how exactly do I become a better programmer? I really want to become an excellent programmer one day, so do you guys recommend that I do the Odin project in order to build stronger skills? Is Odin project beginner friendly and can I do projects on there as a beginner as well? I’m an upperclassmen and because I switched to CS major, I am behind compared to my peers who already have tons of internships and projects. What other resources do you recommend I use to improve my skills and later on build projects?"

I recently joined IBM ISL as an intern, and already have an offer to join after graduation in a full time role, and the LPA is pretty good, but I'm not enjoying the work at all, I worked for 6 months before my current internship and dreaded every moment, the work was so hectic that I could not prepare for ongoing placements and at the end I was just left with IBM. I'm considering leaving for an early stage startup that I'm really interested in, but I'm worried about how this decision will impact my chances of getting shortlisted in top tech companies like Amazon, Google, etc. in the future after the recession ends..

I know that working at a well-known company like IBM ISL looks good on a resume, but I don't want to stay in a job that I'm not passionate about. On the other hand, working at an early stage startup would be a great opportunity for me to learn a lot and work on interesting projects that I care about, and I may be getting a bit less financially but not that less as compared to IBM.

So my question is, would working at an unknown company hurt my chances of getting hired by top tech companies in the future? Or should I stick it out at IBM even though I don't enjoy the work?

I would appreciate any insights or advice from those who have been in a similar situation or have experience working in the tech industry. Thanks in advance!"

I imagine you get questions like this all the time, but I figure that everyone's situation is a little different so it doesn't hurt to ask.

I have a Master's degree in mathematics and am currently self-teaching Python. I think my training in math is helping me pick up programming quickly, but I still have a lot to learn.

Obviously, I'd like to be employed as soon as possible for financial reasons, but I understand that I won't be able to just jump right into a dev position given how much I still don't know about (especially now considering how saturated the job market is). So I'm wondering what my best course of action is.

In particular,

- Are internships worth looking into? I don't mind starting from the bottom career-wise, but a lot of postings for internships seem geared toward those still in college. Is being a student a hard-requirement?
- Has anyone else switched from math or another non-cs but STEM field into software development? Do you have advice about getting ones foot in the door?

I'm happy to answer any specific questions about my background/experience/whatever if that would be helpful. Thanks so much!"

I recently turned 22 and for the past year i feel like I've been living a double life, slowly and steadily destroying everything I've worked for in a spiral of self-sabotage and disassociation. ever since i was a child, i have been working the system to achieve what i want, figuring out how to achieve what i want with whatever i have and whatever loophole i can find, and i think a huge part of this is bc i had undiagonised adhd for a majority of my life so i was just tryna cope with what means I can find, however over the past couple of years i feel like this ""superpower"" has done away, my lies used be a vehicle for manifestation and push me forward and now i feel like I've lost the will to catch up and slowly they are swallowing me alive. 

it started in 2019 when i joined engineering as a major, not my true hopes and dreams but i knew i loved tech from the conferences i had been to and could push through even tho math and science didn't come as easily to me as english or history, etc did. failed my first semester, then covid hit so i went back home and i was able to pass my classes and then when things calmed down i came back to my uni town and started doing poorly again and started coping with weed and became a full-blown stoner, this was never me, i have been a high achiever, great student my whole life, sudden i was a fucking degenerate, why was life so hard since i came to uni? i went into therapy, got help, got diagnosed for adhd, started meds and started to take control of my life. 

I started to network in the tech space and make opportunities for myself, this how I discovered my love for design, and i was making money, finally doing something for myself even tho school was still so hard; it got to a point where i felt successful enough to dropout and move to NYC and had enough money and jobs to make it happen. 

and then everything went to shit at the end of 2021.

I went home to help my family move and finish the rest of the semester online and decided once December exam season ended, I would take a gap semester off to see if my design work could turn into something bigger, but that is not how things planned out. 

my parents were not ready to move, they have their own pile of issues but this new life step really brought it, suddenly i was expected to drop everything to help them and as the oldest i just felt like i couldn't say no, on top of that a week later my dad wanted to get a dog, even tho my mom knew she would be doing most of the work and he promised that he would do 50/50 but that was no true; i wasn't too sure about it but i was like I'm not gonna be here soon like yall can deal with this. when the dog came i spent most of my time raising him bc i fell in love with in him within a day, he was a messy crazy lab but i didn't care, i felt like our souls bonded.

then my grandparents moved in with us bc that's how it goes in a lot of POC cultures and they're from my dad's side so you know they were mean to my mom when my parents were younger and now everyone acts like nothing happened bc they're frail but they're still naraccists and my dad just cant see that bc he's been brainwashed his whole life. this lead to a lot of trauma over 2022, fights, abuse, and it really fucked me up. everything i wanted to do and create, i dropped it all, all i did was get in between my parents fight and try to survive another, i started secretly smoking again, and then only thing that got me through another day was my dog, i was filled with pain and rage, and took that out on my work, i stopped replying to people, fulfilling my commitments, and went from a young talent with lots of potential to the girl who always uses her mental issues and life as an excuse to be irresponsible and procrastinate. i know that its not my parents fault and that a lot of people see a sorts of fucked up shit and are so successful and don't ruin their lives, i don't know, i cant even tell you what i was thinking, i lost track of time, a day or week of not replying turned into a year nad now theres some people and commitments that i haven't responded to in like 12+ months. i decided in the summer that i would come back to school so i could get out of that house so that i could can at least get a part time job, study, make some money, start designing again, and make amends with the people i hurt.  and then turns out the place i sublet lied to me and i found out when i moved in that they had a huge bedbug infestation, i got reactions everyday and started to not sleep and go crazy until we got rid of them, which took all of last semester, so ofc i didn't work, sleep, anything. 

and the worst part is now I've used up all my savings and the line of credit i opened for school so i basically have to live paycheck to paycheck for the first time ever, how did i get here. and you know what, now my parents wanna give up the dog, so it frees them to get a divorce or at least separate for a big even though they promised to keep him until i got back on my feet then i could take him. they found a good family and everything, and i know I'm just in my early 20s and the dreams of being a fast-paced design and tech creative require me to being working all the time and travelling and that is what i want for my life but i cant imagine anyone else being my dog's pet parent, it makes me want to puke and the air leaves my lungs when i think about it. i know i sound dramatic but i was the one who stepped up for this dog when my parents couldn't, he was the one who saved me when everything was going down, i feel like our souls were meant to meet, how can someone else raise him for the next 10 years?? just bc my parents are finally getting their shit together and want to move forward, now he has to go, i know its not fair to hold them back for him and they will live better lives once they have the freedom to go their own way but please i cant lose my dog, why was all of this for nothing, but at the same time there's a voice in my head that is saying i don't care enough about my big dreams if i cant let go of this dog. my whole life is a fucking mess and its all my fault. how am i supposed to make amends professionally, get an internship, get money so I'm not broke anymore, i just have too many problems and each one needs the other to be fixed and its just too late. I've fucked everything up, please just give me advice, real talk, i just need help, I'm so scared I'm crying as i write this, how did it get to this point. i cant even tell my friends bc they still assume I'm making as money as i did a year ago, no one knows I've fucked up so bad what do i do"

I earned my degree in Fashion Design and business and started working retail. I couldn’t afford to do internships and missed my opportunity to get into the field. I worked as full time assistant retail manager all through college and thought I would enjoy making it a career — plus I was making more than most of my friends did at their first job out of college.

Fast forward to now, I’ve been in retail for 7 years total. I manage a store and make almost 6 figures with my bonuses — but I’m miserable. My mental health is suffering and I feel stuck. 

How do I get out? All the jobs I apply to want experience, but don’t seem to take into account that I can do a bit of everything. At my company the GM does selling, team management, HR, corporate customer care, event management, manages shipping logistics, and I do about 10 hours a week on Excel of reporting (KPI’s, comping to other markets, targeting, forecasting, and order data). 

I have a bit of experience in everything, but all the jobs that call back end up being entry level commission only. I do not want to do sales anymore for my mental health, but everything else I’m “qualified for” is a major pay cut. 

Anyone else experience this? 

Anyone have advice for finding a career when taking a huge step back financially seems to be the only option?

How do I get companies to give me an opportunity? I’m willing to learn and a hard worker, but that doesn’t get far in the application process.

Overall, I’m disappointed with myself for getting into this situation. But hey, when you’re young money talks… turns out the more you’re offered the bigger the headache.


Any advice is appreciated."

I am an engineering student who will be graduating late this year, I still have one more summer so I've been looking for internships since September of last year. I'm located in the US.   


I received an offer from Company #1, a company I worked at for my previous two internships. I really like the people there, but it's not the industry I want to work in. They did not give me a date to respond by, so I've been withholding from saying anything concrete.   


I interviewed with Company #2 in early/mid January. I didn't think the interview went all that well, but at the end of the interview the engineer talking with me said I did really well and he would try and get back to me in a few weeks. I then interviewed with Company #3 about a week later and thought the interview went super well. Even better is that it's in the industry that I want to work in.   


A few weeks later I got an offer from Company #2 with three business days to reply. I reached out to Company #3 to ask if they would be able to make an offer in light of Company #2 sending me a contract. Company #3 said they wanted to send an offer and would do so ASAP. Because they sounded so enthusiastic I politely said no to Company #2. (I will be honest, it hurt to write that email)  


After a week of nothing from Company #3 I emailed them asking for an update. A week later I got an email back saying they were still working on getting approval for the offer and would let me know as soon as they knew more. That was nine days ago as of today. I'm starting to get really nervous and am wondering if I'm being towed along only to be told in a few weeks that they weren't able to get me an internship after all.   


I was thinking about emailing them again to ask for an update once again, but I also don't want to come across as a nuisance or annoying. I realize interns are not exactly the most important people in a company, and that's fine. This is starting to feel a little silly though. I'm really concerned that I'm going to dig myself a hole and not have a position for the summer, though.   


I was wondering how exactly I should proceed in this situation. Unfortunately the recruiter has not attached their work phone number so I can't exactly contact them in a way other than email. I could certainly go back to Company #1 again, but having an internship in the industry I want to go into would be really helpful for when I'm looking for full time positions.   


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!"

I’m a 2022 bscs grad from a decent (T25) university and my relevant work experience is currently 8 months at an ai startup in SF (1 billion valuation/ 250 employees). At the time this was a big opportunity for me because I didn’t have internship experience so a six fig fully remote offer was basically a dream come true. But these past couple of months I’ve been thinking I need to switch places for the following reasons/concerns:

1. I’m worried my experience won’t be relevant moving forward. The tech stach is a bit strange in that I’m using relevant technologies (python/aws/docker/kubernetes/GHA) but I’m developing in their own home-built framework so I feel like I’m only gaining experience in their specific tech. And for the deployment technologies, I don’t really build/modify anything with docker/kubernetes/aws/gha, I just interact with their existing setup to monitor my. code, do builds, etc. - does this even count as experience with this technology? 
2. The work is mind-numbingly boring. Their products are automation software for revenue cycle, they have me implementing the business logic and writing the drivers to interact with EHR’s (RPA). Even though we’re supposedly using scrum, I feel like I context switch on a daily basis at minimum, jumping from product to product to fix their sh*tty codebase that gets broken over a tiny ehr UI change. I think I average like 2 small PR’s a day for bug fixes and it’s probably been 2 months since I actually wrote code for a new product. Every day I wake up to someone pinging me with a new production blocking bug that I need to tackle right away. This white knuckle development is burning me tf out. Is this normal? Or perhaps normal for a startup?
3. I feel like remote work is extremely bad for my mental health. Right now I’m just living with my parents stacking cash but I meet basically no one new. I have a few hobbies after work but I feel too tired at the end of the day/ week to push myself to go out and meet more people. Not sure if working in person would help with this problem or not, would appreciate insight here. 

How long should I stay at this place? I haven’t tried applying to places since last spring so I don’t even know how easy it will be for me to get another offer. Basically the only positives I see from working here are the great (for me) pay and the flexibility of not having to relocate somewhere. 

all advice is greatly appreciated"

I am (incredibly lucky and grateful to be) deciding between two internships and was hoping for some input on what would better set me up for a career in SWE or data engineering: 

1. Security automation engineering at a lesser known F100 company: in person (which doesn't bother me) in a smaller city that I'm not super interested in (but relocation/housing are covered which is nice), $23/hour (considering negotiating higher if possible - would hope for $26/27). I don't know much about the field, but am interested in automation and pipeline development (though long-term likely not in a security field).
2. Reporting/Data analytics at a large healthcare company (worked there last summer too, but different team), fully remote, $27/hour (might try to negotiate to $28/29 but unlikely to get that). This field is very similar to my previous major which I'm still somewhat interested in, but I was hoping to break more into a CS-related field if possible and don't want to pigeonhole myself in health data too early on.

I am (incredibly lucky and grateful to be) deciding between two internships and was hoping for some input on what would better set me up for a career in SWE or data engineering:

1. Security automation engineering at a lesser known F100 company: in person (which doesn't bother me) in a smaller city that I'm not super interested in (but relocation/housing are covered which is nice), $23/hour (considering negotiating higher if possible - would hope for $26/27). I don't know much about the field, but am interested in automation and pipeline development (though long-term likely not in a security field).
2. Reporting/Data analytics at a large healthcare company (worked there last summer too, but different team), fully remote, $27/hour (might try to negotiate to $28/29 but unlikely to get that). This field is very similar to my previous major which I'm still somewhat interested in, but I was hoping to break more into a CS-related field if possible and don't want to pigeonhole myself in health data too early on.

Any and all thoughts are much appreciated!"

I was wondering if anyone could recommend some clubs on campus that cater to people interested in coding! I've taken a few classes but I really want to learn more languages and prep for internships, preferably in a chill, low-commitment environment with nice people :)"

I am not going to work in this field and just want a certificate to pass the sem. I found many companies online giving internship certificate for doing a course. Do college professor just want a certificate and report or they do a background check and see if you had done some work in industry or not."

I went to the CS career fair last semester and waited in line for 1.5 hours… and never got in. I have a solid resume and am at ~85 credits. I’m looking for internships and am also looking for entry-level data analyst or database admin positions. Any advice regarding a game plan? For now, I have 10 copies of my resume and a list of companies I am interested in that are attending. On top of that, I have some of the positions of those companies listed. Please let me know, thanks!"

I'm in a point in life where I have total flexibility to go whatever direction I want so I was wondering what are the best countries to start a cybersecurity career. I'm a European Union citizen, quite new to cybersecurity (and by no means a seasoned expert), but I also have a few years experience in other type of positions in tech companies, so not really a totally inexperienced worker either. 

My main priorities are a good salary and also (even if it's later down the road) the possibility to work mostly remote and with flexible schedules. I have a preference for being based in Europe but I'm flexible with that too. Single with no kids and no kind of debt so no constraints on that side either.

What are the salaries and job conditions like where you live and what would you say are the best places to start a career? What could be the potential salaries for someone like me? Info about me:

\- A BSc in engineering  
\- A MSc in cybersecurity  
\- A 6 month internship in a mid-size cybersecurity consultancy firm (mostly pentesting)  
\- 4 years experience in another tech company (one of the big ones), not related to cybersecurity (most of this time I was managing a tech support team but my job was not really technical)  
\- I speak 3 languages, including fluent English and Spanish.  
\- Tons of international experience, studied/worked in different countries for long periods of time.

Thanks everyone for the help!"

So for context, I am a dev working with other 2 people (one an intern) on a not so sinole proyect with a code base form ~3 years ago. The scrum master is also the arquitect and the issue is that the tasks we get assigned along side their user stories are unclear and too general. For example one said: ""Update the module to communicate securely to the cloud using sas tokens"". And that's it, no success criteria, no further explanation, no nothing. The arquitect barely knows the technology and doesn't even know how to git clone a repo (idk why is he and architect) and he keeps pushing us to fill the user stories which afaik is his job. He even put the intern all by herself to fill those. I don't mind doing his job as long as it comes with a performance bonus. I am a not so patient person but I try my best, how can I communicate all of this to him?"

1145oqv,1,2023-02-16,Rising senior struggling to get offers looking for advice,PlasticAd7344,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1145oqv/rising_senior_struggling_to_get_offers_looking/,"Hi all,

I was initially planning on going to medical school, and have switched gears to SWE. My major is in Computer Science at a top school.

I have some computational research experience (have twisted it really hard to be engineering related) but no real internship at a tech company.

I have applied to 400+ Summer 2023 internship roles since August 2022. Initially I got a lot of interviews and OAs and thought I was killing it. In the end my lack of experience with recruiting because I was so new led to a lot of potential offers slipping out of my hands. I did not receive an offer.

I still haven't received one. I've kept chugging along. But as of late (for all of Jan. and Feb. 2023) I've been receiving essentially 0 interviews. I apply every day to new jobs.

I am getting really discouraged and frustrated. I do not understand why I am not getting interviews/OAs, because I received them from all the top companies early on.

I am trying to critically evaluate my process to get an interview. I am pretty desperate at this point, and am even considering graduating a year later (I was originally going to graduate December 2023, but I'm not so sure anymore) so I get another chance at recruiting. I have two questions I wanted to throw out there:

* Can someone give me some hope or at least empathize with me here lol? I am honestly extremely stressed about this every day. My financial situation is very unstable and all I need is an internship.
* What am I doing wrong? What can I do better? I feel like I can't really improve my resume much at this point. Any tips? Or is it just volume of apps and keeping my fingers crossed?

Appreciate the time you all took to read this."

I just got another offer for a similar interview from another company. Is it likely to be the same situation? What types of questions would be asked in this context?"

I applied to be an intern for a junior python developer role. they got back to me and said i had a lack of knowledge in e.g. dictionaries, hashing, code style, and context managers and that I wasn't a good fit at the time. it sucks cause I felt that I did good n the technical interview I just fell short on a few things but I got a handle on it, in my opinion, it could have been better because I was really nervous as it was my first technical interview.

instead, they offered me a role to be an Intern for a QA Automation Engineer role, I am a bit disappointed and I never even considered this path. Does anybody have any experience with this type of role and is it a good thing to get involved with? 

I'm asking because I really want to get into a good position in life so I can support myself and my family."

-Investment Banker (compensation ceiling is much greater than other options, it seems)

-Consultant (better work/life balance then Banker but seems to be less fulfilling work)

-Private equity (still better work/life than banker but hard to break into)

-Hedge fund (portfolio manager, trader, etc.)

1149tj1,4,2023-02-16,CPA worth it?,yesman88b,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/1149tj1/cpa_worth_it/,"Im a 22 year old accounting student going to a decent state university in SoCal (SDSU). Im a year out from graduating and rethinking my decisions. Ive got an intern offer with a Big4 in Audit lined up for Summer 2024 and am just wrapping up an Audit internship with a regional at the moment. After I get my Bachelors Im planning on doing a Macc program and get to 150 for the CPA exam. At this rate I’ll be done by the end of Spring 2025 and will be 25 years old. 

I feel like ive lost out a lot by going to community college then state school while still living with my parents straight out of high school. Ive never had a girlfriend or gone to a party or done anything fun. All I do is study and go home. Add the 2-3 years needed to put in the time in public before hopping into industry, Im going to be 28/29 by the time I start my first high paying job and can move out of my parents house.

Im starting to get real cold feet, I’ve sacrificed my early 20s for a degree I didnt even enjoy while living with my parents and never moving out. I feel like the walls of time are closing in and I’ll be an 30 year old by the time I start my life.

I’m thinking of getting my bachelors in spring 2024, getting a government or industry job, and foregoing public at all. The thing is, as we all know without a CPA you’re pretty screwed if you eventually want to get promoted to Manager, even in industry and government. 

My two choices are: sacrifice the rest of my youth for a stable, lucrative career and license in my 30s and beyond, or live my life and be happy in my mid to late 20s but get pigeonholed as a Staff. 

I want to hear if those who went the riskier path (no CPA, straight to industry/gov) regret their decisions, and if not what decisions did you make? I know that the CPA is worth it in the long run but I want to know if sacrificing my youth is worth the opportunities opened up by a Big4 + CPA combo. Thanks!"

So l’m conflicted because I have two opportunities this summer to choose from. I am currently a senior about to graduate and I need one more summer class to
complete my degree.

My first option is a study abroad program happening in Rome for about a month that will cover the last credit that I need for my degree. I put in a lot of effort for the program application and also to get a grant to help fund the program. I got the grant but I still have to pay around $3000 to go unfortunately. But I feel like it might be a once in a lifetime opportunity.

But on the other hand I applied for internships this summer for the Student Conservation Association. It's something that I've also
always wanted to do as well, and I will get paid for it but I know it won't be as fun. But it could lead to future job opportunities.

It's for a site located on a mountain that's pretty remote and I would be leading tours of the site and also just maintenance of the facilities. This is for three months and it's pretty far away from my home state as well. But my references gave me really great recommendations and I wouldn't want to let them down.

I looked to see if I could potentially apply for other internship opportunities in the future if I were to go to Rome but it looks like this is one of the biggest
opportunities for me because most of the internships
that they offer are in the summer. 

And it's not as common to have these opportunities during the year. So I feel like both of these would be once in a lifetime
opportunities, one that I have to pay for and one that I get paid doing. I just don't know which one to choose. I know the internship would probably be the smarter choice but what do you guys think? is there any advice to offer here?

Thank you!"

This year, I am going to address what if cannot enter a CS degree? Many students would be considering applying for the popular computer science degree. Realistically speaking, with such high demand and limited vacancies, many students who apply for computer science would not be able to get it. Especially NUS Computing, which is AAA/A. So, what other degrees can one do if one is interested to study the contents in the computer science degree? What other degrees can prepare one to go into the computer science related careers?

This post intends to compare in detail (module matching) the synergy between a CS degree and a math degree. As I am more familiar with the NTU curriculum, I will be comparing the modules taken in NTU CS degree and NTU math degree. I based on the latest curriculum of both degrees:

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider118/ug/cs/ay2022/ay22-23\_cs-curriculum-structure\_jan-2023.pdf?sfvrsn=74876034\_6](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider118/ug/cs/ay2022/ay22-23_cs-curriculum-structure_jan-2023.pdf?sfvrsn=74876034_6)

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/math-2021](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/math-2021)

NTU Math has 4 tracks/specialisations: Pure Math, Applied Math, Statistics, Business Analytics. Under Applied Math and Business Analytics tracks/specialisations, one can take computer science modules to clear as NTU Math Major Prescribed Electives. I will elaborate more later. Also, one can take modules in another specialisation, just that clear it as Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDEs) \[aka Unrestricted Electives (UEs)\].

There are 19 compulsory core modules in NTU CS curriculum, excluding those CC, HW, EG, ML coded modules that are not CS specific modules, and excluding internship and FYP. Both internship and FYP is in both CS and math curriculum. Out of these 19 modules, 9 (47% of the) compulsory core modules in NTU CS curriculum have equivalent content with NTU Math curriculum modules: (Those in bracket is NTU Math modules) \[AU is academic units\]

1. SC1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking &amp; Programming - 3AU (PS0001 Introduction to Computational Thinking – 3AU)
2. MH1810 Mathematics I – 3AU (Simplified version of the combined content of MH1100 Calculus I – 4AU and first half of MH1101 Calculus II – 4AU)
3. MH1812 Discrete Mathematics – 3AU (Simplified version of the combined content of MH1300 Foundation of Mathematics – 4AU and MH1301 Discrete Mathematics – 3AU)
4. SC1004 Linear Algebra for Computing – 3AU (Simplified version of the combined content of MH1200 Linear Algebra I – 4AU and MH1201 Linear Algebra II – 4AU)
5. SC1007 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms – 3AU (MH1403 Algorithms and Computing – 3AU)
6. SC1015 Introduction to Data Science &amp; AI – 3AU (PS0002 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence – 3AU)
7. SC2000 Probability and Statistics for Computing – 3AU (MH2500 Probability and Introduction to Statistics – 4AU)
8. SC2001 Algorithm Design and Analysis – 3AU (Half of the combined content of NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module MH3400 Algorithms for the Real World – 4AU available for all tracks/specialisations and NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective MH4302 Theory of Computing – 4AU available for Pure Math, Applied Math, Statistics specialisation/track) \[Note: This exact module SC2001 is also NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module available for Applied Math Track\]
9. SC2207 Introduction to Database – 3AU (NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module available for Business Analytics Track)

NTU CS curriculum needs to take 2 modules SC30xx and 4 modules of SC4xxx, which is total 6 modules of Major Prescribed Elective of 3AU each. The list of CS Major Prescribed Elective we can refer to the following link:

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider118/ug/electivefocusarea/cs-elective-focus-(june-2022).pdf?sfvrsn=9cd4d18e\_6](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider118/ug/electivefocusarea/cs-elective-focus-(june-2022).pdf?sfvrsn=9cd4d18e_6)

Note that the link above is for earlier cohorts. I couldn’t find the new SC-coded CS Major Prescribed Elective list, other than what I found below which is the SC-coded CS Major Prescribed Elective list in the NTU Double Major in Math and CS.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/macs-2021](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/macs-2021)

Among all the CS Major Prescribed Elective in the list, the following 7 CS modules with equivalent content to NTU Math curriculum modules:

1. SC3051/CZ4015 Modelling and Simulation – 3AU (Simplified version of the combined content of NTU Math MH3511 Data Analysis with Computer – 3AU available as Statistics Major Prescribed Elective Module, Business Analytics Core Module and NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective MH4702 Probabilistic Methods in OR – 4AU available for Applied Math, Statistics, Business Analytics specialisation/track)
2. SC4010/CZ4010 Applied Cryptography – 3AU (NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module MH4311 Cryptography – 4AU in the Pure Math and Applied Math Track/Specialisation)
3. SC4020/CZ4032 Data Analytics and Mining – 3AU (NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module MH4510 Statistical Learning and Data Mining – 4AU in the Statistics and Business Analytics Track/Specialisation)
4. SC4001/CZ4042 Neural Network and Deep Learning (NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module available for Applied Math Track)
5. SC4000/CZ4041 Machine Learning (NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module available for Business Analytics Track)
6. SC4021/CZ4034 Information Retrieval (NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module available for Business Analytics Track)
7. SC4040/CZ4016 Advanced Topics in Algorithms (The other half of the combined content of NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective Module MH3400 Algorithms for the Real World – 4AU available for all tracks/specialisations and NTU Math Major Prescribed Elective MH4302 Theory of Computing available for Pure Math, Applied Math, Statistics specialisation/track)

From the above analysis, we can see that a student in NTU math can learn more than half of what a NTU CS student learns if the NTU Math student plans to take modules leaning towards CS. Regardless of what specialisation in NTU Math, every student in NTU Math would have learned almost half of the core CS modules knowledge, which are those math/CS fundamentals, and modules leaning towards algorithms that involve both math/CS heavily.

So, what’s the difference between a CS degree and a math degree? The difference lies in math degree will have (1) a stronger math fundamentals training (especially in mathematical proving which is the bread and butter of a math major) and (2) all area of math studied that is not necessary link to CS (Much wider range of math modules covering mathematics in finance, economics, engineering etc.). Whereas a CS degree will provide the training in software and computer systems absence in a math degree, thus less in-depth study of math fundamentals is needed.

Personally, I would have recommended people to go for NTU Double Major in Math and CS, as this is really the best of both worlds. Strong math training + Strong CS software skills. This has been highlighted in a talk by a math prof (link below tune to timing 1:00:15). He talks about how math and CS are intrinsically linked and that studying for a math degree is excellent preparation for a CS career. What differentiates an excellent computer scientist from a mediocre one lies in the math.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkRKIXPaOLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkRKIXPaOLc)

However, if can’t get into this double major, a math degree will also be a good preparation for CS-related careers. In fact, some of my peers in NTU Math took CS-related internships to pick up and hone their software skills, which help compensates for the lack of software skills training in a math degree.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/minor-in-computing-and-data-analysis/ay2021-22-onwards-cohorts#Content\_C005\_Col00](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/minor-in-computing-and-data-analysis/ay2021-22-onwards-cohorts#Content_C005_Col00)

Also, a significant number of my NTU Math peers took a Minor in Computing and Data Analysis (link above). This minor cannot be taken if choose business analytics track in NTU Math. This minor would enable students to take 5 CS modules from the list of modules in the link, which are mainly part of the 19 compulsory CS core modules. This would have enabled NTU Math students taking this minor to learn more than half of the content in the 19 compulsory CS core modules.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/mada-(matric-yr-2022)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/mada-(matric-yr-2022))

There is also a rather new NTU Math with 2nd major in data analytics (link above), involving modules in databases, data mining, and database management. Typically, a 2nd major needs 10 modules. But because the NTU math curriculum already has 3 modules that double count to this 2nd major, NTU Math students only need to take 7 modules to fulfill this 2nd major requirement. It's super worth it in my opinion! To put into context, a minor in NTU is 5 modules. Just study 2 more modules, you can get a 2nd major! Furthermore, a math degree highly complements data analytics, as many data analytics concepts/ideas come from math/stats which you would have a strong foundation in from the math degree curriculum. This meant that math degree students hold a unique advantage when they take data analytics modules, as math degree students can better appreciate the math-motivated data analytics concepts. This double major enables students to take 1 CS Major Core Module SC2207 Introduction to Database and 8 CS Major Prescribed Elective modules.

In terms of job prospects, with a great overlap of math and CS, many of NTU Math peers went on to CS, data science related careers, including statistician and data analyst/scientist in Department of Statistics (DoS), Singapore, DSTA, Shopee, etc. With strong mathematical training, some of my NTU Math peers, including myself, went on to do research work in universities, A\*star, DSO, and pursue Ph.D. studies in math, engineering, CS, etc. (both local and overseas) doing research and developing new and improved algorithms for various real-world applications. To develop new algorithms, one needs to know how to prove the correctness, convergence, and performance upper/lower bounds of the proposed algorithm. Hence, mathematical proving skills learned in a math major are essential.

Check out the latest NTU Open House 2023 Math Talk Videos (link below). The first link is a talk by a NTU Math prof about the NTU Math curriculum. The second link is a talk by 2 NTU Math alumni, which mention how interesting learning math is in NTU Math, and securing internship in data analytics and machine learning.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d89PxzhDs1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d89PxzhDs1I)

In conclusion, a math degree is a good preparation for CS and data science related careers. The best is to have a double major in math and CS. But a math degree also provides good training and a pathway towards a CS and data science related careers.

I started at a new office back in October of last year. To preface, I was simultaneously fighting through a deep depression and struggling with suicidal ideation almost, if not, daily. This wasn’t apparent at first, I was able to show up to work as normal, pretend to be happy and brush off the stress of my everyday with relative ease.

**I’d like to point out that I interned at this same office when I was in college (2021)**

I work in a sales job in, let’s say, residential living. I deal with abusive, difficult people all the time: over the phone, in person, email etc. In fact, I’m pretty good at it. So much so, that I became the go-to guy for difficult people. It started off small; responding to a nasty email, a bad review. Eventually it developed became more extreme; sitting for 30 minutes after close on the line with an abusive resident, spending two hours in our common area with a difficult person, being appointed to handle specific aggressive people known to be willing to escales to physical violence.

*This wasn’t the only thing happening in my life however*

I decided that I needed enrichment and enrolled in an online master’s program — the day before classes started, the logic board in my MacBook failed. What I thought was a charger port error ended up becoming a $450.00 replacement. I could t afford it and began staying late after work to do research and complete assignments. It wasn’t easy, my financial aid had been mixed up and I was unenrolled from my classes and then re-enrolled days later without any notice from the university. It put me behind two assignments.

I didn’t grow up with much and my parents split early. One of the consequences of that all is that I never learned to drive - this severely limits my opportunities for work. I spent my entire summer looking for work, hoping that I could focus on learning to drive and save up money before moving out of my mom’s home. I graduated college in May last year (2022). I was unsuccessful, so I took this job I knew I did not want (the internship had made me miserable) because I felt, with increasing pressure, that my mom not only wanted me out of her house but could not support me financially, even as I tried to live beneath my means: one meal a day, nothing special asked etcetera.

Eventually, it became evident to my coworkers that something was off. I confided in a coworker that I was going through a lot and why but that I had begun therapy. That same coworker turned around a week later and complained to my manager that my work performance was poor and that I did not take work seriously. My manager and I had a confrontation where I was told that I was bumming the office out and needed to knock it off + leave my depression at home. I had been sitting at my desk performing work but not socializing as much.

I made an adjustment, even though I was still having a particularly tough time and decided to try showing up to work and being more bright and sociable. I never had an issue with performing for customers and even garnered a few positive reviews and customers only willing to deal with me due to their pleasant experiences with me as a professional - this all during my deep depression and silence in the office. I had to put my energy where I could.

Regardless, that same coworker (from before) and I began to come into conflict over small things; me stirring a coffee, asking a question, or lightly whistling a tune set them off. I also had begun outwardly complaining about the abuse I was receiving because I figured I was safe to do so in the office. That coworker told me that I was unprofessional, aggressive, and explosive which was alarming and difficult to hear because I’ve always been described in the opposite way. I sat back and listened. It turned out that me complaining about the abuse I was receiving from customers made my coworkers perceive me as aggressive and explosive. 

I decided not to let that bother me too deeply and instead began coming to work with a professional-only attitude. Speaking to others when necessary, when it was polite to do (good morning, bless you, good night), getting my work done and serving our customers. Only this was problematic and I was called into a meeting with our regional manager yesterday who told me that they did not hire me to show up to work to just get work done. They hired me because of my personality and my capabilities but my personality had been severely lacking in terms of socializing with my coworkers.

Honestly, I’m not sure that I know who I was the summer of my internship anymore or that I am willing to reconnect with that part of myself. Adulthood weighs heavy and I feel it changing me. I’ve always been serious, but now even more-so. I have tried to please these people (I know people-pleasing is bad but I can’t lose my job) by showing up on my worst days and beyond but no matter what I do, they seem to want something different. Maybe I’m the problem, but I figure it’s worth looking for a solution. 

*TLDR; I moved to a new city which worsened my depression because now, I have no connection to family and friends who all don’t have time to see, call, or text me - I reach out and don’t get much back. I haven’t been successful at finding new friends and the friends I made here during my internship took my depression as anger toward them (though I explained I was going through a lot and just needed social distance at times). A coworker has been nitpicking at me since November. So much so that I was reprimanded for being “too social and outgoing” in the office, told my performance was lacking (untrue), then reprimanded for being depressed and less social, and finally reprimanded for “showing up to work like a robot” because I decided to behave in a strictly professional way. What now?*"

I study aerospace but during the internship I mostly built big and small tools in Matlab to assist the colleagues. My team analyzes vehicle performance simulation and test data, which contains tons of signals in different formats.

Here are three big projects I did:

1. A GUI program in Matlab that reads in simulation and raw test data, automatically identifies and trims off useless range in the test data, does a lot of conversion like unit and sample rate, put signals in pairs according to an Excel table, then plot them for visualization. Before they had to open the data in different software, then copy both signals into Excel for comparison. One important aspect is that I did two presentation for the colleagues to gather feedbacks and add new useful functions.
2. Similar to the first tool, except this program one-click generates an Excel report with fully processed data and plots. It has no interactive interface, but its code is written in a way such that the user can easily exapnd and customize it. Before this tool it would take &gt; 15 mins to make such a report manually and they do this a few times a week.
3. There was a Matlab program for performance simulation. The code was a mess, so I did a thorough cleaning/rewriting, then expanded its function by making it call a self-contained simulation FMU. I don't know how it works, only how to feed it data and process the outputs.

Here's my first ideas:
- Developed independently internal tool in Matlab that allow users to visualize, compare, and analyze road test and simulation data while holding workshops with team members to understand their needs
- Built MATLAB tool that generates Excel analysis report with one click, saving colleagues up to one labor hour per week
- Integrated FMU (Functional Mock-up Interface) into Matlab for rapid vehicle performance simulation

I would really love to experience working in a different country and culture, and I believe this could be a great opportunity for personal and professional growth.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice or recommendations for finding internships in the UK as an international student. I have been researching online, but it's challenging to determine which opportunities are legitimate, and which companies would be open to hiring someone from another country.

I have some experience with web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Java...and I am currently working on improving my skills through personal and academical projects and online courses. 

If you have any advice or recommendations on how to find web development internships in the UK, I would greatly appreciate it! Additionally, if anyone knows of any companies specifically looking for interns with my level of experience, or has any leads that they could share, that would be amazing.

Thank you in advance for your help!"
114rfcy,68,2023-02-17,My job search experience in France and Switzerland: New grad landed a job as MLE in Switzerland,9Dr_Awkward6,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/114rfcy/my_job_search_experience_in_france_and/," I wanted to recount my experience trying to find a job in France and in Switzerland as a new graduate and provide some advice for those still looking in this area of the world or who plan to look more. This is not a post to brag, I'm interested only in sharing information and my perspective.

A little background and context in which I found my position as a MLE :

* Searched from August 2022 - Jan 2023
* 28 years old
* MSc Statistics
* MSc Physics
* BSc Energy Engineering
* Couldn’t break into the market between the two MSc degrees (CV gap)
* Relevant experience at time of employment for position:
   * Did some analytics at a small company for 8 months before Covid hit
   * Got an internship (6months) at a big household name tech company doing R&amp;D (not in France or Switzerland)
* Returned to study and coding for MSc in Stats (Covid years)
* Personal information (becomes relevant later):
   * Name sounds French
   * Speak fluently French (no accent), English and some German
   * I am an EU national (not French)
   * I am not white, I am a man
   * I live in France

I applied 359 times in 5-6 months, witn ⅔ of applications in Switzerland. I got into 28 interviewing processes (at least HR screening), I performed in 11 technical interviews (hackerrank, leetcode, technical know-how, take-home), 1 assessment centre and the longest recruitment process I got through is 6 different interviews for the same company. I rejected 2 invitations to interview, and rejected 1 other offer when accepting my position.

I looked for jobs on different job boards with most success in finding positions that fit on Linkedin, Indeed and Jobup.ch (I got Jobup ads that fit, the job searcher experience is just bad if you go on their website). I then usually tried to apply through company websites directly and otherwise through those platforms if I had to. I limited my search to my geographical region (East of France, Paris if full remote and Switzerland as a whole with a focus on West).

# Experience of job search in France:

It was absolutely horrendous to search for a job in France. If you don’t come from one of the Grandes écoles, Engineering schools, or famous universities, companies don’t understand your resume and why you have moved around the world. It even said in job ads for EY Lyon: your application will be considered if you come from an engineering school….for a financial auditor position(?!?). I know financial engineering is a thing, but there is a serious problem of ageism and “not in the right box”-syndrome in France.

I was told that I was too old, traveled too much, and wasn’t attached enough to France. I speak perfect French (I went to a French school as a kid), my partner is French and I live in France. I really don't think you could guess I'm not French if you didn't know it before. Make it make sense for this company that I interviewed for who needed someone to do everything from data engineering, MLOps and analytics while interfacing with their biggest american client.

Candidates are treated like shit. I can safely say that after 100+ applications. When applying, you’ll either have to get in through recommendation (understand nepotism from your uni/school contacts and alumni) or then get an automated answer to your application saying that if you don’t hear from them in 3 weeks, then you should consider not being retained. There was even a job advert in Grenoble saying as the first recruiting point “Do you want to work with people coming from these prestigious schools? Work in a competitive environment? Then come work for us”. I went to look at their website and lo-and-behold, it’s just a bunch of white dudes 30-40s with brown hair and variations exist only in presence of beard and/or glasses. Not a single woman and not a single person not coming from the schools advertised. Do you mean to tell me that they couldn’t find anybody qualified from one of those schools that doesn’t fit this bill? I don’t know if it says something worse about the company, the people working there, the state of higher education ,diversity of origin and walks of life in France or all at once.

**Interview experience in France:**

I had three interviewing pipeline experiences in France. First one was great, it was at a scale-up (turned towards global markets) that allowed full-time remote and I was just not a good fit for a dev position. I got this interview through recommendation because there was no way to get it through their recruitment page. For the second one, it was clear after 5 minutes that the person I was talking to didn’t want to be there and was just doing due diligence and asking generic questions. I got a generic answer that they were not currently looking for anyone after the call….but then why the hell do you have a job ad still posted on your website (job ad dated from 2020)? The last interviewing experience was honestly weird and I am going to let you make your own assumptions about it. I first got a phone call from the recruiter who talked to me about the position. It was the one that was advertised as “Data Analyst” but after some questioning, it looked more like it was a bit of everything and there was no Infrastructure on which to rely on so DE, MLOps, DS, DA jobs all rolled into one with extra hours not counted and being on probation for 8 months because you’re a “cadre” (management status role in France). I told I was interested and wanted to pursue the interview process (I like myself a challenge). I then had a video call. I could see the surprise in the face of the interviewer when they saw that I apparently didn’t look how they expected. I was then grilled about my CV, why I travelled so much, where do I live, why do I speak so good French, why do I speak so good English, what school and Uni did I go to (it’s written on my CV…..). Anyways, I got the talk about being too old (“a certain age”) and all the other stuff after that. So I never really got to do any technical interviews for any of the positions. I got HR’d out of all processes.

I don’t want to be pitied for the things I’ve gone through because I don’t want to work for people who behave like this. I honestly believe that France loses on talent and fosters a culture of bitter workers because of how hostile upper management culture vs. management vs. anyone below is. If you don’t fit the French mold and plan from highschool to prépa to école d’ingénieur to company, I would advise you to look at another job market. The market is missing out on talents, people who think out of the box, people with diverging and innovative opinions and that’s too bad for them. I could go on about French history, the labor market evolution in France and divestment from democratic processes, but this is not a post about that.

# Experience of job search in Switzerland:

It seems that there are a lot of companies that are hungry to fill in positions at all levels but like for everything, they mostly want experienced individuals. From my understanding of the market when I was looking, people who have 3+yoe and do front-end or fullstack dev should have an easier time than others. There are a lot of positions that don’t have a very good pay (for Switzerland) that will hire more junior people, but they probably have a retention problem once people hit that magic 3 yoe number. These positions are in academia and public sector usually.

There is a federal obligation for the employer to answer every single application that comes their way. It can be generic, it can be 2 months later, but it HAS to come. This seems insignificant, hard on morale when you’re looking for a job, but at least I didn’t feel as dehumanised as my experience in France. Some people are even open to giving you feedback about your application.

So that’s the good news, on the down side, the companies can sometimes be quite picky and not give you a lot of room for mistakes during some of the technical interviews. After all, they do have to filter somehow since they get so many applicants who are after that good swiss pay. You need to have your wits about you and your nerves under control for this. I guess that is general advice, but good to keep in mind here. Practice makes perfect and will get you a long way ahead.

**Interview experience in Switzerland:**

I’ve had several kinds of interviews from behaviorals, OAs, take-homes, video interviews and I can say that I mostly had a positive experience. I got better as I did more interviews of course and it’s a shame that I didn’t get to show my best for some of them, but that’s life. Sometimes you underperform or bomb interviews. 

Swiss companies like remote interviewing and will ship you out for on-sites if they’re really interested and there’s only a few candidates left. For my current position as an MLE, I had an asynchronous interview with generic HR questions, a 1 week take-home project (honestly, this was fun, but quite time consuming) and then a technical video interview before receiving the offer a week later.

# Conclusion:

It’s rough out there for new grads. The hiring gets hot usually starting in August for the end of the year for the most part. I am not enthusiastic about working in France and I remember seeing the post on this sub of a 40+ year old dev in France who bemoaned the job market situation and it being difficult to change jobs at his age in France. I completely believe and understand him. In this case, it seems the pastures are greener elsewhere. My search process is skewed because I didn't look very hard in Paris that has a lot of job opportunities as a DS, but I don't want to live in that city and friends who lived there have moved back to Lyon. The job search in Switzerland is hard, but companies are looking for people even now. I still think I got quite lucky to find this job especially at this time. I am working in western Switzerland where knowing French is a perk, but did not come in the balance for my position. I use English mostly at work with occasional French for informal conversations with some colleagues.

 My best advice to job-searching new grads or prospective grads is to get your CV checked by people who are in the industry, people with HR experience, prepare well for interviews by finding resources and finding the kind of questions asked on glassdoor and finally expand your network and meet people outside of your circle of tech people. You’d be surprised what other industries need your talent.

I'm looking forward to providing more information if anyone is interested and clarify my perspective."

I (26 F) have always been motivated. I was very good in school, very driven, and I studied a subject I was passionate about at uni. I worked in companies during my internships and I loved it. 

I graduated easily and found a job in a lab in Jan 2020. The boss was extremely controlling, manipulative, stressed out, disorganised and all over the place, going from one crisis to another. No employee has ever lasted more than 3 years. My drive and motivation were used and as I wanted to prove myself, I put up with it and worked really hard, especially during the pandemic when I had to do the job of 3 people who couldn't come, with no additional money. 

After 1 year and 10 months, I quit as I couldn't contain the anger I felt for the boss. I thought that I'd take a month off to calm down before I find another job. 

Instead, I was completely depressed for 3 months and it's been terrible. After that, I became self-employed to help my bf with his work, and also to work remotely for another company that I know and love. 

But for some reason, I still cannot find an ounce of motivation to do the work I am supposed to do. I feel like a piece of sh\*t all the time and most days I don't work at all and only do cleaning/tidying/cooking for me and my boyfriend.

He works in events and one 2-hour gig pays him more than a week of me working full time. Maybe that also impacted my motivation when I think of all the effort I have to go through to make the same money.

He is very nice and understanding with me but everyone else keeps asking me if I found a job and I see judgment in their eyes, which feels awful.

It's been over a year since I quit my full-time job - why am I still so demotivated? Has one of you been in a similar situation? Is there anything I can do to be driven again?

Thank you for reading me and I appreciate any advice/feedback."

I’m a manager at a hotel, but I’m only 2 weeks in and I’m already second guessing being here. I wanted to start an internship that would help further my career (I want to be a graphic designer and currently in school online pursuing that degree). There’s a company here I really wanted to do an internship with this summer, but it requires about 15-20 hours a week. I thought I could do both, but I’m quickly figuring out there’s not much of a work-life balance here at all. I’m salaried, but the other managers in my position work upward 60 hours a week, getting paid for 40. I’m now really tempted to go back to working in the service industry, which is what I did in the past. Here are the pros and cons I’m working with:

Pros:  
\-Consistent pay  
\-Benefits  
\-Managerial role that I could use on my resume later  
\-Stability and security  
\-Can work from home once a week and can make my own schedule sometimes (but there are many days I’ll have to work 14 hours, or come in on the weekend)

Cons:  
\-No work-life balance  
\-May not be able to do the internship  
\-No socializing (I’m new to this town so meeting new people is important to me)  
\-The pay is not as much as I thought. I thought by taking this job I would be able to move out into my own place, but after taxes, I don’t think that would be possible. Which leaves me stuck because it was kind of the whole reason I even accepted this job.

My priorities are: to move out on my own, start the internship in the summer, build a social circle (Aka networking)

I feel so lost, I really don’t know what to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

This is my first time building a PC, could you awesome people give me recommendations/advice of the current PC build? Thank you all! &lt;3  

**Warning**: Prepare for huge chunks of text, summarized the details at the very bottom.  

My maximum budget for this PC build is $800.

**For context**: I will be switching from my [wonderful 7-year-old laptop (click to see specs)](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-envy-15-k100-notebook-pc/7234894/model/7588536/document/c04518209), mainly because I am afraid of it breaking anytime soon, and getting stuck with no replacement.  

The primary use of this PC is to continue to freelance as a Software Developer in a rather, niche market (specifically: Minecraft server-side extensions. until I find an internship), and casually (lightweight?) play games on the side! (as long as the GPU could handle it)

 **The workload**: I understand that this is a dumb question, but to truly rest my soul, this PC build could definitely handle the following workload, right? The regular workload would usually involve: 
- an Integrated Development Environment (shorten to IDE; specifically IntellIJ)
- a Minecraft server, and a couple of Minecraft client instances open simultaneously (in most cases, 2 client instances). 
- Alongside with hosting a couple of docker instances (mainly Bitwarden (unrelated) &amp; MySQL)  

**Minimal boot test**: I will be receiving a payment soon, so I looked around, and if I am correct, I could get passed the POST stage by only purchasing the motherboard, CPU, single RAM, and PSU, right? (I am planning to purchase the other components later)  

**Important note**: I currently reside in Egypt, so the component's prices will be relatively higher than the USA's market. Additional notes:
- In regards to the GPU, I am hoping to purchase a used GTX 750 nearby, until I could save up enough to purchase one that'd peer well with the CPU. I assume this is identical to my laptop's GPU (NVIDIA 850M), so this will be adequate for now! (sidenote: the vram is actually really low though, rip)
- I understand that I could save some money by going with a aATX case. However, I would rather, not have to purchase another case.
- I also presumingly understand that 700W power supply is overkill for my type of PC setup. However, unfortunately, the other lower watts PSU did not have any reviews on Amazon, which is kinda scary. As I would rather not have to deal with Amazon returns, if possible.  

That is all, I apologize for the long chunks of text. I just wanted to write the context, my concerns, train of process, and a couple of questions that I had in mind. Thanks y'all again!  

**Tl;dr**: Any recommendations, tips? Switching from a 7-year-old laptop in-case it suddenly breaks! This PC build is mainly for software development, and some lightweight casual gaming (until the GPU gets upgraded). Questions:
- Is this PC build adequate for my kind of workload? (details at workload section)
- Could I pass the POST stage by only purchasing the mobo, CPU, single RAM, and PSU?"
114ucuo,1,2023-02-17,Is my [56M] ex-wife [58F] being unreasonable towards our daughter [23F]?,ThrowRAdad111,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/114ucuo/is_my_56m_exwife_58f_being_unreasonable_towards/,"Sorry its long but ANY advice would be very much appreciated! My ex-wife and I divorced many years ago when our daughter was a baby. I paid extra in child support on top of what I was required to pay her since she was essentially a single mom. The house was already paid off thanks to me as I had a 6 figure job at the time and I was paying her alimony too. She was a SAHM during and after our divorce. She took great care of our daughter and lived on alimony and child support in the paid off house I left to her after the divorce. She had custody during the week while I did during weekends as my job required many hours and traveling. Several years later, both of us got remarried to someone else.

My wife and I eventually had two kids (boys) who are my daughter's younger brothers. My job also became too demanding as I had three kids (2 who lived with me full-time) so I quit and took a lower paying job for better work-life balance. I also got to see my daughter more often as she stayed overnight on some weekdays. My ex-wife and her husband didn't have any kids together apparently so they took good care of my daughter. Her husband is a great stepfather. Apparently my ex-wife still wasn't working. She was a SAHW and still a SAHM even though our daughter was in grade school by then. My wife on the other hand is a very successful career woman with two master's degrees.

Four years ago, right before my daughter started college, her grandparents (my ex-wife's parents) gave her an inheritance. They said it was for her future. The family was very happy for her. She had already gotten a full-time offer through scholarships for her college of choice so the inheritance was essentially extra. My ex-wife and I had a discussion and spoke with our daughter. I urged our daughter to invest it in real estate. She was confused at first so I gave her a run down of things as I have experience with buying houses.

We found her a small starter home in which she put all of the inheritance in. It was listed a bit more than what her inheritance was worth so her mom (my ex-wife) put a little bit towards it with the help of her husband. In other words, it's in my ex-wife's name, her husband's name, and my daughter's name. Daughter owns 85% and ex-wife and her husband owns the remaining 15%.The original plan was for our daughter to live in it during college as it grew in value but she found out her scholarships cover room and board. She wanted to full college experience.

What my ex-wife did was regularly take care of the place for four years while our daughter attended college and lived in the dorms. My ex-wife even rented it out to a couple tenants for a while so she could have income of her own (our daughter never asked for a penny of the rent profits). This apparently helped my ex-wife immensely as she still had no employable skills and no degree. She was a SAHM her entire life. Well now our daughter is about to graduate college and move out of the dorms. She also met a wonderful guy there who she recently got engaged to. She excitedly asked me about the house and said she would like to sell it to get a slightly bigger home for her and her fiance to start their future in.

I was delighted to hear that and urged her to talk to her mom. While her mom agreed to sell the house before this fall, her mom is wanting 50% of what the house is worth because she had been taking care of it for 4 years. I asked her mom what about all the rent profits from when she was renting it out to tenants while our daughter was in college? She said she barely broke even. I asked why because as far as I know, rent has increased everywhere in the past few years. She said she apparently did her research wrong and rented it for too low. I asked why didn't she use a real estate agent? She said because she wanted to save money by not having to hire one to help her rent it out. She winged it herself.

Granted, the house is still in great shape and my ex-wife has been taking good care of it in her spare time obviously. But she's very set on getting the most she can out of this starter home even though 85% of it is owned by our daughter and she put all of her inheritance in it. My daughter is graduating with a business degree and learned a lot. She told her mom (my ex-wife) that if she gives her 50% then it defeats the purpose of her upgrading to a bigger house (suited for a family) because house prices have increased a lot. My ex-wife still won't budge. She says it's unfair that she took care of the house for four years and would only get 15-20% back. Then our daughter reminded her that's why she never asked for any of the rent profits when her mom was renting it out to tenants.

Then my ex-wife admitted that she broke even and never made profits through renting it out. I reminded her that was her own mistake for refusing to hire a professional. I also reminded her that the inheritance our daughter got 4-5 years back was for her future and she's worked really hard to get where she is (my ex-wife's parents have passed since). Scholarships, full-time school while doing internships, and now engaged and ready for the next chapter in her life. My ex-wife doesn't have a pot to piss in. Still unemployed, no education beyond high school. Also, her husband had an injury a while back and is on disability and social security now so neither are working. Whenever I bring up some alternatives to my ex wife (going back to college, applying for work, downsize the house she lives in, etc) she shuts it down immediately.

I told my ex-wife she's making this more difficult than it needs to be and to just let our daughter sell the starter house (which has gone up in value a lot), she can pick another house to buy within the price range of what she sells the current house for, and ex-wife can have what's leftover. My ex-wife turns it around and is saying that I'm being difficult by not understanding that her and her husband put 15% towards it and have been taking care of it therefore deserve 50% of it (even though she owns a nice house as it is, the paid-off one I left to her years ago)."

I'm wondering would it be a smart career move to try get a summer internship on a J1 Visa  in the summer of '24, the money seems to be very healthy but was wondering if anyone knows how difficult this would be or if there is a better career move to make. I know that the company i'm currently with could keep me on but I don't think the wage would be comparable to what the states would offer."

I have had 3 SWE internships throughout my college years and I am actively trying to look for entry-level full time software engineer roles or even internships at this point. 


Everyday I open linkedin and read messages about companies doing more layoffs which is scaring me that I might not be able to get a job in this market. I have been leetocdng a lot more, but still feel like im not there yet / not rlly good enough. 


This has got me to thinking maybe  should pursue an online masters.. where I Can get a deeper undertsanidn of software, work on building my portfolio, and simultaneously apply to jobs as I am not “wasting my time” 


A couple of reasons why I want to pursue this program and masters:

1. Looks really good on resume
2. Bang for your buck + heard really good things
3. I feel like I half assed my undergrad degree esp w covid
4. Gives me more time to develop as a software engineer with a deeper understanding of databases, algorithms, etc. 
5. Network of other like-minded students 



Thoughts? Your experiences on this program ? Was it worth it for your growth?"

I have been in a humanities graduate program for the last decade or so, during which time I organized and led a number of projects (including ones that were not part of the curriculum and for which I was paid independently). I recently got my CAPM certification, although I did all the prep work for a PMP (including taking a prep course that allowed me to meet all the requisite hours of study). Right as I was about to put my application in for the PMP, the instructor informed me that anything done during my time as a graduate student would not count towards the 3 years necessary to have been performed in project management, so I ended up just going for the CAPM.

I could use advice on a couple of things then. 1) was my instructor wrong about none of this work being applicable or acceptable to the Project Management Institute (e.g. I was in charge of projects at the academic libraries I was employed at; I administered and organized the running of a very large course, including creating a course website and processing the students into actionable groups; I created a course from top to bottom, including creating a curriculum and developing important documentation/assignments/important handouts; I was lead organizer and lead editor for a conference and an accompanying Proceedings edited volume).

2) is a little more complicated. While I obviously have the skills and was very successful with the projects I ran during my time as a graduate student, I don’t have any corporate experience, and that’s what I’m looking to get into. I’m obviously a little older than the typical recent graduate of an undergrad degree (I have my MA, decided that continuing with my PhD was not economically sound given the current state of academia employment), and I really can’t afford to take an unpaid internship (even if I could find one appropriate for my age). What terms should I be searching for in order to get something corporate but that would still allow me the space to learn appropriate methodologies within that sphere?

I’ve had really conflicting advice from the instructor and from a couple of project managers I know, and I feel totally lost. Everyone who has known me professionally (in the academic sphere) think I would be really great at his kind of career, I just don’t know the best way to go about it.

I never feel that I'm ready for the intern-searching things right now since the experience that I got is coming somewhere else (specifically in South East Asia). My internship was about cloud computing, AI, and web/app so I never dig into some topic super deeply and was afraid that would be a huge minus in somebody's eyes. My project section is like shit too with only a few that I have done in my freshman year and that's it, my school is decent in CS (can say that it's a target school for CS) which could help me get some attention but I'm not betting on that. Does anyone have a suggestion on what should I do and would the 4 internships that I got would help me land somewhere in the Bay Area? (or some decent software company)"

114xzl1,13,2023-02-17,Internal moves: Quant Developer to Quant Researcher,Neutral_Nombre,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/114xzl1/internal_moves_quant_developer_to_quant_researcher/,"I’m working as a Quant Dev with a few years of experience and Masters at a top-tier university and been contacted about Quant Dev roles at hedge funds. But, I am also interested in quantitative research. Realistically though, I would need to start from a quant research internship to get my foot in the door and would be taking a lower salary as an intern than as an experienced quant Dev. Is pursuing the quant Dev role a better option and then look to transition internally once (if) I get into a hedge fund or is this extremely difficult?

I have seen on LinkedIn that some people with similar background to myself have done this at mid-sized hedge funds, so I know it’s possible, but curious if it’s actually more common than what I think as I know the skillsets are a bit different.

I’ve read the QuantStart article on quant Dev to quant trader (not quant research) and it also seems to say this is possible but you would need to somehow demonstrate alpha generation abilities (e.g. through paper trading). (Although I recognise even if you commit capital it’s completely different than actually running a strategy with a large capital commitment as you’d have to be more stringent with risk). So yea basically my question is how easy it is to transition internally across on average if I decide I want to (without taking a pay cut).

Any advice appreciated.

114y0iv,1,2023-02-17,"Background in web dev but just got job as an IT Specialist with path towards Network Engineer, not sure what is worth my time to pursue",Blockchain_Airman,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/114y0iv/background_in_web_dev_but_just_got_job_as_an_it/,"So in 2020 I went through the pipeline of self taught html, css, javascript, React, build a portfolio and then apply to a bunch of jobs, the learning and building was like 8 months including some internships. I applied to jobs for like 3 months without getting one thus just joined the military as I needed to get out of my parents house.

So I found my military job required sec+ so I ended up getting my sec+ before going into the military and my military training was basically that of a network engineer.

Fast forward sometime I got stuck at tech school for reasons and ended up getting honorably separated after 1 year and 3 months. But I knew this was coming so in my last 5 or 6 months in the military I went back and continued web dev as I still felt further in that than network engineering / IT. 

I have since separated from the military for like a bit over 6 months and have been coding a lot and now I know full stack MERN, graphql, sql, trpc, etc. Mostly everything in React ecosystem and feel confident in my abilities.

However come now to this recession and it seems there has never been a worse time to not have professional experience and try to break in as a SWE, so I figured I would be continuing grinding and probably start contributing to open source a ton.

However, I did apply to a couple of IT jobs as I have my Sec+ and TS clearance (which are valuable for government jobs) from being in the military, and months later after forgetting I even applied I got a pretty handsome offer for my area as an ""IT specialist"". 

What I was told from talking to them on the phone is if I get my net+ / CCNA I can get moved into a networking role and get a pay raise, which I was already very happy with the starting amount as its a lot more than I have ever maid before and is a big stress relief trying to grind into a SWE job while you burn through savings.

Now I have yet to start this job and have been studying for my CCNA and my dilemma is what is worth my time to pursue. It seems the only offer I have now is in this stuff and being able to get years of experience while I bang out my CCNA, CCNP, and maybe even CCIE could put me worth a lot of money in a few years.

On the other side of things its seems most people speak pessimistically of network engineering as a whole and its future. On top of the fact that I have spent so much time in web dev / SWE.

I am not sure if I should just get my ccna and then in all my free time work on still pursuing SWE, or pursue more networking certs, or even try to combine my experience into a role like dev opps in the future?

I feel like I am now going to spend my time with one foot in one door and one foot in another if I do SWE, I really love SWE and people generally say its the best, but having a really good Network Engineering opportunity in front of me when the pay is very comparable makes me think the future in it will be a lot easier simply due to the fact that I will be racking up paid professional experience, which is all any industry cares about for job application (for the most part) anyway, and everything I have done so far in SWE has just been by myself.

Also if I do pursue the networking side of things considering my background in coding should I go into dev ops or something instead and if I want to combine coding and networking will CCNP / CCIE be worth it still? Are there other paths I should be aware of as well?

I am sort of just at a crossroads here and would appreciate any advice."

If I do applied math, I will be done in 1.5 years and if I do CS, I'll be done in 2 years. My goal is to work in the CS field after graduation. The applied math option means I will have to do more higher-level math courses in place of the upper-level CS courses but I will still do the 5 foundational courses in CS at my school (below).  The CS major path will mean I get to do all of the comp sci classes and focus just on that. Do you think graduating a semester earlier by doing applied math and only getting the foundational CS courses to look for an internship that semester is worth it? I've already spoken to my peers and advisors on this but am just looking for more thoughts. 

CS foundation courses (CU Boulder):

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. Computer Systems
4. Principal of Programming Languages
5. Software Development Methods"

I’ve always struggled with school in the past, it’s made very depressed and many of the classes I took within my past 2 years in college are generally easy so I was able to pass them, but these courses are getting a lot harder which upset me even more. 

I would love to become an actor, that’s my dream. All the clout, money, and excitement. I was debating whether or not I should major in drama/theater or anything related to acting, because an acting degree helps but I’m not sure how much. Many actors don’t have an acting degree or do anything related to that. It is really my dream though honestly to become an actor, but it takes a lot of luck to become one too and be successful. And a degree in this field wouldn’t do much I feel like, there is not many careers out there and they don’t even pay as much anyways.

So right now I am currently majored in cybersecurity. I was originally majored in computer science but I narrowed it specifically to cybersecurity to limit the amount of courses I need to take, even if it results in less opportunities. Coding and advanced math are very hard for me to learn and I hate it. With all this being said I’m not even sure if I’ll enjoy working in cybersecurity, because I won’t be doing any career than involves much coding or math either, but even then in general I don’t know if I’ll like what I’ll see, I’m going to try becoming an intern soon to see if I’ll like what I see. I have somewhat of an interest in cybersecurity but I don’t know if I’ll live it and I’m worried if I don’t. I have a feeling I won’t like it but I’m really hoping I do. I just want to find someone I don’t mind doing for a living, and I don’t wanna masts my time and money going to college.

What should I do? What should I pick between these 2 majors? If it were up to me I’d choose the acting major but I’m not sure it’s worth it, and the cybersecurity major, the intern should help me dictate whether or not I wouldn’t mind doing it. Honestly school is making me so depressed and thinking about this freaks me out even more because my whole future is relying on this, on college."

- currently doing a few machine learning and web dev courses online
- currently doing internship at an ai company doings ops and some analytics
- most probs doing web dev on the side for some places soon
- indiv award in hackathon with 100+ ppl (ml related)
- other portfolio: participate actively in 3ccas, started via proj + alot of other p big via and with leadership, a few leadership in school/events, a few small awards in humans/mun stuff
- don't mind retaking as cus i hardly studied and didn't go sch much due to health+other reasons but im rly motivated now and confident of doing btr (alr was planning to retake a levels last year and my parents r rly supportive of it anyways)
- prefer cs in nus due to more interest in modules there and other progs offered at nus + interested in postgrad so rep of uni is pretty impt? + nearer to home + only close ppl going thr too
- female so have to take gap year if I don't go uni this yr

options for me:
1. apply for nus cs via aba (on a side note i saw online that nus aba only allows 3 achievements and advice on which achievement I shld put will be appreciated🙏), but risky as I'm really far off from cutoff
2. apply for info sys 1st choice for 2.5 bonus + pray aba pushes me in
3. if I don't get into above, go nus business, study rly hard and apply ddp/transfer home faculty
4. go to other local unis 
5. retake a levels (and make time to build portfolio+might apply overseas the following year too)

Apparently my supervisor and the director of the facility had a rocky relationship but I wasn't aware of this until the past couple. He was unsatisfied with their performance which confused me as I only heard positive things from the clients and other more established counselors. My supervisor knew they'd be fired so they put their resignation date right after the end of my semester so we could stay on board. We as in me and the other interns.

A few days ago the director unjustly screamed at two of my fellow interns about their attire. Imo they were dress professionally. I think the only reason I didn't get yelled at was because I wasn't in the room.

Long story short, the interns complained to my school and the school contacted the director who assumed it was my supervisor who put them up to it. My supervisor had no part in this.

So the director fired my supervisor today and me and the interns had to leave.

I never got the chance to say goodbye to my clients which is really fucking tough since one of them told me he was experiencing suicidal ideation. No plan or intent but still. After the session my client told he felt wayyy better but I still wanted to do a safety plan. I explained what it was to my client but I think he assumed that I was going to hospitalize him as he started freaking out. (He was deemed low risk, so hospitalization wasn't necessary) I explained that the safety plan is only for him and nothing else is happening. I'm scared tho now he will be afraid to talk about his feelings. I cried afterward feeling like I fucked up and wondered if I'm really cut out for this line of work.

I never got the chance to address this with him since I got kicked out when my supervisor was kicked out.

Idk, I think I'm just feeling really down and like I ditched my clients I know the other interns feel the same way. 

I wish it all didn't go down like this."

I know an internship is not essential to get a job but I know it helps a large amount. I would not mind doing an internship after graduation but most companies only hire internships for current students, at least that is how I read the listings. I do have an opportunity to build a web application for the small town of 1,700 people I live in. It would just require a small static site but would building that and being put on payroll or as an independent contractor amount to something of an internship? 

So in summary: 

Are internships mostly locked to current students?

Would building that site amount to anything as far as experience for jobs? I have personal projects.

I’m a 25 year old male. I just recently graduated with a general studies degree. In my second year of college, I got into a terrible accident and was forced to take some time off. Because of depression and lack of motivation, I had zero interest in school and just wanted to get out as soon as possible. I graduated with a 3.2 GPA. 

And naturally, I had little work experience. A 3 month internship and a 6 month job at an insurance agency. A year has passed and I can’t find a job in any professional field in digital marketing (marketing is what I had my experience in) or a simple help desk job. 

I do have some experience in IT and I’m generally great with computers. 

I want to pursue a masters not only to learn a new skill (hopefully in technology) but to also possibly have an easier time getting a job. Realistically what’s the best course of action for me?

Does it get better?,evenheathens_,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/115frwb/anyone_else_just_hit_a_wall_and_literally_cannot/,"I think (well, I know) I’m burnt out. I work full time with children with disabilities which I love but it’s very draining emotionally, mentally, and physically. I also have a caseload of clients I’m responsible for at work on top of my direct therapy, and have tons of client assessments and work to do for my fieldwork requirement (2000 hours). 

Add in grad school, plus my own child (sole custody and no family to help) plus my failing mental and physical health and I am just feeling stuck with no return. For reference I have fibromyalgia, endometriosis, ADHD, and pretty severe depression so motivation is not my forte when I’m “healthy”, much less currently. 

I went back to school in 2018 to finish my bachelors and worked myself to the bone to get into my dream grad school. I did full class loads plus 2 research labs and an internship. I got into my reach program and was absolutely elated. I spent a year there before realizing I wanted to change paths as this degree wouldn’t allow me to continue working with my clients in the capacity I want, and enrolled in another grad program this past fall. 

I am just worn out. I know I’m burnt out. But I can’t drop any of these responsibilities and I just feel stuck. Without grad school I will pretty much top out in my field and have no upward mobility to ever make more money or have an easier life. 

I have a paper due plus other assignments and I literally cannot muster a single ounce of motivation. I also have independent research to do for my boss that makes my stomach turn whenever I think about it. 

Does it get better? If you experienced this, what did you do?"

When I thought I can't clear ca inter I started preparing for banking exams from 2022 but can't even clear any exams finally I started a internship in a consulting office in Jan 2023. 

I don't know what I should do now so that I can make my future good. I am thinking of two ways :

1st I should continue prep for bank exams with job ( but I don't know if I can clear the exams )

2nd I should opt for uscma as it is one the cheapest course among cfa frm cpa acca uscma. But still requires a lot of money for a lower middle class guy.

I am very confused about my future I am soon going to be 24 and still I've done nothing in life.

Now I'm hoping to build a PC so I can get back into it again. However, I've got an internship in California this summer I'm flying out to (coming from a college in Iowa), so if I did I would have to ship it, but I've done some research and found that shipping it is pretty complicated and nerve-wracking.

So, should I still build a PC and then try and ship it in a few months? Or should I wait until I'm there and then build one so I only have to ship it back? Is it worth the cost of shipping? Or should I just hold off altogether until after this summer?

I've also considered getting a gaming laptop since it would be a lot easier to transport, but from what I've seen pretty much everything has lower specs for much higher pricing. I'm not interested in using it as a laptop, and I'd only really plug it into my monitor to play, so stuff like the screen and trackpad don't matter to me very much. Another option is a Steam Deck, but unfortunately, it doesn't get the performance that I'm looking for."

Two of the questions asked during the interview was, ""What sets you apart from others?"" and ""What is your proudest achievement?""

For A&amp;M, I would be placed in ETAM and have to maintain a 3.75 to get auto admitted to computer science. It also bothers me to know that I would be wasting an year, taking general courses. But the full ride and engineering honors opportunity is making it hard to pass up. What do y'all think?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Pros of UT Austin CS:

\- mini silicon valley

\-top ten ranking

\-Austin is amazing, because I probably won't have a car with me (I've heard you need a car for college station)

\- amazing career fairs, great recruitment opportunities

Cons:

\-have to pay full (in state tuition)

\- not in honors

Pros of A&amp;M Brown Scholar :

\- will be a ""brown scholar"" (very selective, only national finalists are eligible and out of that Mr. Brown picks out applicants to interview)

\- full ride (most of tution, housing, and food will be paid for)

\-engineering honors auto admit

\- the so called aggie network

\- a trip to Italy this summer with other Brown Scholars

Cons:

\- Have to go through ETAM, take general engineering courses the first year and maintain a 3.75 to get auto admitted to computer science

\- doesn't have that many connections to internships at big tech companies

\- college station, the place feels isolated compared to Austin

\- wont have a car, so it will be hard to get place to feel

\- more known for engineering than cs

\- 39 in ranking for cs"

These 2/3 years have not been easy and regardless of the results, pls be nice to yourself!

For context, I come from a rather low income family, my father is recently retired and my mother is earning ~3k a month, way below the national average, but not quite low enough to qualify for full school subsidies like FAS. I did qualify for 75% subsidies for ISB (Independent School Bursary) though 

During my schooling years I never took any tuition lessons because I didn't want to burden my parents and mostly just self studied, I was lucky enough to get into an elite JC and get a pretty decent RP. My RP was 86.25, PCME/GP grade was BABA/A and A for PW.

Currently I would really like to enter NUS Comp Sci, but from what I read its usually a hit or miss with my current score. Can seniors share whether it's feasible? I know NTU has Comp Sci too and I'm pretty sure my RP will get accepted, but I heard NUS syllabus is better and it offers more opportunities. Not sure if it's possible to study a DDP score with my RP 😭 I'm happy but ik my score isn't quite good enough to compete with all the top dogs in SG

Also want to enquire more about the different financial aid/scholarships for low income students, from what I know NUS and NTU provide a lot of financial aid for low income students quite heavily and also I would like to know if social organisations like CDAC offer uni scholarships? Is there some scholarships out there specifically for well performing underprivileged/low income students?


TLDR, these are the main questions


1. What's the likelihood of 86.25 getting accepted into NUS Comp Sci?

2. Should I consider ABA? I don't have a coding portfolio (I know nothing about it tbh) and my leadership is only class leader, not sure if it's worth a try

3. Is NUS CS better than NTU CS? What are the main differences and your experience with either

4. Anything I can do before uni starts to get a taste of CS? How and where to learn coding or start my own project

5. Will it be helpful if I apply internships to tech startups, is it possible to get one with no experience? What's the best way to secure an internship?

6. What was your experience like interning?

7. How does school fee subsidies and financial aid work for NUS/NTU? With my household income (3k ish, 4 pax) how much will we be subsidised?

8. Is it possible to get subsidised for hall stay? I live very far from NUS and even further from NTU

9. For hall stay, I heard that they try not to let local students stay (1 year in Y1 max), is that true? 

10.  Any external scholarships for different organisations (e.g. CDAC??) that have no bonds/are specifically for low income students? Because with my RP definitely no shot at uni merit scholarships. 

Thank you so much for reading, and I'll be very grateful if you can answer any of my numerous questions :)"

The idea of sitting on the chair at least 40-45 hours a week freaks me out. Choosing another career path seems really hard and even I choose one, there is no guarantee of finding the one I need. I feel lost.

My options are finding another career path or trying to improve my condition and getting experinced about software jobs. I started with frontend, burned out, I know a little about mobile app development and 3D modelling. I really want to improve my 3d and animation skills but modelling jobs are really hard to find and they require much more experince generally.

I always feel really reluctant to tell people what I am majoring in because of its reputation. Overall I'm just really dissatisfied with AET as a whole, and what I really want to major in is Computer Science, and it sucks that I realized this during college and not during my senior year of high school. I just don't know what to do, there's so many paths I could take and its so overwhelming. Option one would be sticking with AET + CS certificate and risk not being able to break into the SWE field without further education. Option two would be the same as option one but I'd go to grad school to get an MCS, which would basically guarantee me a job once I finish, but this comes with its own set of problems like having no way of being able to pay for the high prices of grad school while I'm enrolled. Finally, option three involves applying to other universities during my sophomore year and transferring my junior year, but again this comes with the risk of spending 5 years in college as opposed to 4, which means that it will also probably be more expensive compared to if I just stayed at UT. UT is also my dream school and I absolutely love it here, so transferring would be painful for sure. I've been trying really hard to make myself look employable, I already have an internship (design related) and I am constantly working on my programming skills but the uncertainty of post-grad life has given me a lot of anxiety and has been  severely impacting my mental health.

I've been waiting for a promotion to a full-time position for half a year but have been repeatedly told that due to the shaky situation at the company, there's a freeze on hiring juniors.

Recently, one of the senior engineers decided to leave, and my manager asked him to pass to me his responsibilities. When I talked to my manager about finally becoming a full-time employee due to being given this new responsibility, I was told that there is still no green light to hire me due to the hiring freeze, but she will try to talk to her manager, with no promises.

On one hand, it frustrates me that I'm being given new responsibilities without being compensated for them, especially as an intern. On the other hand, should I just be grateful for the opportunity and keep quiet, with the hope of being hired soon?

I have thought about telling my manager that I'm willing to take on this responsibility, but only if I'm promised a full-time position within one month. Otherwise, I will give up this role.

(Choice 2) Another offer is a fully virtual offer that pays the most out of my offers. I was going to take Choice 1 until I just got admission into the MSCS program. I'm considering a few options.

1. Go full-time with Choice 2 and part-time in the MSCS program (be done with school at the end of 2025 **tentatively** depending on how difficult the full-time job is).
2. Work full-time at Choice 1 or Choice 2 for a year (and save up) and defer the MSCS program and then join the MSCS program full-time and quit the full-time job (also be done with school at the end of 2025).
3. Go full-time immediately to the MSCS program without any full-time work experience (be done with school at the end of **2024**). 

Some additional information: the last time I worked was a FAANG internship last summer. I'm most worried about not having any work experience since then and going into grad school especially because I focused so much on only getting full-time offers and no part-time or internships so far.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: 10/10 She is my AP Gov, AP Microeconomics, and AP Macroeconomics teacher. She majored in poly sci and has been extremely helpful. She is also the advisor for Model UN. I think she talked about my knowledge of politics and self-motivation.

AP Lang + Freshman English 8/10: Close personal relationship and coach. I have gotten to know him very well and he was able to see my debate skills in AP Lang.

Comp Gov + Humanites (9/10): Close personal relationship since he was my dorm head so he got to know me as a person and as a teacher.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Swarthmore (9/10) I thought it went really well, I connected with the interviewer as he was from Hawai'i and white as well.

Washington &amp; Lee (9/10) Also thought it went really well. Connected with my interviewer and

**Essays**

Common App (9.5/10): I talked about growing up in Hawai'i as a white man and how I was discriminated against and how Hawai'i was not my ""paradise"" like it is for many. Instead, I called my private boarding school which I have attended for 4 years now in the midwest has been my ""paradise"".

Supplements (8/10): I really think my Swarthmore Supplemental essay was the reason I got rejected. I thought it was pretty good and so did my counselor, but, I think I tried to be to nuanced and it just didn't make sense. But, my W&amp;L essays and Macalester Essay's were STELLAR in my opinion.

**Final Thoughts**: MAN WAS THIS PROCESS A *STRUGGLE*. I wanted to see if I would have been accepted to Williams or Carleton, but I sincerely think that W&amp;L is the best for me and my future. Being rejected from Swarthmore really hurt, but, after receiving a FULL RIDE from W&amp;L, I think that my future is bright and I sincerely want to prove their admissions officers wrong.

I know you hear this all the time, but, put your head down and WORK, no matter what happens in the college admissions process, it will ALL work out."

My real actions was applying for internship for several institutions. I got 50/50 result, but was hugely rejected by big corporations &amp; institutions. And now I’m dealing with grief and ultimate fear of the future. Thus resulted in __trouble focusing.__

Any tips or advice would be appreciated!,rfag57,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/1162q5a/mature_student_starting_his_ce_classes_tommorow/,"Freshman in University starting my first CE classes tommorow! Please drop any tips or advice

I actually am pretty old. I graduated high school in 2018 and went to university in Canada to study economics but ended up almost killing myself!

I've worked an insane amount to become the healthiest mentally I've ever been and now I'm starting university again officially tommorow.

I know any engineering major is very difficult and I've heard from multiple faculty members that students in my ECE program usually take longer than 4 years due to the amount of work needed. 

I was hoping to get off to a fast start so I had a few questions. 

1.) I have very very basic / almost no experience in coding. I know the barebones of python. I know this isn't the best case scenario but I'm willing to put in the work and I was wondering if I should take a C++ course and work on it outside my lectures. 

2.) As someone with no relavent experience in the field around when should I be looking to apply for internships? 

3.) I know the field of CE is very large, should I be trying to focus on one area of specialization already from my freshmen year? Like the concept of AI and ML seems attractive and the chair of my department seems to think it's a field that will grow in the upcoming years. Even if I don't start projects or whatever, should I be trying to self teach ML courses? I honestly have no idea what I want to specialize in

4.) Orientation was honestly fucking torture. Playing around with kids almost 4-5 years younger than me.. I have a ton of life experience over these kids but because of my age (I was born 1999) I really don't wanna fail... Again. I've worked blue collar jobs and I know how blessed I am to be given another opportunity at higher education. If anyone can throw me some words of wisdom for a fresh engineering student I'd greatly appreciate it.

My GPA is a 2.61. I don't have very many academic achievements. Last semester, I had a class that if I had gotten a D in, I would have been placed on academic probation and lost my scholarship. I only got a C because the final exam got curved up.

After that experience and doing some self reflection, I realized something had to change. I met with my advisor first thing this semester and discussed my options, here's what I've been doing:

* I have a repeat option available, which can be used on a class I retook for a higher grade. It replaces the lower grade with the higher grade on my transcript. Will raise my GPA to \~2.8.
* Met with career councilor at my uni and made a half decent resume. Perfected it with information that I found online. I spent a lot of time on it and I'm pretty proud of it.
* Taking 18 credit hours this semester instead of 12/13 so it effects my GPA more. Currently my lowest grade is a 94%, I'm going for all A's and I have been studying like crazy.
* Started applying for internships, and have currently applied for 10 different companies. Mostly local companies that recruit from my uni, or companies that my friends had internships at.
* Going to a career fair on Tuesday with over 30 different employers hiring CS majors. Researched every company on the list and made an elevator pitch for each one. Have copies of my resume to hand out, and I'll try to hit as many booths as I can. Additionally, I plan on applying to every company online prior to the career fair. I've been working on doing that.

Anyways, I'm doing as much as I can, but I have never applied to internships before and I'm looking for a dose of reality, and also advice for what to do if I don't one. Do I have a reasonable shot at getting an internship this summer? It's already nearing March, and I'm hoping to apply for as many companies as possible before the end of the month. I'll apply for 100 places if I can. I'm not even going for FAANG or anything crazy.

If I don't get an internship, I have a friend with an IT job that pays $20/hr and I think he can get me in. It's not really related to my major, but it's local and I could work there and save up some money over summer, and take some summer classes to increase my GPA further and advance through my degree more quickly.

What are your thoughts?"

As the title suggests, this relates to determining the best approach for managing personal priorities, goals, and academic commitments. Of course, individual goals and priorities will vary. For instance, my personal goal is to maximize my long-term earnings while also having sufficient free time to pursue my interests during my time at university. Additionally, I would like to graduate sooner, as this would enable me to secure a good-paying job sooner than if I were to finish later. Ultimately, I would like to graduate with a desirable job prospect as well. However, a challenge arises in that the more I study, the better my WAM (Weighted Average Mark) will be, but the less free time I will have. Alternatively, if I take on a lighter course load, I will have more free time, but it may take longer to graduate, and my WAM may be lower. I could also pursue any combination of these approaches. It's worth noting that I study computer science, so while a high WAM may be less critical in this industry, it still plays a significant role in securing internships and grad job opportunities, making it relevant to me. 

Relating to this topic is it better to take harder courses for more knowledge but tank ur WAM or easier courses to improv ur WAM.

Note: I just want to finish uni and look back at it with no regrets with the choices I made

I am a college teacher. I haven't quite graduated yet but I got hired after completion of my internship. The school is in trouble and need teachers.

My colleague clearly have mixed feelings about if I should be teaching there or not. All was fine until last week. They started treating me differently. I though it's in my head I have work to do what ever.

However yesterday things took at bizarre turn. They were cold in the staffroom and shut down my attempts to join in conversation. 
I got on with my day, however this is where it gets fucked. I am teaching and every time I look up one of my colleagues is outside my door or by the window watching me. This goes on all day. 
In the last period I flip. I see the teacher next door not in his room. He is in the corridor watching me. I give sarcastic wave. He just stares, I walk out and ask him what he is doing and what his class is up to. 
He gives a good explanation of why he feels ok leaving them alone. 
He asks me what I am doing. I notice a nutural teach is watching the interaction. Way in the background. 
He says he would not cover the topic I am doing with a twelve foot pole. This is despite it being in the curriculum. 
It happens to be forced migration and racism faced by refugees seeking assylum. This is my area of interest and passion. I feel confident teaching this. I was encouraged to teach these topics by the dean, my co teacher doesn't want to cover the topics but I'm ok with  it.
 Also one of the best teachers I have ever met encouraged me to make sure I take the road less traveled and push my students to dive into hard topics. It expand their knowledge and skills. I like teaching the meaty topics. 

We have a new dean and I wonder if this has something to do with it. Upper management is ok with me. But the team are idk what to say.
I am not sure what is going on. Can some one explain."

 I had promised that I will prepare hard for off campus opportunities by the time my internship is over but here comes recession!!

Even the stress I’m going through all this preparation time I feel like I am making no progress at all, completely lost. Sometimes I doubt if Software development is for me or not. This constant bashing has even hampered my relative performance at my current work.

Anyone in this industry please show me a way, what do I need to focus on🙏🏼"

Long story short, did quite a few internships at a company that is among the big 5 and I am currently in the conversion to FTE process. However, because of the layoffs, I got no news on anything, I dont even have a recruiter anymore. I partly assumed the conversion is not happening anymore.

My start date was supposed to be in November but in the meantime I managed to get a job and now an offer for another internship till the end of the year at the biggest company in my country. I would accept this internship because the company is amazing, but in case I still get the conversion for the first company - would it be acceptable to resign from the internship? Would that put me on any sort of black list (apart from the fact that the manager would probably be mad at me)? I am asking because of course, you never know what's in the store for you, so I dont want to burn all the bridges with the company in my country because I really like it.  

Does any of you have any experience or heard of any similar situation? How bad is resigning from an internship, really?"

I’m currently a 3rd year student studying Information Systems. I recently switched in the major and don’t have any IT experience in the field yet I wanted to go on here to ask a question: I basically just accepted an offer for an Information Security internship at a mid size Insurance Company. They only gave me 48 hours to decide so now I’ve been wondering if I should still keep applying to other internships and looking out especially since our career fair is coming up in a week. I actually really wanted this internship especially since it’s position is valid (cybersecurity) and feel like it would look good on resume yet part of me feels guilty as I see other people accept offers from big firms but at the end idk if it really matters since a lot of their positions are really bland such as IT audit or something.

Note:

The internship is a Hybrid/Remote role and pay is 22/hour."

116jaiw,19,2023-02-19,"I am not mentally disabled “enough” to qualify for most disability benefits, but I haven’t been able to get a college education or keep a job for over a year due to said not severe mental disabilities. Any tips?",inspektor_eel,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/116jaiw/i_am_not_mentally_disabled_enough_to_qualify_for/,"I am 20, nearly 21, and it may just be the anxiety talking, but I’m worried for my future and how I will afford just about anything when I can barely keep a job for extended periods of time. This post will mainly be context to my situation, so if you already have tips, please send them my way! If your tip is “you’re so young, things will work out,” please take that up with the employers I’ve been getting no responses from.

Basic context: I live in CO in the US. I have held 3 full-time jobs over the past 5 years, which doesn’t sound too bad at face value. The story untold is that the last month or so of every job I held, I’d been borderline hospital-admission level of not doing well. And before you call me just plain lazy, I’ll also include awards or special recognitions I received at each job.

I got my first job at 16 y/o at a grocery store being an in-store shopper. I held this job for 7 months and had to quit due to increased stress in school causing some not so fun nights. At this job, I was the 2nd most efficient shopper, and would be considered essential every weekend. I was hard-capped at 40 hours a week due to unions since I was a minor, yet would hit 38+ hours on school breaks.

After that, I didn’t get another full-time job until the pandemic, when I graduated high school. I then worked at a restaurant seasonally for about 7-8 months total as a server and during that job, I had extensive mental health problems outside of the job that extended into the workplace with 3 breakdowns during work. I would often at this job work as a host, server, dishwasher, and expo all at the same time and would sometimes have to work lunch rushes by myself due to staff shortages.

During the time that I was working seasonally at the restaurant, I was attending college to pursue a degree in meteorology. Being a meteorologist is my very hopeful, but unrealistic end goal since I had to withdraw after ending up in the hospital twice early on in my Sophomore year. These hospital stays were from, you guessed it, mental health lapses.

I took a few months of a break after the hospital stays and did not start my next full-time job until 4 months later at a ski resort. I then worked as a ski lift operator/off-season helper for about 8-9 months total until I quit that job about two months ago due to a severe manager-influenced mental breakdown that left me unable to climb stairs for nearly four days. This was the second time I had a mental breakdown at this job, and after repeated joking about and disregard of my mental health by my manager(s), I figured I would move on. At this job, I received $50 extra compensation for “exceptional work”, two employee of the month awards, and another special recognition for helping out beyond my department.

So that’s where I’m at now. I’ve had side gigs of being a tutor, dog sitter, babysitter, house sitter, personal driver, and a few other one-off things to help keep me afloat. I still live with my parents which some would call a blessing, but constant pressure to get an actual job from my Dad who doesn’t like to acknowledge my experience with mental health makes it hard. I have about 4-5 months worth of money saved up to pay for rent/groceries/gas/anything else, and that’s about it. I’ve applied to multiple (4) meteorology internships and have heard nothing back, applied to five jobs in the area of data analysis/science and have heard nothing back, as well as two local jobs that said they were urgently hiring who also didn’t respond, so here I am. Almost two months removed from my previous job after a meltdown that left me catatonic for a day and a half, I’m trying to search for a job to continue with life as best as I can. And it’s not like I don’t have experience relevant for the jobs I’ve applied to, I have plenty of personal projects I have completed in that area and have shown excellence in each of them.

Any tips for anything would be appreciated since I’m sorta lost on where to go now. I’m discouraged about how I’ll pay for my future before I even get to the age to drink legally, and I would like to do something about it so I’m not just looked at as wasted potential."

Me:
I have an associate (2year) and bachelor's (4year) in biology (Forestry &amp; Wildlife Specializations respectively) and I currently work for the state as a watershed specialist for the past year. I have previously worked in the food service industry for about 7 years and have had a variety of internships in labs and biology related jobs (3x 4mo internships), often doubling up my jobs in the summer. My current salary is at the poverty line and I have very little hopes of getting it all that much higher, even doubling it feels, while yes amazing, not adequate due to the cost of living. I currently live in one of the most expensive places in the country and am forced to live within the county because of my job. I understand I can take a job elsewhere in the country and am exploring that too, but I have other issues as well with this country. I am always applying for new jobs in this country but everything seems to take 5 years experience or a Masters or both. 
I currently only speak English. I very much enjoy walking and not having to drive, something that I cannot do here because the area is so rich and much if the US is unwalkable. I like beer, rock climbing, and video games. 

Also I still have about 10k in college debt but its slowly getting paid off. I have no idea what effect this could have on my leaving but maybe it's worth noting.



1) Where?
The biggest question is if I were to leave where would I go?
I have a friend in Chile that's always talking it up but we both agree not speaking Spanish means I'd never make it there. There's a lot of Europe, but when I google jobs in my field over there I can never find good results (I probably need to get a vpn and set it to some european countries). I need this country to pay me more than just a living wage, which means either the salary equal to what I earn with a lower cost of living (almost a guarantee), or more with an equal cost of living.
Are there other first world english speaking places too?

 1.5) Culture (Where)?
  I dont like american culture. I don't like guns, I abhor police, I hate our money driven justice system, I hate how long we sentence convicts for constantly, I hate how anti climate change we are, I hate how no one talks to anyone, I hate having to drive everywhere, I hate how much power we give money, I hate our military, I hate our censorship, I hate that I have no healthcare!  Frankly I'm pretty open to lots of ideas though.

I hear all the time that I could just move anywhere else in the world and have 80% of these issues go away. So maybe culture isn't a huge issue in the ""where"" section but some insight would be nice.



2) How?
How does someone leave? I read a lot of stories here about people being happy for leaving, but how do you get the money? How did you search for the jobs? How did you get housing? What were your biggest challenges? How once you get there do you assimilate into the culture? 



3) Crimes!
I have a class 1 misdemeanor permanently on my record from, honestly, not too long ago. How will this affect my immigration? I wouldn't even plan to leave for at least another year at minimum for legal reasons and possibly another year past that for personal reasons. Does this kill my chances of ever leaving? What experience did you or anyone you know have with immigrating with a small criminal record?

Thank you very much for any and all assistance!"

 I was shocked by the UT Austin acceptance after seeing some rejections on here with better stats and ECs. After being rejected by UIUC and Georgia Tech and deferred from UW Madison, I thought my application was really weak, as said in my ChanceMe post's comment so UT Austin acceptance gave me a little confidence back. I think being full-pay was a huge help. I still have many unlikely and high reach RD schools left, but I will keep my expectation very low.

After graduation, I was thinking about doing software cos I do know some coding (enough to do leetcode problems at least) but getting interviews hasn’t been going well, as expected. Anyways I’ve gotten 3 interviews for QA testing positions. If I was going to continue trying to get into software it’s not a bad idea either way to get experience in these jobs, but also I’ve been pondering if having a QA testing career would be all that bad. Is grinding hours of leetcode really worth it if I could just do QA testing? (Saying this b/c recruiters say I won’t be tested for coding skills). It’s not like I especially enjoy swe. Any insights, opinions appreciated. Thanks."

I have some accomplishments in my corner, but I was an alcoholic and horrible person/student until my mid 20s, when I got sober, went back to school, and have since been successful. Because of my bad start to school, the school I got into was also not impressive. 

I'm wondering if my past will essentially be a non-starter when it comes to being admitted for schools like Stanford, or is it something that has a reasonable chance of being overlooked? 


Pros: 

- 3.96 GPA from the **school I graduated from**, being on presidents/dean list each semester
- Major in Chemical Engineering, Minor in Computer Science
- Received awards as the top student in program every year I was there (3 years) 
- Award for AICHE student in NorCal the year I graduated
- Internship and some work experience at NASA 
- One paper published by NASA for a trade study 
- 4 years work experience as a software engineer, currently a staff software engineer at a Bay Area fintech.


Cons: 

- Degree is not from a top institution (SJSU)

- I can probably get a letter of rec from my nasa mentor and definitely my work contacts, but I do not have a relationship with any of my former CS professors.

-  my non-SJSU GPA is horrific due to the above problems. It brings my overall GPA down to around 3.3.

Give it to me straight: is it a waste of time to take a chance on top programs? Would I even stand a chance in mid tier programs? 

Thanks for reading."

I'm a 34M QPoC Architect with a 5yo dog in San Francisco, USA. I work as an urban planning consultant, earning about 92k annually. I'm considering a move to Spain or Portugal within the next 2-3 years with the intent of pursuing permanent residency/citizenship. California will always be my home, but the cost of living here will become unsustainable in the long run unless I suddenly become wealthy in the next few years. I keep my current housing costs down by sharing a house with people. If I moved to us to Europe, I would buy or build a home of my own to live in for a fraction of what it costs to do so here.

I want my first scouting trip to be at least a month-long as this is a massive life decision, so it probably won't happen until early next year. In the meantime, I'd be eternally grateful for any friendly advice folks have to offer regarding the matter.

**Culture:** I could also use a culture change. California has evolved into a place where everyone is working and hustling all day to get by, meaning people don't have the time, capacity, or ""bandwidth,"" as we say, for friendships, community, and even dating. As my 40s approach, I want to spend the rest of my life somewhere where the pace is a little slower and people are (hopefully) a bit warmer. Spain and Portugal sound perfect, as I wouldn't have to sacrifice access to culture and good weather like I would if I moved somewhere else in the US. I've lived on the east coast before for school(undergrad &amp; grad x2), where my priced-out family now lives, and I have to say I'm not impressed. The rest of the US is too car-centric and segregated from everything else for my taste. I'd like not to need a car to exist. 

\- How friendly are locals in either location?

\- Has anyone relocated with a dog before? How welcome are they?

\- Is it challenging to find housing as a foreigner trying to establish residency? 

\- Other than language, what are the cultural differences between Spain and Portugal?

\- Is there a decent work/life balance?

\- Will racism or homophobia be a problem? Especially in smaller cities and rural areas?

**Qualifications:** I have a bachelor's and two master's degrees in architecture, urban planning, and design, with about five years of professional experience, not including internships and a break during the pandemic. My specializations are land use, parks, open space, and transportation planning. I'm good a digital rendering, 3d modeling, animation, and video production. After becoming comfortable speaking &amp; comprehending Spanish/Portuguese, I'd love to teach or consult there eventually. 

\- Is there a demand for people with my skillset in Spain or Portugal?

\- Are teaching/research positions challenging to find?

\- Would I be able to start my own practice eventually as a foreigner?

**Language**: I am not yet fluent in either Spanish or Portuguese, but they don't intimidate me. The opportunity to immerse myself in a new language is exciting. With practice and effort, Spanish will be the easiest to learn since this is California, and my housemates are native speakers. I speak some Portuguese and have access to online courses and a pen pal who is a native of Portugal who I can practice with. When I arrive in either county, I'd like to take Es/Pt classes at a university to improve my fluency and eventually allow me to speak like an architect in the local tongue. 

\- Are there university courses specifically designed to help non-native speakers become fluent?

\- Being mindful of the difference in Spanish dialects, will the Latin-American Spanish I learn here in California help me in the Madrid region?

\- Is entering as a student (to learn the language) an option to reach resident status?

**Visa**: I'm considering the digital nomad visa. My company primarily works locally in SF and the surrounding area, so I'm still determining if I could work remotely with them, even if we are currently hybrid. I'll be teaching online courses soon, which I could pivot to someday and help me qualify. 

ANY advice on visas and the roadmap to permanent residency will be appreciated.

**Thank you kindly!!!**"

I know I need to continue improving my DSA skills, so I've been practicing on Leetcode every chance I can get and analyzing mine and other solutions to understand my blindspots. I have one internship from freshman year and have been working as a web developer the past 2 years so I think I have experience locked down somewhat? And of course a few personal projects though they're not as technically complex as they should be.

And as I (understandably) have not been able to secure any position for summer or fall I'm moving onto grad school a few hours away from where I am. I'm planning to also teach myself back-end and frameworks like React and Vue and Angular etc. What more should I be doing to make myself more employable for a FAANG or F500 job?"
116rneg,1,2023-02-19,Graduated (CS) in a foreign University in late 2019– career gap after my last internship until now. Need advice/insight on what's going on and what to do!,Valarent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/116rneg/graduated_cs_in_a_foreign_university_in_late_2019/,"I'm gonna make this quick, but this is a swift overview of my background:

* I've a Bachelor's in Computer Science with 3.34 GPA from a developing but major country in Asia– and the school was either first/second best in the country and the best private college for Computer Science. Graduated December 2019, moved back to the United States right after in February 2020.
* I have 6 months of internship experience as a Software Engineer in a large pharmaceutical/healthcare company in said foreign country. No formal experience in the US.
* Developed a travel recommendation app/algorithm using the KNN algorithm for my undergraduate research thesis, but I no longer have the source code since it's mostly a team project and confidential by my school policies.
* I've had two paid freelance projects as a web developer way back in 2020– but both websites have been taken down for me to show any proof of it. Both projects based in the US.
* Spent 6 months in China in a student exchange program (I'm not sure if this is relevant?)
* Haven't done anything Computer Science/Tech related since my last project in mid-2020 to focus on my (at the time) growing side business.
* Long story short pretty much done with that business for the moment and I've rekindled my interest in working in tech.

Aside from needing the general advice, these are my concerns/questions regarding getting a job in tech with a 3 year career gap, competing with fresh grads from 2021 and 2022. I've been out of touch with the corporate/office world for so long so I might sound very ignorant but that's why I turn here!

* Do I look for internships or full time positions? As far as I've looked, most internships only hires fresh grads or last year students.
* My future plan is to take a Master's Degree in Data Science whenever possible. So ideally I'd like my job related to Data somehow. Should I apply to mostly Data Engineer/Scientist entry positions, or do I take a general SWE/backend role and slowly transition into Data Science/ML-SWE?
* Related to the question above, I'm thinking of building 2-3 good projects for my updated resume, but I'm not sure 'what kind'. Do I focus on making good Data Science/ML projects or just general SWE projects like your typical Netflix/Instagram clone?
* Since I have little experience with DS/ML aside from my research project back in college, I'm planning to take [Kaggle's introductory course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) and [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/book/index.html) afterwards, along with daily Leetcoding as my friend and most people suggested. Since this will take a significant amount of time I'm wondering if it's worth it to focus on this one specific route or just build generic apps and get my foot in the industry as a generic SWE?
* When do I start applying? Do I start applying now with my (personally I feel) lacking resume? I'm more than happy to share my 'old' resume from 2021 through DMs!
* If so, where to apply? I've applied a ton in LinkedIn but really I've got nothing. I've around 400 connections so it's not really a 'dead' profile– but I've reached out directly to recruiters with no luck, as they just referred me to the company website if they even responded. It's really difficult since most of my connections/friends in the field are in my graduation country, but I know basically no one in the US that works in tech.
* Should I put non-CS related experience, like my side business and my current part-time job into the resume? Because frankly speaking I don't have that much experience in CS after graduating.
* On interviews, what do I say about my 3 year career gap? Last time I've had a couple phone interviews they seem really strong on pushing on the fact that I have a gap. Should I be honest about the fact that I did lose interest in the field the past three years to pursue other things?
* Does the fact that I did not graduate in the US affect my chances negatively, especially in the resume filtering process?

Again sorry if most of these questions are pretty stupid.. I don't have many friends in tech, especially in the US, so I don't know too many people to ask. I'm currently in Florida, so not really a city that has a lot of tech meetups and job fairs. I do know someone who works at FAANG but all he said to me was ""your resume is lacking"" and that's very vague. Until then he won't refer me in because frankly speaking I'm way under-qualified for the moment, which I understand 100%. I'm facing problems fresh graduates have while they look for the highly competitive entry-level positions but I've graduated 3 years ago which really puts me in a weird position."

I'm starting college next year, but I have a dilemma in terms of which major to choose.

I am 87% sure that I want to have a software engineering job. I mostly like to program applications for windows or Mac but kind of a full-stack engineer type of person. No idea, really.

As a hobby, though, I like to build things - I built AR-type glasses and currently building a self-driving trash can that can, hopefully, interact with cameras to avoid objects. I just like building devices. As a hobby, though, don't think I want to do it as a job (haven't tried it, though). I've been having problems in terms of choosing what parts I should get for my builds and seeing if they are compatible and things like that.

This makes me want to major in something like Computer Engineering (since in the college I'm most likely going to, you can't minor in it + the classes that supposedly teach you what to look at to see if parts are able to be powered and are compatible has a lot of prerequisites) but I do not want to be at a big disadvantage when it comes to getting software developer internships and jobs.

In your opinion, should I major in CompSci to be at the same level as others when applying to jobs and self-learn electronics + maybe take one or two classes for electronics, or major in Computer Engineering and get the best of both worlds since I don't even know if I want to do purely software and this gets me into both hardware and software part of engineering but putting me somewhat at a disadvantage for SE jobs?

Could I just make up for me not having a CS major with some projects + a little self-studying?"

In terms of software, I have the most experience academically / personally with C#, as well as a few other popular OOP languages. 

I would be pretty open to any position that pays fairly since I feel that I do my best when I'm learning something new, but my lack of focus on a specific job feels like it's hurting my chances and making it more difficult to actually search for positions.

So I graduated in CS this fall, and up until recently I've just been doing nothing, playing videogames, sleeping, and eating. Mostly at the nagging of my parents, I decided to go back to work part time at the place i interned at( still as an intern) while I look for a full time position.

A part of me honestly hopes I get fired so I can go back to my lifestyle of doing nothing. I feel like I haven't rested enough and don't want to go back to working, but I also think it'll just get harder to get back into the swing of things the more I stay around home and do nothing.

Fast forward 6 months , I got a job in  a data science company as an intern and he told me to develop self supervised model for their image dataset and I did that and it good kind of okay results and he told me to move on to another project , still there was no code reviews or code checks , do people in data science just blindly trust each others code , I feel managers should at least give a look through to see if we taking the correct data split or if the model is correct or if there is any data leakage.There is a lot of red flags in trusting the AUROC results blindly. Is this a norm or maybe its just for me.

Moreover most of the data scientists in the company dont even write proper documentation and for interns like me its such a pain , it took  me 2 weeks to understand their entire training repo, data science people should talk with the data engineers and take some of their methods and practices."

I just recently graduated college, and I've been applying to jobs here and there. So far, tatlo palang yung binalikan ako for interviews, I totally fumbled the first one because I was unprepared (my fault tbf), the second one went well - I went through two interviews but in the end di ako pumasa for the third round. The last one naman is with a reputable company - I just finished my initial interview and the recruiter said I've been endorsed for the next round of interview and it still depends if I pass that before I reach the third round. Here's the thing though - sabi niya baka next month pa raw ako mabalikan for the sched kasi matagal recruitment process sa kanila, etc etc and around July pa mag-uumpisa yung work should I receive an offer. Salary is great (like really great for an entry-level job) and the company culture seems good too.

Now, I'm really not sure what to do moving forward while waiting to hear back from that company. 

To cut it short - I'm earnestly hoping to land the job at this company but their process will literally make you wait for *months*. Since fresh grad palang ako and honestly lacking pa ako with work experience, should I briefly take an internship somewhere else? Or do I just wait it out and hope for the best? Lowkey I feel pressured na rin kasi to get a job because everyone else around me are employed already, but at the same time I really want to get into that company, ang tagal ko nga lang maghihintay tapos di pa sigurado if papasa. 

I know in the end the decision is still for me to make, but I would really appreciate anyone who can share their thoughts about this!"

I'm currently finishing my master's at King's College London and waiting to hear back from my **Physics PhD** applications at various US universities. I've actually already received two rejections from two Ivy League unis (not a surprise eheh) but I'm hopeful that I will get in at least one of the unis I applied to.

Problem is: I somehow got an amazing opportunity for an **internship + funding** abroad that should start in the summer and last for 3-4 months, depending on the plan they end up approving. But I graduate from my master's in July, and if I end up being accepted into a US PhD, I'll have to start around August/September from what I understand, meaning that there really isn't enough time to do it in the summer. 

Another problem is: I'm **burned out** af. I applied for PhDs because (I wanted to! and because) I was afraid of not getting decent references if I took a gap year, and thought that I had about two months in the summer to rest, but now I'm thinking that even if it wasn't for the summer Internship, those two months probably wouldn't be enough. I could do it, but it would be a bit of a stretch and I would've liked to just REST for a while and maybe **travel**, since I don't know if I'll get a chance later (... will I?) 

SO, this is to ask: do you think that if I **ask US graduate schools to please defer my PhD program by a semester (but ideally a year)** on the grounds of internship opportunity + need of a break  for mental health/performing best once I start/ ADHD/Dyslexia/etc which in theory should allow me a bit of flexibility, is it likely to be considered or rejected straight away?

I ask this because from all the regulations I found, they only mention unexpected health problems, religious or military service as appropriate grounds for deferring, but they also say they'll consider the circumstances case-by-case.

\*This is ***specific to US programs*** becasue I know that in the UK is very different, whilst in the US you are part of a cohort of students for 1-2 years and only after that period and after an exam -from what I understand - you then pick a supervisor to work with.

11742b0,225,2023-02-20,A career guide to PH corporate: Your School Matters as a Fresh Grad,BigBeard-,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/11742b0/a_career_guide_to_ph_corporate_your_school/,"Consider me as your virtual mentor. I have been working  for almost 20 years in both local and multinational companies. Became an expat before I was 30 and now working for a multinational fmcg as a senior leader. I did not graduate from the big 4, no latin honors but I am an outlier from the same graduates financial wise.

This is intended for the young, starting out, and has no direction in their careers. If youre from IT, this doesnt apply to you, you have a world diff from the rest. In this post, lets talk about your school and how it can help you land a job after graduating.

Your School and how they are seen:

A school is a production line of graduates. Some schools will have the best raw materials and churn out the best possible graduates, even their average graduates will be better than most schools because of this. 

In PH, UP Diliman is the best but only for their Suma and Magna grads (best EQ and IQ combo) the rest are above average or average but has grind and they are just like you and me, nothing especial. The rest of the UP campus grads are above average at best. 

In Ateneo, their ME is the best they got, their graduates are usually the targets of management trainee programs. Its solid but some are problematic especially those who graduate from upper class families, detached sa reality and masyadong maarte sa trabaho. 

The rest of the universities and colleges in the UAAP and NCAA + PUP are after thoughts. You will have the same level of opportunities as the rest. If you are outside these schools, the chance of getting in big companies is next to impossible but there is still a slim chance but not as a fresh grad.

Alumni Network:

You may try your luck in companies where there is a strong alumni network that support each other and look after their fresh grads. The big UAAP school are not good at this, usually its a free for all for them, UST usually sticks to their own colleges but not as tight as other networks. The best you can get this is either through a fraternity / sorority or from the NCAA schools of Letran / San Beda. They have the best alumni networks who really takes care of their juniors. Engineering colleges of schools usually are tight, they help each other after graduating.

This doesnt matter though if you dont have the credentials, they also want to preserve the opportunity to those who can make it and contribute. But make sure you get to know your upper classmen to build a network and get mentors along the way. These will open opportunities for you and give you a boost with your job hunting.

Experience beats any School:

If you have the necessary experience, you will beat any latin honor kids with no work experience. They may have the best internships but if its not a real job, you still have the advantage.

If you dont have the school pedigree, you can compensate for the work experience before you graduate. This will not be easy but there are small companies that can help you build this credibility, try to work for them before you graduate even as a part timer, so by the time you graduate, your resume shines through. 

After two years, the school you attended wouldnt matter. Its a fair game at that point and no one bats an eye if youre not from the popular schools as long as you can do the job.

Best time to apply for a job:

Do it at least 2 to 3 months before graduating and prepare 5 to 6 months before by practicing how to anwer difficult questions and developing youe elevator pitch to introduce yourself and explain your achievements. Work with a mentor to guide you how to answer questions, look for an alumnus in Linked in who is successful and ask for their time. Look for managers and up who are less than 40, they know how things work and still not too far from the reality of things. They will not say no to a junior who is as determined as you, they will be happy to be part of your success. Just try and ask. 

I hope this helps you understand the school you are in and how you can mitigate your work.

All the best. See you in the next series.

Disclaimer: this is based on my limited knowledge of the PH market with the companies I worked for and people I met along the way. Take this with a grain of salt."

How can I even land a job when only like nearly 3000 entry level jobs get posted all over Canada for CS students?

Nearly 400-200 applicants are applying for that one job position. I don't know how you can get that job in this competition; it feels like it's a rat race out there.

Most of you will say it's happening because of recession and tech layoffs, but our neighbouring country faced mass tech layoffs too, but still fresh grads there don't even have to deal with such competition that we are facing here. If you search LinkedIn, you will see they have nearly 100k entry level jobs for cs students and on average 20-100 people apply for those posts. I know our population size is smaller than them but still, they can't even fill all their job posts with their domestic applicants and here even a domestic candidate is struggling to get an entry level job."

Edit: Changed the loan amount to 50K. My primary concern seems to be the recession. Repaying such loan amounts are usually doable through interns and FTEs for CS grads, but I'm skeptical because I'll need to look for interns by Summer 24, and I'm unsure if hiring will be any better during that time due to the economic recession and hiring freezes."

1177ivx,0,2023-02-20,Making a Career Switch - Looking for Advice on Paths,Runah,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1177ivx/making_a_career_switch_looking_for_advice_on_paths/,"Hello everyone!

A little bit about me is that I graduated in 2021. I was originally studying Pharmacy but switched my Junior year after learning about the job outlooks. While I would've liked to obtain a more technical-related degree, I wouldn't have been able to graduate on time (couldn't afford more semesters) and had to settle for a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a degree in Business Information Systems and Supply Chain Management.

My first job out of university landed me a Bodyshop gig (like Revature, Dev10) to become a Scrum Master, and worked full-time for a year at a bank. While I enjoyed working with software teams, I didn't feel fulfilled in the role as I strictly worked as a Scrum Master coaching agile methodologies and had no technical work.

After being bored in the role and not challenged, I read about how lucrative software sales was and ended up accepting an offer with Salesforce earlier in October. Wow, that was a mistake, I never realized how stressful sales really was and the terrible work-life balance surrounding with it. I work 65+ hours a week and don't have the energy to try and self-study because of it. I realize it's another job where I can't continue to learn and I am now looking into getting back into technical positions and am interested in becoming a Software Engineer. After doing some research over the past couple of weeks, these are the current options I believe exist for me:

* Go back to school full-time and obtain a post-bacc in CS to be able to apply to internships and possibly have better success in landing a job. I've considered just going directly to obtaining a MS in CS (obtaining the pre-requisites as well) but am not sure how beneficial it would be without previous experience. I live in NJ so I would consider Rutgers since it is low-cost, ranked okay, and is located close to NYC and Philadelphia. If I did this full-time I would look to get a part-time job whether it is working as a bartender, server, or some gig I find online.
* Potentially accept a Data Engineering offer from another bodyshop recruiting company (such as Revature, Dev10) that would actually land me at the same bank I previously worked at. I am not sure if this is the path I would want to follow but it would allow me to get technical skills + have a better work-life balance. The WLB would give me the option to maybe even complete a post bacc or masters online part-time. The bodyshop tradeoff is that I am locked into 3 months of training at $16 an hour, then at $50K salary for a year or less if the bank buys me out. With my previous job the bank did buy me out a little bit earlier and got me $75k with negotiations so I'm sure a Data Engineer position should be able to get higher.
* Going through a recruiting company / body shop like Dev10 or Revature. I really don't want to try these because I can't choose the location I'd have to move to and I would also risk getting screwed over and maybe learning a language that isn't too beneficial. Dev10 I know is a 2-year commitment with a 50k y1 and 60k y2 rate or higher if put into an HCOL area. While I am near the NYC area, there is no confirmation I would work there even though they have locations there and I would not find out. my placement until after I sign my contract. If I did not want to move or continue with Dev10's program I would have to pay a fee of over $10,000. The same also applies to the Data Engineer position in my second bullet point.
* Going through a paid BootCamp like Hackreactor, Codesmith, Flatiron, etc. While they are shorter timeframes to be taught well, I do not like the idea of paying a lot of money to study full-time without being paid and then hoping to get a job after the program. I know they offer career support but nothing is guaranteed and I believe a CS degree can hold more weight, especially with the current state of the economy.

If you got this far I really appreciate you taking the time to help someone who is looking to change their life. For reference, I'm a first-generation Polish American and First-Generation University Graduate and at 23, I am hungry to succeed and learn. I can't really ask my parents/family for any general career advice so here I am. I plan to also reach out to university professors for their advice as well.

So, what are your thoughts?"

I have a friend who's been working hard for the past six months to learn programming after joining a coding bootcamp. He has a background in mechanical engineering but unfortunately wasn't able to find any opportunities in his field. So he decided to switch careers and study programming.

He's been working hard, learning various programming languages including React, Redux, Node JS, Mongo DB, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and building projects to improve his skills. However, now he has completed his programming bootcamp, he's been having a hard time finding his first job or internship in the field.

I've seen firsthand how passionate he is about programming and how hard he's worked to get to where he is now. That's why I'm turning to this community for help.

Do you know of any job or internship opportunities in the programming field? Or perhaps you know someone who's looking for a hardworking, dedicated programmer who's willing to learn and grow.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Let's help my friend start his programming career on the right foot.

It was great, exciting and made me feel like I made the right choice.

That was until they randomly allocated some of us into TAC. To say it is soul-sucking would be an understatement. I understand that people say that Cisco has a great WLB but that definitely does not apply to TAC.

You wake up at 5 AM, come home at 2 PM, work on cases till 9PM, have dinner, work some more, and then go to sleep.

Weekends are spent in dread of the coming week.

Plus there is the fact that I do not wish to go further into this career path (no hate for people who like this role, it's just not it for me), but all job postings I see require at least 1 year experience in dev roles which I do not have.

I wake up with this deep pit in my chest every morning and sometimes even cry in the evenings when it gets too overwhelming. I don't want to live like this.

I want to switch roles but I do not get any time to study anything else apart from TAC. I want to quit but I've been advised by everyone not to because a career gap will be hard to explain.

It has only been 7 months since I've been working in TAC, I don't want to wait until it's too late to get out.

At this point I feel helpless and don't know what to do. Please let me know if you have any advise for me. I will be eternally grateful."

Got placed as SAP ABAP developer and have been in that domain since then. Applied for MS in CS(got into university of Texas at Arlington) and will be moving to US this Fall, hoping there will be no issues in VISA process.

My main goal behind MS is to learn foundations and gain in-depth knowledge in CS and specialise in AI/ML and land a great job in this domain. Assuming that this gives me freedom to work in multiple areas of computer science.

I have 6 months till I start my course, so I can start with my basics right now. I want to make sure I get an Internship in 2024 summer to have industrial experience by the time I graduate.(Have started with This is CS50 from Harvard open ware course, in the last week of this course now)

Now my question would be, what is the best roadmap to follow to achieve this goal?

Since I am new to this domain and I don’t have anyone to guide who has experience in this domain, requesting suggestions. Would be happy to talk to, if there is someone who can guide me in my journey.

Courses, tools, methods, tips and tricks, how to find good projects for self study, groups to follow, finding like minded people. Any suggestions are welcomed.

Thank you all in advance for your time. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best."

I’m also planning to take 3 APs - phy C mech, CalC BC and CSA. 

My ecs are - an internship, a mentored research, an independent research, founded the school’s coding club, school body president, a few projects on GitHub, building a website from scratch and will be attending a math camp and hopefully I get into Girls who code summer immersion program. I’m also contemplating whether or not I should go for an in person summer program for CS

What kind of universities do you think are in my reach and most importantly- HOW CAN I IMPROVE TO GET INTO A T20 or T50?

Then, they asked me questions about how I would approach the internship position. 

All in all, the panel members were incredibly polite and patient. I definitely bombed the interview, but the team members were extremely professional and didn’t make me feel stupid.

I graduated with a MA in Counseling Psychology in CA. My program was designed to meet the criteria for licensure as an MFT.  I was an MFT intern for a few years before pausing to raise my kids. 

Well it’s been 15 years, 3 kids, and one move to Michigan. Here’s the facts:

1. Not a lot of MFTs here! Most therapists are psychologists, LCSW or LPC.

2. Due to some slight differences in CA and MI licensing, my CA practicum hours do not meet the requirement to become a MI LLMFT. Boo. 

3. LARA has directed me to seek out a post-grad certificate program. I’m willing to do this, but I’m thinking maybe this is an opportunity to switch my licensing path? I’m confused about how this works. EMU has a post grad cert in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, but requires a CACREP accredited MA, which mine is not. 

Sigh. Any guidance to offer? Any Michigan MFTs or exMFTs? I’m hoping to figure out the most painless path to my own small private practice. 

Thank you 😊"

As a result I've been suffering from a pretty bad burn out. Nonetheless, computer science is my passion and I research a whole host of topics in the little spare time I have. I learn about deep learning or cryptography, one day I implement a hyper-optimized VP-tree, the other I work on writing a simple CPU in Verilog. I love this stuff and not even being exhausted with work can dull my interest.

I was thinking that maybe if the stars aligned perfectly, I could apply for a PhD, secure a juicy grant so that the salary downgrade wouldn't be too extreme and be able to research the stuff that interests me all day every day, as long as I pump out a paper every now and then.

My situation is distinct from most other threads about PhDs here in the sense that I already have secured a great job and have industry experience and wish to do PhD for personal rather than career reasons.

Dear Hiring Managers,

I am a 3rd year engineering student with a passion for coding, specifically in the fields of node.js and express.js. I have acquired good knowledge in cloud services, particularly in AWS. As an enthusiastic learner, I am always willing to learn new things and strive for excellence.

I am writing to express my interest in obtaining an internship in your company. I am excited to work in a company atmosphere and gain practical experience in my field. I believe that an internship in your organization would be an excellent opportunity for me to develop my skills, learn from experts, and contribute to the growth of your company.

During my academic journey, I have been exposed to various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I have also been actively involved in extracurricular activities, including coding competitions and hackathons, which have helped me sharpen my coding and problem-solving skills."

But I'm gonna give it a shot anyway 🙂.
So, I will start with some context. About six months ago, I joined my current job after an internship period (as part of my masters program). It is practically my first experience in the industry (I did a masters to specialize in what I'm doing right now). Anyway, things are going pretty well, and I believe that I'm doing some pretty good job especially considering my level of experience. However, I'm not feeling super comfortable with I'm doing because of mainly three reasons:
- I don't feel that I'm getting paid enough (my salary is slightly above the average of what my peers in other companies are getting, but that's on me since I didn't negotiate the offer at the first place).
- I feel that I would be more performant in a ""more international environment"" (I'm a foreigner who moved here recently, and I sometimes find myself unconfident between my coworkers who are mainly locals).
- The way the work is done isn't very efficient (yet, this isn't an issue specific to my company. It's how most of the companies in my industry are doing things, which brings me to my next and core point).

There's this startup that is ""revolutionizing"" the industry (at least that how I, and they, see it). And I have been wanting to join it for months, so when they had an opening I directly applied. I had the first interview with the hiring manager that went great. I was fascinated by their culture and she was confident that I could be a good fit for the position. Then, I did a case study and had an interview with the team leader, that I thought I went good. However, to my surprise, 2 days later, they called me to tell me that they decided to go with another candidate. When I asked about feedback for my application, they told me that I didn't do as well as expected in the case study. That was surprising to me because, when I presented my work to the team leader, I didn't get any negative feedback for it, quite the opposite actually. It was very frustrating, not because of the rejection on it self, but more because, the judged that I wasn't competent enough for the job.. So I'm not sure if I would have the confidence to apply for another job in the same company in the future..

It may seem that I'm overreacting to a rather common situation (being rejected for a job). It may seem that the reason of my big disappointment is a lack of ""professional maturity"". But for me, this opportunity was my chance to work on a project I'm passionate about, and being passed out made me feel stuck (since, to my knowledge, no other organizations is similar to the one I applied for). Plus, the fact that I was seen as ""not good enough"" just make it worst (I believe I would have been ok with being rejected for any other reason). I'm not usually an emotional person, but since I got that call more than a week ago, I failed to move forward and to get over it..

Many thanks to those who read my post to this point!"

My friends live a bit far from me, and I'm one of those who don't look for help. 

I just found out my ex was cheating on me and is now with the girl he cheated on me with. And she works at the same company we do! And was his intern. He lied A LOT about it, talked to her about me. 

He was very mean and shitty, and I'm heartbroken. I dont know how to get back at my feet. 

We were living together, but he's been with her for months. I need more money monthly and friends. I was getting back on my feet about cooking and eating properly but now I'm worst than before. 

I never post anything and english is a second language, I really need to vent about this, sorry if this is weird 

TLDR i was cheated and he's now dating her"

My main choice of major is CS. Here are a few questions.

\- BIGGEST QUESTION: How easy is it to get into CS? The website says that the minimum requirements are Cs in Calc 1 and 2 as well as intro to CS, Data Structures, and intro to Discrete Structures. I don't truly believe that these will cut it, since many times colleges underscore the admission requirements of majors. Additionally, my other choice, if not Rutgers, is Purdue, and hope to transfer to CS if I am to go there. Their requirements are As in both their intro to CS class and Calc 1 along with a minimum 3.5 GPA. Is getting into CS easier at Rutgers or Purdue?

&amp;#x200B;

\- How tough are the CS courses at Rutgers? I have an extensive CS background (for a high schooler) through various internships regarding data science, and machine learning, along with projects in App development. Will these skills be useful in class?

&amp;#x200B;

\- How is the food on campus, and are there necessary accommodations for those who are vegetarian?

&amp;#x200B;

\- How safe is the campus?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there things to do outside of campus, or is Rutgers generally campus-centric?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is it easy to get housing on campus, and will I be guaranteed housing for all 4 years?

&amp;#x200B;

\- is Rutgers heavy on Greek life?

&amp;#x200B;

\- How is the party scene on campus, and do I need to be in a frat to join one?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Will I be able to get CS internships while I am at Rutgers and will my advisor or Rutgers staff help me with my application and getting selected for it?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Are there Co-Op programs

&amp;#x200B;

\- for people who have studied abroad, what is it like?

I started my journey as a web development intern for six months, based on a project I did in college. However, I transitioned towards data science due to my keen interest in the field, and worked as a data analyst in a company for four months. Unfortunately, I had to leave that job due to relocation issues, but I was fortunate enough to find a new opportunity as an MIS analyst at Swiggy. I completed a six-month contract there, gaining experience in different industries and working with various tech stacks. While those jobs weren't particularly technical, I did gain knowledge in Excel, spreadsheets, HTML, Snowflake, and CSS. Since January, I've been seeking employment and have gained intermediate proficiency in Python, Postgres SQL, and Tableau. I'm also familiar with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. However, the job opportunities I've come across lately haven't been technical or aligned with my programming interests, such as Python programming, machine learning, and SQL. I'm looking for some suggestions to improve my skills or gain new ones that would help me land a proper tech job. Thank you in advance for your help!"

I am from a tier 3 collage who might just get an internship at a product based startup. The initial intern stipend is around 25k and after an year of intership once my degree is completed (I am still in my 6th semester), i will get a PPO of 10-13 lakhs CTC.
The role is a of a backend developer.

Now I am not sure if I should just take this now, or try for some other companies with better packages. I know the market these days is not the most welcoming for freshers and getting an year long internship would also be a great for my resume as well. But I am hesitant because I have been doing quite a lot of DSA and CP these days, and I feel like I should be able to do much better. Secondly my cse specialization is from Ml/AI so if I do take this one, I don't think I will have enough time to invest in it for a while.

There is also the fact that the reason I picked this role was because ultimately I want to become a ML engineer, and one of my professors said that an ML engineer must also have a good knowledge on backend system designs. So I think this role will fit perfectly with my final goal of being an ML engineer.



I need some guidance as to what should I be do?

Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it."

I'm considering if I need a BS to continue career progression and be a competitive candidate for better paying jobs.

I am from CA and I am in my 11th year of school. By the time I graduate, I will have my AS-T in CS, Math, and Physics. Thus, I should be able to graduate college in 1.5 years (taking summer courses). I was debating graduating HS early but I decided not to and instead graduate college early (to enhance my ECs and maximize my chances of being accepted to a good University of California school, such as UC Berkeley). Because I will graduate college early, I will only have one summer to get an internship and hopefully get a return offer.  


Is graduating from university a good idea? I plan to spend my senior year of HS making projects in JS and React and studying LeetCode (I only learned Java / C++ / Python in my CC classes, not JS), because I will have a light senior course load. Would I be better off graduating university in four years? Thanks!"

USC Supps were very good and one of the best essays I wrote this entire college round (I reused and recycled one of the essays here for a lot of other colleges)

I have a bunch of on-campus positions. I have had like 3 event coordinator positions and I’ve found that I enjoy them, despite how challenging they can be at times. So, I decided to look for some event coordinator/planner internships for the summer…but my degree has nothing to do with event coordination obviously. 

I honestly don’t even know why I chose cog sci. I barely enjoy my classes. I thought I was interested in a career in UX, but I don’t have any experience or skills (other than maybe copywriting) that are relevant to the industry. I’m scared I made the wrong choice. I can’t really change my mind tho bc my school requires u to declare a major by the end of sophomore year so…I’m kind of stuck. Am I screwed?"

Let me tell you about myself first. I discontinued in my 8th semester(B.E) in college. I take nearly two years gap before rejoining college to finish my degree. 

In the 2 years gap, I got interested in python and study for nearly 4 to 5 months. But soon my interest fades away. But because of this, I get a pretty good grasp of a basic understanding of programming. 

So at the end of college, I got interested in Web Development and studied for 4 to 4 &amp; half months for HTML, CSS, and JS. I got pressure from my home (mostly my brother) to apply for a job as soon as possible. 

I apply for a bunch of jobs on an online platform and attended a couple of interviews. Lastly, I got a job as an intern in a small startup with a stipend of 3k per month. After the 3months, I accept a job for 10k as a Front End Developer. 

The location is work from home. I still don't get the Provisional Certificate (The certificate that proves that you passed all the exams in college - It will be issued before the degree certificate.) why you ask, maybe because I debar from college and had to rejoin the college to finish the degree. 

Work is mostly about creating a front part of a website with HTML, CSS, and JS. I didn't get to work with React.js, even though I know it.  (I think they are using my designs to show the clients as a model).

And I am also started to work on youtube shorts (To showcase my skills to my future employer, just started on 17th Feb). And working on full projects to post as a normal video. 

I saw some job offers for 10lpa with 3 to 5 years of experience. So I thought it was ok based on my situation because I have some education gap.

But I saw some of the people complaining about 8lacks per annual for freshers and a 15k per month stipend for interns. 

So I am wondering if I can work until 6 months or 1 year.

Or can I start looking for another job with better pay?"

I believe my profile is not the best, as I lack undergraduate education in CS or math (however I taught myself to code).

I have shortlisted some universities which I think i have some chance of getting into (deadlines are far away) because they explicitly say they welcome non-CS majors.  Somebody advised me to focus on Universities on the West coast only, as it will be easier to get internships and jobs as the West Coast is a tech hub. But when I checked out these universities, I am getting a feeling that they need a strong profile.

The Universities I had shortlisted earlier are spread all over the US, like the East and the interior of the US. I tried to choose the best university possible, without being too ambitious.

I'm confused. Should I apply to the Universities I think I have some chance of getting into or listen to my friend and focus on applying to Universities on the West Coast only? if I get an admit in a University which is far away from the West Coast, will it be harder to find internships/jobs?

I would appreciate any advice. Apologies if this is a stupid question, but I am new to grad school applications."

1188cgw,1,2023-02-21,Fresh grad and co-workers at new workplace are socializing too much.,Naws_mchz9,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1188cgw/fresh_grad_and_coworkers_at_new_workplace_are/,"First sorry that English is not my first language. I am a new graduate and started working 2 weeks ago. I work in a tech company. My co-workers are not toxic, not cold and friendly. Actually they are TOO friendly. They are OBSESSED with being around each other. I am talking about not leaving after 6 pm, keep chit-chatting for a very long time, sometimes making me the first leaving the office. They are at office but not working. Some even invite lots of co-workers to their own house at weekends. I don’t really believe co-workers can become ‘real’ friends so all of these are quite crazy to me. I don't really understanding choosing to more spend time with your co-worker than your family, friends or even yourself.  
To make things worse, many topics are about going to the gym/working out, no matter men or women. Like they are planning to become olympic champions or something. There are guys putting a gigantic bottle of whey powder on their work desk. I can’t do heavy sports because of I am born with a problem in my hip so definitely I can’t go to gym with them. I actually got invited yesterday and I don’t know what to do. Turning it down is not hard but I can’t stop thinking about it when, like 70-80% of my co-worker (at least in my team) are going to the gym together after work.  
My boss will come back from another country next week, and yesterday I heard that they are planning to rent a badminton court or whatever at weekend and my boss will possibly show up. I am worrying that turning it down won’t probably be the best choice, but I also don’t want to waste my precious weekend sitting on the side of a badminton court all day.  
I kind of miss the workplace at my internship company where people only have smalltalk during lunch break, and just grab their bag and LEAVE after it hits 6pm. No contact after work whatsoever.  
I know my job is not something that requires excellent socialise skills. I will work hard to become professional at work. The only hope I have is that (choosing to) not meeting them after work won’t hurt my career. But right now this is bugging me. I was considering asking my workplace mentor but later I think he 99.99% will reply “It’s okay””That doesn’t matter”. Am I overthinking or always tend to think other people are bad? Maybe you all could give some opinion. Thanks so much."

118bdxu,8,2023-02-21,Accepting internship offer only to reject it,Awkward-Abalone732,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/118bdxu/accepting_internship_offer_only_to_reject_it/,"Hello, I was recently able to secure an internship for the summer. The team I met with is great and it’s in the field I want, however, the relocation of it would be a little bit of a hassle. They gave me until this week to let them know of my decision and I was wondering if I should accept it even though there’s no guarantee that I would be able to do it plus I’m still waiting on other offers. There’s no guarantee I’ll get another offer for the summer, so I have some hesitation on declining this one since I don’t want to be empty handed. 

Long story short, would it be totally bad to accept this offer and possibly back out later on as we get closer to May? Keep in mind, I don’t plan to work at this company in the future so I wouldn’t mind burning the bridge if that makes sense. 

Thank you. Any help is appreciated."

I’m taking 2110 now to get better at coding, and it’s just so different from my other experiences that I’m quite not sure where I am. I’ve read that people gain enough knowledge to get SWE intern roles from 2110 alone. Is this actually true? I don’t plan to get into SWE myself but it seems incredible that you could learn so much after just a 2000-level class. Is this an exaggeration or is Cornell’s program just that strong? I feel like I still don’t really know much lol."
118czh1,1,2023-02-21,Recent graduate with double degrees (Statistics/History) can't find a start,BeefNChed,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/118czh1/recent_graduate_with_double_degrees/,"Hi everyone. hoping to get some advice on my situation as I've pretty much been hitting my head against a wall since I graduated in August. I've applied for 300+ jobs, had a few interviews but still can't get anything going. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first degree was in Stats, and as I filled out my electives with mostly History classes, I was able to get it as a second major. Then I found out I was could get History as a full degree with a summer semester. My lease was through August and figured better do it now than if I ever wanted to come back to it, and got it done. So I graduated in August, and have been applying for data jobs, but have had very little luck. Seems like entry level data analysis jobs have cooled off with worries about a recession. 

&amp;#x200B;

My stats background, I can code, analyze, and wrangle data. Good with R, Python, SAS, jmp, and very good with Excel. I think my problem comes from being 25 with no career experience. I wasn't able to get an internship because COVID, I just kept working where I was as an ""essential worker"" and I never really developed a relationship with any of my professors or cohorts since everything was online. 

&amp;#x200B;

My history degree rounded me out a lot. Good communication, research, and critical thinking skills. I can write fairly well too. Have a 25 page capstone on environmental history that did fairly well. I never really planned on using history as a career, as I figured stats is where the money is, just something to sell myself with. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any ideas on Stats related jobs I should be looking out for that would be good too, but the main point of my post is trying to find something I can start in with my history degree. I really just want to find something at this point and opening up to the side of jobs that might use my history degree. I'd really like to work remotely as I'm trying to relocate, but also if I can just relocate that would be fine too. I'm not looking for history teaching jobs, but something where I can use the kind of  skills from my history degree to get a job. I know government work, but have no idea what I should really be looking for in this regard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really plan to be looking for jobs with my history degree as the main focus and using stats as a technical selling point instead of the other way around but at this point I'm open to anything. Any advice is appreciated!"
118dtko,0,2023-02-21,Questions for Trinity Graduates,anathemaaah,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/118dtko/questions_for_trinity_graduates/,"If anyone who has done computer science at trinity, answer the following questions, I would really appreciate it. I have checked through all the posts regarding DCU vs UCD vs Trinity, etc., so it would be helpful if anyone can answer these questions.

1. Did people often get burnt out from the workload? How do the staff deal with this?
2. Does the theoretical nature of the course make it difficult to find jobs afterwards? I get the idea that other courses are more practical, however I also read that you have to grind leetcode and have a GitHub anyway for jobs, so my understanding of computer science degrees was that it would be a few letters on a CV to get you through the screening process of jobs.
3. How does the staff in the course manage those with disabilities? Are they understanding with assignments and reasonable accommodations, if approved by the disability service, and provide extended deadlines if needed under reasonable circumstance?
4. I saw that assembly seems to be a massive part of the course, as well as other parts which seem to be inapplicable to most jobs - would you say that these modules provided useful as background knowledge, or did you think that these modules were utterly useless? If they were useless, would you say that the use(ful/less)ness would be similar in most courses, anyway?
5. Do you think that a more theoretical background or a practical background is preferable when tools and practices in software eng / computer science seem to change so much? Of course, practical is best starting off, but when the tools become outdated, does the theoretical aspect make it easier to 'pick up' new tools?
6. How was getting summer internships? I am aware that there is no internship for just a BA, but you can do it by saying you will do the masters and then dropping out, but I am not sure if I want to go this route. Did the summer internships provide enough work experience for getting a job?
7. Is the mathematics manageable? I am not struggling with mathematics at the minute, but I am worried that in computer science they might move too fast and it may be more difficult. Is this an issue, or would just putting the head down and studying make it possible to get good grades, despite not being a maths whizz?
8. Did you enjoy your time at Trinity computer science, course-wise?

Thank you for your time."
118ecs5,4,2023-02-21,Uruguayan Who Torrented While Briefly in Germany,BastardvonNightsong,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/118ecs5/uruguayan_who_torrented_while_briefly_in_germany/,"Hello, I am a Uruguay citizen who was in Germany for 2 months in September/October of last year for an internship. Regrettably, I torrented a TV show over the home WiFi network of the apartment I was staying in (I didn't really know that it's so illegal here). Anyways my landlord got a letter from a law firm saying he has to pay some 1000 euros for uploading copyrighted material. My landlord contacted me and of course I confessed that it was indeed me. But I can't really afford the fine and on finding out on how predatory and scam-like this law firm is, I don't want to pay them.

I've been reading a lot on this matter and there seems to be precedence that if he tells them that it wasn't him who downloaded the material and me, and gave them my contact, he would no longer be liable and they would leave him alone and shift their focus on me. But of course, I am now back in Uruguay and they have no way of pursuing me here legally.

So would this make them leave us both alone? Or would they tell him that he has to pay it because I left the country?"
118ep1q,69,2023-02-21,TIFU: By lying for the past 4 years to my parents about going to university.,Mobile-Routine-6637,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/118ep1q/tifu_by_lying_for_the_past_4_years_to_my_parents/," I (22m) have been stuck in this never ending cycle of a series of lies for the past 4 years. Some background my parents immigrated here for the Soviet Union and have always been super hard on me about grades and athletics. In high school I was a pretty average student finishing with a 3.1 gpa but I was super good with numbers and math in general. But every minute and existence of high school  was horrible. I had friends and wasn’t bullied but that learning aspect and homework always was bad.  Obviously the pressure to go to college was huge from my parents and wasn’t really a choice thing so I apply to go to a D1 school. 

Fast forward I got accepted and graduated high school so I was off to university. Everyone in my family and friends was so happy proud and of me. Everyone except for me.  I was sad, scared, and anxious to know I have to spend the next 4 years of my life wasting away in a school to get a piece of paper that didn’t need.  Two weeks before I leave I jokingly tell my dad that one if my buddies decided not to go to school and just start working to gauge his reaction. He processed to tell me that my friend is a complete joke and disappointment and that I should not hang out with him anymore. (This wasn't even a real thing I just wanted to imagine how he would react to me if I did this.)

Now school began and just as I imagined it was bad. I hated going to class, I hated doing pointless assignments and my motivation and mental health were never lower. I've always wanted to be a stock broker and eventually a investment banker and I spent all my free time doing research on everything I could know about these two things. As mentioned before my brain works in numbers and I couldn't justify spending all this time, money, and stress on something I hated. I knew I wanted to drop out 2 months into my freshman year. So I started looking for jobs in those fields. I landed a few interviews within a few weeks and got a offer to work a brokerage firm where they could sponsor me to qualify to take my exams to become a stock broker. First time in my life I truly felt proud of myself and felt like this was the first step to working towards my dreams.

I told my parents the news and they were not very happy. They asked if I planned to work there after graduating and I said I wanted to start now. They laughed and said if I took the job before finishing school I would never return back to their lives. I was heart broken that my parents chose their dreams for me over mine own dreams. I return back to school with my head held low and crying in my bed not wanting to lose the little family I had. But knowing I was going to be miserable for 3 and a half more years.

Fast forward to the end of my first semester and I'm at a new all time low. Just going to class, home, gym , sleep and repeat. I couldn't take it anymore and was crying myself to sleep ever night when the manager of the investment firm called me and asked if I wanted to start my sponsorship. I explained my situation telling him as soon as I am done with school if the offer was still there I would love to come work. He laughed and said that a long time and offered me a ultimatum. He offered me a $15,000 signing bonus if I dropped out right now and came to work for him. He said that gives you everything you want to start your journey to your goals. I don't know what went through me and without even a second thought I agreed and the next day I dropped out packed my bags and left campus.

To say I wasn't scared was a understatement, but it was a excited scared, a pumped scared, and I walked in on my first day with a big smile on my face. Everyone is great, charismatic, and outgoing. My type of crowd. I work 70 hour weeks and I never got bored or tired of it. I woke every morning excited for another day. I have never felt like this in my life. My mood was so good my friends were convinced I was on taking mood boosters. I finally told my best friend about what happened and he hit me with something I completely forgot about during this time, my parents....

My parents during this time are still under the impression I'm in school and learning. I started to lie to them from this point on. A few months go by and I become the top sponsored prospect in the firm and get a 100k job offer once I get my brokers license. My parents had no idea.

Fast forward 6 months and I passed my exams and was officially a stock broker. I was so over come with joy but I had to celebrate that alone. I couldn't tell anyone with fear it would reach my parents and my lie would spill out. But I didn't care, I was making more money then people with master degrees while enjoying life. I continued to lie for the next year about this and during summer months told my parents I got a internship so I couldn't come home for ""break"". I never felt one bit of remorse for this lie. I didn't care how it would affect me down the line.

Fast forward 3 years and I'm still FUCKING LYING. They still think I'm in my last year of school getting ready to graduate with my bachelors when in actuality I'm the youngest junior brokers in firms history making 140k a year to crunch numbers. (shits so fucking easy) Now its February when I write this and I'm supposed to graduate in May of this year and I don't know what to do. My mom is planning a giant graduation party, my family from over seas is flying in to see my graduation, and everyone is calling me telling me how proud they are. I'm stuck now, I'm fucked, everyone is going to know I'm a liar, everyone is going to know the truth. I don't know what to do. I was thinking about going no contact for a year or 2 but I can't kill my mother like that being I am a only child and the light of her world. But am going to kill her anyways when she finds out the truth. I'm stuck guys, I have never been happier in life and everything is going great besides this one thing. Any ideas for what I should do? More than welcome to call me whatever you want but I kind of need advise more the insults but hey its reddit you guys do you. Thanks for hearing my story, I will update you all with what I do once the time comes around.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have been lying to my parents and family about going to university and they are about to all find out."
118fi9k,4,2023-02-21,"Neurodivergent and struggling to land an internship, seeking advice",RGuy98,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/118fi9k/neurodivergent_and_struggling_to_land_an/,"I've been studying CS for three years - got an associate's, working on a bachelor's. Started at the beginning of the pandemic, was forced to do online learning even after things reopened due to moving.

I was never really able to network because my college didn't really have the right resources to help, especially online and during a pandemic. I was dealing with mental health issues as the pandemic was not the kindest to me. Plus nobody really told me I needed a strong portfolio and 10 years of experience to land an internship, which I learned the hard way while finishing my associate's.

As a neurodivergent CS student still working on improving their mental health, how can I best turn my luck around in the next few years? I do great in my classes - it's just applying my knowledge in a more practical manner and building a network that I struggle with. I also have yet to get my driver's license due to personal reasons, which limits my opportunities.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, especially if anyone can point me towards potential networking opportunities."

I'm currently a high school senior from Seattle and I have a strong foundation in computer science. I'm interested in finding a summer internship opportunity that would allow me to build on my knowledge and gain valuable real-world experience.

However, I'm not sure if there are a lot of internships out there for rising college freshmen. There's one from Microsoft called the Discovery Program which I'll apply for but it's very competitive and I'm not sure I'll be accepted. Are there any other programs or internships for the summer targeted toward my age group that you guys know of?

Will be switching up in a few months if a better opportunity arrives.

I did search on LinkedIn and found most of the companies asking for senior position, at last the learning and experiences that I have gained could land me just a junior position, so wanted to know a few better companies for a learning .NET dev. Thanks."

118max4,1,2023-02-21,New Grad: Tesla vs TikTok,connyoocla,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/118max4/new_grad_tesla_vs_tiktok/,"Hi everyone,

Could really use some advice here. I'm an incoming new grad graduating Spring 2023. I have been a SWE intern at Tesla in an internal tools team for the last year or so, and am thinking about accepting a TikTok SWE offer for their E-commerce team.

I love the team at Tesla and see a path towards working on some AI (not self-driving) tools, which I think would be awesome. Additionally, TikTok RSU's are paper money and I have seem some horror stories in terms of wlb, micro-management, etc. but I don't know anyone at the company personally so I am unsure what to think. On the other hand, they do give free lunch/dinner and have a really awesome office, while Tesla has free black coffee lol.

In terms of fields, the role at Tesla would be more backend, while at TikTok I would be working more on frontend/mobile, with the opportunity to transition to full stack at both companies eventually.

Location and remote work wise,  Tesla would be 4-5 days/week in office at Fremont, Seattle, or Austin, while TikTok is 2 days/week in office in San Jose.

Comp (in USD):

* Tesla - $194k TC, more equity-heavy
* TikTok - $206k TC, more cash-heavy

Any insight at all would be appreciated!!

Hope you all are doing great.   
I will be appearing in interview for Data Science Intern/Full-time (Later) roles. I wanted to ask what all resources you referred while preparing for the same? I understand companies sometimes use Data Analyst, Data Science Engineer, Data Engineer etc names interchangeably.   
I had recently appeared for CVS Health Intern interview, and tbh it didn't go good. I had applied for analytics positions and in coding round only Pandas was asked. The interviewer told me it was understood that Pandas will be asked, but wtf in job description Python was written I thought it will be just normal Python questions.   


Anyway, now I understood, I need to have pandas on my toes and MySQL, Is there anything else? Which resources to refer? There is abundance of material in online platform and it's confusing me.   


Please help!!"
118pgey,2,2023-02-22,Regret playing the status game - any advice?,Wide_Razzmatazz1550,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/118pgey/regret_playing_the_status_game_any_advice/,"I regret majoring in the major I had chosen just because of the prestige of the school. Everyday I keep telling myself my life would've been so much better if I had majored in Computer Science at a lower ranked university rather than taking the bait for a joint major called ""Mathematics-Computer Science"" that's really mostly math. Honestly, all I want to do is work from home and not be stressed. I thought the major looking like a double major (even though it's really just one major) would catch some eyes, but now I'm having second thoughts.

This is the exact opposite of what I'd imagined I'd be doing, I'm killing myself by bending over to do math problems all the time. At the same time, I notice how much easier my cs courses are and it just makes me feel so regretful for picking status over passion. I feel like this math is hindering my dream of working from home in a low stress environment, since I feel like I have less time for internships and job prep due to all of these fucking math classes that I'm taking and that I'm probably going to forget once I graduate. 

I just keep thinking back to myself why I made the choice in the first place, and I think it alongside the double major idea it was literally just because I wanted to be at a ""prestigious"" school, whatever the fuck that means. When I apply for jobs I'm literally going to have a bunch of esoteric math theorems in my brain and at best about 1/2 the knowledge that a pure CS major would have. Like, it doesn't even matter for shit that my current school is ""better"" than the one I could've chose pure CS for, what matters is the knowledge of CS concepts for interview, which I'm going to have jack shit of when I graduate. Plus the fact that some of my general education requirements won't transfer if I transfer schools so I'll likely end up taking much more classes and delaying graduation even more.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Honestly my ultimate goal is to work from home in a low stress job. I just got spooked after realizing the lack of career opportunities in pure math, which is really what my major is mostly about. I still remember the story someone told about pure maths job opportunities. It goes like this: 

&gt; Once upon a time, there was a person who studied dragons and how to kill them for their entire life, and went on to a dragon slaying college. They met up with the greatest dragon slayers of all time, and graduated with honors from that college. Out in the real world, this person was struggling to find a job slaying dragons. There were no dragons around! so he asked his teacher to give them advice.

&gt; The teacher said, ""teach others how to slay dragons""

That's what I feel like I'm gonna be. A middle-aged teacher in the most socially accepted pyramid scheme teaching glorified toddlers and getting sick every month. I do NOT want to be that person."

The following post is based on my personal opinion which others may or may not disagree with.

&amp;#x200B;

**If I want to study Business, which Uni should I choose? NUS? SMU? NTU?**

Each Uni has its own pros and cons and you should balance them accordingly. I will go about this post by highlighting some key areas of consideration and see which Uni comes up on top.

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-Uni Prospects: SMU &gt;= NUS = NTU**

Among the 3 Unis, I would say that SMU Biz students are the most well-trained and prepared to move into the workforce. This is largely due to their seminar-style lectures, tons of group projects, lots of presentations, and CCA focused culture etc. By and large, I do think that the average SMU student carry themselves better as compared to NTU and NUS. This is also apparent in the GES survey where SMU student do have a higher starting pay than NUS and NTU students.

If you're looking at the top 10-15% (or if you deem yourself to be the top) of the cohort e.g. potential Bankers/Consultants, I would say all 3 Universities are equally competitive. There are bright students from all 3 unis that made it to high finance/consulting. From my experience, I see more NUS and SMU students securing branded internship as compared to NTU but this may be due to my skewed social circle as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grades: NUS &gt;&gt; NTU &gt; SMU**

SMU Biz has a significant flaw in their their grading system. SMU has a GPA out of 4, while NUS/NTU has a GPA out of 5. In NUS, getting straight B+ will give you a second upper class. However in SMU, getting straight B+, will give you a High Merit (or Cum Laude), which is a 3rd Class (Cum laude is 2nd lower class) grade equivalent. Hence, despite getting the same B+ as an SMU student, your graduation class is lower than that of  NUS/NTU student. I think that SMU students do lose out on this. One might argue that an A+ in SMU gives you a 4.3/4 which pulls up your GPA, but from what I heard, SMU can be stingy in giving out A and A+ to students (they usually hard cap the number of A+/A that they give out), and you need to be really capable/smart/have good group mates to do so.  If you really look at the grading system of NUS/NTU vs SMU, I feel SMU is rather unfair because the B+ grade which contributes 3.3/4.0 (assuming that its the average module grade), sits just outside of the Cum Laude (second lower equivalent) range 3.4. Hence in order to get a Cum Laude, you NEED to have B+ and above grades to average up. SMU is tougher on the average student, while NUS/NTU is slightly easier.

My sensing is that it is comparatively easier to get A-/A in NUS/NTU than SMU.  Additionally, SMU does not really have a S/U system that NUS/NTU have. The S/U system is a system when you do badly for a module, you can ensure that it doesn't count towards you GPA and waive the bad grade. NUS is much more liberal, where you can S/U i.e. waive up to 8 modules (5 modules in Y1, and 3 for your Y2-4), which is pretty crazy as you can essentially waive the grades for your entire Year 1. Whereas for SMU, you have to stay focused throughout your 4 years without slipping up at all.

NTU is kinda in the middle; You S/U the module BEFORE you see the grades, so sometimes the waiver is really a wild card as you don't know what grade you are actually waiving. Additionally for NTU, you cannot S/U core mods, while in NUS you can S/U core mods (e.g. Intro to marketing, intro to Biz Law, Intro to Accounting etc). So that means in NTU, there are really only a handful of modules you can waive.

&amp;#x200B;

**CCAs: SMU = NUS &gt; NTU**

For CCAs, specifically, Finance related CCAs, SMU has a much greater variety as compared to NUS. SMU is comparatively a little bit more ""CCA-oriented"" in the sense that there are numerous CCAs and that you can start your own CCAs as well. The top/popular CCAs in SMU/NUS/NTU are all rigorous and challenging and do help you develop your skillsets (they are all very competitive to get into). From what I know, NTU has lesser Finance related CCAs comparatively compared to the other two.

&amp;#x200B;

**Accommodation + Social Life: NUS = NTU &gt;&gt; SMU**

NUS and NTU come up on top with regards to accommodation/social life because you are able to live on campus. SMU has little to no campus life, and generally the students who stay on SMU campus are exchange/international students.

Social life/Friend-making in NUS and NTU is much much higher where you tend to meet new people from Biz AND other faculties which do go a long way in finding group project/intern mates/ network etc. In SMU, most of the friends/network that you make comes from your groupmates and/or CCAs. Additionally in SMU, the friends you'll generally tend to make are fellow Biz students. This is compared to NUS and NTU, where the friends you make can and often come from more diverse majors. Essentially, more variety of friends in NUS/NTU compared to SMU.

A lot of people have concerns having ""snakes"" in business school, but I feel that those stereotypes are not very true. Generally business school people are nice and decent wherever you go. Your reputation truly precedes you. More often times than not, everyone know everyone, so if a ""snake"" does something bad, generally there will be some rumors/hearsay about it and you would know who to avoid.

&amp;#x200B;

**Academics : NUS = SMU &gt; NTU**

NTU's business program is 3 years, compared to NUS/SMU which is 4 years. This is both a good and bad thing for NTU students, where you get to graduate faster, but you have a shorter runway to build your portfolio/up skill yourself. I personally feel that graduating faster is a downside, in the sense where you only get to do 2 summer internships, as compared to the traditional 3 summer internships for NUS/SMU (assuming you even get an internship in Year 1). As an Year 1student, you likely wouldn't get an internship as a Year 1, and when you're a NTU Y2 student, you are considered a ""penultimate year"" student with no prior internship experience competing with Y3 NUS/SMU students with prior summer internship experience. However this NTU situation can be somewhat resolved by taking a Leave of Absence (LOA) from school to do a 6M internship. However, not all students are keen to extend their graduation date.

Given that NTU course is 3 years long, the Modules are more content heavy (more packed) which means more time studying and less time applying for internship/time with friends and CCAs/self-development.

Another factor to consider is that NUS and NTU have more diverse courses i.e. non-business courses. So you can do a life science minor, history minor along with you business degree. In my personal observation, I see NUS student straddling the digital divide better, where there are more Biz-Analytics, Biz-Information Systems, Biz-Coding kind of skill sets. Whereas NTU/SMU (NTU more so than SMU), students tend to focus on their normal Biz degree in the relevant specialization. In NUS at least, Biz-Analytics major has become increasingly more common and competitive.

True to what you have heard, SMU is indeed more participative and presentation focused etc. People do ""fight"" for class part like what you imagine. This is contrary to NUS (and NTU but I cannot confirm) where class participation is definitely more chill. In fact, there are people who do not class part (minimal class part) at all. All 3 Universities have similar levels of group projects to be done. 

Another factor to consider is that in NUS, you can ""overload"" where you take on more modules than the average semester workload. This means that you can likely squeeze in a minor/ do a second major/ underload in Year 3 etc, where you have more flexibility over your academic plan. For NTU and SMU, generally people would follow the assigned modules/average workload and you would be able to clear your requirements and graduate on time. I know of NUS Biz students who take 2-3 mods more than the average person (a total of 28-36 Module Credits compared to the average 20 credits) and thus they have a ""free"" semester to full-time/part-time intern or just speed run their degree in 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Resources: SMU &gt;&gt; NTU &gt;= NUS**

SMU provides for their students much better than NTU/NUS students. From what I've heard, they have Formal Attire for rent for students who need to rush down for sudden interviews, more interview prep, access to Refinitiv, Bloomberg and Capital IQ, stronger alumni network and network with corporates. Not sure about NTU, but for NUS, you have to mostly fend for yourself and rely on your CCAs for more opportunities and exposure.

I think scholarships across the 3 Unis are similar in terms of monetary value. I do think NUS gives out more scholarships than SMU/NTU, so it might be easier to secure a scholarship.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

As a NUS Biz student, I am happy with where I am, mostly attributed to the positive grading and S/U system, but the lack of resources can be a major pain at times. This post turned out to be longer than I thought! I hope these insights have provided more information about what studying Business in different Unis entail. Caveat: I don't have a lot of exposure to NTU students so can't draw a very firm conclusion about NTU biz. Feel free to ask any questions you might have and I can drop a reply. If any current students/Alumni's have any insights or corrections to be made, do feel free to drop a comment!

P.S. A secret fun fact is that ~~MOE~~ is likely to reduce Biz student intake across Unis, because we have too many biz students."

My degree is in Mathematics and I have a certificate (minor) in computer science. 

Currently I’m enrolled in a graduate program to get my Single Subject Teaching Credential as well as my Masters of Teaching. But I don’t want to be a teacher anymore. I’m going to finish the program because it’s not that long and I’ve already started, but I want help figuring out what to do afterwards.

I’ve begun studying for the first actuary exam and will hopefully take it this summer. I’ve looked at jobs in the actuarial/data science field near me and I’m just not qualified for anything. It’s very frustrating.

My experience is limited to working as a tutor/in education in general. And my resume has nothing to be padded with. My GPA was poor (2.66) and I did no extracurriculars or internships in college.

It feels like I’m already stuck in the teaching career and I want to scream.

Sorry if this is more of a rant than anything. But is there any advice for what to do next? How do I make myself seem more appealing and qualified for data analyst / data science/ actuary positions? How do I appeal to employers? I live in the Bay Area, so it is not as if there is a lack of opportunities around me, but I am not qualified for any of them."

They did their undergrad in business/management with rather poor grades. But since then they managed to land software roles after studying it on their own and doing different internships. They have now 3 years of software experience but feel like they would be better off going through a degree to fill in the gaps of their self study.

I was wondering which you universities can they look at which have:
1. Good course structure (programming assignments and good teaching).
2. Will take into account their work exp and overlook their unrelated bachelor's grades.
3. Closer to a big city (not necessarily high on priority though).

They are more interested in software engineering than core computer science (might be their bad experience with maths in their undergrad).

When they look online , they are bombarded with advt from Rhoeampton etc. which I feel are degree mills and interested only on milking international students for the fee."

Been a reader of this group for a long time and first time posting. Just looking for others that are in a similar situation as I am and how the F&amp;\*k you do it.

A little about my situation: I’m a one-man IT shop. We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.

On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and \~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and \~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.

In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.

Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)

Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.

I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.

Been with the company for 12 years.

Opinions? Comments? Am I just plain stupid for putting up with this crap?"

I know they’re selective, but I’ve never heard of anyone getting deferred/rejected from all of those types of schools and then doing well with the types of schools I have in RD. 

At this point, I basically feel like there’s virtually no chance for me at T30."

I’m 22, coming as a recent undergrad with a degree in Political Science and prior aspirations to become an attorney. I’ve found that my love lies more within the realm of IT and particularly the business component/management. My former university offers a master’s program that combines the MSIS with an MBA, spanning about ~2 years. That’s what I’m eyeing.

I worry about the ambiguity as far as job positions I can slot into after these programs with no prior experience. I do plan on getting some certifications throughout my involvement in the program and hopefully some internships to tide me along. 

But I want to feel secure about this decision, and would love it if someone could help out with some sort of roadmap for this career in IT business/management positions. Any advice regarding this path I’m considering would be greatly appreciated.

A couple questions aside from the general advice:

-What would be some ideal jobs to slot into while in the program to bolster my experience?

- What is a realistic position for me to slot into post-grad?

-What can I do to make myself an attractive applicant post-grad?

Thanks in advance."

Yeah, the gpa isnt that awesome but im still applying  i dont believe its my fault, my grades were getting better since the last 2 years (89 to 91) and in 11th grade, they suddently dropped to 65 percent. The reason for this is our schools academic calender. They decided to take the final exam early to implement changes in the calander(extremely stupid and nonsensical move, idk what the management was thinking) and as a result nearly the whole class failed. My teacher is going to mention this in the letter of recommendation that she's writing for me so i think i might still have a chance considering i just got 96.5 in my midterm exam in 12th grade (apparently colleges love to see growth)and will submit these scores too.

I begun applying (93 applications so far) 3 weeks ago. Yet, I have already been rejected by 44 companies and only gotten 1 interview (and that is end of next month). 

Since the internship, I have improved my LinkedIn, increased LinkedIn connections, added a fullstack application on GitHub (I have 6 projects total), Increased my contributions and most importantly, gained experience.

Before the internship, for every 30 rejections I would get at least and interview and/or a phonecall with the HR.

I have asked companies that rejected me for feedback, and the ones that replied said that the CV and Cover letter were great, but they just had more suitable candidates.

Am I a fool to believe that 3 months of experience has a meaningful impact on landing the next job?

For the not-yet tech literate (you will be an IT Wizard in no time), you can find [this two-picture guide I made](https://imgur.com/a/PSsmRjU) quite useful. [Here's an iPhone guide with the official Reddit app](https://imgur.com/a/7911ZOJ), as well.

You might want to ask a hit question, such as ""Am I too old for IT?"", ""Can I be successful in IT without a bachelor's degree?"", ""Is it possible to make X currency in Y trips around the sun?"", "" AI can match celebrity speech patterns, does this mean automation will phase out IT jobs?"", and the biggest hit of them all, ""how do I get started in IT?"".

With the power of the Wiki, you will get banger answers to those banger questions, and more! Not only will the Wiki break down Computer Science vs Information Technology, it will outline the disciplines within IT like *Helpdesk*, *Networking*, *Security*, the *Cloud*, and more.

The Wiki also cover and recommend what education to pursue, such as certifications, degrees, types of schools to attend (or not attend...lots of information on the web!), how to land internships while studying, and making labs at home for the purpose of learning. No more will you waltz into IT Career Questions asking questions that have been asked daily for 9 years. You will be prepared!

On a serious note, use the Wiki. If you have questions, consult that first and you will likely find an answer. If your answer is *not* easily answered by the Wiki (or easily Googled...Google is amazing, folks!), it is probably a good question to ask. I check this sub daily but the same questions are tiring and have been answered multiple times a day. If you work in IT you have to get good at researching things you are unfamiliar with (or maybe you need a refresher). It's a great skill to have.

P.S. I wish the mods would sticky the Wiki or at least a FAQ for newbs who don't bother to check the sidebar. But they are set on having a low-engagement daily post about...whatever. Not a knock on the mods, there is value for those who use those daily posts...very little do. And seemingly less know about the Wiki. I feel like we should be slapping it right in their faces when they come across the subreddit. But what do I know..

I digress. Use the Wiki people!"

119ktw0,54,2023-02-22,The One Thing That Helped Me The Most With Behavioral Interviews: STAR Principle,lifting_and_coding,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/119ktw0/the_one_thing_that_helped_me_the_most_with/,"Whatsup everyone, thank you for reading my post. There's a TL;DR at the end.

**My Background:**

Before I started my tech journey, I was interviewing for a train security guard position. I didn't end up getting it and I was bummed out because I really wanted that job.

While analyzing my interview performance, I realized two things:

1. The interview was largely behavioral
2. Whenever the interviewer asked me a behavioral question, I would basically ramble a lot and not really get to the point. This was obvious to me after the fact due to a comment the interviewer made during the interview which I can't remember now (it's been a few years)

**Enter The STAR Principle:**

Since then, I started looking for ways to improve my performance in behavioral interview questions. I was introduced to the S.T.A.R principle during my Criminology degree and it has been by far one of the most helpful principles for me in behavioral interviews.

I have used it in multiple interviews since then with great results. That doesn't mean I always got the job offer but it does mean that I felt good about the answers that I gave. I used it during the interview of my current role as well.

The STAR principle gives you an easy way to tell stories that get to the point of the details that the interviewer wants to know about.

**How To Use The STAR Principle:**

**Situation:** Start by describing the situation briefly and clearly. What was your role in the situation? Who was involved? What were some important details that impacted your decision? Anything relevant to the situation that would set the scene for the interviewer can be mentioned here.

**Task:** Next, briefly and clearly describe the task that you had to do

**Action:** Go further into detail about the specific actions that you took. What is it specifically that you actually did?

**Result:** What was the result/outcome of your actions? What was it that you accomplished?

**Example of How I've Used This Principle:**

I was asked an interview question about how I would approach a new problem that I did not know how to handle initially (I'm paraphrasing, I don't remember the exact question)

**Situation:** I have recently completed an internship with Company A. This was my first internship experience and I had been assigned a task to add a feature to a code base. This was my first time reading a code base this large as in school, we usually only dealt with small code snippets or wrote code from scratch.

Adding a feature to an existing codebase and understanding how all the parts of such a large codebase works was a new situation for me.

**Task:** As mentioned, I was tasked with adding a new feature to this codebase. To briefly explain, the feature had to do x,y and z.

**Action:** While I had never worked with such a codebase, I did have tools at my disposal from my personal projects/schooling. I knew how to use a debugger so I started stepping through the code slowly in the debugger and started taking notes.

I started to understand how the different functions in the code interacted with each other and what the code was doing. I hopped on a call with a senior engineer as well who had context on the project and confirmed my understanding of the code up until that point. This gave me a better understanding of what I needed to add and where I needed to add it in order to complete the feature request.

Upon confirming my understanding, I started to work on and completed the feature request and got a code review from the senior engineer.

**Result:** The result of this was that I got my code merged into the codebase and completed the feature request successfully. My supervisor and the senior engineer were very happy with the contribution.

This is one example that shows how I can go into a problem that I do not know how to handle initially and achieve the desired result.

**Conclusion/TL;DR:**

The STAR principle has been one of the most useful tools for me to handle behavioral interview questions. It stands for:

**Situation:** Describe the situation in question

**Task:** Describe the task that you had to do in the situation

**Action:** Explain the steps/actions that you took

**Result:** What was the result of your actions

More info here: [https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/star-format](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/star-format) . That's where I learned about the principle and I used information from that website throughout this post as well"

This is my first real high pressure role in the finance industry.

I had some tasks that were fairly advanced mathematically (at least for me) and i've been going back and forth with my manager about it for about a week now. I've done multiple calls w/ my manager about it, and we've agreed several times on the method i was going to do for this project and have ironed out the details to make it successful. Earlier this week I finished the bulk of the work (working a lot of overtime btw) and submitted everything to them, and today they really just tore me apart about it. Apparently they don't agree with anything anymore between my methods/theoretical portion/execution - they ripped me apart about it for the better part of 45 minutes - told me things like it shouldn't be taking me this long, I don't understand anything about our product, and that I'm wasting time and resources.

To be honest I don't think that I did that bad of a job though, from what I was told there were some valid criticisms about my work, but my coworkers all didn't have a problem with what I did. I screened my work multiple times with other people, and nobody else thought twice about anything or saw huge glaring problems which my manager seems to see in my submission.

Anyways after my manager was done ripping me to shreds I went and had a good cry in the washroom, then began slowly fixing things. Although there were valid criticisms about my work from the manager, the way it was delivered to me was pretty harsh. I feel like they went the extra mile to say some things that didn't need to be said, especially to an intern. I know that I have a lot of room to grow and learn (especially considering i don't know a lot of the math for quant), but did it really have to be delivered this way? Or should I have not taken this so personally? Is this normal?

I don't really know how to navigate financial culture, first of my family to work in the industry and none of my friends work in finance so I don't really have anyone to ask."

No experience, no internships, basically never went out of way to do anything software/hardware related outside of my classes/projects. This was mostly due to pursuing other hobbies and not taking my potential career more seriously. As a result, I don't have much to bring to the table besides by knowledge of C/C++, bit about programming microcontrollers, and limited knowledge of electrical circuits. I know this my fault and I can't change the past, so all I can do is try to improve from now. I've applied for jobs near LA and cities/counties nearby, but it feels like there is just too much competition with others being much more impressive candidates. I don't doubt my ability to be able to pick up new skills, but not quite sure what exactly to focus on to make myself more appealing to potential employers.

I am always debating with myself on what to spend my time doing/learning (web development, front end, back end, SQL, all these technologies I've never heard of but I see lots of job descriptions listing, leetcode, improve DSA knowledge, learn to use command line on unix OS,  work on side projects, search for jobs that I least pass one qualification, etc).

I honestly just want to get my foot in the door and gain some relevant work experience anywhere tech related, and learn and use my skills in a work setting so I can eventually be qualified for better jobs. I was hoping to do an internship, but didn't realize you can't anymore once you graduate. I don't really care about the pay at the moment, the only thing I am not willing to do is relocate. I know a few people who were in the same situation as me, and they were able to secure jobs, but only by relocating to a different state such as Utah, Oklahoma, etc. I have my reasons for not wanting to relocate, but maybe I am being unrealistic given my situation, where I live, and should seriously consider it at some point. Sorry for the rant, I am just not sure what course of action to take at the moment. I really just want to start my career and start working, but am worried instead I am just going to waste my time staying indecisive and being in the same spot a year from now working an irrelevant part time job."

I have pretty intense ADHD, anxiety/depression and lately has been extra hard as my relationship for the past 9 years unexpectedly ended. I know I am trying to avoid being alone with my thoughts, it just gets so intense at night and I’m so exhausted trying to spend any extra time during the day trying to process everything. 

To make matters more challenging, due to my adhd it is next to impossible for me to keep any type of routine no matter how hard I try. I also live at college half the week and home the other half due to the placement of my internship. When I turn off my phone I just get this intense needy feeling, and if I don’t quench it with my screen then the thoughts start coming and I either end up crying or in a total adhd rabbit hole working on something in the house. If I am able to sleep, it normally takes about 1.5-3 hours, and I sleep very, very lightly. If I wake up it’s the same deal.

I have found some relief from sleep podcasts, but not consistently enough. I also fine when I’m home I sleep so much better with my dog and cat in the bed, but I can’t bring them to school. I’m sick of constantly being tired and without energy. It’s such a frustrating problem to have. I’d really appreciate any advice on how other folks with adhd manage to sleep, or how anyone finds ways to manage the issue of not letting yourself sleep, although you want/need to. Thanks!"

I have listed some of the pros and cons of these options. My priority is to maximize the odds of me finding a full-time position in US when I graduate this December.


Google@Taiwan

pros: 
* It’s Google
* Get to live with my family, so no living cost basically 

cons:
* Pay is low in US standard (&lt;20$/hr, but it is high in Taiwan tho)
* (not sure)It is not in US, so maybe won’t help as much when I am looking for full-time?


C3.AI

pros:
* US internship experience
* 40$/hr

cons:
* not as famous maybe

Is Google internship still considered as relevant if it is in other part of the world?

I've broken this into 3 parts because I went on a little it of a rant. I hope you can forgive me, I just feel like there is nothing out there for me. 

**Background**

Here is some background on myself. I'm 25, graduated with Bachelors of Science in Communications (Integrated Media Major) because I thought I wanted to work in some form of media. In my sophomore year of college, I was looking for a part time job and my dad's job had a summer internship available so I took it. He works for a large contactor in electrical construction, so not anything I was interested in, but it was a job and I've only worked manual labor jobs up until then so being in an office was a nice change of pace. It was fine for that summer, I bounced around the office doing basic work. They asked if I wanted to come back the next summer. The money was good for a college student, so I did. They ended up putting me in my dad's division, which he is the general manager of. Again, no major issues, and they even asked if I wanted to take a laptop back to my college with me and work part time. I accepted and after only a few months of doing that his boss asked if I wanted to come back and work full time for them after I graduated as a Project Manager. I wasn't excited about the work, but the $55k a year starting salary was too good to pass up when compared to my other offers in fields I was looking at. 

**Issues**

This is what brings me to my big issue. I am currently a PM for them. It was fine the first year, but I've come to run into some issues. Point 1 is my personal feelings about the job, and point 2 is a recent issue that has made me actively want to now leave. 

1.) I came in with no knowledge of the industry. Both in the type of electrical work we do or in being a Project Manager. I received no training but ended up getting educated though experience and asking questions. The main issue with this is that I've been there for almost 4 years and there is stuff that I still have no clue about because it was taken care of for me at the start. I was never educated to do those tasks. I try learning on my own and getting whatever help I can, but it is assumed I know about all of our specific systems just as well as people who have been there 10+ years. These are tasks that deal with specific reports, tracking job progress on a monetary level with their specific technology, etc. If I got properly educated on it at some point I'm sure I could do it, but I never was and I know I'm in too deep now to keep asking if I know my companies culture at all. I asked about it towards my start at the company but I was always told I do not need to worry about it for now, and now I feel as if I'm always trying to learn and keep up rather than doing my job.

It makes me feel stupid, and I honestly hate my job. I don't like construction. I will say that I am fairly confident I can lead a team in my role as a manger currently, my jobs do well and my guys are happy. I am good at the construction manger portion of the position, but I am not good and hate the project manager aspects. We just moved up 3 guys to CM positions, so that took away the only thing I was actually enjoying and taking pride in with this job. Now all I do is the administrative aspects of it, which is that main part where I have no idea what I'm doing and I hate the parts I do know about.

2.) Something I didn't know coming in, is that my dad is not very well liked among some of our customers. This has lead to a decent number of them not wanting me to run any of their work recently because they do not want to have to deal with him, and they feel as if he intervenes a lot more when I'm the one running the jobs (my first year or 2 he did, he does not as much any more but still more than the other PMs). As of now there are no jobs running that I can run. I have tried mitigating this with talking to him, talking to the customers, and with our other PMs but nothing has come of it. Him being the GM for the division makes it extra hard to try and get around the need for his interaction as well. It is something I had no idea about coming in and seems like I can't make better no matter how hard I try. Many of them have said outright that they do not want me on their jobs because I am related to my dad, and that is has nothing to do with me personally. This has only just become a recent issue and is the main driving factor for me wanting to leave. I keep myself as busy as possible and there are some things I am doing currently, but at some point I will have nothing to do unless some of the jobs with customers that don't mind me running their work start and I'm scared of getting let go because of this. If I would have known about this before I most likely would have not taken the position in the first place, or would have looked to leave a long time ago.

**What I'm looking for**

I'm looking for a job that I can enjoy. I'm great at writing, interacting with people, organization skills, etc. I do think I have a pretty good head on my shoulders for learning new aspects of work when trained. I'm fine with deadlines, meetings, etc. I'd really like to avoid having to deal with money directly like I do currently. I believe I am at my best when I am given a task and told to go. The only aspect of my current job I love is that I do it remotely most of the time and would like to keep a remote position, but it is not a hard requirement if I can have a job I enjoy at all. I love reading (mostly light novels) and ideally would work with books in some capacity if at all possible, but that is more of a dream than a hard requirement. I'd like to avoid crazy hard physical labor jobs like the oil field, but I'm not entirely against doing a physical labor job. I was a maintenance worker for 3 years in high school and did paving for a summer during college. I'm also not against moving states, as my fiancé and I would like to move to a more southern state eventually (something like North Carolina, Texas, etc.). We currently live in Pittsburgh. 

Some actual requirements I do need though is a salary of what I currently make (or more of course). Right now I bring home around $50,000 a year, so my currently salary is around $64k-$65k I have a house, bills, student loans, and I'm getting married in September in a wedding that we are getting to financial help for from family. I try to cut down of my bills as much as possible, and am still working on doing some other stuff to cut them down more, but with all these monetary responsibilities I cannot go down in salary currently. 

So, with all of that said, is there any position out there for me? I've been looking but I have no idea what to properly look up to find what I might enjoy, and more importantly a position that would consider hiring me at all. I don't know what I can apply for since my only ""real"" experience is my degree and this Project Manager position I have now. I just feels impossible to move into a different field of work while trying to maintain my salary at a minimum, which is the most stressful part about this for me since I don't want to fuck up mine and my fiancé's life plans. I just want to work and not hate myself and my job. Please help!"

I know that I don't have an impressive work experience but I couldn't land any internships or jobs during my undergrad years and I regret not trying harder. 

Should I keep applying as is (I use LinkedIn to find positions and go to the company website to apply and use Simplify to auto-fill what it can)? I apply to anything CS related so maybe that's the issue; I apply to Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Software Engineer, AI Research, AI/ML Engineer, etc. Maybe I need a separate resume for different positions but I'm approaching this as a mostly numbers game but it's not working out well for me.

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated and I'm happy to answer any questions. Just wondering if there are any glaring issues.

Also they didn't really give me any kind of requirements or specific use case or anything it was just a vague description. I'm no expert in manufacturing or stock management or logistics or ERP software but i can do my research and contact experts.
I know an erp system is pretty complicated and there are already well established solutions so I'm just thinking the project will be more of a reflection of my technical abilities as an engineer more than a viable solution for manufacturers.
I'm also thinking  maybe if i streamline the requirements to be of a niche workflow or requirement, coordinating between stock and manufacturing and calculating stock replenishments, this would make it more valuable again I'm no expert in any of this and I'm just thinking off the top of my head. What do you guys think??? Should i just ask to do another project? Are there advantages to building an ERP system from scratch? Anything you guys can propose that could make such project unique?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

i got 4 LORs out of which i submitted my CS, Math and Chem teachers' letters to all my EA unis. The 4th one (by my english teacher) was sent to a couple of EA unis as an additional recommendation since I got this LOR in Dec.

My CS LOR was a bit mid imo but ig it was because I was the one who provided her with the content and expected a bit of contribution from her side. Our school asks us to provide our teachers with all the content for the LOR and whatever we choose to keep in the LOR, goes in the LOR. Relationship with this teacher was great but LOR felt a bit like my Resume but in words lol. 5/10

Math LOR was okayish too...maybe a 6 maybe a 7 but the teacher didnt know me as well as my English and CS teacher.

Chem LOR was a solid 8 cuz she is also the vice principal of our school and loves me a lot.

English LOR was a 9/10. Know her very well and when I read it once, enjoyed it so much...she was able to read into my personality so well and put all of it down in words wonderfully. She says that its the best LOR she has ever written yet!

School Counsellor: Loves me a lot and wrote me a solid 8/10 LOR.

**Interviews**

All of them (MIT and UPenn) went great. Not extremely good but not bad at all. I'd say slightly positive.

**Essays**

Wrote my common app essay on how my name being a super common girl's name in India led me through different challenges and brought me to different opportunities which have shaped specific sides of my personalities. I go in detail on how the personality trait has been changed or evolved due to a specific instance. 9/10 acc to my counsellor, alumni and a2c discord friends lol

Supps werent the best for most EA unis but RD unis and UCs have one of the best essays ive written so far. Overall- 7.5/10

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* UNC Chapel Hill !!!  EA
* Rutgers (Both Biz and CS majors) EA
* UPitts  EA
* Casewestern (29.5k scholarship)  EA
* Rensselaer Polytech (29.5k scholarship)  EA 

*Waitlists:*

I mentioned creating another app in my LOCI called the ReadAbility bot which tells the user how difficult it is to read a given text. (aligns with my Comp Ling interests)

Also scored a 98% in mid terms which is higher than my predictives. Mentioned the same in my LOCI

119yi06,67,2023-02-23,Handed in my resignation and suddenly it was possible to take PTO at the time I requested,wuesch,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/119yi06/handed_in_my_resignation_and_suddenly_it_was/,"I started doing bike delivery after school until I figure out what to do next &amp; to earn some money on the side. I love what I do and I love my coworkers, but everything else regarding management, HQ etc etc is mediocre at best. I've been there for 1 1/2 years now and therefore one of the oldest on the team.

Since this job was only temporary for me from the beginning (as well as it is for everyone else on the team), I went to apply for an internship. I knew it was gonna be in march &amp; it was 3 weeks, but didn't know when exactly or which days of the week. I told my manager about this about 5 weeks beforehand (end of jan/beg of feb) and that I couldn't yet put in a PTO since I didn't know the specific dates yet.

Last week I got the dates (CW10-12). When I told my manager that I applied for the PTO, he said it wouldn't be possible since other coworkers already have PTO during that time (they didn't/it wasn't approved yet when I first talked to him about march; EDIT: 3 total, each of them has 1 week, totalling to exactly the 3 weeks I need). I even offered to work saturdays beforehand, since the internship would only be during weekdays and I knew others would be missing, most importantly to save PTO days tho. May I add that we had 3 full-timers missing during the first 2 weeks of feb, whereas I'm only part-time even.

&gt; ""I really like being (field of work) &amp; I would love to continue doing that after march. However I need you to understand that I can not let (company) interfere with opportunities regarding my future. (company) is not a company that any of us plan to have a long lasting career in.""

I would assume he understood, what I meant by that. He texted back that he would like to discuss this in person. When I got to work then, it pretty much came down to, that I cannot take time off in march, but I could take as long as I want in april (longer time off while using the same amount of PTO days), which would have been great, but isn't really of any use for me since I needed the time in march.

Anyway, I handed in my resignation at the beginning of my shift this monday (with the intend of just reapplying afterwards actually). ""It's a pity, man"" was his reaction. That really hurt. He's a nice dude usually, subpar at scheduling and takes the job a little too seriously most of the time, but he's not a bad person. I just left and continued with my shift then.

Now it gets interesting. A few hours later, he comes up to me: ""So you really wanna leave us, huh?"" and I go ""no man, obviously not"". He told me that he cannot accept my resignation and that we can make it work. Maybe he thought I was bluffing when I texted him. Maybe that was what it needed for the higher-ups to agree. IDK. I will now work friday evening shifts (after the internship + I dont have to wake up early on the weekend) and saturday evening shift. Not quite what I was looking for, but I have the time off that I need for the internship, tips are better on friday &amp; saturday + I save 3 more days of PTO, so its fine by me, even though it will be a pretty tough 3 weeks for me.

Anyway, fuck work and fuck this specific bullshit in particular. Glad I got my time off."

11a1vec,0,2023-02-23,Is it wise to go for an MS in Canada with ~4 years of Industry relevant experience if my only motivation is money?,10PsP01,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/11a1vec/is_it_wise_to_go_for_an_ms_in_canada_with_4_years/,"Hello Reddit, Please help me brainstorm this as I'm very much confused here.

I've got an offer for MS from one of the well known universities in Canada (top 15). The program is an applied computer science program which means it's basically a cash grab program for the university. Good thing is it's only a 16month program out of which 4 months would be co-op (full-time internship), so basically after a year of studying I would be back in the industry. Bad thing is, I would have to work my ass off on my own while being in debt due to loans required to complete this program.

Currently, I am earning 11LPA in a not so well known company. I am not sure how far can I get in India but I have a feeling I can earn up to 25LPA with my current experience and skills (currently in the process of trying to find how far I can push myself in that regards).

Here's the main part, my only motivation for doing MS abroad is to earn more. I have no thirst for knowledge as others usually say when describing their motivation for studying. Having said that when I spoke to some of the seniors in the university who have completed the program they said the average salary is around 75-80k CAD. This seems like a very small compensation considering the 40% taxes in Canada.

Which in turn has left me confused if pursuing MS there would be worth at all in this recession climate or even otherwise if I'm just going to be earning 80k CAD. CAD is also much weaker than USD so it doesn't make any sense that the compensation should be this less compared to US. My main motivation to go abroad was to get a house in India on loan and pay off the loans as quickly as I can by earning in foreign currency.

 Also at what CTC (In India) will MS become an absolutely non viable option?

Sorry for being not having framed it very well, but that just shows how dispersed my thoughts are regarding this matter."

- unsure if I can improve a lot a lot more but I feel like I really can if I put my mind to it now (I'm in a much better mental state)

- suss full time courses do not really appeal to me, part time have a few I was considering but need to be 21yo and stuff
- sutd and ntu no bec I don't want engineering at all (no to nus nursing too)

3. Art school
- have been drawn to art my whole life and enjoy many aspects and mediums (self taught) but didn't take art in jc or secsch at all
- missed NTU ADM igp, and my portfolio not very strong so not sure if can ABA but maybe can rush smth out
- laselle and nafa maybe but costly too

4. Private Uni 
- maybe psych in JCU or something or others like Kaplan but unsure as I don't know what I want..

11a6ihs,2,2023-02-23,CS EU or US Masters for US Employer Preference (with US BS) for SWE/XR/Graphics roles?,danials0505,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/11a6ihs/cs_eu_or_us_masters_for_us_employer_preference/," I will graduate with my BS in Computer Science this May 2023 from a Top 10 public university undergrad Computer Science program in the US and it is my plan to continue to a Master's program, where I could focus more on the research and development of XR and Computer Graphics (a more recent interest of mine). Despite having applied to other universities (mainly as backup), my main goal would have been to continue in my University's Combined MS/BS program so I could graduate in 1 year as opposed to 2 years for every other program.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

I received the interview request 2 weeks after submission. It was held over zoom and I believe it was the one part of my application that really stood out. The interviewer was extremely courteous and friendly, and allowed me to relax and answer her questions while chiming in with my own, turning it into more of a conversation. She was visibly impressed by my achievements and also commented that she liked my attitude and friendliness. She asked me about myself, my relationship with my family and friends, my interests and intended major, my inclination towards Harvard, and discussed at length about various topics ranging from international relations (her major at Harvard) to the Indian education system.

Tips for Others: Harvard Interviews are known to be selective for international students, so it is a must that you come off well in the interview. The interviewers are generally looking for genuineness, amicable character, academic and extracurricular success, proper use of the resources available, and an interest in pursuing interdisciplinary education.

**Essays**

TLDR; Go to community college -&gt; coding boot camp -&gt; finish CS degree at 4-year university (24 y.o)

Hello everyone. I was looking for any feedback or advice for my plan for the upcoming months. I just got out of the military in July of 2022, and nothing IT related. I landed an IT job 4 days after I got home (tier 1 helpdesk), mainly for the experience and I needed a little extra income. It's been 7 months here, and I really like office work compared to manual labor. I find the ability to make much more money based on the knowledge fascinating in the IT field. I have been coding for a few months here, (last post, I posted a project if interested) I'm going through Python and common shit. I'm progressing nicely. Here is my plan for the next years to become a Software Developer:

Community college for 2 years: out of state, get an associate in CS

After completing my associate, I plan to do a coding bootcamp (14-18 weeks) with a military program called 'Vet-Tech'. - Fully paid

4-year uni - After boot camp completion I'll go to Uni and I should be a coding madman by then. I hope to land nice Interns and an awesome gig once I complete this roadmap.

Any advice on this plan? I'll be in Utah / a few hours away from San Diego, may relocate for Uni , may not. School and the coding boot camp are covered $ wise. I have income, and will not have to work. Shoot any advice/suggestions my way. ty"

I'm a new CS graduate, and I just finished in December.  I'm currently in my late 20s and just trying to come up with a plan to take the job market and move forward.  I don't have an internship, and although I do have a project that I was satisfied enough to put on my resume, I don't feel like I'm prepared enough,  especially for this job market.  Currently, with the layoffs and the number of applicants applying for entry-level swe jobs, I feel like I need a plan to focus on to keep level headed. 

Currently, I'm thinking of getting a part-time IT job for a few months and brushing up on the skills necessary to create competent projects with a mern stack. I have experience with Iat support but don't want to pigeonhole myself with only helpdesk jobs. I want to find an entry-level SWE job this year. I wasn't taught the MERN stack in my web development class, so I'm going to learn it using odin project and full stack open. I used odin project to study for my capstone class a few months ago, so now I'll just go back and finish it. 

Honestly, it's hard to make sense of what to do given the market and my skill set rn. I don't want to screw myself over and make the wrong move. Any feedback or advice would be appreciated because it feels a little overwhelming currently. 

Thanks!"

I am in kind of a weird situation with regards to internships and need some advice.

For the first 2 years of my bachelors degree, I was unsure what I wanted to do in the future. I was debating between Consulting and Software Engineering. I was actually double majoring in Computer Science and Quantitative Analysis (it's like econometrics and business mixed, my school recommends it for consulting). However, when I took more CS classes, I realized that I was wasting my time doing the business major and decided to drop it, picking up a Math minor instead. 

I focused more on getting consulting-related opportunities for the first couple years and was on a good track but just realized it wasn't for me, I needed something more technical. Since then, I've narrowed my search down to more software engineering roles. I got an internship in the Fall of last year at a local startup and have been consistently applying to internships for this summer, but to no avail. I really only have this summer and next year's summer left, and I don't know if this is enough time to get any good internships (FAANG/quant is the goal). I had a super late start given my pivot, so I couldn't do any freshman/sophomore programs either and don't go to a target school.

I'm confused on what to focus on now. Should I focus on undergraduate research opportunities? Internships for Summer/Fall/Next summer? Projects? How do I make the best out of this situation and hopefully hit my goals?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I was double majoring in CS and Business but decided to drop business, so now I'm behind in terms of CS opportunities bc I focused more on the business side and need advice on how to catch up."

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian
* Residence: Northern Virginia
* Income Bracket: Very well off
* Type of School: Very competitive public school
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None

**Intended Major(s)**: Economics

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.8 UW, 4.27 W

I got a B every single year in English. I generally did well in everything else. Another critical thing to mention is that I skipped 9th grade, which meant that I couldn't do any AP classes in 10th grade (my first year of high school) and had to cram 4 years of curriculum into 3 years.

* Rank (or percentile): School does not rank, but my relative placement in the class was not high.
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 4 Honors, 9 APs, 3 DE
* Senior Year Course Load: Dual Enrollment English, AP Government, AP Music Theory, Dual Enrollment Post-AP Computer Science, AP Physics C M/EM, Dual Enrollment Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra, Chinese 3

My midyear grades, which were submitted to Duke (quarter 1) and to UChicago (whole semester) were not good, I had 2 Bs in English and Physics.

**Standardized Testing**

ACT: 35

AP/IB: 5 on AP Micro and Macro (self-studied both exams), 4 on AP CS A (self-studied), 5 on AP World, APUSH, AP Lang, Calc BC, Statistics, 4 on AP Physics

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Economic Geography Research Internship at local university. Wrote a paper, publication pending. Participated in during the summer before Senior year for around 40 hours a week.
2. Economics Research Assistant at T100 university. Got acknowledged in a paper presented at one of the best academic economics conferences in the United States. 2 hours a week.
3. Economics Club President. 1 hour a week.
4. Blog author on economics, with a blog viewed by residents from 15+ countries.
5. Math tutor
6. Math Honors Society
7. Religious volunteering
8. Competitive Programming
9. Statistical Programming
10. Model UN (10th grade only)

**Awards/Honors**

1. AP Scholar with Distinction (there is not a lot here at all)

**Letters of Recommendation**

I got 3 letters of recommendation, one from my Calculus teacher, the other from my Physics teacher, and the final one from my counselor.

My Physics teacher is my favorite teacher, and he has stated that I am one of the best students that he has ever taught. He's known to not be very experienced at writing recommendations, but I really liked this teacher and felt it was important that he write a recommendation for me. I would give this a 9/10 rating.

I am fairly close with my Calculus teacher, and have talked with her often. She would remark on how I was a good student, but I am definitely not her favorite student (everyone knew that honor belonged to someone else). I would give this a 7.5/10 rating.

I got a new counselor just this year who started working at our school very recently, and we developed a very good relationship. She was very impressed with my research achievements and I was one of only a few of her students that submitted any supplementary materials that she requested. I would give this a 9/10 rating.

**Interviews**

Duke - My Duke interview went very well. My interviewer was a PoliSci major, and we hit it off with our shared love of social science research. A researcher that I had extensively read was actually his professor at Duke! We conversed for around an hour. He said that I had his full support in the admissions process.

**Essays**

My common app essay is, to say the least, an interesting story which may reflect well or poorly depending on who reads it. The essay discussed my conversion to Christianity from a nonreligious background. Along the way I attended an ultra-conservative fundamentalist church as well as fell into a crowd which was narcissistic and went out of their way to denounce religious people whenever they were encountered. I really cannot give a rating on my common app because of how much it depended on the AO who read it.

My supplementals were fairly good, and my friends thought they were pretty witty. Most of them talked about how academic research was an important part of my identity.

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* UVA Arts &amp; Sciences (EA)

*Waitlists/Deferrals:*

* UNC Chapel Hill (EA), waitlisted
* University of Michigan LSA (EA), deferred

*Rejections:*

* Duke University Trinity (ED)
* University of Chicago (ED2)
* Georgia Tech (EA)

Still waiting for JHU, Northwestern, Cornell, Dartmouth, Brown RD. Not expecting anything from these schools, and overall very happy to go to UVA! Wahoowa!

**Additional Information:**

I definitely took a huge risk with my Common App essay. Though I obviously can't post it publicly here, I mentioned pretty much every controversial political/religious issue on that essay. I can't say whether this is a good idea or not, but if you're thinking of writing a similar essay, just know that it didn't kill my application so it might not kill yours.

I am immensely happy with my acceptance to UVA. If UVA offered an ED2 program, then I would certainly apply under that, but I wanted to apply to my dream school of Duke first. I am grateful that UVA chose me, especially considering that I didn't apply ED and the average admitted student GPA at my school is around 4.5."

I'm a student currently studying a Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence at a low-ranked university in Saudi Arabia. I'm planning to study at a top tech graduate school in the future, and I'm working very hard to do so! I'm at the beginning of building a portfolio, trying to get a research internship, doing club activities at my university, and many more things. The thing is, does graduating from a low-ranked school put me at a disadvantage? I have a strong GPA of 4.94/5.0, and I'm planning to transfer into one of the top schools in my country if my current school is going to affect my future. I'm planning to pursue my studies after 3–4 years of work experience and research. The system in my university is unstable. I was supposed to be in my third year, but I’m entering my junior year next semester, which I was supposed to take this fall, but it’s such a mess that I have 3 semesters left and summer training without including the upcoming third semester. Any helpful tips? If you were in my situation, I would be extremely grateful."

I am now coming up on almost two years of full time SWE experience, which is wild to think about

Looking back, if there was one thing I would want to just hammer into my fucking head is that you ARE smart enough to be a Software Engineer

With every course that I took in my CS degree that I didn't do well in, with every interview I failed, with every project I left abandoned because I didn't feel I had the expertise to complete it, I felt dumber. I'll be honest, some of the comments I read on Reddit/other forums didn't help either

At times, I felt like there was a form of gatekeeping around SWE (if you didn't live &amp; breathe code, you'll never make it as a SWE)

Pair that with my educational background before CS, where I was a terrible elementary school student, failed a bunch of high school courses and didn't graduate on time and failed a college course too

I held a crim degree before my CS degree and I was an average student at best during my crim studies 

Put all these facts together and I had a perfect recipe of imposter syndrome running through my head 24/7

Even when I got the job/got my internships, I always felt deep down inside that people will realize the code I'm writing is a dumpster fire and that I'll be let go 

What actually happened was that I did well in my internship and got offered to return as a full time employee and my manager is happy with my performance at my current job as well

Keep going, work hard, &amp; I look forward to hearing your success stories :)"

However, it has been my dream to work overseas, especially in the US which is considered the most advanced tech hub and has a lot of opportunities and projects going on. I realise that going to Virginia Tech will open up many opportunities in the US but I don't know if a degree from NUS can give access to the same opportunities in the US. 

I'd like your advice on where I should go if I really want to work in the US. I would also appreciate any professors/employers who can speak about how well-known NUS is among the tech industry in the US! It would also be helpful if any CS students can shed light on how international students can get tech internships in the US during college!

I don't care about going to an Ivy, just a school with a decent cs program and internship opportunities.

I'm a junior in HS right now and had a 1430 on PSAT before prep since I didn't even know what National Merit was ☹️ but I plan on prepping for the SAT and aiming for 1500+. My class rank at the end of this semester will be in the top 10 of a 300-400 student class. U.W. GPA of 4.0 and a decent amount of APs. Extracurricular wise I'm in volleyball, math team (maybe state qualifier), Deca (made it to state), chess club, key club, nhs, and student council. I have also worked 2 summers with the IT dept at my school and will work this summer too. Senior year they offered me a paid apprenticeship during the school day that I am going to take them up on.

I've realized that some form of leadership would probably help but am unsure what I could do to get a leadership role besides maybe run for the NHS committee.

On a side note, would it be beneficial for me to continue learning Italian my senior year or to drop Italian and pick up a different science AP to hopefully knock out some electives in college?"

At company A, I got paid $17519.58 total over the internship My pay cheque for every 2 weeks or 10 days of work was about $2268.

Now at company B, I got a smaller paycheque for the first pay since it was mid pay cycle that I joined, but now my paycheques should be higher but I am instead getting $2123.07 every 2 weeks for 10 days of work. Based on my calculation, I will be making just a hair more than I did at company A over the 4 months... which just does not make sense to me. I looked at the paystup. A good bit goes to taxes and then EI, CPP etc bringing the gross from 28xx$ to $2123.07. So monthly I only get about $4600 of the approx monthly $6.23k gross salary.

Both jobs are 7.5hr work days.

Statistics Teacher: Honestly she was a super nice teacher, but I constantly left her classroom to walk around with friends. I did try to act super nice to her so that she would write me a good lor, but not much more to our relationship than that. Honestly not even sure why I asked her to write my STEM lor, but compared to my calc teacher, this was the lesser of two evils. (4/10)

Cornell Prof: Honestly we had a great relationship, but we only had like maybe 6 hours of interaction in total over my 3-month internship. Also met him when I visited Ithaca, so I think that made the letter a little bit better. (7/10)

**Interviews**

N/A

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Went through 6 drafts of my personal statement before finishing my final one a couple of hours before the deadline. It was about my love of movement and how I've moved around the globe, and how it's given me a new perspective on life. (6.5/10)

Honestly, my Cornell supplemental was probably what got me into the school. I talked about how I disliked how one of the buildings looks like when I visited, and the story about why it's soooo ugly. Related it to the environment and why that matches up well with my dreams of using CS to better model buildings to make sure they don't look so ugly and cause such a negative impact. (9.5/10)

**Additional Information:**

Second semester of junior I started to think about colleges and what makes the most money.  I saw CS and ran with it. I started going through the CS rankings and found Cornell. I disqualified every school before Cornell for semi-serious reasons. #1 was MIT, and let's be real, the people who get into MIT have been wanting to go there for their whole life. They have absolutely incredible EC's and my EC's effectively disqualified me. #2 was CMU, and honestly, there's just too many nerds there, but also their CS program is crazy hard to get into as well. Something like 5%. Berkeley was too expensive OOS, and Stanford same reason as MIT, but it would have been my second choice for ED. So then I locked into Cornell.

The 20% ED acceptance rate was appealing, and I saw myself as a 20% applicant, definitely not a 5-10% though. After I ""knew"" that Cornell was my best shot at a T5 CS, I started messaging profs there asking about an internship. After not even 2 days of this, I ended up connecting with a prof on LinkedIn. That's the short story, and I ended up interning with that prof that summer.

I'm so excited to attend Cornell, and I think it was either Cornell ED or bust. My application was just so tailored to Cornell it's crazy. Go Big Red and my ass has already started learning all the Lynah Rink Hockey Chants."

I recently graduated this past december with a BS in Comp Sci. I had an internship last summer with Company X and received a return offer for May (I had chosen date as I was unsure if I would finish in Fall or Winter at the time).

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago Company X says that due to the state of things they have to push my start date back 3 months.

I was fine with waiting ~4 months originally, an additional 3 months does not sound appealing. Plus it is not reassuring, and makes me worried it will be pushed back again or rescinded.

I am currently working at my schools IT department, and could realistically continue working until June in order to avoid any large gaps in my resume. I have also been using my spare time for side projects as well.

I would like to begin my career asap, but the compensation package at Company X is nothing to laugh at. If I look for other jobs it will be difficult to beat, if even possible.

Another factor is psychological, I find my current job to be quite boring. While side projects have assisted, I would like to reduce my time in my current position if possible.

In short my question is this, should I look for alternative employment opportunities? Or be patient and wait? Or is there some middle ground I am not seeing?"

Due to my internship being 10 weeks (was initially meant to be 1 year), they've instead offered me a Hardware Internship with some software projects. 

Reason being is that it'll take several weeks to understand the codebase as it has to do with writing software for FPGAs. Also as they're a small team, the intern's work will immediately be put in production instead of a small project which isn't used past the internship. 

I study computer engineering in uni and therefore due to time constraints they think I'd be more suitable to do a hardware engineering internship alongside some software projects (writing testbenches, verification and some automation scripts). 

Should I still consider taking this internship even if I want to do software engineering in the future? Also to better reflect my role would it be suitable to write Hardware and Software engineering intern on CVs?"

Graduating early seems tempting but it comes with a higher risk since I'll have to manage courses, part time and job search in my last semester and less time to prepare.

If I can get exposure to the working world early, not only will it give me personal motivation to complete the degree especially once I get to harder courses, but it will give me a good source of income to sustain myself. 

The issue with this, though, is that 1.) I’m not sure if my field is what I want to intern in (currently computer and coding is definitely not my strong suit, even after years of practice), 2.) My resume is filled with mostly retail and food service experience, and 3.) I’m afraid I won’t be able to find an internship before I graduate.

Probably my greatest fear is coming out of school on the other end at graduation with no internship experience, or really any hands on experience due to simply not having enough time or money while a full time student. I live off campus and spend a lot of my time worried about basic needs, which eats into time I need for studying. 

I guess I’m just wondering if there’s anyone here who graduated in engineering and didn’t have a job lined up. How long did it take for you to find something? Did you have to work in another kind of job to make ends meet? If so, how long did you do that?"

I am a super noob into this whole IT job market. I was working in retail for many years and only have customer service experience.

As for certifications I have a BS degree in IT and acquired the CompTIA trifecta (A+ N+ S+). Now my question is where should I start looking for a job? Should I start looking through your normal online job posts like Indeed, monster, glassdoor, and etc... or should I update my linkedin and talk to some recruiters for maybe some hookups?

Is this normal?,Old-Telephone-2560,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11b86mj/i_am_in_a_constant_cycle_of_interviews_yet_have/,"I have been searching for a new job since Christmas. I am currently in a difficult job situation. My hours were reduced from 40 to 25 out of nowhere. On the bright side, this frees up a ton of time to interview. I have avoided filing for partial unemployment because I want to keep people happy at my current job while also trying to convince them to give me more hours here and there when there’s a need. Unfortunately it’s a struggling small business and the future of the company doesn’t look great. I am a marketing coordinator for a small communications firm. 

I started searching before the new year and have submitted over 160 job applications in total. I have a bachelor’s degree in communications and 3 years of experience which is enough to get interviews but probably not enough to stand out against someone who’s got significantly more than that in an oversaturated field. I am very grateful to say that I’m getting interviews which I know a lot of people aren’t. In fact, I have had about 35 interviews in total. About 1/4th of which were final round and I either end up getting rejected or ghosted.

I feel like my interview rate is awfully high to not have an offer yet. Everyone is shocked that I haven’t found anything yet. If I wasn’t making it past the first round, I’d think…okay, something is wrong with my interview skills and I need to improve. But when I’m getting to second and third rounds, that’s when it puzzles me. Clearly they like me up until a point.

 The majority of the jobs I’m applying for are basic, entry level marketing jobs that pay $50k a year or less yet I feel like I’m being interviewed as a senior level executive at a pharmaceutical company. I’m stuck in this endless cycle of constant interview requests and my non-working hours are booked full.

I have had professional interview coaching, I get good feedback in the interview like “You seem like a great fit for the organization” or “Your skills and personality would bring a lot to the team” just to get ghosted. I’m so perplexed. Can fellow job searchers tell me if this is normal or if I’m doing something wrong? Back in my previous jobs and internships, I had maybe 5 interviews max and I found one. Now I’m struggling so hard.
 Maybe in the world of Zoom, people just interview everyone and it doesn’t mean as much as it once did."

I can read Mandarin but do not try to speak it to me, I don't understand a word spoken. I just thought the grammar was neat and learned to read it lol.

Medical condition info: I developed severe hyperthyroidism in freshman year, and it went undetected until earlier this year. I have trouble memorizing information and concentrating amongst other things, and my heart has suffered a lot because of it. It's been getting better recently but I don't know if college admissions consider that stuff. The information I've found online has been mixed.

ECs:

* Published research in two journals (biology and machine learning, both a pretty decent deal in their fields, but I'm sharing enough to get doxxed already lmfao)
* Raised 60k via my own initiatives over my middle school-high school career. 10k in 2019 to help rebuild a town in Syria (I went and personally helped after), 20k in 2020 for direct aid after the Beirut explosion, and nearing 30k right now for support directly to the Syrian people after the earthquakes. I will be visiting Syria and Lebanon this summer as well to aid with anything left. I organized all of these things, from collecting donations to a dinner or two to directly communicating with
* Varsity fencing
* President of Library Leadership club
* President of Women in Stem club and Women in Finance club
* President of Econ club
* 300 hours of volunteering at local hospital
* Brown Model UN x2, best delegate this year
* Summer internship at Dad's work (Idk if it counts)
* Red Cross club vice president, raised 10k for that over my high school career

Random hobby stuff (you can skip this, literally have no idea how to put them in an application, figured they were important though):

* I mean I've been programming since I was seven. I have a giant backlog of stuff on my GitHub, but I don't think they check those. Here's my highlights for the last few months/year or so:
* Seniors at my school are allowed off campus, but all other grades are not. I made an app for Android and iOS that allows underclassmen to do something like ""DoorDash,"" where a senior will pick up food for someone for a small fee, as long as it's close to the school. Was forced to shut down in November, but I profited a lot from it because school lunch is dookie. Most of the 400-person school had used it at some point, and I made a bit of money from it, but not much because I'm not greedy and it was mostly a fun tool I made in my spare time.
* I work on multiple game development teams in my free time. I do a lot of Unity (C#) and Minecraft (Java), as well as helping my little sister do stuff in Roblox (Lua and C#'s horrible lovechild). I can program in... well, I would say basically every single mainstream language, honestly. I'm no crazy savant genius child but I pick stuff up quickly and once you got the logic down for one, you just have to figure out what a pointer is and you've picked up the next.
* I went through a TI-84 calculator hacking phase. Made like seven apps.
* I made a high-level language that compiles into Brainf\*\*k. Iykyk.
* I built my own 32-bit CPU (it's big as hell) and am working on assembling an at least semi-functional computer, combining parts from the '80s and '90s and whatever I can scrap together on my own. The goal is to get it to run Linux, or at least UNIX-based something something.

What I'm looking for in a school:

I like STEM, but I also like a good balance. I wouldn't be opposed to going to a STEM-only or focused school if it fit my vibe, but I also know I can't be too picky because my GPA is kind of dogshit and I don't think admissions officers care about situations that much.

So yeah. Would you mind reverse-chancing me? I am having a lot of trouble deciding on what to do, and all of the colleges I thought would be a good fit for me I have no chance in getting accepted to.

Thanks in advance. Sorry if there are any spelling errors, I knocked this post out while my GPU was asthmatically trying to train another machine learning model. Hopefully this one actually works, I'm sleeping if it doesn't."

If I can get an internship role that involves programming in another sub-sector of CS (i.e., cybersecurity, DevOps, etc.) but is not a full fledged SWE position, should I be worried about being pigeonholed? 

It seems many CS majors aim for software engineering/developer internships because of future goals, but is it a negative to do something that might have a mix of other things?

Thanks in advance."

Internship. UNC is probably better because there are several big companies near UNC.

Please help me with other factors I need to consider, thank you！

Also for China, is it better to accept the offer earlier to prevent being checked for a long time? Does anyone know what time people usually go for visa before?

11b9jye,10,2023-02-24,I cannot get a CS internship and I’m struggling with networking.,jadedOcelot1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11b9jye/i_cannot_get_a_cs_internship_and_im_struggling/,"I am a CS student trying to get an internship, and I’m not having much success. I’ve applied to about 50 places and I’ve not gotten any response whatsoever; I either get ignored, or sometimes get sent an automated email that says “we’ve moved forward with other candidates.”

I have had my resume reviewed by a career coach and the career center at my university, and both thought that my resume wasn’t super problematic. Instead, they both thought that I needed to spend a lot more time networking and reaching out to people on LinkedIn. The person at the career center thought I needed to start rearranging components of my resume and changing experience and project descriptions to match the job requirements that specific companies had posted for their positions. They also thought I should start reaching out to developers at companies that interest me, build up a rapport with them over time, and then eventually job opportunities would materialize through this networking (friend of a friend has a job opening, things like that).

I totally understand how this would be a good strategy for specific companies, and I will admit that I am not very comfortable with reaching out to people on LinkedIn and it’s something I’ve underutilized and should do more (I can’t shake the feeling that I’m soliciting these people and begging for a job, and it makes me feel bad). That being said, I’m really shocked at how much effort it takes to get an application noticed *anywhere* (not just the Googles and Amazons of the world, but any dev job), and I’m finding it difficult to determine how to best spend my time.

What I mean is that at the end of the day, I could put a huge amount of time into one company: I could reach out to a recruiter on LinkedIn and a developer on the job, and spend time keeping that connection alive. I could also attend this company’s Intern Info Session #1, Intern Info Session #2, Coffee with Recruiters Session, etc. I could completely overhaul my resume and change all my wording to match their job description and beat the ATS. I could be given an automated coding test right when I apply that takes me 2 hours to complete. And they could still look at my resume and deny me fairly quickly, before I even get an interview.

So I get that giving a lot of attention to one specific employer can increase my odds with that specific employer, but man, at the end of the day I do need a developer job of some sort, so I’m trying to balance quantity and quality. Right now it feels like I’m doing too much quantity, but I’m also afraid to pump too much time into networking with one company or working on one application if it's not going to somewhat significantly increase my chances of having that application noticed.

I apologize if I sound like I don’t want to put in the effort. I *do*, I just want to make sure I’m not missing something fundamental here and that I’m spending my time wisely. Is my resume maybe not as good as I think it is? Are ATS systems eliminating me from all of these jobs before a human even sees them? Is networking on LinkedIn really the missing piece that puts it all together? Worth noting also, I am a sophomore, so I get that I’m not as desirable as a junior; it could also be that 50 is not really that many applications, maybe it truly is just a numbers game. But I also don’t want to chalk it all up to that and then throw out 500 applications that are not useful.

I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone has, and thank you for reading 😊

TL;DR – I am not having success with internship applications, but am worried that I could spend too much time and energy on specific companies and networking that won’t be fruitful."
11b9nn4,36,2023-02-24,Galactic detour: chapter 01,ZaoDa17,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/11b9nn4/galactic_detour_chapter_01/,"**Bantona Favonat POV**

I stepped out of the Police vehicle. The humans called them ‘cars’ but this one was from Moltar so I didn’t like to call it a ‘car’. My partner got out on the other side and from the back our ‘tag along’ got out.

We had gotten a clue about some suspicious behavior. So we went to investigate. The apartment building looked run down and worn out. We got to the door. I rang the bell. At first nothing happened. So I rang again. My partner got out the taser and gave me cover as I knocked a final time. I was ready to break down the door.

“Yeah yeah! I’m coming already! No need to tear down the fucking door. *Ein Mann ist doch kein D-zug. \[German idiom: A man is no D-train. -&gt; I’m not that fast\]* “. The last part was barely audible and the translation made no sense so it must have been a figure of speech. But the door was opened.

The human on the other side seemed baffled by our presence. He looked pretty average. Well the beard style was a little off the standard.

“Officer Bantona Favonat, from the Melbourne Office of security.” I introduced myself, “This is my partner Officer Latnamy Tinka and this is Orgata Wordinat from the Imperial Office of internal affairs. We are here on accounts of suspicious behavior reported to us.” I concluded.

“Hello there? I’m Johannes Stein. I ehhm live here?” he seemed confused, “How about you come in? We don’t need to do this in the hallway do we?”

“Lead the way!” I told him and nodded to my partner. Then I followed him, her covering me. And I regretted doing so. My ears touched the doorframe and had to bend back to go though! I hate that feeling! Why can’t the humans build their doors at a proper height? Well I got though into what was a one room apartment. He pointed to the chairs around the kitchen table. Well actually it seemed to be the only table in the apartment. He sat down himself. I followed his example. My partner went into the other rooms to check for dangers.

“So what is this all about, officer?” he asked.

“We have received a clue of suspicious happenings in this apartment.”

“Yes, you said so much already. But what suspicious behaviors do you mean?”

“Firstly there are plants growing that might be illegal narcotics.”

“You mean these tomatoes next to the window?” he pointed to the plants with red fruits.

“Then there are accounts of activity during the night.”

“Look I don’t have a job anymore and I prefer the night over the day because it’s nice and quiet so what?”

At this moment my partner came back and held up some propaganda posters. “How do you explain this? Propaganda against nonhumans? And there is a lot of it in the bedroom!” She asked.

“Ohh come on, those are from Warhammer 40k.” I didn’t know what that was but it sounded dangerous. My concern must have shown because he continued.

“It’s a fictional universe where humanity is strong and it's way older than two years so it has no connection to you guys at all!” he insisted.

“What do you have them for, smartass?” Latnamy asked further.

“As inspiration or motivation I guess.” He shrugged, “Other people have other stupid shit on their walls for that reason.” He continued.

“This is of no use!” our ‘tag along’ intercepted. “You claim to be the person to live here but can you prove your identity?”

“Yes I can just wait a moment and I get my passport.”

He got up and went into the bedroom. My partner followed him. Shortly thereafter he returned. And handed his passport, still on paper, to Wordinat. She read through it. Then she looked up. Her eyes were narrower as she asked the next question.

“This passport is from the former federal republic of Germany. What are you doing in Melbourne? The order was for all to return to their homes.”

“Well you see I was on an internship when the Empire of Vorzyd *integrated* Earth and when the order to return home came, well I can’t because my original home is a controlled zone where no one can enter or leave. Well no human at least. So I thought this was technically kind of my home so I stayed here.”

“I see. And you said you were without work?”

“Yes?” The human was confused and more careful now.

“Why is that?”

“Well The mining company I had my internship in kind of fired most of its workers when coal mining was banned and hard light products became much cheaper then metal wears.”

“Well you do look pretty suspicious with those propaganda posters and without a passport from here…” Wordinat trailed off.

I was pretty certain that these suspicions would probably only result in some bureaucratic work and maybe some fines. But everyone knew not to interfere with the Internals schemes so I kept quiet. Although I felt some pity for the human.

“What do you want from me, Miss?” he asked.

“Well there is a job that will offer some legal protection and solve all of your monetary problems.”

“What is it? Get to the point.”

She slid him a card made from hard light. I knew that violet, it’s the color of the Army. Now I really pitied him. Getting pressed into the army like that wasn’t nice. Especially with a war brewing in the void he probably didn’t even know about. I had heard that the soldiers from the subjugated races were more cannon fodder than anything else.

“Of course it’s the army, some spying would have been too easy.” He sighed. “Is there a war brewing or are you just testing how to work with humans in the army?”

No one answered him. Well he seemed at least somewhat smart.

“Well I guess I don’t have a choice anyway so count me in I guess.” He said with a dead expression on his face.

“Very well!” Wordinat spoke up. She pulled up a form on her data pad. “Sign here!”

The human signed and asked: “What am I allowed to bring with me? And what would you advise on bringing?”

“You don’t need to bring anything but you can bring everything that you can fit into this bag.” As she said that she pulled a synthetic bag with a zipper from her coat pocket. Then she stood up.

“We are done here.” She said towards my partner and me and left for the vehicle.

We stood up too. While leaving I remembered to lower my head so my ears could pass through the door. As he closed the door the human muttered something about a ‘rabbit KGB’ whatever that is. I’m sure it’s nothing I actually what to know.

One is a ""fun"" internship in which I will be a dark sky park interpreter at a large National Park (USA), whereas the other is a software engineering internship (I am a comp. sci student). 

I'm having difficulty choosing between the two. On one hand, I am really passionate about astronomy and astrophotography, and working/teaching/exploring at a national park on my passion sounds amazing and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

On the other hand, this software engineering internship would be a huge boost in career readiness as a software engineer and the experience would be great. However, the idea of working 8/hrs a day for 12 weeks is kind of off-putting, especially compared to the alternative.

How would you guys decide between the two options?"

Some background: I am a Junior at a top 50 CS school.

In the fall, I accepted an internship offer with a defense company. At the time, it seemed like an amazing choice because the pay is relatively decent, I wouldn't have to relocate, and I have an opportunity to do machine learning (which at the time I thought I was interested in, but in reality I am not 100% sure if I am).

I was so decided on this offer that I turned down an interview with Capital One, a final round interview with Bloomberg, and an interview from Appian.

I am primarily regretting turning down the Capital One interview. I'm not 100% sure what my career goals are, and I feel like Capital One would have been a way better choice (assuming I got the offer, which may be a bold assumption).

I am always seeing online the disadvantages of working in defense (old tech, below average pay), and pay is fairly important to me. People tend to talk about how ""easy"" it is to get a defense job. It kind of makes me feel like a failure. I am a Junior so this is my last internship opportunity before I graduate. I had one other internship but it wasn't a software engineering role. 

I feel as though I will be disadvantaged in terms of relevant experience and resume prestige if my goal is securing some kind of good paying software engineering role at a prestigious company when I graduate. 

I feel very regretful- did I really mess up so bad?"

11bbxui,13,2023-02-24,Acceptance-Senior Year,Nabuchadnezar,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/11bbxui/acceptancesenior_year/,"Hello my fellow Gators, applicants and future Swamp inhabitants, 

I would like to share my story of the circumstances of my journey before UF and the pathway that UF has led me down now being in my Senior year, soon to be graduating. 

My story starts shortly after high school, with no direction, no sense of belonging, and little idea that the circumstances in my life are from the sole purpose of a continual chase of dreams that orbit a sense of personal dedication. 

I graduated from high school and was lost in the idea that because of my GPA, because of my upbringings, and little money I owned to my name, the possibility of higher education in the realm of a top 5 university was seemingly never an option for me. I started hanging out with the wrong crowd, starting getting into questionable vices with questionable people that made me question the direction in my life and what I truly wanted from myself. 

I gathered my wits and put the feeling of discord behind me, as I felt the need to achieve better, to feel better, to be better. I applied at a local state college, I had never researched it or cared about what I wanted from it, I just needed a change. I didn’t even know my major, I was just working towards a “degree” of some sort. I took all sorts of classes that qualified for my AA, and I found myself soon graduating on my last semester from that state college that I never thought I’d take serious. My senior year I enlisted in the Army National Guard not knowing what my next step in life was, I graduated with honors from my state college in May of 2020. Because my girlfriend at the time wanted to go to UF, I applied to UF as the only university because I thought “Well I just want to go where she goes” There was never a chance, I thought that I would be accepted.

By February 1, 2021, I found myself on a bus and initiating basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. For the next 10 weeks I would undergo the strenuous activities of becoming a soldier, forming bonds of brotherhood through blood, sweat, and tears. It wasn’t until my 8th week in basic training that I got a letter in the mail, a brightly colored orange and blue packet with the clearly boldened letters “UF” written across the top and the looming significance of Century Tower laden across the folder. The realization was delayed, a sense of disbelief and shock over the course of the last two years at a local state college and the arduous labor while at basic training held in my hands at that moment the divinity of Godly intervention. There was the sense that through sheer will and passion, a persons fate can change through your own hands, and through faith in God. 

I had but 2 weeks until graduating basic training, and another 7 weeks at AIT (Advanced Individual Training) until I returned back to my hometown, pack my things and move to the Swamp to embark on the most challenging journey yet with just 1 week after my return to enroll in classes.

I moved into a place with much consideration and luck, and began working diligently on a degree that placed me in arms length of the dreams I hoped to achieve, and oh, how they have been. I graduate next semester with a great GPA , an internship through the Department of State, two clearances, a great job, a fantastic military career, and a degree from the University of Florida as a proud Gator, a proud student, friend, mentor and person. 

I did all of this with no SAT, ACT, no immediate scholarships, no idea of what to expect- just dedication and hard work from the years that followed. I see a lot of you prospective Gators wondering if you’re good enough, and trust me, you are. Just because you didn’t get accepted this time, or worried about the potential of whether or not you will, put faith in yourself and God and know that a “no” now doesn’t mean it’s for forever, and it’s possible that an even better opportunity is calling you elsewhere. The point is, never give up on your dreams. Trust yourself and trust the process. 

I wish you all the best of luck on your individual journeys, and to never stop working on yourself no matter the obstacles. 

With Wanderlust, 

A Proud Gator 🐊"

11bd6nx,1,2023-02-25,Can you help me with my career situation?,Careful_Will_1734,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11bd6nx/can_you_help_me_with_my_career_situation/,"Friends, sorry for the long post. Had to vent out. Can you suggest how I can come our my career situation? I have over 20 years experience in the industry, mostly on Front End but managed full stack and platform teams. I have been an exceptional performer all throughout with awards almost every year of my career so far. I am well respected by my managers and colleagues so far. I have managed teams up to 80. Out of 8 years of people leadership experience, 6 years are managing managers. However last 4 years, I switched to IC role for personal reasons. If I had continued without switching to IC role, I would have been a Senior Director/VP of a big company. Anyways, I thought I was ready to switch back to leadership and started to apply. No company was taking me in as leader since my previous role was IC. I had tried to explain to the recruiters that I had 8 years leadership. But after a long effort, I got 3 offers, 2 of them were Senior engineering manager. But both were Front Line Manager roles when I wanted Managing Manager role. One company promised that I could grow faster into Director role there. So I took pay cut from my current company( $4000 lesser per month) and also 120K less than my other offer, but I took this one for faster growth.

After I signed up offer and before I actually joined, company has changed a lot. CEO quit, many VPs quit and a lot of attrition was happening. Also, my team was just 4 people compared to a bigger team they promised. I spoke to Senior Director that this was not they promised and how I had to compromise other higher paying offers for what they promised. A week later, my manager asked me to play Director role, a team of 30, 4 teams. I was very happy.

We were having Game day and I wanted to approve food for remote employees. But my manager said, food should be provided for only those who come to office. But the team was small and one team mate just had a baby, I thought they deserve to have this. He said, he was not ready to give free food to people who don’t come to office. I was surprised and felt so cheap about the way he said that. I got furious and said, I don’t think it as free food but as a way of thanking my team for their hard work whether they come to office or not. So I went ahead and approved the food. He did not like me for that.

Then, he went on leave for a week. I went through the launch schedule and I found a big miss in the planning. I spoke to multiple teams and tried to mitigate , spoke to VP, got the plan frozen and when he came back , I told him about the whole change of plan. I thought he would appreciate that I have identified the big gap. Instead he started to say, “I was gone for 1 week and you changed everything”. I didn’t know what to say. I said, I only made it better. Again, he didn’t like me talking back. He would say my plan is not good, but he would publish to CTO, VPs and call it his plan. I commented on the same thread claiming my work in a way that everyone knows it is my work. He got furious.

He started to talk abusive in 1:1s. When I asked senior leadership decisions on few org transformations, he cut me from the meeting. I asked him why he set certain goals and advocated for different approach that would help accomplish goals easily with higher team satisfaction. My team loved all the plans I came up with but he was not. Slowly everyone started to address me and reach out to me, which he felt really jealous and intentionally cut me out from meetings. Called my designs hack but I found him sharing the design as his’s in a presentation to CTO. I was not present in that meeting, but he accidentally shared a document he was going to present with CTO with me.

When I brought it up with him, he managed differently saying, he didn’t mean to say it was his design and edited the doc as team’s effort. So there were so many 1:1s we were in conflict. If I have any opinion different from what he says, he asked me to tell him only in 1:1. I denied saying these are team’s issues and every team faces it. It will be better to address in leadership meeting to get different ideas rather than sticking to 1:1s.

He was so done with me and he wanted me to step down from Director role. He complained to my VP that I don’t listen to him. I asked my team to provide my feedback directly to VP. After seeing feedback from my team, VP let me continue as Director.

But later, my company went through layoffs cutting layers. He used this as opportunity to take my role off and made me an IC ( Lead Engineer). I got shocked. When he told me that I am going to play IC role, he told me that “I changed his goals. And I didn’t listen” that’s why he did it. But he told his manager he didn’t need this role as part of cutting off layer. I went to HR and filed workplace harassment. After that, he is professional with me. But I didn’t like playing IC role, so I pinged almost all the Senior Leaders and they didn’t have leadership role for me. I tried outside of my company and there is absolutely no interview call. Almost 5 months I am trying to come out. Now my husband is saying, just bite the situation and use this 1 year here since I negotiated mostly on RSUs and I will lose them all if I leave within 1 year.

He is giving me all the crapy work, working alone, no team to talk to, it feels like a big punishment. I spoke to CTO and many other people including HR head about my situation but they just ask me to apply for internal job. When the hiring managers go to him to get my feedback, he complains that I don’t listen and they don’t want to hire me.

Every day of my office feels depressing, unable to move out at the same time can’t stay here.

What should I do? Pls advise. I never thought after 20 years of exp and successful career, I would be in such a situation doing intern work and isolated. That too I took pay cut for this."

High Income.

**Intended Major(s)**: Undeclared, preferably. If not, Undeclared Engineering. If none of those are offered, Data Science. If THAT isn't provided, CS.

**ACT/SAT/ SAT II:** Applying test-optional. Submitting my 1440 to Georgetown.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 4.0 unweighted; my school doesn't have a weighted GPA, ranked 5 out of 398 students. 

**Coursework**: 14 APs (by Senior Year: AP HUG, AP Calc AB, APES, AP Chem, AP Calc BC, AP Lang, AP CSA, APUSH, APCSP, AP Physics C, AP Stat, AP Lit, AP Macro, AP Gov). I struggle in the testing environment (as you can see from my SAT score); I've received all 4's on the AP tests I did last year (AP Calc AB, AP HUG, and APES). This will be a weak spot in my application as at the time I apply, I predict I'll end up with 2 5's, 4 4's, and 2 3's on my AP Tests.

**Awards**: Valedictorian (school gives Val to all 4.0s), Honor Roll, will maybe be a Distinguished AP Scholar.

**ECs:** 

* Helped fundraise for a non-profit supporting underprivileged women experiencing sexual violence in a very globally south African country, at my highest raising $2,000 in one day. This non-profit is backed by a 3rd generation Yale student who is very active in the Yale alumni community and is known by everyone in the rich old white men Yale alum scheme.
* Internshipped for two years in a row over the summer at a children's clinic, supporting children with disabilities and families who were lost in helping a child with special needs. I could relate to this one a lot because my brother has autism and attended this same children's clinic. My parents were in the same scenario, stressed out about supporting an autistic kid and seeking professionals for help. I grew bonds with these kids and helped some learn how to express themselves in the world that they saw differently, growing genuine relationships and having an actual impact.
* 3 Sport Athlete for all 4 Years of High School (XC (football for senior year, frick XC), Swimming, Track, and Field).
* Swim Team Captain 
* President and Team Captain of the Trivia Club. Won the state championship and placed top 5 at nationals when I wasn't even on the A team, but still, a very decorated program.
* Chess Club Member 4 Years
* Co-developed a genomic desequencer under the supervision of two high-up Amazon developers with Cambridge and Stanford CS degrees. This project took a year of weekly meetings with my team.
* Sophomore Year Class VP (Plan, Organize, and Assist)
* Senior Year Class President ?!?!?!?
* Vietnamese Student Union Member 

**Essays:** I know it really does all come down to my essays. I don't have any plans now, and I probably shouldn't be worrying about it. I know I'll do at least one essay about my internship and another about my non-profit. 

**Schools**: Oh boy!

 **Reach:**

I had to drop some courses that I was likely going to fail and I feel horrible. I will be working full time this summer at an internship which I am currently working part time at now. So essentially I can’t take summer classes and most of the classes I need aren’t offered anyway. This job is part of the reason for my bad grades, along with some serious depression. Although there really isn’t an excuse. So I think I will need to take an extra semester to get all the classes I need without taking 20+ credit semesters senior year. 

I know I sound hysterical, but I feel absolutely sick about having to do this. Worst of all is I don’t know how to break it to my parents who have high hopes for me and think I’m doing fine. Is this a really big deal? Have any of you had to do this? I need some advice."

I love going to punk shows; I love the beach and I love going on spontaneous adventures, and whenever I do any of these things, I do it with my friend, who we’ll call Steve. 

I was introduced to Steve in junior year of high school by a mutual friend and, at first, we didn’t really hit it off. Back then, I was a very shy, introverted person and Steve was the definition of an extrovert. He could strike up a conversation with anyone about anything and he always seemed to make it work. As time progressed (and after he moved 40 minutes north to a beach city) I started developing socially and opening myself up to new experiences, which is something I had never done up until this point. This was around the time Steve randomly invited me to his apartment to shoot the shit, and our real friendship developed from that day forward. For the rest of that summer, I would go up to his place at least once a week just to hang out with the guy. We’d go on short hikes, go to the beach, the gym, and the tennis court . He’s the dude that helped me overcome my fear of approaching women.

So after the summer came to an end, we couldn’t see each other as consistently, but we still always found time to hang out. But today, he sent me a text telling me he got an internship for a life insurance company and he’ll be working 7 days a week for the next few months. I’m happy he’s moving forward in life, but it sucks that my go-to friend is no longer there to hang out. Of course I have other friends, but they’re never able to make time for me. 

I need advice on how to meet people like Steve. It’s hard cultivating meaningful friendships as an adult, but I can’t allow myself to fall back into that lonely introverted state I was in back in high school."

2 - Will I be paid well? If not, for how long will I have to take a hit on my salary?

3 - How do I even start? As an intern maybe? That would be depressing again!

Over time, I catched feelings for my bestfriend. We're both girls. Here a little background.

Ok, so over 3 years now we've been best friends. Since she moved to my hometown village and went to the same highschool we came pretty much inseperable. I had many friends at the time and was quite content with my life. But that was before I met her. I didn't know at the time friendship could go so deep. I still have a handful of friends now but they don't compare with the connection I have with her.

I'm 19 now, studying at Uni and she is in her last year of highschool (got held back a year). We hang out 3-4 times a week, go on vacations with the two of us, stay on the phone with eachother for hours a day.... she really became a big part of my life. Since our last vacations to Italy, my affection started to grow. I wanted to be close to her and hug her. I dunno where it came from but i always perceived myself as a very physical, touchy person so that was my conclusion. Months passed and we went out together on weekends quite a lot. We ended up kissing in clubs on some evenings, drunk - just for fun. Always when she wants to kiss I kiss her back. However, when I try to initate something, she somtimes simply says not now (afraid that that means something?!?). In that way (and a couple of other ways) she is pretty dominant in our relationship. Don't get me wrong, the relationship is healthy tho. It's just that I perceive her as more dominant than me, while I'm a person that gives in to her easily.

We talked about sexuality a lot in the past (when I didn't have feelings for her already) and came to the conclusion that we both like kissing girls from time to time, but don't envision ourselves in a relationship with a girl. She said that she would be open for the idea but at that moment wanted the dynamic of boy-girl relationship. And there it comes, we talk about boys ALL the time. It's pretty embarrasing how that's such a big part of our conversations. So in that way I don't think she is much intrested in girls. But to be honest, I'm not intrested in girls either. I don't see myself having much sexual interactions with a girl. I never had. But there is something different about her. I just want to hold her and kiss her and have her at my side. I don't know what that means. When she talks about guys and kissing them and stuff I get this nagging feeling of jealousy. I don't know what to do. We always joke that we're lesbo's together and sometimes pretend we're a couple in public for fun. She'll hold my hand and we'll laugh, but I know, eventually the joke is over and she'll drop my hand. I always get hypersensitive of her body and her touch, always noticing every departure of their presence. It's eating me alive. But I set my mind to not telling her. I don't want to ruin things, she's so important to me.

However, last weekend she made another joke about us being an old couple later while we were out drinking. We laughed for a bit, and then she said 'you know, when you or I start to feel more for each other, please let's be honest. Otherwise these jokes will be killing for the other to hear'. This remark really got to me. I thought about all the jokes that we made and how they were funny, sure, but still stung me so deep and so many times. I don't know what to do. Should I be honest with her?  In a few months I have to go abroad for 4 months for an internship. I really want to have this sorted out. Please, any advice is welcome"

It was my first job. At the same time, I did a master's degree in human resource management.

Now that the temporary contract is coming to an end, given that the limit is two years, I received a proposal from the company to sign a contract with them. Unfortunately, when I received this proposal, I didn't ask some necessary questions due to anxiety, such as whether they would have a vacancy for me in the human resources department or in a more specialized role than what I've been doing these two years.

I accepted the proposal, but I haven't signed the necessary papers yet, it was just a conversation. However, for two months now I have been sending out some resumes for jobs and internships in human resources in my area of residence. Until now, I still hadn't received any response, so my instinct when they made me the offer at the company where I work was to say yes right away, because it was always better than being unemployed. I should mention that I'm currently on a project that involves working in a warehouse with old boxes full of paper and dust, and a lot of hours on my feet. This project should last another three months.

However, this week I got a call from a large company in my city with the possibility of doing a 9-month paid internship. They still only did a telephone interview, and said they would call in the next few days to arrange a face-to-face interview, which has not yet happened.

Basically, my dilemma is this: should I sign with my company, despite the possibility of having a role in human resources and the salary progression is uncertain, or should I take the risk and look for a job/paid internship in human resources? Should I contact my boss and ask him directly if there is a possibility for me to have a role in human resources? If he says no, should I deny signing the contract and continue to look for better opportunities? What is the best way to contact the boss, by phone, email or linkedin?

Thank you for your help."
11bnb7m,69,2023-02-25,The strangers looked like you and me until they showed their teeth,doomedgeek,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11bnb7m/the_strangers_looked_like_you_and_me_until_they/,"I grew up in a village on the south coast of England.

I had a quiet, sheltered childhood. In the summer, I used to explore inlets and caves and pretend to be a smuggler. I’d read about these rogues and knew they made fortunes from bringing in tea, spirits and lace and paying nothing in tax.

I would stand at the entrance to a cave and the driftwood I had found became the sword I would use to fend off anyone who tried to steal my goods. 

Back home in the evening, the seashells I had picked up on the beach were transformed in my imagination into the coins I had earned from my crimes. I would count them off and plan my next daring deed.

The winters brought storms that sent waves crashing over the harbour wall at the southern end of the village. I knew the risk of being swept into the sea by this so keep my distance. I stood as close as I dared, though, and spent hours watching as the storm raged. Then I would go home and stand in the hallway soaked wet through and dripping onto the floor as I hung my coat up.

There was precisely one shop in the village, which sold most things you could possibly need, apart from on a Wednesday afternoon and Sundays when it was closed. 

Sadly, as I started to get older, the shine started to go off life in the village. 

As a teenager, imagination was no longer enough. I wanted real action. Ideally involving drinking and girls. 

But there was no way I would ever get served alcohol in the village shop. The people who ran the shop, Mr and Mrs Owens, had known my parents since before I was born, and they knew I was not old enough to drink legally.

As for girls, there was hardly anyone my age living the village, apart from Kay. We’d grown up in houses a few minutes’ walk away and had always been friends, nothing more.

It was a dire state of affairs and I felt like I was getting unhappier by the day. 

What I needed was to be able to spend time away from the village. 

The trouble was the nearest town was a forty-minute drive away.

And even when I was eventually old enough to learn to drive, I did not have a car and there was only one bus, which stopped in the village twice a day.

If you looked in the dictionary under ‘middle of nowhere’ the definition would have been my village.

By the time I turned eighteen, I was desperate to get out.

One evening shortly after my birthday, I was sitting on the beach around a fire with Kay and Tony, who lived with his divorced father in a house that had been made by knocking three adjoining cottages into one. 

It was late autumn. The sea was restless and there was a cold wind which sent sparks from the fire spiralling into the air. 

The wood we had propped up to make the fire crackled as the flames danced.

I could feel their warm glow on my cheeks and smiled.

“Penny for your thoughts?” Kay asked.

“The usual,” I replied, “I can’t wait to get out of this place. Until them I’m just enjoying hanging out and trying not to freeze to death.”

The others laughed at this. We all felt the same way.

Tony already had his escape route planned. 

His father had worked in finance before taking early retirement and one of his old business contacts had offered Tony an internship with his crypto currency company in London.

Kay had her plan as well. She was going to sit her exams next summer and was already applying to universities for a place. She had decided against trying to get into a London university because the cost of living in the capital was eye wateringly high. Other cities, mostly in the north of England, offered the combined benefits of a busy social life, good courses, affordable living and, most importantly, being hundreds of miles away from the village. 

My plans unfortunately were still vague. I had given up studying as soon as I could and my parents only business contacts were people they owed money to.

Despite this, I was determined to follow my friends out into the big, wide world. 

Tony had borrowed – his word – a bottle of wine from his dad’s wine cellar and he opened it, while Kay handed round the plastic cups. 

Tony poured us all a measure that almost spilled over the top of the cups.

Not wanting to waste any wine, we raised our glasses carefully and touched them together gently in a toast:

“To the future, anywhere but here.”

Then we drank. 

Tony poked Kay in the side while she was taking a drink, which made her laugh and snort wine out of her nose.

“Such a lady,” I joked, and she reached over and gave me a playful slap on the cheek. 

Her cheeks were flushed and she was smiling, and I thought: *You’re beautiful*.

It wasn’t the first time I had thought this and sometimes I wished there was a way we could be more than friends.

We all sat in silence after this, watching as dusk fell over the ocean. Then it was time to head to our homes.

As soon as he got to his feet, Tony was stumbling slightly and weaving across the sand – he was clearly a bit drunk. 

Kay and I avoided him as we did not want to get bumped into.

She looked at me as we kept our distance from Tony and said, “It’s cold.” Then she linked arms with me. 

Any thoughts I had of the cold were swept away. She felt so warm beside me and I could smell… I don’t know what it was. A scent she was wearing, the shampoo she used, or maybe it was just shower gel.

It did not matter. It was amazing and I was wishing we had miles to walk not yards when Tony came to a sudden halt.

He was staring up.

“What is it?” I asked.

He responded by pointing his hand at the sky out over the sea. 

I couldn’t see what he was pointing towards at first. Then Kay tightened her grip on my arm and gasped.

And I saw it then.

It was a shooting star. 

By my side, Kay gasped and said, “That’s so beautiful. It’s a sign that amazing things are going to happen to all of us.”

“Actually,” I replied, “shooting stars were often seen as portents of doom in medieval times.”

Kay let go of my arm. “You’re such a loser,” she said and then she walked away.

My heart sank – all the way through my boots, into the cold, lonely ground. Or at least that’s the way I felt as I watched her heading back to her parent’s house.

Tony was long gone but I did not care about him.

I trudged home alone.

I did not sleep well that night. I felt so stupid, opening my big mouth like that and once again wished me and Kay were more than friends.

When dawn finally arrived, I felt groggy and depressed. I dragged myself out of bed and felt too sad to shower so I pulled on the clothes I had been wearing the day before and went down to get something to eat.

My parents were both in their home office, presumably making more deals that would not work out, and I made it through to the kitchen without anyone asking me what my plans were for the day.

I hated it when my parents did that.

I emptied the last pack of cereal into a bowl and opened the fridge to discover there was no milk.

Typical!

Thinking how the universe hated me, I pulled on my coat and went to the village shop.

Mr Owens was on duty behind the counter. He was a short red-faced man whose idea of customer service was to look at you like you were about to try and steal a packet of sweets or a bottle of washing up liquid.

I wandered over to the milk, but decided cereal was too much trouble so bought two chocolate bars, some sliced cheese and a can of soda.

Breakfast sorted, I paid and got out of there. The weather had turned worse overnight and I had to put my head down as I walked into the wind on the way down to the harbour wall. There was a bench near there, next to the old church, where I could sit and eat.

The old church was the largest building in the village. It was no longer used as a place of worship. Like a lot of churches in small villages across the country, it had been deconsecrated because its congregation had fallen away to next to zero. 

It was now for sale with planning permission to turn it into a residential property. 

One developer had bought it a few years before, but they had gone bankrupt not long after starting work, leaving the inside of the old church half gutted and littered with debris. 

The exterior was a mess as well. The windows were boarded up and a No Trespassing sign was stuck to the front doors of the church. They were clearly starting to rot thanks to the damp sea air and the rain.

It was a shame that such a nice building was going to ruin in this way. 

Thankfully, it wasn't my problem. 

As I passed the harbour wall on my way to the bench, I saw that the Campbell brothers were working on their boat. It was low tide and the boat lay tilted over slightly to one side in the silt. The hull was filthy and worn, much like the rest of the boat. It looked barely seaworthy. I personally would not have gone out in it.

The Campbell brothers, Tyler and John, claimed to be fishermen, but I did not believe them. I was convinced they were the modern-day version of the smugglers which I had admired so much when I was a young child.

However, I did not admire them. I felt the opposite: I did not like or trust them one bit.

That day, they must have noticed me – we were the only people around – but they continued to work on their boat and ignored me.

That worked for me. I sat on the bench and opened the first pack of my feast.

After I had eaten, I should have gone home and gone online to check out career websites so that I could start getting my life into gear, but instead I drifted around the village and then walked for miles along the coast.

The inlets and caves were now just places I could be alone with my thoughts.

Hours passed and it was soon getting dark again. I had wasted another day and started to drift back towards the village.

I was about a mile away when something caught my attention.

There was a light flickering out at sea. It could only have been coming from a vessel. 

As the last of the light slipped away, I focused on it, and saw that the light was flashing on and off. It seemed to be a signal.

But who would a vessel be signalling to out here in the middle of nowhere?

My answer came minutes later when I spotted another vessel slowly making its way out to sea. Even from a distance I recognised the Campbell brothers’ shabby boat straight away.

My guts tightened as I realised what was going on.

They were going to pick up illegal goods and smuggle them ashore.

That was it. It must have been.

And, sure enough, their boat was almost at the other vessel now. 

The sensible thing to do was report the Campbell brothers to the authorities, but out here I knew I would have no signal on my mobile phone. 

All I could do was wait.

I did not think there was any way I could be seen by the Campbell brothers from out there on the water but instinctively I crouched down anyway. 

And it was lucky I did, because, about ten minutes later, I could see the Campbell brothers’ boat was heading back to shore – and if they kept on the same course, they would come perilously close to me. 

I crawled backwards until I was inside a small cave. 

On the plus side, this meant I was hidden from view if they should land close by.

On other side, if they brought their contraband into the cave like the smugglers of old, I was a sitting duck.

This had been a bad move.

I needed to make a break for it. I could be safely home in no time if I ran as fast as I could.

But it was too late.

The Campbell brothers’ boat was feet away from the beach and its engine was stuttering to a stop, and one of them – Tyler – was clambering ashore.

I swore under my breath and moved further back into the cave just as John Campbell appeared on the deck of their boat.

He was joined by two people whose faces were hidden beneath the hoods of sweatshirts. 

They must be the Campbell brothers’ co-conspirators in this crime, I figured.

Their presence also meant I was outnumbered now by four to one.

I started to feel sick with anxiety and I was cramping up.

I bit my lip and tried to stay as still as I could.

The two people whose faces were hidden were getting off the boat as well, helped by Tyler. He then turned to his brother and waved. John went back into the cabin and powered the engine back up and soon the boat was heading back out to sea.

In the meantime, Tyler had started to lead his two mysterious companions along the beach. They were heading in the direction of the village. 

I counted to ten then, despite my common sense screaming at me to leave it, I followed them. 

I kept at a distance, ready to make a run for it if they turned and saw me, but they seemed focused on keeping up a fast pace. 

The only thing slowing them down was the wind, which by now was becoming vicious. I was almost blown over at one point by a particularly fierce gust. 

It was the last thing I needed when I was trying to follow them without being noticed.

I was relieved when they at last reached the village. They headed round to the small back door of the old church. I was shocked to see Tyler take out a key, open it and usher his companions inside. 

He followed them, closing the door behind him, but leaving it unlocked. 

I was desperate to follow but, before I did, I needed reinforcements.

I messaged Kay and Tony, telling them what I had seen and asking them to get here now.

A flurry of questions followed. Then Tony told me there was no way he was leaving the house on a night like this, before adding that I was crazy. 

Kay, though, said she would be there as soon as she could. 

I was still cold, windswept and on edge, but I felt better knowing Kay was on the way.

And secretly glad that Tony would not be joining us. That it would just be me and Kay. 

A short while later she arrived. She was bursting with excitement.

“This is wild,” she said – far too loudly. 

I put my finger to my lips to shush her and whispered, “We can’t do anything to let them know we’re on to them.”

She nodded and added in a much quieter voice, “Are you sure we should not just phone the police?”  

“I’ve been thinking about that,” I replied. “What would we say? That one of the Campbell brothers is in the old church with a couple of strangers they brought ashore.”

The nearest police station was more than an hour’s drive and there was no way they would send anyone out all this way for something so insubstantial sounding.

Kay got that straight away.

“So, what’s the plan?” she asked.

Powered by the adrenaline pulsing through my veins, I grinned and said, “We sneak in and we get hard evidence that they are up to no good. Is your phone fully charged up?”

She held her mobile up. Its screen glinted in the darkness.

I gave her the thumbs up and crept towards the unlocked door. 

I opened it as slowly and gently as I could. At one point it creaked. It wasn’t that loud a noise but I froze anyway and stood there while my heart beat far too quickly in my chest.

Behind me, Kay giggled.

I turned and gave her a stern look. She put her hands over her mouth but kept laughing. 

Beginning to wonder if I should have just saved the day on my own after all, I entered the old church with her close behind. 

It was too dark to see much inside and for a moment we just stood and listened. I could hear voices, but they did not seem to be too close, so I chanced turning on the torch on my phone. Keeping it pointed downwards, I checked out our surroundings. 

We were in a small, empty room. There was door ahead of us, which Kay walked up to, opened sligthly and peeked through the gap. “It's very dark,” she whispered. “But I can see pieces of wood piled up where the pews must have been ripped out and broken up by the developer. We’re close to the bottom of the staircase as well. You know, the one that leads up to  the balcony.”

We had both sat through weddings and baptisms when we were younger and the church was still open, and we remembered its layout pretty well. 

“That’s great,” I whispered back. “Can you see Tyler and the others?” 

“Not sure,” she answered. Then said, “Yes. They are at the far end of the church, by the front doors. Someone has just lit a candle and I can see them bright and clear.”

“Ok,” I said. “Let’s try and get up the stairs and into the balcony. That would be a great vantage point to see what they’re up to.”

“Copy that Echo-Leader-Two-Six” Kay replied with a cheeky grin that was clear even in the gloom of the small room.

We made our way slowly up the staircase. There was no creaking, and we reached the balcony without Tyler or the other two having any idea they were not alone.

And now being spied on.

Until Kay tapped me on the shoulder, interrupting my staring and listening.

“Why did they get off the boat down the coast and not in the village?” she whispered. We were almost touching, and I could feel her breath on my skin.

I was tingling all over because of this as I whispered back, “If the storm had not driven everyone else indoors, they could have easily been seen if they had disembarked in the harbour. There was much less chance of them being spotted if they came into the village on foot.” 

“And what now?” she asked.

I did not know and shrugged.

A few moments later things became clearer.

Tyler’s phone rang. He listened without saying anything then put his phone back in his pocket, turned to the other two and said, “That was my brother. He has been listening in on the police channel. A tree has been blown down by the high winds. It is blocking the road. There’s no way we can drive you out of the village tonight. You’ll need to shelter here. You’ll be safe. No one will know you are here, and then we can take you tomorrow night”    

From their body language, they seemed angry about this.

Tyler told them he would get blankets and something to eat and drink for them and headed towards the small room which led to the back door.

Leaving just the four of us in the old church.

Me and Kay, whose closeness to me was making me feel slightly dizzy. And the two people who had been brought here, and who we still knew nothing about.

They started to pace around and one of them pulled back the hood of their sweatshirt. I could see now he was a young man, not much older than myself. His dark hair was cropped short.

And he was with a young woman. She had revealed her face as well. Her long dark hair hung loose over her shoulders.

Kay leant back in close to me and said, “Do you think they have come here to try and escape some awful situation in their country?”

“I don’t know,” I replied, “But even if they have, we still can’t trust them until we know more.” 

“No,” Kay said, “Look at them. They are just like you and me, only they are strangers. We need to help them.”

Before I could stop her, she was standing up and walking back down the staircase.

I kept my head down, cursing under my breath, while she made her way towards them.

They saw her – there was no way they could not – and stood facing her. They seemed tense, uncertain.

“It’s ok,” Kay said. “Don’t be afraid.”

She was only a few feet away from them when the young man looked her straight in the eye and raised his right hand. His palm facing her, he spread his fingers and continued to stare at her. Even from a distance I could sense the intensity of his gaze.

All of a sudden, Kay’s legs buckled and she fell to the ground, where she lay unmoving.

I felt myself panicking. I was losing it and no idea what to do.

I could only watch as the young woman approached Kay, leant over her, and said something which shocked me to my core: 

“I will feed on her first, brother.”

The young man shook his head.

“No, sister,” he responded. “We should not feed, not here in this small place. We do not want to draw attention to ourselves. When we reach London, we will be two strangers in a city of strangers and there can choose our prey without fear of discovery. For now, let her remain in the trance and we will be gone when she wakes with no memory of us. But be assured, my sister, we will drink her blood if the hunger grows too great. We will take that risk.”

As he said these last words, he smiled and drew back his lips.

A wave of cold terror passed through me.

I could see his teeth.

His long, curved fangs. They looked razor sharp. 

And I knew deep inside, in the part of me that was instinctively afraid of the dark, that he was not human.

That he was a Vampire.

The woman he had called sister was smiling as well and her fangs were revealed in the flickering candlelight. 

She was like him. An evil creature of the night.

And Kay lay helpless at their feet. 

I could not wait for their grotesque appetites to spiral and for them to hurt her. I had to act now. I had to save Kay. 

Not caring about keeping out of sight anymore, I leapt to my feet and ran down the staircase.

Only, before I knew it, I was not running. I was falling.

I’d tripped over my own feet and was tumbling awkwardly done the stairs. 

I landed in a heap, winded and hurting in loads of places. I scrambled back to my feet and stumbled forwards. 

The Vampires watched me. They both had narrow smiles on their faces. I could tell they were laughing on the inside at me. 

They thought I was a joke, not a threat.

Well, I would show them!

I gritted my teeth and ran at them screaming.

I was on a collision course and made a fist, ready to lash out, but they stepped out of the way with lightning speed and my momentum carried me into a pile of broken wood.

I skidded along until I came to a halt. Pain flared in my leg. There was a piece of wood sticking in my thigh.

I grimaced, took a deep breath and pulled it out. Its tip was sharp and covered in my blood. I looked away from it before I puked and turned my attention to the Vampires. “You… leave… my friend… alone,” I gasped. 

They laughed out loud at this.

I could feel the world around me blurring and starting to spin and knew I must be close to passing out.

That couldn’t happen.

I took a deep breath and grabbed a second longer piece of broken wood and used it as a crutch to help me get to my feet.

Then inspiration struck me.

I put the two lengths of wood together, making a cross, which I held high in front of them.

“Take that,” I yelled and waited for them to cover their faces and start hissing in agony. 

Instead, the man walked calmly towards me and said, “Some parts of our legend are true, others were invented by people who needed to get out more.”

Then he fixed me with his gaze and raised his hand.

I could not let him put me in a trance as well. 

In desperation, I lashed out with the sharp tipped bloodied piece of wood.

I could only hope that piercing a Vampire’s heart with a makeshift wooden stake was grounded in truth, not myth.

The Vampire looked at me. His eyes were wide with shock. His hands grasped the section of wood that protruded from his chest. Then his skin began to crack and fall away, and he opened his mouth as if to scream, but his jaws were nothing now but naked bone. With shocking speed his whole body collapsed, until all that was left of him was a pile of dust lying on the floor.

I stared at this, transfixed.

His sister cried out mournfully then turned to me and said in a voice pulsing with anger, “You will die for this. It will be a slow, agonising death. Your screams of pain will be exquisite to me.”

She took a step towards me.

Then gasped.

Looked down.

The point of a wooden stake was sticking out of her chest. She staggered, tried to turn and see who had done this to her. 

The other end of the stake on which the Vampire was impaled was held by Kay – who said, “No one messes with my friends.”

The Vampire snarled but it was too late, her body was already breaking apart and falling away and soon she too was nothing but a pile of dust on the floor. 

I smiled grimly and staggered over to the front doors of the church. I started to push at them.

Kay understood and joined me.

The rotting wood soon gave way, and we opened the doors as wide as we could, then stood and watched as the wind swirled through the old church, scattering the Vampires’ remains and making sure the foul creatures would never walk this earth again."

11bo1s9,5,2023-02-25,Need advice on doing internship in my own company with my peers,samk555,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/11bo1s9/need_advice_on_doing_internship_in_my_own_company/,"Hi 

I am an undergraduate CS student and been working as a freelancer for past few years in tech field which includes tech support , software development etc. My current field which I am working on is DevOps. Though I have great knowledge and skills of my field, I still can't find a part-time remote internship locally or internationally, perhaps, due to very few opportunities available for this field.

Because of that, I have an idea to make a small local company with some of my peers, hire some experienced players from outside (to mentor us and help in creating a corporate level environment) and then keep doing internship in it until I or any of our member find any good offer from another company. My idea is that everyone will be working and gaining experience under the supervision of those experienced mentors in our company and when they get a good offer, they can leave and start there. So atleast, we will have some experience instead of nothing.

I think initially, we can intern in our company without registering it and then after some time, we may register it with equity equally divided among all members.

I see many pros in this like

* Flexible working  
* Familiar same colleagues
* Gaining experience while contributing in our own business 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to know if this is something completely acceptable and will it be considered just like any other average internship at small startups. What could be its cons if there are any

Also please note that I'll make everything clear to the employer about this internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate any feedback or suggestions"

11boy90,0,2023-02-25,Badly need some advice,WhomstveIsJohnGalt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11boy90/badly_need_some_advice/,"

Hey, everybody. Crowdsourcing some advice here on Reddit to get some other perspectives.

I have two degrees, one of which is in economics. I graduated in Winter 2018 and spent the better part of two years looking for a job in the field with no success. Two things worked against me in that: first, I worked full-time through school to pay rent and didn’t get an internship, so I had no “experience” upon graduation. Second was that my economics professors were unanimous in their advice that learning SQL and Python were a waste of time for a prospective financial analyst and that I just needed to get certified in Excel, which was true in 2004 when any of them were last looking for a job, but an absurd statement by the end of the 2010s.

At some point toward the end of 2021, I realized that I’d be better off just learning to code and doing software engineering than trying to re-enter my financial analytics job hunt after being three years out from school with no job in the field. I spent the entirety of 2022 studying code (variously C#/.NET, Python, TypeScript, and Java), building projects, and applying to hundreds if not 1000 jobs. I went to all the Meetup groups in my city, networked in person every chance I got, followed every lead that was put in front of me. My yield was nothing, not even a single interview with a hiring manager. In absolute desperation, I accepted a position with Revature in December. As I’m sure some of you know, Revature is drowning right now and can’t place people, and they still refuse to give me a firm start date.

So, to sum it up, I am on my fifth year of trying to just get a toe in the door somewhere with no success, and I’d categorize my mood about it as despondent. “You have to have experience to get experience” has become like fighting a giant evil god, and I’m afraid that I will never beat it. I would greatly, greatly appreciate it if someone has an idea on how to conquer this."

I'm a new CS graduate, and I just finished in December. I'm currently in my late 20s and just trying to come up with a plan to take the job market and move forward. I don't have an internship, and although I do have a project that I was satisfied enough to put on my resume, I don't feel like I'm prepared enough, especially for this job market. Currently, with the layoffs and the number of applicants applying for entry-level swe jobs, I feel like I need a plan to focus on to keep level headed.

Currently, I'm thinking of getting a part-time IT job for a few months and brushing up on the skills necessary to create competent projects with a mern stack. I have experience with IT support but don't want to pigeonhole myself with only helpdesk jobs. I want to find an entry-level SWE job this year. I wasn't taught the MERN stack in my web development class, so I'm going to learn it using odin project and full stack open. I used odin project to study for my capstone class a few months ago, so now I'll just go back and finish it.

Honestly, it's hard to make sense of what to do given the market and my skill set rn. I don't want to screw myself over and make the wrong move. Any feedback or advice would be appreciated because it feels a little overwhelming currently.

Thanks!"

-for some reason, a lot of students don’t even have the confidence to apply, you can’t let yourself be the barrier to your goal, even if you think you’re not ready enough, you should still do it. this applies to not only internships, but joining clubs/academic honor societies, etc 

-summer internships are not over. They may be scarce, but they’re still there due to offers being regened/declined for other better offers. I talked to someone about this, and they mentioned how it was like “picking up another student’s leftovers”, 100%. In November 2022, I got a rejection email from X company, saying I didn’t “meet their minimum requirements”. Just yesterday they sent an email, saying I “meet their minimum requirements”, and whatnot. My summer internship that I secured I got from applying on February and following up on a career fair. The internship scene is more competitive right when doors open, but as recruiters scramble to find replacements for those who changed their mind, that replacement could be you

Hey reddit,

I'm 24yo and finishing my B.Sc in compSci in august. I've started working as a software engineer and really enjoy my job and what I'm doing.Thing is, I've always been fascinated with being a doctor and medicine in general was (and still is) super interesting to me, and thought about studying it, up until I stumbled upon programming and decided CS is my career path.

Now that I'm finishing my degree, I can feel the 'what if' voices coming about being a doctor and going to med school, and for the past months been thinking about actually starting med school and if and how I could combine both professions.

The courses I enjoyed the most during my studies were the Data Science courses which I can imagine that could go along with a MD degree, maybe for research or in a biotech company. Am I delusional or is this actually a thing I can pull off? Being both a physician and also use my tech skills for something?During my degree I took a bunch of premed courses, so starting med school will take me around 4 years to complete, and tuition fee is reasonable where I live so no worries about getting into debt.

I'm really confused about my next steps. My tech pay is pretty good right now and will increase after finishing school, but will probably decrease if I start school again and start working less.Another concern of mine is time. If i start med school it means 4 years of studies + 1 internship and then try to combine the (3-6) residency years and then maybe do some DS medical research.For less time I could pursue a masters in compSci/Data Science that'll take around 2 years to complete, and then land a DS job with an extremely high pay, but will probably mean forgetting about medicine.Third option is dropping the DS thing entirely and just stop with my bachelors, and work in the industry as a software engineer as I'm doing now (which I really like at the moment).

Also, for the doctors out there, I would really appreciate getting your opinion about being a doctor, the hours, the efforts, the pay, pros and cons and what do you think about moving from tech to medicine? does it have to be black or white, or it's possible to combine them?And a question for an even smaller subset, does anybody actually made the switch from tech to medicine and can share some tips and insights about their transition and journey? why did you choose to move from tech and start over in medicine?

Thanks a lot!"

I was interning at this NGO inside a specific CSR project last year. Based on my skills, they extended my internship and offered a permanent role to manage the entire tech infrastructure of the organisation which consists of running like 10+ portals, being the point of contact for them with the tech partners who develop solutions for them (Org does not know tech, only my boss does which is into management since 10+ years).

On the other hand, I have an ""Associate Software Developer"" offer from campus at a Product based Fintech. The pay is lower ofcourse but I'm looking to get the SDE experience which I don't think I'll get at the NGO.

I've personally done some previous internships, made some decent projects in freelancing. I do mostly backend and DevOps.

Just need some advice on whether should I get the tech experience first or do this consulting gig side by side and learn individually."
11bs64n,1,2023-02-25,"I went from one work project to 3 without any form of support, and my boss refuses to properly accommodate my ADA request.",ThrewAnAccountAway,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11bs64n/i_went_from_one_work_project_to_3_without_any/,"Throwaway Account here. For context, I work as a government contractor conducting research, I have a primary supervisor as well as sponsors to whom I report directly as well and interact on a day-to-day basis, as well as the department head who works within the government dept I work under.

I started this job very well with one project (Project A). I had an amazing group of folks with a structure that made it feel like I could be effective. We had short 15-minute meetings almost every day that allowed me to ask my sponsor what I should be focusing on, what I was planning on doing, what I have already done, and if I had any issues, almost built like Agile. It worked very well, and my sponsor felt I could grow very well, even if there were issues with my ADHD that were making it a bit hard, alongside COVID. Unfortunately, things took a sharp turn for the worst when I was informed that my project would be canceled. For almost 4 or 5 months, I was put in limbo after my group was scrambling to find funding, at some point, I was close to getting laid off twice.

I was put on two projects (We are calling it Project B and C) temporarily before there was more funding for an additional year to keep me on board, however, I had large issues with this project. For Project B, I only was going to be on it for one month, but I got COVID and I was shited to Project C with the ability to work remotely as I got settled and read about what I was doing. For one, I felt that my sponsors in this project did not really give me a proper layout of what to do, and they wanted to pass the torch along in a way to help guide some of the research done by one of our interns. We would have a single 2-3 hour meeting every Friday afternoon that felt like I would waste time, it often felt that it ran over the limits. Rather than discussing the project as a whole and understanding how everyone's parts were involved, I felt that I was leading the project because I was informed I needed to create a presentation and explain what I did, what I wanted to work on, results, etc. It felt like a massive project progress report and made it overwhelming for me because it made me feel like my bosses were expecting me to lead the project and I had no information of what my status was on this project if I was a primary investigator, a co-investigator, a contributor, etc.

I was also never informed in writing about changes to my remote work agreements. These were on the sole basis of the project manager. In this case, they demanded that I worked on-site every day. They were also informing me that I had to be present and ready to help from 7/8am to 6 pm. Our department has common hours of 9:30 am til 3 pm. I am salaried and exempt, but this was becoming an issue in the next year, as now I would only put 20 hours to this project and then later 10. When I asked if I could at least work a 4/10 schedule, my supervisor (for my current company) related to me that I wasn't ""reading the room"" and that they said that they refused to even allow me to a 4/10.

With the new year approaching, I was now on three projects (B, C, and D), one of which was an extension of my prior work. I was a co-investigator, which means I now have a greater responsibility for the work being done and I am properly aware of my responsibilities. I asked for a 4/10 because it would give me an extra day to go to therapy, work on doctor's appointments, etc. I live at least a half hour away and I was close to a lot of medical resources, and even that is not enough. Project C and D were the majority of my time, and Project B was as needed.

My supervisor would later inform me that I was going to be put on a performance action plan, which to me was basically probation. At that point, I informed my boss that I had a disability: ADHD, Autism, Depression, Anxiety, and (more recently since I got rediagnosed) PTSD. In addition, I have medical issues that do not help me with work, including psoriatic arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea due to nasal polyps, allergies, and asthma. I struggled to even get a diagnosis until after January and my current psych is now starting to doubt my diagnosis after Adderall was not working and Ritalin and Concerta were giving me panic attacks and gave me heart problems. In the PAP, they revoked my ability to work remotely except on an as-needed basis, and I now had to coordinate with 7 people about my time off and if I needed to get remote work done and relay that information to my supervisor. I had to email 7 people about my progress by a set time limit, I had to email **7** people every time about this. I remember once my car was broke, and my boss was not liking the fact that I was coordinating this with people at 10AM about this. She then insisted ""your department is early, you should have been emailing them at 8AM"" and refused to even seem to understand how my disabilities work right now. With the ADHD and PTSD, I struggle to sleep. Sleep Apnea (even with the CPAP) is helping but my polyps make it hard to breathe. My ADHD and ASD are now making it hard for me to even function and make choices properly.

Right now, I work mostly on Project D, and put 10 hours a week on project C. Project C is still adamant about me working remotely, whereas Project D has been extremely open to my concerns and my sponsor for that project listened to me and agreed that the accommodations put into place were not enough and even supported me working remotely to an extent. For one, every time we meet, she makes sure and asks if she wants to send a recap of what we did to me. we still have meetings every other day, she makes sure I am taken care of, and understands when things are slow.

I was cleaned out of the PAP, but I feel extremely overburdened. I feel lost and clueless. With the reduction of hours, I was told that I would focus more on one side of the project rather than the other. I feel like Project C is trying to use more of my time and make me go OT which I will not get paid for, but the project still gets charged. I do not know what to do, I keep on getting conflicting information about my actual responsibilities, and while I should have told my supervisors about times when I am not doing project responsibilities, I feel that these responsibilities are not properly documented in a way that makes sense for me. Project C was unwilling to write things down for me, allow me to recap any issues, provide feedback as frequently, and to be honest, I feel intimidated by my sponsors after their lack of willingness to help me. My supervisor, who saw the potential accommodations written by my therapist at the time, and also used a lot of stuff from askjan, said ""these are things you can do yourself"" and all that was provided was access to JIRA that I got no training for and two lamps. That's it. They were not going to discuss remote work until after the PAP, and to this day, Project C, the project I only work 1 hours a week and makes me want to be on-site from 8 til 6, refuses to even let me work a single day from home. But y'know, one person is remote almost the entire time, the other person is part time and attends meetings remotely too, and the two that demand me working on site everyday I've seen leave at 4pm sometimes without even telling me. We have two interns too that do not have the skills I asked for when they were hiring, and so now I now have to learn new skills to help solve issues on my projcet.

I really do not know what to do anymore. I am scared, I am frightened, I have a meeting with my supervisor when I come back from leave on Wednesday. I already took sick leave after a sinus infection last week, and I took 3 days off because I am simply too overburdened and had to see family a few hours away. I am scared, I am spiraling down mentally, and I think this meeting will get me fired. I'm struggling to find a simulant that works for me, and I'm struggling to even find a therapist that will help."

1. Going on exchange
2. Working at an internship
3. A selection course

 I firstly applied for the exchange program to Japan, Korea or China, as it is my final goal to land a future job in Japan. With my current score I couldn't get the offer for Japan but instead I got the one for Korea.

I'm getting to the existential point that, after giving it some thought I would prefer to develop professionaly, instead of personally (such as going on exchange). I'm pursuing the game development path (don't know in which area just yet) but after giving it a lot of consideration I don't know what to do to for now. Right now I have the interpretation that going on exchange conveys some paid vacations to my college, and honestly I'm not willing to go on vacations when I can at least help my CV grow by making a selection course at Computational Graphics.

I know that going on exchange is a one in a life chance of getting to enjoy your college life and working will come later, but right now I'm really motivated to do what I didn't do on my junior years, which is developing projects of my own to help my CV grow.

Not completely ditching the idea of accepting the Korea exchange program, I'm also looking on what does the university offer to my career (It is Yonsei). 

But do you have any advices?"

I plan to work in software engineering/web dev out of college and managed to secure an SWE internship for this summer. I am permitted to take summers off from my support tech job to accommodate for internships (it's a very laid-back job that is mainly worked by college students, so there's a lot of leeway for unpaid time off for school and internships).

My concern about this is how I'm meant to order my work experience on my resume. My SWE internship (and any other SWE internship I'll get in the future) would be far more relevant to my goal and the jobs I'll be applying to, which makes me think that I would put them higher on the list. But I would still put that I presently work as a support technician, so would that be at the top, even if that job isn't as relevant to any opportunities I'm looking at?

To better visualize this, what would be more appropriate:

**Version A:**

SWE Internship (Summer 2023)

[insert internships/dev experience above tech role, even if not presently working]

Support Tech (2022-Present)

**Version B:**

Support Tech (2022-Present)

[insert internships/dev experience below tech role]

Just looking for some perspective from those who know more than I, because I am currently very lost in life. 

I graduated in 2021 with a degree in CS from a university in Ontario (not Waterloo). During school I completed one 16-month internship but it was more IT support work than development. 

My next job experience was working at a bank for a 6 month contract. Again, it was IT/documentation work and not dev. However I found myself deeply unhappy with the job, foremost because there was very poor training and I often felt like I had no idea what I was doing. That contract ended in May 2022, and foolishly I thought I could take some time off to ready myself to get back to work. Now, before I knew it, there is a 9 month gap on my resume with only a couple months of part time work as a wine salesman. 

I kept telling myself I would work on side projects but I have no idea where to start and the road to re-learning how to program seems almost insurmountable, even though I thought I was good at it in school. So I have nothing to show for those 9 months.

So, as the title states, I’m wondering if you guys think it’s even possible for me to break back into the field, or if you think it’s time for me to face reality and try something else. Any advice is appreciated and I will answer any questions. Thanks."

So before I start I'd like to make my disclaimer. Which is that I know in this whole IT/Cybersecurity world when it comes to getting jobs asap a Computer Science degree reigns king. But that is a degree I do not wish to go for. Simply because advanced math isn't my strongest suit. And I also know that an IT or cybersecurity degree is pretty much deemed useless unless internships are involved. So I'm aware I'm taking a risk. My end goal is ultimately to work remotely and I am willing to work my way up from the bottom first in order to achieve it. Whether it's at helpdesk or any other entry level job I'm unaware of. And sure I know there are those who'll say that for this there's no need for a degree at all and just go for certs. But I first want something more sustainable such as a degree. Sure I may sprinkle one or two certs on top of my associates degree with a home lab just in case but I just wanna get my foot in the door first. I'll eventually have access to my GI Bill, but I'm having trouble deciding between going for an associates in IT or in Cybersecurity. So if your goal was to just get into an entry level IT job with a degree and possibly 1 or 2 certs like A+ or Sec+ and you wanted to eventually become a Network or Systems engineer who could work remotely. What degree would you pick a cybersecurity associates degree or one for IT. And also what else should I be teaching myself if I wanted to either become a network or systems admin. So with all this said I just want to get my feet wet no matter how horrendous my first job may be, stay in IT for a few years, and once I've made more money I'd like to transition to Cybersecurity with the use of certs and my associates. Does this sound like viable plan? Thank you in advance everyone."

They then offered me a full time job as a software developer and I've been there since September. I took the job because it had better pay and good benefits, plus I liked the people and environment.

I heard that it's easier to find future job opportunities when you already have your first full-time dev role, but I'm worried that won't be true if I don't work for a well-known company. My current one is a navy contractor and they've got great contracts and stability, but they're not as well-known. Just wondering if it'll be harder to get interviews and land roles in the future."

I really want to work in investments, banking, and financial management. I know I’m just a freshman and I shouldn’t be worrying too much about internships as I don’t have much technical skill yet, but I really want to land the interviews at least just so I know I’m doing well. 

My experience involves being a business development intern at a startup fitness company and being the director of professional development of a well known (national scale) marketing association at my school. I also have experience in software solutions such as an AI internship and financial internship at Cisco. 

Should I incorporate these computer science experiences into my resume? I know I have to tailor my resume to the job I’m applying to, but does showing computer science hinder my application to finance and investment positions? Should I even mention I’m double majoring in CS? 

Any tips of how I can land interviews at mid-top firms? I think I have a solid resume and got it reviewed through many stages.

Cheers."

11c70nb,1,2023-02-26,My (23F )boyfriend (24M) told me that I called his family racist.,dmn661,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11c70nb/my_23f_boyfriend_24m_told_me_that_i_called_his/,"My bf and I are going through an extremely rough patch. I have been trying to forgive him for disloyalty but it’s been hard and we argue daily. We have been together for 3 years and I started to noticed that he is not the brightest nor emotionally intelligent. 

I am not in the U.S., I am in the Caribbean so race is kind of a weird-ish topic. My boyfriend is white Caribbean and also hispanic. His mother is light skin hispanic but the rest of the family is white. I am dark skin black. His family’s generation and their associates are known as the “white islanders”. They are usually wealthy, all date within each other’s circle and were once slave owners on the island. While not all of the white islanders are racist, it is evident that darker skinned people are not their first choice. A certain group are known for even throwing away their cups if a black person uses it. I have had many instances growing up where I was made fun of for my skin color. Thankfully, my mother instilled that black is beautiful from a young age so while I was never insecure, the thought that people MAY be racist always lived in my head, especially if I am the only one in the space. 

When my boyfriend and I first started dating, my social anxiety was at an all time high. I was extremely nervous to be around his family and would sometimes refuse to get out of the car because of this thought it the back of my head. I would shake and hyperventilate and eventually got on meds to calm down. At social events, my thought would always be “I am the only black person here” and would be uncomfortable. I was the only white person at my corporate job as an intern once and I felt the same way. I never really shared this with anyone besides my therapist because it has just been something that I always think about. 

Eventually, his mom and I got super close and I warmed up to his family and started hanging out more. My mom has a friend who is a cleaning lady and happened to be cleaning for his family once. I guess that I came up and the lady said to his mother that I am a very nice and smart girl and that she shouldn’t worry about my “color”. His mother assured her that their family is not racist. This always was in the back of head because obviously my color is something that one would think is worrying? 

Anyways, flash forward to tonight when were having a few drinks and of course started arguing. I had a mere sip of mine and he was slightly tipsy at this point. He brought up the past and mentioned something about me being weird for not wanting to come out the car into his family’s house when we first started dating. I said well yeah I was nervous just in case your family was … and he finished the sentence by shouting “ RACIST?? YOU JUST CALLED MY FAMILY RACIST??”. He said he knew it all along. I tried to explain to him that I didn’t say his family was racist but this is something, as a black person you always have in your mind ( especially given the history on the island). He started going completely wild saying that he’s done with me for calling his family racist and he always knew I thought that. I kept trying to calmly explain to him that the source of my initial anxiety was that but I have gotten to know his family and seen that they are not. I tried to change his perspective by telling him what the cleaning lady said and tried to show him that race is a big factor. Big mistake. This set him off even more and he started to call my mom crazy and it just escalated completely.  I was bewildered at the misunderstanding and just started to break down. He kept twisting my words and I eventually gave up. We got home and he took a few things and left and said he’s never coming back to my home. 

I have seen this relationship at its end for a while now so I guess that’s it but I just want to hear an unbiased opinion. Am I in the wrong here?? Should I have worded what I said differently?


TLDR: I am black, my boyfriend is white. When we first starting saying 3 years ago I had extreme social anxiety to be around his family in case they were racist. He brought it up again and I explained to him my thought process and he said I called his family racist and that he was done with me. Am I in the wrong here?"

11clszk,163,2023-02-26,The Mocking Gallery,XRubico,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/11clszk/the_mocking_gallery/,"The painting came from nowhere. No extant records anywhere in the gallery named the mystery artist or when they created it, and it bore no signature. No witnesses, no footage, no trail, cold or otherwise. Officially, it did not exist. And like many anonymous transgressive works, it patiently gathered dust in the back room, appearing only when the night shift sought a quick peek at the new batch of imported, exotic figuratives. The impossible painting shocked its first audience so harshly, the security guard had to settle for ogling the gallery’s older exhibits instead.

Tynwe, the gallerist, caught word of the painting and ordered it brought to his office the following day. There he could discern its provenance; he would have it known across the galaxy that no one knew art better than him, though in truth he simply had a wider vocabulary of esoteric art buzzwords like contrapposto and trompe l’oeil and sniflegot.

But his employees refused to deliver it. It was supposedly so hideous and grotesque, so affronting to the senses, that going near it summoned bile faster than ipecac bitters. They couldn’t touch it, let alone bring it to Tynwe. In all his years in the Flostuanis art community, never before had he heard of such a painting, nor had he ever worked with anyone so spineless, and he’d once toured with the freedom-loving septa-cephalopods, but they at least had the courage to swim upstream. These damned soft-hearted universities didn’t prepare people for the harsh world of the cruel, back-breaking upper-class sects of pseudo-modern art and wine appreciators, and he’d be loath to donate to one again.

Tynwe’s words of admonishment fell short, however, upon viewing the painting in the gallery. Perhaps not gag-inducing as the thankfully unpaid interns had insinuated, it was off-putting, in a way.

The image was simple. Direct. A ruined city — a war zone, if the massive craters and collapsed buildings were any indication — sprawled across the background landscape, devastation from frame to frame. Mangled bodies littered the pock-marked ground in lurid red piles of rent flesh. Weapon barrels protruding from the crimson mud still smoked. Every corner marked a terrible tragedy that directed the unlucky viewers' attention to the centre.

Sitting in a foxhole, sharing a cup of something poured from a sock-stuffed can, were three humans smiling and laughing, their guns spent at their sides. Whatever battle raged, these three did not care. Indeed, they seemed to enjoy their time among it. They looked battered and worn, their uniforms reduced to near rags from cuts and tears and stained holes, but an undeniable mirth came from the scene as one of them gesticulated broadly as if in the middle of a story. 

Tynwe had no words for this. Style and form notwithstanding, it made no sense. War engulfed them, and they relished a joyful tale like death wasn’t a few steps away. Humans were dumb, but they weren’t that dumb. He hadn’t spent much time with humans — their “art” always professed distance from their cave-painting origins, though clearly, they weren’t that far — but he had read many free articles online, which was more than enough to absorb any cultural metaphor this painting lacked. It had nothing to say beyond the colour, a common failing of the amateur artist.

Yet he could not deny the visceral effect it had on the viewer. It offended, it insulted, it reeked of naive cruelty and sadism. Despite its dreary subject, though, Tynwe suspected the intention was not disgust, but some kind of morbid edification, the nature of which he could not identify. If it sought to teach, it made no student of him. If it was to warn, it only made him wary of the worryingly realistic dripping reds. And if it was to simply look nice, it failed at that, too. He considered it as he would a lengthy, florid obituary: it took the long way round to say something simple yet unapproachable. What the painting actually said, he could not comprehend.

He wasted the day considering his few options. Displaying the hideous painting at the upcoming gala was a non-starter; people paid for the social atmosphere and generous open bar, not a roadside freak show. Selling it posed the similar problem of interacting with people sick enough to appreciate it in earnest. For longer than a fleeting moment, Tynwe entertained the tempting idea of burning it, brittle frame and all. He’d never believed himself superstitious, not like those silly humans, but the human storyteller’s impish smile, stretching impossibly from ear to ear, seemed directed over Tynwe’s shoulder, as if exchanging a knowing glance over his head. The feeling went unappreciated, so he abandoned the thought altogether, warier than ever of the countless portraits watching from behind him.

When closing time came and he was no closer to a resolution than the morning, the security officer — whose name he never bothered to remember — knocked, wanting to see the painting again. Exhausted of patience and options, Tynwe allowed them inside. The officer beheld the painting again, hemming and hawing, humming all the while.

Tynwe lost himself as not the audience of beauty, but in observing the beholder. The officer’s face twisted in befuddled discomfort, then consternation, then some hybrid conjoining of arousal and constipation, before wrapping back around to discomfort again. Clearly, they enjoyed themself, but serious work went into the contemplation required. These were always the best works, Tynwe thought, the ones that you don’t typically want to be on the receiving end of. Then why did he hate it so?

After a minute, Tynwe cleared his throat and asked what the officer thought the soldiers were laughing at. They studied the painting a mite longer, then said, “Maybe it’s a pun.”

Neither were satisfied with that.

The painting’s missing words haunted Tynwe for days as he prepared for the gala. The placid, expressionless faces of the venue’s greatest hits teased him in their smug indifference, and with each of his clients’ works assiduously put on display, he retreated to the back room, where he kept the all too human painting hanging under the storage area’s single swaying bulb. He caught himself visiting it multiple times throughout the day, rushing in as if to catch it unaware, to steal a moment of its story. Still, the laughter stayed quiet. The joke, the ribald tale, the ostensibly hilarious corner of the inimitable human condition, whatever it was, remained frozen on their smiling faces. Having the laugh but not the punchline was an answer without the riddle: an easy end without the hard and heavy. Tynwe hated it.

The day before the gala began, the RSVPs all returned and accommodated, Tynwe had an idea. On his sixth trip to the painting that morning, the back room’s door wedged itself open. The morning’s light reflected off the gala’s triptych mosaic stained glass and stole in, casting in fractal colours the human painting. Somehow, it looked even more hideous, as the mosaic’s patterned design segmented the painted war zone. Colours melded randomly. Rigid lines divided incongruous shapes, accentuating empty space. If one of his workshop students had painted it, Tynwe would have tossed it into traffic and forced them to fetch it.

But the overlapping pieces, both professional and primitive, showed him that his own humble impression, as much as it pained him to admit it, was not enough to accurately scrutinize this painting. He needed help.

Tynwe cleared out the cluttered back room, stashing the contents in the foyer, cordoning them off with velvet rope and labelling the pile ‘Post- post- postmodern.’ If any of the gala’s visiting veterans had questions about it, he would say something about needing to be conceptually enlightened to ‘get it.’

He hung the human painting on the wall opposite the door, which now wouldn’t close, and draped an old curtain over the entrance. A few underlights, a small credenza, a generous spritzing of myriad disinfectants — the impromptu display looked, smelled, and felt like a proper exhibit. Only certain clients, the chosen ones he trusted enough not to blab without explicit instructions to do so, would be accepted inside. The security officer — nameless, still, for who needs to remember the help — volunteered to stand guard, so long as they were not needed inside. Tynwe felt it worth mentioning that hazard pay was not a thing in the art world, save for adventurous archeology and political fundraising, but didn’t bother doing so. Exposure was enough, he thought.

For good measure, he mounted a handheld camera beside the frame, pointed into the room. He had only one genuine first impression on record -- the purest lens through which to appraise new art, Tynwe thought -- and it was the philistine with a flashlight. This way, he wouldn’t miss another chance at solving this enigma.

On the gala’s first night, Tynwe gave his prepared speech for the magnanimous something-or-other campaign — he could never keep track of them all. Between the half-hearted attempts at sympathy and the notable attempts to speed it up, he subtly praised his clients’ funding efforts to make him filthy rich, though not in so many words. The speech was eloquent, sufficiently loquacious, and so full of hot air it was a wonder he didn’t float away.

He ended the speech with a tactless salute and set himself to searching the crowd for patrons with a sizable grain of insight. What insight looked like, he didn’t know, but the fact it took him longer than two minutes made him question if he was associating with the right people.

The first lucky patron was an older Flostuanis client, a successful artist and starving academic. She regularly attended these functions, even when she wasn’t invited, which lent her an egotistical air that only earned expertise could back up. Tynwe brought her to the back room under promise of an exclusive viewing of unpublished, anonymous works. Not a lie, but an obfuscation of truth better suited for end-user license agreements. He needed pure, raw reactions if he was to understand this piece; no amount of nerdy book-learning would suffice.

Immediately upon seeing the painting, the client fought the urge to purge, as the officer was keen to point out. Tynwe studied her reaction, keeping her well in frame. The gross depiction of even grosser humans stunned her into silence, and as she examined the smiling faces in more depth, Tynwe saw the shared fascination spread across her face.

He gave her a few moments before asking, “Why do you suppose they’re laughing?”

Without hesitation, brimming with surety, she said, “Well, they’re mad, of course.”

“There’s not much to laugh about when you’re mad.”

“With all reason gone, I can’t think of a single thing worth taking seriously.”

Tynwe glanced at the humans again. “They don’t look it, surely.”

The client laughed. So close a mirror to what he sought, but clouded with sneering derision. “Madness in like company is just good conversation.”

They spent the remainder of the gala’s first evening debating madness and its methods but arrived squarely nowhere resembling common ground. All they could agree on was that a human surely painted the piece, as no other race could confuse and irritate another like this.

The night closed, and Tynwe retired. When sleep would not come, he obsessed over the footage of the client’s reaction. Subtle ticks and curves in her face belied the suppression of shock, but Tynwe, masterwork socialite that he was, saw through it. Pensive curiosity, maybe. Professional disgust, absolutely. But it was only a painting, he had to remind himself after the sixteenth rewatch. How could it, a human creation, bestir and aggrandize and dyspepticize and other words he thought he knew well, when his own work, certainly superior to this, had never made anyone give so much as a perfunctory roll of their eyes? If only he had had the foresight to record his own impression of her impression. 

The day after, the gala was in full swing. Tynwe made his glad-handing rounds for a while, nursing the Brin consulate’s stale pale ale, and found his next subject. Such terminology, in this sense, seemed anodyne enough, as ‘experimentee’ was too cold and the ‘victim’ headline never pairs well with anything other than ‘lottery winner’s expectant family.’

As professor emeritus of one of those softer universities Tynwe loathed, the Oherxtciine (pronounced as it’s spelled) philosopher had adopted the peculiar human fashion that comes part and parcel with tenure. The professor’s tweed jacket had six kinds of fabric sewn into his six elbows like he had taken the corner pieces of different puzzles and figured they’d fit regardless. He must do a lot of leaning, Tynwe thought.

Tynwe brought him to the backroom, promising the same as he did the Flostuanis patron. The same shock, the same morbid interest. He hoped it wouldn’t get old. He pointed the camera at the professor and asked about the laughing again.

“It’s a metaphor,” he said, pointing at the background’s bloody devastation. “War births death for the sake of life. Only the dead can rightfully laugh at irony like that, and since these humans have consigned themselves to death, they have the right to be in on the joke.”

“You don’t think they’re mad?” Tynwe asked.

“Possibly. When it comes to politics, we’ve all got a bit of crazy in us.”

“Now you think it’s political?”

“Politics may not be in the paint, but they certainly guide the brush.”

“Do you always speak in bland aphorisms?”

“When I can, yes.”

Tynwe dismissed the philosopher and rejoined the gala. He searched for another subject, someone not so snooty, but came up short. While the patrons filed out the gallery’s doors, he watched the reaction footage on his office computer, scrutinizing every angle to see what, if anything, there was to laugh about. Sleep wouldn’t dare interrupt him.

The final night of the gala, he found a suitable subject with some unsubtle eavesdropping. A young student of his, a tall and burly Meshin sculptor who carved stone in his own image, had just returned from a cross-colony orienteering trip in human space. He opined over the amazing beauty of this and that, the natural splendour of here and there, none of which anybody wanted to hear. Proximity to humans, however, was a boon on which Tynwe was not about to pass up.

Again, the painting came as a surprise. There are many more ways to describe a shocked face, so pick one and stick with it — that should do you fine. Tynwe asked the same question, expecting something inanely anecdotal, like every travelling story ever told.

“They’re just weird,” the student said.

“Could you elaborate?” Tynwe asked.

“Probably not, no.”

“So the fact your sculptures’ heads are always hollow isn’t a coincidence, then?”

The student shrugged. “Humans just do weird things sometimes. I knew this one guy who jumped out of low-atmo shuttles for fun.”

“Thrill-seeking isn’t unique to humans,” Tynwe said. “Nor is stupidity.”

“Without a parachute.”

“There is evidence to the contrary, of course.”

The student carried on, explaining the ins and outs of cross-colony traversal, even after Tynwe left the room. The gala was empty now, the evening’s energy spent. Finding a subject would be impossible without reaching out, which carried the risk of his carefully curated reputation taking a hit; in a culture predicated entirely on subjective opinions, clandestine meetings become gossip, and gossip becomes pointed fingers. But everybody has been taught, by either a caring parent or a broken phalange, that pointing is rude, no matter how fun it may be, so the intolerance for the practice translated more readily to polite-by-proxy isolation. If no one spoke or worked with him, they couldn’t be rude.

This would be the death of the gallery, though. Contacting new subjects could ruin him; only he could find the answer now.

Tynwe watched the patrons’ footage for hours but learned nothing, so he let the student’s endless story play in the background as he thought on it. 

He felt the fool for projecting something human onto something so unlike them and hated how useless it made him feel. The distance he sensed between him and the painting, the unknowable space lost in visual translation, was too wide to bridge. It was as if he stood ashore, trowel in hand, while the brook babbled on about how wonderful life was on the other bank.

A part of him wanted to hang it publicly, scream out, “See what I mean?” as if that would justify the utter rage he struggled to stifle. Again, though, the thought of destroying it arose, but burning unlikeable art is rarely indicative of victory. Selling it, too, posed a problem. Whatever he did, the painting would have won.

His spiralling daydream was interrupted by a soft chuckle. The video had continued, long after the student left the frame, and standing before the painting was a lone human. He didn’t share the shock and recrimination the others had, smiling instead, and his short laugh jingled the many medals draped across his chest. After admiring the painting for another silent minute, the human left with the rest of the gala.

Tynwe had missed it. The one chance he’d had at understanding this joke, and he missed it.

He swallowed his pride — and a few fingers of bottled brown — and dove through his garbage for the discarded RSVPs. Somewhere among the rotting hors d'oeuvres and general trash was the human invitation, though he had no memory of actually sending it. He tore through the colossal heap of waste, powering through the astringent stink with a fervent zeal he’d never felt before. A famous gallerist, dumpster diving in the name of art. There was something there, he thought, something obliquely poignant, but he blinded himself to everything except this infuriating painting. The answer lay with the human, wherever he was.

The RSVP card was stained with numerous sauces from dishes he didn’t think he’d served but still had the human’s name and number legible. A quick online search gave Tynwe an address not too far away.

He lugged the painting, bulky frame included, to the human’s residence, blood rushing to his ears in giddy anticipation. Running on days without sleep and smelling like death warmed over, he must have looked the madman. The laughing figures in the frame taunted and teased him, louder and crueller than the last few days. But he’d show them. A concrete answer lay only a few steps ahead at the human’s door. He knocked, and the human opened.

“What’s so gods-damned funny?” Tynwe shouted, holding up his torturer.

“I don’t know,” the human said calmly. He pointed at the painting. “But I’ve heard that one before.”

Tynwe dropped the painting on the stupid, no-good, confusing, annoying, incomprehensibly weird human’s doorstep, and laughed all the way home.

So people describe me as very animated, silly, bubbly and boisterous . I’m very colorful with my language and vocabulary. I often tell dramatic stories. I’m relatively outgoing and friendly. I smile at everyone (except for creepy old men lol). I’m not overly hyper but just super giggly and kind of always on (if that makes any sense).

Currently I attend an engineering school where people are way more introverted and quiet. Even the more social people are like not very animated. Everyone seems somewhat awkward (I’m a little awkward too but in a different way). Obviously not everyone fits this archetype but it’s common for people here to just be more standoffish and academically focused (I care about my academics but I’m most definitely not gonna talk about school at a party)

I’ve been getting the vibe that people generally feel uncomfortable with me here. I can just kinda see it in their faces. Like I’m this high energy alien creature. 

It’s just weird because I’ve never struggled so much socially until now. I literally did an internship last year and my social life was glowing and I had great friends. Now , nothing. Like I don’t even get invited to things anymore .

Should I change to fit the culture more ? I’ve been joining clubs and I’m noticing similar results. If I had time I’d go to the schools nearby but they’re slightly too much out the way.

Help lol"

I am trying to figure out the best route for me to take to eventually break into the industry. I am working on a full-stack project for my senior capstone and actively teaching myself as much as I can. My only internship experience has been a year of Tier 1 support at my schools Helpdesk. So with the lack of knowledge, projects and internships I understand I likely have a long road ahead of me before getting a job as a dev.

I know everyone always says that you don't need a CS degree, but others will say it definitely helps get your foot in the door. Even though I'm only 22 I feel like I've been making so many career mistakes/wasting time figuring out the right path for me.

I am stuck between going back to school for a post-bacc or masters in CS and leveraging internships during the program. Or should I make use of my bachelors to work an IT position until I can learn enough on my own to break into SWE.

Is my IT degree completely useless and will I pigeonhole myself for taking an IT job? Is there any point in going back to school for the CS degree if I already have an IT degree? I appreciate any insight and tips that anyone can give me!"

Same for me when I studied, I worked part time at a web agency for several years. Maybe I mix up the terminology, but it seem to me that what americans talk about as internship is a fixed period of 12-16 weeks where you work full time in the summer break or as a master thesis mixed job in your last semester or so

I recently got an appointment for an interview for a dream internship on a really

Thing is, there are a LOT of requirements (experience in C++, Arduino, Python, Labview, Matlab, CatiaV5, along with general stuff like being good with tools and plane knowledge) and my knowledge in a few of these softwares is dubious at best (I’ve never written a single line of C++ code)

So I have a few questions;

a) Should I be worried about not meeting all the requirements? (they are listed as “our ideal candidate would have experience in: …”) Or do they expect you to have experience in only 50-60% of the softwares listed? Do I need to cram crash courses on C++ before the interview?

I landed two internships in IT (cybersecurity) and truth be told I really don't know what I want to do more, IT path or web development. However I really feel like I shot myself in the foot by not getting a CS degree. I am debating going back for another degree at some point, perhaps online, but have also heard that it's not worth it to get a second bachelor's and to self-teach into the job I want and eventually get a master's instead. I really only care about salary - I honestly enjoy coding, IT, and all things tech. I just am really bad at math and such, which made me not get a CS degree to begin with. My resume is much more IT angled at the moment, but I have my web dev projects and languages listed on there at the moment. IT salaries just kind of throw me off, they seem very underpaid until you break out into higher positions that a CS degree would help me earn faster anyways.

I am a Junior at University, who has been seduced by NM Mutual at the career fair about a month ago. First however, some background information would be useful: 

I started out Uni as a Philosophy major, who then after this past summer, transferred into the business school and made the major into a minor. I am still graduating on time and have decided that I wanted to pursue Finance. So far I am excelling at the courses and find finance to be interesting compared to all the other business majors offered. 

Career/Internship wise, I was planning to get my first internship (this summer) as a sales rep, which I have two interviews lined up for two separate companies. At the fair, I was sucked in By NW Mutual and thought to myself that I found something big, something that would set me off for the future. 

Flash Forward to today, where I spent a majority of this morning researching the company and reading reviews on the internship. I am now quickly learning that this internship is more of a scam and a joke than the big thing I initially made it out to be. 

Now I am left as a crossroads... I have the sales internships to try, but I would love to try to get into a more financial-type of internship. Are there any types of places I could start looking into now, or is it too late? I would love to hear what financial internships you guys have had and what types of companies/banks I should reach out to. Again, the sales field is fine to me, but I am interested to hear what other financial opportunities are out there so that I have a broad range of paths to consider and explore.

Thanks for reading"

&amp;#x200B;

**This season, I applied to 315 companies for an internship. Here are my stats:**

&amp;#x200B;

|Number of Applications|315||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Number of Rejections Total|143||
|\-|Resume Rejections|115|
|\-|OA Rejections |22|
|\-|Interview Rejections|6|
|Number of Offers|3||

&amp;#x200B;

Total Rejection Rate (%)		45% 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I wear my rejections as a badge of honor. I even printed some of them out to nail to my wall to remind myself of THE GRIND. Every rejection got me closer to GLORY.** 

&amp;#x200B;

If you haven't gotten an offer this season, let me tell you why. The recruiting this season has been 100% RNG, even more so from last year. I did not hear back from companies whose OA's I nailed. I got resume rejected from every company I applied with a referral. 

Literally, I know mid-people who got offers with 20 applications., I know some people I know who are way better than me who haven't gotten jack. Gotta spray and pray with your applications, and hope that one of them stick (This is assuming you can do most LC-Medium questions). 

Anyways, I applied to 315 companies. 142 of them were nice enough to reject me. Never heard back from the rest (The latest application was around \~2 months ago). I know how frustrating that is from 1st hand experience, so I decided to share those companies with y'all, enjoy.

Currently I am in my mid 20s, in the UK, and trying to develop my professional career. 

Originally, I am from Vancouver, and decided to do a two year working holiday in the UK and get the chance to work in Michelin rated restaurants. At this point, I have worked in smaller, relatively ""lax"" restaurants and had just came out of Covid, and graduated in 2020 from university. 

Once in the UK I had worked in Michelin for about 3 weeks before I decided that the work was too unrewarding and that the atmosphere was too stressful. Head Chef would get stressed out and start throwing pans into the dish-pit or it would come out in small aggressive acts. 

I proceeded to try and use my degree to find a job / internship. From May to December of 2022, I had approximately 12 interviews and didn't land a single offer. So I decided to go back into the Culinary field and save up money for a Masters degree or just for the sake of having money.

The restaurant I ended up working in was by a world known chef/person that paid well but, I didn't feel satisfied with the use of my time because there wasn't much to learn. so after that I decided to pursue a job back in a michelin rated kitchen... this was a huge mistake.

Once I was offered a decent amount at a highly rated kitchen I decided to take the offer. During the trial, everything looked fine. However, once it was the time for service, the initial problems I had noticed in the first place was completely amplified. The Sous Chef was moody, kept hurrying everyone, while the head chef was complaining that I was working too fast and it was causing him to be too anxious. Throughout the night, I was doing prep, garnishing, etc. assisting the CDP. And throughout the night, the head chef and sous chef would be making fun of the CDP and hurrying him along even though the CDP has worked with both of them for 2.5 years. At some point I had a question for the head chef and told me to ask the CDP. When I asked the CDP the CDP mentioned that I shouldn't ask the head chef questions etc. I was asked to clean the plancher/flat-top and asked the sous if there was a prefered method that he wanted me to use, and got called out for not knowing, then when I did do it the traditional way that I have been taught for the past 5 years, he called me out for using vinegar. 

One of the worst first shifts I have ever endured. Regardless of it being ""michelin"". 

To summarize : This experience had made me run around in a circle and I am so stressed out by my life choices. I don't feel like I have accomplished anything."

I'm struggling to understand what I should focus on with this goal in mind. I enjoy programming and stats, but at my school, UW Madison, a data science double major would more so prepare me to become a data scientist, although many data scientists become ML engineers since the two are related. Instead of that, I could take more stats classes to gain a better math background. At the same time, though, both of these paths would take away from the CS courses I'd otherwise take to become better at software engineering, another key component of being an ML engineer. My current issue, for example, is whether to take a CS elective like intro to AI, a stats class, or a data science programming or modeling class to fill out my course load. Ultimately, should I double major in stats, data science, or neither if I want to go to graduate school to pursue the ML engineer career path? Another question I have regarding this is whether to focus on research or internships, because grad school would theoretically correlate to research, but I'm not looking to get a PHD.

Frankly, the company pays pretty low and there is little room for growth. There is not much room for mentorship anymore.

2. My internship is lasting waayyy too long. At this point, I have domain knowledge and productivity of a junior dev while I’m still in school and with a below average pay ( &lt; $20/hr) even for an intern.

I’ve always thought an internship no matter the pay and no matter the responsibilities would be great as long as I learn, but It’s getting pretty fucking tiring waking up at 6 am (no remote) being expected to do the same work as my coworkers while being paid less than half as much.

Is it great that I can work at an office job making as much as a walmart stocker while I study? Yes. But what I really want to know if it was worth getting those extra months of professional experience or if I should have quit a long time ago."

Building pipelines, scheduling tasks, manipluating data, mining it etc. What I dont know is what is it that cloud engineers really do.

Now, while I was looking for intern positions on data engineering I've realized that the job ads mostly include those:

Cloud software Aws etc, containers (docker etc), scheduling (airflow etc), parallel computation frameworks (hdfs, spark etc), bashscript, linux server knowledge.

However it seems to me that 70% of requirements do match with cloud engineering requirements.

I dont know where to ask this question. It matters both fields. But is it easy to switch between cloud and data engineering? Does they do mostly the same job. If it is, what are the most differing parts?"

My career thus far has   been a rollercoaster - and I've provided more details below for anyone   who wants more context.

What can I realistically do instead?

\-----

**THE VERY LENGTHY BACKSTORY:**

As   a kid/young adult, I really wanted to be an aerospace/rocket engineer.  I  was a good student in high school, graduated valedictorian. With a  3.96  GPA in my sophomore year (2007) of college, I got a summer  internship  at a major jet engine manufacturer. The role was a  statistical  reliability analysis engineer. I really enjoyed it but felt  conflicted -  I wanted to jump into design. At the end of my summer  internship I  informed my recruiter that I wanted my next internship  with them to be  at a different part of their organization that was  involved in rocket  design.

Junior  year (2008), I got  distracted by a girl and my grades slipped a bit. I  reapplied to the jet  engine manufacturer, but I was not invited back.

Still   reeling from that rejection in my senior year, I got desperate,   applying to all of the major aerospace companies while improving my GPA.   With my mother breathing down my neck, I applied to multiple positions   at each these various companies (Boeing, for example...I must have   applied to 50 different open engineering positions there). I'm pretty   sure I got blacklisted in my desperation. Second semester rolled around   and hadn't gotten any bites, so I applied to a mechanical engineer   internship program under the Marine Corps. I got accepted, then breathed   a sigh of relief that I would have a roof over my head after   graduation.

I graduated from   college in 2009, and then started my Marine Corps internship. It was not   what I expected - there was very little design work, with the role   being focused on acquisition contract management (and taking tons of   useless online classes). To make matters worse, my homeport coworkers   were extremely offensive (I overheard one of the managers refer to me as a ""faggot""). So I quickly pursued external assignments that were   mandated by the internship program.

I got a paid course in CAD design for one of my assignments, but  realized  that I wasn't going to be able to put that to any use in the  full time  role offered at the end of the 2.5-year internship. So in  2010, I quit  the internship program in my frustration and started  job-hunting.

It was a rough  start, and it certainly held me back. I never managed to  get a job in  aerospace, and ultimately abandoned my pursuit of that  industry. After  toiling away for a couple years doing tech support at a  CAD software  reseller, I finally got a job doing product  design/engineering work.

The excitement gradually dissipated as I never felt truly connected to my   employers. I am now in my 7th post-collegiate job... so on average,  I've  job-hopped roughly every 1.7 years. While I love designing and   engineering things in CAD, I have repeatedly found that the environment   around design engineers is completely stifling. ""Design by committee""   has become the norm while deadlines get shorter and suppliers get   lazier. Rather than invest in development time, companies force   engineers to quickly release products that then have to be patched up in   production. If the losses are severe, companies love to accuse   engineers of developing bad products... but the reality is that we often   work our asses off reconciling requirements conflicts to then be left   with a fraction of the development time that we actually needed. And   don't get me started on Steve-Jobs-wannabe types who think it's their   god-given right to change project requirements minutes before launch.

I have relocated to different cities and states along the way - I  started  on the east coast and am now in the midwest. Ironically, I now  live in a  city that is considered to be a hub of the aerospace  industry, with a  major Air Force base and tons of aerospace contractors  that employ a  large percentage of people around here. I often wonder  what my career  would have been like if I'd started out here. I have  close friends who  are involved in projects at the base, and I'm sure  they would be good  professional references. But I have little desire to  revisit the  problems of my early career. One of my friends started a  systems  engineering job on base and I could only laugh when he  described the  endless pointless online courses he was taking - because  I'd been  through the same experience over 10 years prior! And even if I  wanted to  reattempt a start in aerospace engineering, I'd have to go  through the  security clearance process again and explain why I quit my  government  internship years ago.

Given my  complicated track record, I don't want to deal with problematic   engineering design jobs any more. I have a marriage and mortgage to   maintain, and I can't realistically job hop out of my geographic area.   But... I'm not sure what kind of alternative job would be a good fit and   easy to get into without a huge financial setback. My skills are   extremely concentrated around SolidWorks CAD / SolidWorks PDM  Administration, and so I'm not sure how I would navigate a role where   those skills are not needed. I do have some rudimentary knowledge of VBA   coding and statistics, and a little bit of project management   knowledge. But those tasks don't excite me much and I don't have any   illusions about making a career out of that stuff. And I don't see myself taking on an engineering management role, as I feel like that would be pouring fuel on the fire.

What should I do?"

When should I start leetcode? I want to start before school starts and I’m currently taking Harvards CS50 course, is that course all I need to start tackling leetcode problems?

2. When should I start applying for internships, around when are the different cycles for internships? I’m going to Northeastern next year so I’m guaranteed some experience through their co-op program but I would like to try to get internships earlier or between co-ops.

3. Is there any sort of resume template or anyway I can make my resume stand out? I’m hoping to start a project soon, but I’ve seen a lot of people say that their resume straight up just doesn’t get read even with projects and stuff is there anyway I can make my resume stand out to bots and interviewers so that it at least gets flagged as worthwhile?

4. For technical interviews are they done digitally or in person? I was wondering if it’s worth learning to be comfortable with white-boarding problems instead of just typing them out.

5. I know Python is the best language for technical interviews but what other languages are worth learning? Idk python, as of now I mainly know C and Java but I plan on diving more into Python over the summer.

6. Are Hackathons and clubs worth it? I’ve seen a lot of people say it’s not really worth it to do them as they don’t really matter much, mainly in regards to clubs as I’ve never liked clubs in high schools it just seemed like we never did anything worthwhile and dealing with people who were just there to get a fancy officer position for their resume rather than anything they enjoyed doing

7. In high school I did an internship for a digital health marketing company where I helped make their website and create graphics for PowerPoints and make write ups for patient interviews. Should I include this on my resume? it’s not heavily related to CS and it is from high school.

8. Are their any certifications or other courses I should do that could help?

9. Should I do a 4+1 program where I get my masters directly after my bachelors for only a year? Or if I have a good job offer is that worth taking instead and putting off my masters for a few years?

10. That’s most of my specific questions any other tips and tricks anybody has for me?"

I will be finishing my PhD in aerospace engineering in a few months. This looks good and all. But I am an international student and won't be able to land an aerospace engineering job in US whatsoever(there is a law that prevents international from working in aero field) and I don't want to do an academic job.

So my question to you is this. Do you think it is a good idea to get a MS in ML/AI and pivot into the tech industry? What are the pros and cons? How would the hiring managers view this career choice as? 

To give you some background, I know fair bit of HPC/ some programming language(Fortran/C)/ Minimal working knowledge of ML/AI(did an ML internship at big tech(I honestly I just got lucky that time)). 

You might be wondering why I don't try to land a big tech job with just PhD in aerospace engineering degree. I have tried for the past 6 months. I got zero interviews for whatever reason it is. (economy is down/ my skillset sucks/idk)"

**Additional Information:**

Phew, that was a lot. Not sure where to start exactly, feels like a place to just rant about life. I supposed I'll start with my thoughts on my application. 

* ACT/SAT: Regret only taking once and also only studying for a month in early senior year. I was originally thrilled with a 34 but looking back I know a 35 was within reach. After I got my ACT I took the SAT for fun (since I had already signed up) and really goofed up the English I guess, oops lol.
* Extracurriculars/Honors: I completely understand that this is likely the part of my application that lacks the most. With a mix of poor guidance (I had no clue what I was doing lol) and limited opportunities in Area 51, I attempted my best. 
* LOR: Was also going to have my tennis conditioner submit a LOR, but he essentially ghosted me? It was quite disappointing since we were close, but I suppose he either wasn't comfortable or used to writing one. Hopefully, this wasn't too big of a pitfall. 
* Deferral Forms: Mentioned how I picked up a new internship at university where I learn about machine learning and then apply it to some projects. I was originally supposed to do this in my junior year but I became too busy, and despite the fact I can't put it anywhere on my resume, I truly find it enjoyable even for the workload. 

Well, I guess that just about sums it up! Feels like I just told my whole life story in the past four years ahaha. I was originally disappointed by my EA round, and I constantly fumed at the difficulties of OOS CS when applying to public universities favoring in-state students (\*cough cough UW, my dream school ahhh). After a few weeks to cool down, however, I realize that I am very thankful for everything and all my opportunities to even be in the situation I am in, no matter the decisions. We all did our best, and I know with confidence that we will all thrive where we end up!

Let me know if you have any clarifying questions, I'm sure I'll be anxiously scrolling this subreddit as I await decisions in March. As for Venmo, I'll be super shocked if anybody correctly guesses 10+/13 decisions (accepted, waitlist, rejected) considering how random admissions can be, and how inaccurate all my friends and family were for my EA round. But, if someone is able to predict them, I'll be happy to Venmo the first person who made the prediction (with the most correct) $20! Best of wishes to everybody!!!"

Currently I  have a degree in finance and have been applying to jobs for a year but I can’t seem to get hired anywhere. I don’t have the technical knowledge, or I don’t have enough experience that is relevant to what the job is. My problem is, I can’t get a job for experience because all of them want unrealistic experience but I also can’t do something like an internship to get experience because I am no longer enrolled in college. So I have a series of questions/ concerns:

I am considering a return to college right now to counter this problem. Recently I have realized that I want to work as some kind of analyst (business, data, banking, finance etc.) so I have decided to pursue economics or statistics. I was wondering if anyone had any insights on which is better for analyst roles. 

The biggest problem I am facing with this is how to finance it. I am still paying off my undergraduate degree. I was thinking of getting a masters but I don’t want to screw my self over because I don’t have relevant work experience. I was wondering what methods people on here have used to finance graduate degrees while still paying off undergraduate degrees and other payments. 

Finally I am trying to figure out where exactly to go to study either economics or statistics. The way I see it, it only makes sense to go to a well known and fairly highly ranked university because of the connections, alumni network, and job placements. For now I am considering UW, Seattle U, ASU, U of O, UCLA, USC, Cornell, NYU, and Columbia. Does anyone know of any others I should look into? 

Thanks for your help!"

11d3mb8,1,2023-02-27,Maybe I just expect too much from people...,StuckinConfusion,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11d3mb8/maybe_i_just_expect_too_much_from_people/,"Maybe this is where my disappointment lies with people. I don't know if its ADHD related... most likely not.

Though I feel like with all the mental  issues and emotional issues I have, I hold a pretty good ship for people who need me. 

But for me... I feel like jesus. I feel empty. I'm pretty pissed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Truth is, I've not only slowed my life down due to ADHD and etc etc  but  the fear of going out in life and knowing at one way or the other I'm going to have to depend on people and fall flat on my face.

I'm going to have to interact with people. Be around people. Try and build relationships with people.

Something about the sensitivity that in the end, having to deal with the outside world, I will always feel disappointed because in my head I was hoping for something more from others.

In my head, I'd get some sort of justification that I'm on the right path and not letting diagnosis derail me from what I'm trying to succeed in if my relationship with others does well. 

Every part of my life has in one way or the other, been shut off because of the social experiences I've gotten from them. I don't like working in public. I don't even like the thought of going back to a college campus. The idea of trying to form a academic network with professors makes me want to gag. The thought of befriending others makes me want to roll my eyes at the back of my head. 

Though all of those things were something that I wanted. Deep down, I'm resentful that when I tried to get them, it failed. Not because I did something wrong all the time but...its like the people I wanted them from, intentionally refused to meet the expectation. 

How can you, or why would you want to be around people who could potentially shut down any sort of relationship intentionally. It doesn't even have to be romantic or platonic. Just a relationship that helps me reach my goals, get an internship, get into circles I've always wanted to be involved in. Partake in simple hobbies etc etc. How can you have a life where people just...fail you???

&amp;#x200B;

I know I sound psychotic and obsessive. I always get this thought that maybe my expectations are too high. 

A good example of this is my college years. I hate college or rather I hate the people there. I swear talking to those people felt like talking to  a brick wall. The problem is that college, at least in my opinion, is not supposed to feel like you're talking to nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I find myself talking to a brick wall. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from brick walls."
11d3mnq,1,2023-02-27,"[VA] I went from one work project to 3 without any form of support, and one my boss refuses to properly accommodate my ADA request.",ThrewAnAccountAway,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/11d3mnq/va_i_went_from_one_work_project_to_3_without_any/,"Throwaway Account here. For context, I work as a government contractor conducting research, I have a primary supervisor as well as sponsors to whom I report directly as well and interact on a day-to-day basis, as well as the department head who works within the government dept I work under.

I started this job very well with one project (Project A). I had an amazing group of folks with a structure that made it feel like I could be effective. We had short 15-minute meetings almost every day that allowed me to ask my sponsor what I should be focusing on, what I was planning on doing, what I have already done, and if I had any issues, almost built like Agile. It worked very well, and my sponsor felt I could grow very well, even if there were issues with my ADHD that were making it a bit hard, alongside COVID. Unfortunately, things took a sharp turn for the worst when I was informed that my project would be canceled. For almost 4 or 5 months, I was put in limbo after my group was scrambling to find funding, at some point, I was close to getting laid off twice.

I was put on two projects (We are calling it Project B and C) temporarily before there was more funding for an additional year to keep me on board, however, I had large issues with this project. For Project B, I only was going to be on it for one month, but I got COVID and I was shited to Project C with the ability to work remotely as I got settled and read about what I was doing. For one, I felt that my sponsors in this project did not really give me a proper layout of what to do, and they wanted to pass the torch along in a way to help guide some of the research done by one of our interns. We would have a single 2-3 hour meeting every Friday afternoon that felt like I would waste time, it often felt that it ran over the limits. Rather than discussing the project as a whole and understanding how everyone's parts were involved, I felt that I was leading the project because I was informed I needed to create a presentation and explain what I did, what I wanted to work on, results, etc. It felt like a massive project progress report and made it overwhelming for me because it made me feel like my bosses were expecting me to lead the project and I had no information of what my status was on this project if I was a primary investigator, a co-investigator, a contributor, etc.

I was also never informed in writing about changes to my remote work agreements. These were on the sole basis of the project manager. In this case, they demanded that I worked on-site every day. They were also informing me that I had to be present and ready to help from 7/8am to 6 pm. Our department has common hours of 9:30 am til 3 pm. I am salaried and exempt, but this was becoming an issue in the next year, as now I would only put 20 hours to this project and then later 10. When I asked if I could at least work a 4/10 schedule, my supervisor (for my current company) related to me that I wasn't ""reading the room"" and that they said that they refused to even allow me to a 4/10.

With the new year approaching, I was now on three projects (B, C, and D), one of which was an extension of my prior work. I was a co-investigator, which means I now have a greater responsibility for the work being done and I am properly aware of my responsibilities. I asked for a 4/10 because it would give me an extra day to go to therapy, work on doctor's appointments, etc. I live at least a half hour away and I was close to a lot of medical resources, and even that is not enough. Project C and D were the majority of my time, and Project B was as needed.

My supervisor would later inform me that I was going to be put on a performance action plan, which to me was basically probation. At that point, I informed my boss that I had a disability: ADHD, Autism, Depression, Anxiety, and (more recently since I got rediagnosed) PTSD. In addition, I have medical issues that do not help me with work, including psoriatic arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea due to nasal polyps, allergies, and asthma. I struggled to even get a diagnosis until after January and my current psych is now starting to doubt my diagnosis after Adderall was not working and Ritalin and Concerta were giving me panic attacks and gave me heart problems. In the PAP, they revoked my ability to work remotely except on an as-needed basis, and I now had to coordinate with 7 people about my time off and if I needed to get remote work done and relay that information to my supervisor. I had to email 7 people about my progress by a set time limit, I had to email **7** people every time about this. Around this time, I decided to report to HR that I had a disability and discussions started about how to properly accommodate me. I remember once my car was broke, and my boss was not liking the fact that I was coordinating this with people at 10AM about this. She then insisted ""your department is early, you should have been emailing them at 8AM"" and refused to even seem to understand how my disabilities work right now. With the ADHD and PTSD, I struggle to sleep. Sleep Apnea (even with the CPAP) is helping but my polyps make it hard to breathe. My ADHD and ASD are now making it hard for me to even function and make choices properly.

Right now, I work mostly on Project D, and put 10 hours a week on project C. Project C is still adamant about me working remotely, whereas Project D has been extremely open to my concerns and my sponsor for that project listened to me and agreed that the accommodations put into place were not enough and even supported me working remotely to an extent. For one, every time we meet, she makes sure and asks if she wants to send a recap of what we did to me. we still have meetings every other day, she makes sure I am taken care of, and understands when things are slow.

I was cleaned out of the PAP, but I feel extremely overburdened. I feel lost and clueless. With the reduction of hours, I was told that I would focus more on one side of the project rather than the other. I feel like Project C is trying to use more of my time and make me go OT which I will not get paid for, but the project still gets charged. I do not know what to do, I keep on getting conflicting information about my actual responsibilities, and while I should have told my supervisors about times when I am not doing project responsibilities, I feel that these responsibilities are not properly documented in a way that makes sense for me. Project C was unwilling to write things down for me, allow me to recap any issues, provide feedback as frequently, and to be honest, I feel intimidated by my sponsors after their lack of willingness to help me. My supervisor, who saw the potential accommodations written by my therapist at the time, and also used a lot of stuff from askjan, said ""these are things you can do yourself"" and all that was provided was access to JIRA that I got no training for and two lamps. That's it. At the same time, when I asked before about working a 4/10, I was told ""I wasn't reading the room"" by my supervisor passing information by my sponsors. They were not going to discuss remote work until after the PAP, and to this day, Project C, the project I only work 1 hours a week and makes me want to be on-site from 8 til 6, refuses to even let me work a single day from home. But y'know, one person is remote almost the entire time, the other person is part time and attends meetings remotely too, and the two that demand me working on site everyday I've seen leave at 4pm sometimes without even telling me. We have two interns too that do not have the skills I asked for when they were hiring, and so now I now have to learn new skills to help solve issues on my project.

I really do not know what to do anymore. I am scared, I am frightened, I have a meeting with my supervisor when I come back from leave on Wednesday. I already took sick leave after a sinus infection last week, and I took 3 days off because I am simply too overburdened and had to see family a few hours away. I am scared, I am spiraling down mentally, and I think this meeting will get me fired. I'm struggling to find a simulant that works for me, and I'm struggling to even find a therapist that will help."

11d4aff,17,2023-02-27,My internship is proving a bit...weird. Any advice?,lilnugget21,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/11d4aff/my_internship_is_proving_a_bitweird_any_advice/," Hi, everyone! This is going to be a bit long. (It's also cross-posted with r/ MuseumPros)

I applied for an internship working at a prominent history museum in the lower southeast, and I'm having a few issues with it that are making me feel a bit anxious. For one thing, the interview went very well, and the director was glad to learn that I wasn't doing it for school credit (I'm in college) because (loosely in his words) there wasn't as intense of a timeline for him to get back to me. So, my friend that got it heard back much earlier than I did because she *is* doing it for school credit.

This remark did bother me a little, but I didn't think much of it until I never heard back from him about the internship. At first, I just accepted that I hadn't gotten it and started making other plans. I was super excited for this opportunity and to put it on my resume, as it promised real museum work and opportunities to work in archives as well as other areas of the museum. It was also paid and was right up my academic alley. But it was going to be a bit of a commute anyway if my ride fell through ($20 uber ride there and back), so I figured maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

Around two or three weeks after my interview, and after hearing absolutely nothing while my friend had already received confirmations and everything, I received an email from the director telling me that I had gotten the internship and that a bunch of things were going on at the museum and he had gotten extremely ill, so he hadn't been able to get back to me. He apologized for the short notice and asked if I could come in that week on a certain day. He said he understood if it was short notice. Unfortunately for both of us, it was incredibly short notice, as I had multiple meetings scheduled that week and then, over the course of the next week would have multiple doctor's appointments for a disorder that I have recently been diagnosed with. (Also---around this time, I told my friend who had gotten the internship and she was like, ""He waited this long to tell you? That's so strange."" And then told me that he had rescheduled her first day twice already.)

So, I had to ask that we move the time that I come in for my first day in response to that email about my first day. He never responded, and I sent two follow up emails. My friend told me that he had mentioned that he wanted to give me an internship and she excitedly (she has memory issues) advised that I email him. I told her that he had already offered me the internship, so that was a bit weird. And she responded, ""Oh, yeah. That is really weird."" So, I emailed him again, and there was no response for a few days. Since I was getting zero response from him, and I am still a full-time college student who volunteers often, I just continued on with my normal schedule as I had not been officially scheduled and he never responded letting me know that the day I was available to come in was a good day or time. When he finally responded, he said he was glad I was interested in the position (for the second time, since I had already accepted it and he had already said this to me) and asked if I could again start that week. Again, I could not because not only did he ask me with very little notice, he also wanted me to come in at a time that I am very certain I told him several times I could not come in at.

Both times he asked that I start within at least a day or two of the email with at least a week between each, and then never responded to any emails asking him for details or anything. Finally, he sent me another email last week, and it was really cryptic and confusing. I asked in the first email if I could start on a certain day like a week out so that I could move my schedule around now that I was certain I had the position, and he didn't respond at first.

The next day, he told me that he ""guessed"" he could make part of the position remote for me, and said he wished to see my availability so that he could figure out if we could work something out. I never asked for any part of the position to be remote, and I expressed this in my response to this cryptic email that I \*think\* may have been meant for someone else. I told him that I just needed to start on the day that I indicated so that I could ensure that none of my schoolwork or volunteer work would interfere with my time at the museum.

And then he just...never replied? Never confirmed weather the day I asked to show up was okay or not, never let me know if my availability (which I remember writing down for him during my interview but idk maybe I imagined that??) worked with the position, and never explained what he meant about making the position remote when I never asked him to do that?

I'm just super confused. I really did want this position, but I can't help but feel like this is a little too much like my last job when I worked at an ice cream shop and they did something very similar with the way they hired me, never trained me, and then bullied me for it in front of my coworkers and customers (who in turn bullied me as well because I guess they thought I deserved it??). All this plus the fact that now I legally can't drive due to my medical diagnosis, and I don't know the specific times that I am going to be working so I can't plan to use public transportation (which is particularly awful in my city), or to get a friend to drive me...it just feels like not a great idea to pursue this, no matter how good it looks on a resume.

My mom keeps telling me to try calling him, and to just try to work something out where I can come in later and take public transportation (but he told me during the interview that I'd need to work mornings, so idk about that). And my roommate suggested to me that maybe it's one of those things where they just expect you to show up and intuitively know what's going on? They suggested I just go at the time I suggested and hope they let me work. Originally, my mom told me that it probably just looks like to him like I never have any time to work, but I'm honestly just confused if that is the case considering all I've been asking for is clarification and a confirmation of which times work for him when he states a time and I say that time doesn't work, does this one work? Especially when they are times that I already expressed during the interview don't work with my schedule.

What do y'all think? Because this feels like.... not how things are supposed to go with an internship. I feel weird for asking him if I could come in at a later time twice and then saying I don't want the position anymore, but this is incredibly off-putting to me. I also hate the idea of having to give up on another job/internship opportunity that I could possibly learn a lot from, even though every time I feel like it's for the best not to do something or I get a major professional ick from someone, I'm usually right. Idk.

1. Should I put this experience on my resume/LinkedIn? (I will be using lots of very relevant technologies and modern tech stacks as well as be very involved in the development life cycle)

2. Is startup experience valuable or even considered as actual software engineering experience or at least equivalent to an internship?

3. How exactly do you explain a startup to future recruiters/hiring managers do they like to hear this kind of experience? Or is it better left out of the conversation/resume

4. It is a very dedicated team and I think that it has potential to go far but what if I’m the future the start up fails, will my experience not count if the startup ceases to exist?"

After my post I took everyone’s advice and figured out where I could be going wrong and stuff and I sorta double checked everything I did ,I did and still do some silly mistakes ,like it just skips my mind as a mistake (btw my internship is in cs) …but overall I would definitely say my work improved significantly,but at every possible turn my company has made me doubt myself …for starters I was a told to port an application over to an old codebase like 10 or so years old at this point which I did and it passed all the tests I wrote successfully ,but it didn’t pass one merge test ..I was immediately told that the mistake was on my side and over the course of two weeks I spent countless hours often losing sleep trying to figure shit out …and then I gave up ..told my supervisor it’s beyond me,they still insisted the problem was in the port I made and would take a look at it whenever they get time ,cut to 2 weeks later they found out the problem was in some niche code made in a commit well over 5 years ago ….okay I agree should have stumbled on the bug when I reviewed it but it slipped past me …it was soo tiny …but they kept blaming the bug on me for weeks that I significantly lost the confidence in my abilities. 

They also gave me some other things to work on ,like add enhancements on some projects some of which were beyond my scope ,but I studied in detail about it and came up with a pretty good implementation and it’s something I am proud but to till this day but the code has never been reviewed and merged and deployed ,everytime I ask them about it ..I get the same message that I am busy now …maybe next month . Several  weeks ago I found out that they are implementing something similar in the new codebase …but I wasn’t called in the on the discussion once and the implementation discussed was pretty similar and when I asked my supervisor about it ,they mentioned something along the lines of they forgot I did that and next time they do it ,they will call me which hasn’t happened so far . I feel like most of the code I have written since I joined here hasn’t even been reviewed or used at all …it’s almost like my code contributions mean nothing to them .
I did ask for a review and was promised one several months ago but so far hasn’t happened 
I wriggle my way into working on their new codebase and I am assigned tasks ,which I complete on time but I don’t get invited for the same discussions/meetings when other interns get to attend it.
Whenever some interesting work is there …I don’t get a chance to do it …some person who has been here longer than me gets it and promises to involve me but so far it hasn’t happened . 
Additionally they don’t respond to me on slack at all unless they have something they need from me ..till then they don’t respond …and if I visit them in person they have an annoyed look on their face .
I feel like I am being intentionally mistreated ..or am I overthinking ? 
What should I do …should I just leave this internship at the end of my contract so as not to burn any bridges? Or do I try to repair this ? Or do I leave immediately?"

And as US-China relations get worse, I just feel like I might be shooting myself in the foot by working at TikTok.

I definitely would not work for TikTok long term because it conflicts with my morals. But personally, I don’t mind working there for 2.5 months since I don’t think I’ll have a large enough impact to make a difference in the company. But I’m worried that other companies/recruiters may not think the same.

I'm wondering if companies would be sussed out and view my previous experience at TikTok as a possible liability. Some of the companies I'm planning to intern/work at in the future include tech companies (both big and startups) and possibly HFT firms.

Could anyone provide any insight into their thoughts about interning at TikTok? How do I know for sure that employers won’t ding me for working there? Any past experiences of discrimination bc of work at TikTok?"

**Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Earth β. Local Date: July 14th, 2136**

“For the United States of America, I christen thee *Constitution*. May God bless this ship and all who sail in it.”

The crowd of assembled sailors, workers, and other dignitaries cheered as the woman broke a bottle of champagne on the corvette’s hull - and such applause was well deserved. The sale of three *Vermillion*\-class corvettes to Earth Beta’s United States had been a topic of hot contention back on our side of the portal, but was ultimately pushed through to cement the budding alliance between the two factions.

It was agreed that the US would locally source the materials for the hull, as most of the metals used in its construction were readily available, while the UN was to provide the FTL drive, weapons systems, and the electronic warfare suite.

While technology systems were loaded onto - *lord above! -* steam locomotives and railed to their assembly point in Cape Canaveral, American Space Force personnel were taken through the other side of the portal to be given a crash course in space-based warfare and FTL safety at the Geneva Spaceflight Academy, brushing shoulders with their UN and Swiss counterparts.

Given the comparatively primitive state of Earth Beta’s shipbuilding industry, I considered it nothing short of miraculous that the first ship to be launched - USS *Constitution* \- was built in only a month. To give credit to the people of this alternate timeline, their knowledge had proven to be more directly applicable to 3000-era shipbuilding than we had assumed.

With regards to the staffing of the ships themselves, a tentative agreement had been reached. With Beta’s inexperience in combat - but also in a situation of desperately needing to learn it - it was decided that staff officers would be drawn from the UN’s North American Union, and within the framework of the NAU, overwhelmingly from the UN-side United States itself. Beta’s American officers, fresh from a hurried 3-week course at Geneva, would fill out junior positions until the experience to operate a warship independently was acquired.

“She’s a beauty, isn’t she, Lieutenant Baker?” A voice came from behind me. Turning around, I was greeted with Beta’s Space Force General Jackson, commander of the Orbital defense satellites and now *provisionally* in command of the budding flotilla of corvettes.

“She certainly is, sir,” I replied curtly.

“I must say, I’m surprised that it only took a month.” He looked thoughtful. “Maybe I shouldn’t have opposed the portal expansion.”

“It was well worth it, sir,” I reassured him. “If we hadn’t increased the size of the portal by a few meters, you would’ve had to produce *everything* domestically.”

Jackson gave me a steely look in response. “Not fast enough to fend off the Faceless, yes, but we could have done it in time. You’d do well to remember that, son.”

“My apologies, sir.”“No need.” He directed his gaze back to the ship. “At any rate, you’d best enjoy the festivities while they last. The second this is over, that ship is being loaded up and getting sent on its shakedown cruise.”

I looked at him, baffled. “That early? That’s against convention!” Ordinarily, UN convention entailed, at minimum, weeks of checkups and testing to ensure the craft was up to UN safety and regulatory standards.

“The Faceless don’t care about convention. I’d rather have a half-trained crew up there than none at all.”

“You’re certain they’ll come on that fast?” I asked.

“I’m betting on it,” Jackson replied. “If they were able to detect us back in ‘44, they’re probably not far off from coming back, now that we’re almost back on the same footing as we were back then - and that was before you all showed up. There’s no telling if they’re able to detect the portal, so it’s better to be safe than sorry regarding ship readiness.”

As I was getting ready to voice my *very strong opinions* about Jackson’s views on crew safety, I was distracted by the crowd of press and dignitaries as they began to be firmly but politely corralled off the hastily-built launch-land pad as a new group of men in military fatigues came into view.

Jackson’s eyes lit up when he saw them. “And that would be the crew.” He turned to me and gave me the slightest hint of a grin. “It’s time for us to again do the worst thing the military ever conjured.”

“Speeches?”

“Speeches.”

**USS** ***Constitution***

**Marcel Fraser**

If I was being honest with myself, the last month had been a blur. A portal to another world had opened up *here*, of all places - Humanity’s graveyard - and on the other end of it lay what I could only describe as *Paradise*. Not that I got to see too much of it, of course; the inconsiderate bastards in the Space Force brass only gave us one day off in Geneva.

If some higher power orchestrated this, it was to mock us. To show us what we *could’ve* been, had the Faceless not shown up and blasted us back to the Stone Age.

Everything was so *clean*, so *maintained*, it was as if nothing on this other Earth knew the concept of entropy. Looking up, you could see the gargantuan orbital rings hovering above the atmosphere. The idea of it alone put the entire Pistol program - the 20 year effort to build an orbital defense array - to complete and utter shame. From what I could see, the living standards of what I could try to make out as the poorest of their society made even a well-off man on our own side look like they lived in abject poverty. The weapons were so far gone in terms of science fiction that I could hardly believe they existed, let alone grounded enough in reality to believe that they would actually *work*.

I felt like William the Conqueror being sent to fight the Nazis, desperately trying to learn enough about guns, aircraft, and tanks to effectively use them on a modern battlefield. And chances were, in my mind, that I was going to fare just as well as he would.

The call for attention snapped me back to reality. Everyone in my formation, myself included, readied ourselves, as if on instinct. We were at the christening and launch ceremony for the USS *Constitution*, the corvette that - in a few minutes - we would be filing into and flying. Several high-ranking officers - and one UN lieutenant - filed onto the speaking platform to address us away from the prying eyes of reporters and other guests; this was for us alone. An officer I recognized as General Jackson stood at the podium.

He cleared his throat, and began to speak in a gravelly voice. “Gentlemen. It goes without saying that we’re seeing the beginning of a new era. After Hell rained its fury from above, the good Lord saw it fit to bestow upon us allies from another time; from another epoch. In their good will, they have shared with us the means to defend ourselves - to bring the fight to the Faceless. And it comes down to all of you to take up this task. Break through their hulls. Break through the light barrier itself. Break those who slaughtered so many of our ancestors as if they were pests. Break ‘em all.”

Cheers erupted from my formation, as deafening as a train horn. We all knew what we were up against. We would either win or die trying. Perhaps with these freakishly advanced allies of ours, we could ensure an outcome closer to the former than the latter. As the hollering died down, we were dismayed to find that our busy-work started immediately. General Jackson was not one for long speeches.

Our newly minted Captain, Paul Pubar - on loan from the UN - quickly set us to work stocking remaining unloaded supplies and carrying out final inspections on the ship’s exterior; other groups, including mine, ingressed into the ship itself. As the head of the radio and radar suite - a job that I *still* didn’t know how I had got - I ran my team through final diagnostics checks on equipment that still, after weeks of training, left our brains half-cooked. Once final checks had been taken care of, me and several other specialist heads gave Pubar our all-clears. Once the last of our supplies had been taken on board - food, water, and ammunition, even if this was a shakedown cruise - Captain Pubar ordered all of us at our stations and to prepare for launch.

The ascent to space itself was about as pleasant as I thought it would be. That is to say, it felt like I had a gorilla sitting on my chest the entire time, unrelentingly pounding away at my chest. It was from then on that I envied every United Nations spacecraft that had the blessing of using an inertial damper - one that our ship lacked, due to its comparatively poor materials; not *venting atmosphere* poor, but still centuries behind our counterparts in material science.

As *Constitution* entered Low Earth Orbit, my team and the crew as a whole started on their various jobs. UN Navigation officers and their US colleagues, fresh from Geneva, charted a course to a higher orbit. Engineers kept *Constitution*’s engines and electronics under a close watch, while other enlisted personnel manned their stations. During all of this, me and my team received and relayed transmissions to and from Earth. As we reached an orbit higher than the defense grid, a new series of checklists were barked out. Ones far more *exciting* to me than a simple nominal status report.

“Warp drive status nominal,” a voice rang in my earpiece.

“Roger, *Constitution*, proceed with jump.”

“Affirmative, Canaveral.” The radio line suddenly went blank, before the on-ship speaker system blared to life.

“All hands, bracing positions. FTL jump in T minus 30 seconds.”

Everyone near me braced for what they could only assume would be the jostling of the lifetime, myself included. Heaven forbid that I cracked my skull on what was supposed to be the greatest achievement this world had ever seen. We would be breaking Einstein’s own reality. That nothing could travel faster than light.

“T minus 5, 4, 3…”

I held my breath in anticipation. My knuckles turned white from gripping the equipment in front of me.

“Zero.”

To the surprise of me and every man on board *not* from the UN, we felt *nothing*. Not a jolt, jostle, or any indication that we had even moved. But a quick look outside of my viewport - one of the only windows on the ship that *hadn’t* been digitized - I was immediately met with a different view than what had been present only seconds before.

Where there had only been a pearly ball the size of my thumb contrasted against the inky darkness of space, now lay a dominating view of the Moon. In but a single instant, we had traveled from Low Earth Orbit to the Moon itself.

Faster than Light.

Everyone let out a collective exhale. Upon collecting ourselves, a deafening cacophony of cheers erupted from my station, and others could be heard from other decks on the ship. We had *done it*. In the span of a couple months - with help from our interdimensional brothers, of course - we had broken a barrier thought to be physically impossible to cross. As the celebration quickly died down, we dutifully returned to our posts and jobs. I immediately patched through what would be the historical confirmation of *this* world’s first FTL jump. In Cape Canaveral, much to my amusement, they were so hasty to send a reply back to us that they had accidentally sent in on five different frequencies.

*Wait, that can’t be right.*

Even the most overeager intern sending out radio transmissions would still be limited to official UN military frequencies; the relays simply weren’t set up to quickly switch to another random frequency like that - not under standard protocol, of course. Oh, yes, there *was* the expected response from Canaveral - on the correct frequency, too - but there was something *else* coming through, as well. My brow started to crease with worry. I instructed an enlisted under my command to isolate the interloping frequencies and locate the source of them with a radar ping. There was the likely possibility that we were picking up ill-advised civilian messages, or maybe the jump had scrambled our systems somewhat.

The enlisted man’s screen lit up with the radar returns from the sources of the strange broadcasts. Almost immediately, I saw his face seize up in horror.

I quickly shifted my body to focus on him. “Roberts! Status report! Where are those transmissions coming from?” I near-barked at him, which clearly didn’t do wonders for him. He could barely form words, let alone a coherent sentence.

He gathered himself enough to stop babbling sounds. “S-Sir… They… They’re…” With a look as if he had just seen a ghost, and presumably giving up on speaking entirely, he simply pointed at his screen, mortified. With curiosity overcoming me, I took one good look at his screen…

And scrambled to remove myself off my chair, immediately bolting for the bridge.

*Thank God it’s on the same deck as the radio suite*.

Practically *barreling* through the door, I made a beeline for Captain Pubar, who at this point was turning around to see the commotion that was my sudden arrival. Before he could get a word in, I crisply snapped to attention and relayed to him the news.

“Sir! Four unidentified contacts approaching from deep space!”

His face immediately steeled. “Current location? Velocity?”

I checked my tablet - directly connected to the radio and radar suite itself. “One hundred-thousand klicks out, positive 15-point-three degrees horizontal, negative four-point-oh degrees vertical, 22.4 kilos per second in an approach to Earth, sir!”

Pubar turned to several officers on the bridge. “Get us a visual on them. *Now.*” They immediately set to work. Pubar then quickly punched in “Red Alert” protocols on his personal console. The corner lights on the bridge and rest of the ship bathed us in a bright red accordingly. He then went to another on the bridge. “Do we have any assets out there that we weren’t told about?”

A head-shake and a firm “no, sir” was what he got in response. Thankfully, my team on the radio suite was doing its job admirably, relaying our situation back to Earth and forwarding the coordinates of the radio blips to the relevant parts of the crew and ground. We got confirmation that the orbital batteries were turning to assist.

The Electronic Warfare section was the first to gain any proper indication on these oddities, as they started decoding and listening in on radio transmissions fed to them live.

Listening in, all ears on the bridge were bombarded with the sounds of several different whistles and… bleats?

Seconds after, we were finally greeted with a live image of the targets, and the temperature on the bridge noticeably dropped as the blood of every man present ran cold. In front of us, and approaching rapidly, was the spitting image of something we had only seen before in textbooks, but something *everyone* recognized. The harbingers of Death, the means by which Humanity had been pushed to the brink. The ones who murdered hundreds of millions and left the rest to starve.

In stark contrast to the grainy images taken nearly two centuries ago using ground telescopes meant for observing planets and stars, I stared down the white, oblong, oval shaped demons that were the four Faceless spacecraft in perfect clarity with military-grade optics.

*They’ve come to finish the job.*

There wasn’t much to stand in their way, but in contrast to 1944, we were much better prepared. We had an orbital defense network. We had this corvette. We had our allies on the other side of the portal. We could *and would,* in the words of General Jackson, break them all. They wouldn’t see a damn thing coming, God willing. And we will find our retribution for our ancestors. We’d make them proud.

I was ripped from my trance as suddenly the deck erupted into barely controlled chaos and calls to General Quarters rang out.

Pubar turned back to me one final time. “Update on current range, speed, and trajectory?”

“Ninety-nine Thousand klicks, same angle, holding at 22.4 kilos per second, coming straight at us, sir.”

Pubar turned to an officer in charge of weapons control and simply nodded. The officer and his team, understanding the implicit order, quickly got to work and within seconds had a target lock on all four ships with the guns on the newly minted corvette.

I watched as Captain Pubar of the *USS Constitution* looked dead ahead, beyond the craft, into the darkness of space itself, with a squint in his eyes and hands clasped behind his back. He uttered a single word:

“Fire.”"

I have been applying to jobs that I feel qualified for / that I understand the posted requirements for based on how the description lines up with my current role, but I am getting mostly non-responses or automatic rejections. 

I am looking for new roles that will allow me to move from my current location (US east coast) to remote, other parts of the US, or potentially Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few other notes / potential feedback items. 

* I have a MPP, but the program was very free-structured and so I specialized in financial economics and data science/analytics courses. I want to show that this experience has contributed to the ""hard skills/degrees"" often required by quantitative analyst positions since I actually did take most of the same course work as these programs
* I have been at my current company my whole career so far. I started with them as an intern ahead of my senior year of college and then got my master's degree while working full time for them.
* My previous role at the company was not a quantitative analyst position (which I am looking for in my current search). I was closer to a project manager. I have tried to minimize this experience on the resume compared to the other professional / education that more closely matches up to the positions I am looking for

If I go to FSU I will know a few people and will be able to dorm with them and it is number 19 in the state. However, I am not sure how good their data science/computer science program is.

I start in 3 months, going back to my internship's company. I was given a mac and there were issues with compatibility regarding some of our applications/production with macs, so most of my team uses linux, but they're fine if I use either.


I was able to get around those issues but not without difficulty on the mac.


I never used linux before, save for a VM and for ssh-ing, so my experience itself is limited. Is the learning curve difficult? I don't want to run into issue in my first few days just because I don't know how linuxes work (took me awhile to even get used to a comfortable mac workflow and getting all the shortcuts down)."

If there isn't, would anyone be keen to join one? Somewhere we could share resumes, interview prep, leetcode and generally support eachother. If you're interested please reply or DM me.


More broadly, how do you balance Uni/Leetcode/Personal Projects/Life? Do you find your personal life suffering?


Long version (I think I just need to vent 😅):


I finished my first year of CS (no prior programming background) feeling good with a 3.9 GPA and a 1st place in a RMIT cohort-wide hackathon. I figured I had a good 3 months to learn DSA, do a decent amount of leetcode and get a solid personal project under my belt. Unfortunately, life had other plans and I didn't get nearly as much done as I'd like. 

Now the big tech dawgs have started interviewing, I'm feeling extremely unprepared and I am struggling to find peers to keep study alongside. Nobody I've met at uni really seems to care and this is the only community I know that seems to talk about this process locally. I am feeling isolated knowing there are 1000s of people applying for these roles yet I can't find anyone to at least suffer alongside 😅

I'm a 2nd year CS student at RMIT and haven't even had a DSA class, I've tried learning things on my own but it's going a slower than I'd like and the big tech dawgs are already interviewing.

I am feeling extremely overwhelmed by what is expected of interns (even for mid-tier tech it seems) and honestly a bit baffled at how anyone finds the time to balance Uni, a job, personal projects and leetcode while keeping any semblance of a lif. It seems simple on paper but so much harder in practice. What are your secrets? Are you also feeling put through the wringer? 

Let's talk."

One of the guys said something along the lines of they don’t but the job does require the ability to visit job sites. He also went on to say since you’re asking about a drivers license I assume you don’t have a car, as a civil engineer we need to be able to visit job sites so having a license and a car would do great in setting yourself up to landing a job.

I told them getting a license wasn’t an issue (I have a full drivers license back home) but getting an actual car would be difficult.  I felt like the interview went really well except for this part, is not having a car a dealbreaker?"

The current job market for freshers is quite cold, and this is causing me to feel scared and confused about my future prospects. While I have some experience with front-end development, SpringBoot, and minor React projects, I'm also practicing DSA. Although I don't hate DSA, I don't enjoy it as much as development. Additionally, I've noticed that the culture at my college is heavily focused on DSA and CP, with everyone talking about it all the time instead of real projects. My seniors have also emphasized the need to grind DSA to get internships, which adds to my confusion. My primary goal is to make good money and support my family, given our current financial situation. I would appreciate advice from senior professionals and folks working in tech on how to navigate these conflicting thoughts. Furthermore, DTU has become stricter, with challenging papers and useless subjects as usual, and there is immense pressure to maintain 75% attendance and attend classes until late evening. Balancing university, learning, and pressure has become increasingly challenging. Could you please help me out? Some healthy discussion and conversation would be great. Thanks. !"

So, my internship plus nearly two years of experience full time is all Full-Stack development. Got laid off in December, and I understand that things are a little crazy right now so I'm not stressing out too hard.

I was thinking about what fields under SWE are in demand and Data Engineering always comes up following Full-Stack. Does it seem like it would be a good idea to open up my options to Data Engineering positions too during the recession? Or should I focus on just being a better Full-Stack Engineer? I'm also thinking about how things may go in the future, no one's psychic but for the people who are pretty tuned in does it seem like that would be the thing to pivot into to be in a more ""in demand"" position going forward?

Hey  guys, I'm in a small company in VIC, Australia and my issue is recently they've basically  started to expect that I have 24/7 availability and even though it  isn't in my contract, told me they expect me to work on weekends for at  least an hour. I want to leave this job - but they've done a lot for me  in the time I've been with them so I'm wondering about the best way to  go about it... I can either find another job and then just give them 4  weeks notice when I have secured the new job - which seems like a slight  'fuck you' to management - or I can let them know ahead of time as a  professional courtesy that I'm going to be moving on from this industry  and that I will give my notice when I have secured another position. Is  this stupid though? What's to stop them from just replacing me while I'm  job searching?  Do I even owe them anything at this point? 

I  could really use advice on the best way you think to proceed, especially as they hired my partner into the company  recently and he hasn't even been offered an official contract yet (he's  currently an intern).

However, during my research I’ve almost only come across summer internships for 2nd or last year students.

Is there any companies that are known for taking 1st year students ?

Do you have any tips on finding an internship for a 1st year student ?

Thank you for your answers."

What's your experience so far?,Far-Library-8406,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/11eaphc/is_a_masters_in_business_analytics_worth_it_whats/,"Hey guys for context, I'm double majoring in Economics and Finance and although I love Econ so much and want to get a Ph.D soon, I always wanted to get a little more into data analytics. I've took a forecasting class in R for Econ but I've wanted to get more into programming and getting into the applications of it for business. 

I was talking to a guy from the Fed who has a Master's in Econ and he says a Master's in Data Science is the move and it gives you plenty of options. 

Right now, I'm grinding summer internship applications and interviews and I haven't gotten any luck with them and I don't think I'll land a job once I graduate this December. But I'm still putting as many applications as I can to increase my chances.

Thanks for reading!"
11earme,2,2023-02-28,Advice regarding pursuing OMSCS as full time student and course plan doubts.,Flaky_Principle_7968,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/11earme/advice_regarding_pursuing_omscs_as_full_time/,"Hi guys, final year CS undergrad from India. I am planning to apply for this course for 2024 spring batch.

My background:-

1. Bachelors in Computer Engineering :- (2019-2023) with 3.78 GPA.
2. SDE Intern at Open Source Database startup. (2022-2023)
3. Some projects in Full stack and Devops.
4. One paper in open access journal (Computer Vision).

I want to continue working as an FTE for another year before joining as a full time student for this course. My main reason for joining is lack of depth in computer fundamentals and also exploring fields like HCI, Distributed Systems, System Design and Cognitive Science (really interested to know more about the intersection of DL and Neuroscience) and doing collaborative projects.

I have a few questions regarding the application process :-

a. Is my profile strong for applying?

b. Is there a way to get involved with research groups/labs under professors while taking the masters?

c. I am interested in the below topics in general, which ones should I opt for and which ones can I benefit most from i.e structured reading + assignments + projects and which ones are better off from other online resources/courses.  I plan to learn by doing projects and assignments don't like watching lectures for hours and taking only notes, although these are important, I find applying things more effective way of retaining and learning in general :- 

&amp;#x200B;

*  System Design for Cloud Computing 
* Computer Networks
* Introduction to Operating Systems
* Advanced Operating Systems
* Software Architecture and Design
* Database Systems Concepts and Design
* Human-Computer Interaction
* Introduction to Cognitive Science

I once asked if extracurriculars mattered and some people told me recruiters don't really look at that. If grades don't matter either, what else is there for recruiters to look at?

Do they care about classes taken? If yes, would taking a data structures course be good, or would they want you to take more advanced courses like computer architecture?

If no to those questions, is it *really* just personal projects that recruiters look at?"
11ec5hp,1,2023-02-28,I confronted a coworker and now I feel anxious about it,asak4eva,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ec5hp/i_confronted_a_coworker_and_now_i_feel_anxious/,"I am not a confronting person. Nor do I like conflicts. I try to avoid them as much as I can. But this time I just couldn’t. 

I work as an intern at this place and I am the only intern. So I do expect people to push the grunt work on me. I don't mind doing it as long as it is not purposely being pushed on it cuz I am the intern. Like, I am okay doing it if the other person is busy or something. 

But there is this person (K) who has been giving me her share of grunt work and that too always at the last moment. Even that was somewhat fine with me. But a few days ago, my parents were supposed to visit my workplace (it's not a typical corporate setting). It is more like an art gallery. Regular visitors require tickets for entry. But parents of employees have their entry free. I was told this by one of my coworkers (let's call her C). But I wanted to inform a senior before taking my parents in. So I told this senior (P) but she wasn't sure of the protocol as she too is relatively new. So she asked K who said I would have to get tickets. I was nervous already and it was an emotional moment for me already as I am finally pursuing my dreams and it matters to me that my parents like my workplace. 

When K said that, I felt very anxious and left without saying anything. I texted my manager who said no need to worry about the tickets. So finally I could take my parents around.

Later on, when talking with C (who wasn't around when this happened), I told her what K said. She got furious as she said that K knew about the policy of parents getting in for free cuz her own (K's) parents went inside without tickets. This felt like a very cheap move to me by K and I was so furious as she did this when my parents were visiting. It was too low even for her.

After all the day's events I confronted K infront of the core team and she straightaway denied saying this. I said she did wrong. After I left, C told me that P also told K did say it but she went on denying it.

Now I feel anxious about having done this. I don't know why. What do I do?"

11eefbq,6,2023-02-28,Thoughts on unpaid internships,maheshmnj,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/11eefbq/thoughts_on_unpaid_internships/,"As a first-year graduate in Computer Science, I'm facing significant difficulties in securing a paid internship presently. Despite applying since October 2022 and I have applied to at least 500 companies so far, I have only received two offers from early-stage startups, which unfortunately do not offer any compensation. While the work seems appealing, it involves a technology stack that I'm not yet familiar with. Nonetheless, I am interested in learning more. My primary concern, however, is that I have to pay my bills each month, and unpaid work doesn't help my situation. When I asked the companies about unpaid work, they explained that it's not worthwhile for them to go through the paperwork for an intern who would only be with them for a few months.

So I am quite confused at this time about whether I should accept the offer or keep applying still. Assuming the current market situation is very unlikely to get better any soon."
11eercr,1,2023-02-28,Post grad job/career options,linoodl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11eercr/post_grad_jobcareer_options/,"I know there’s been so many posts like this lately but I’m losing hope in this job market and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m about to graduate in a few weeks with a bachelors in computer science and minor in data science. I have one internship experience at a software company. I think my resume is fine since I’ve been getting interviews (I am currently in the interview process for 4 companies but I’m not holding out any hope from them). I don’t have much experience or personal projects and I am not the best coder. 

I first started applying to junior/associate software engineering and developer roles but I kept striking out so I decided to branch out to consulting or analyst roles but I’m also striking out from there. I am wondering what other jobs I can get with my degree, or something manageable I can get in the meantime while I improve my skills to get into a developer role. 

I would love to do web development, but many jobs I’ve seen require years of experience or at least very experienced with the languages. I know I should be building my portfolio to showcase my skills and work, but I don’t have a lot of time right now with my last few weeks of school. So I’m thinking if I don’t get the job that I want, I should get something to hold me over while I work on improving my skills. 

TLDR: no luck getting job out of college, what other job options are there?"
11eeyr1,2,2023-02-28,What should I do? What should I learn?,project-xcviii,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11eeyr1/what_should_i_do_what_should_i_learn/," I'm a final year undergrad in my early 20s, working as an intern in Technical support. Well to be honest I never wanted a career in IT, I originally wanted to be a veterinarian. But my parents made me choose between Accountancy and IT, I had to choose IT. I am tech-savvy and interested in technology since I was a kid, but I never wanted it as my career.

So since the first year I just faced my exams and assignments without an interset. Anyhow, I realized that even I managed to pass my exams and assignments, my practical knowledge (specially in scripting) is really low.

I've been studying Python by myself, I'm going to start learning React JS within this week. As soon as my current internship ends, I'm going to apply for another internship in SE, so I can get experience in practical use of programming. Well, the problem I'm having is, **am I doing something wrong?** I need to start a few projects, so I can show recruiters that I have potential to learn more, **what kind of projects should I add to my GitHub?**

Hope someone will be able to give me few advices about my issue, thanks all, have a great day &lt;3"

I don't mind working desktop support, helpdesk, etc. I actually kind of like that work as I enjoy people and working on problems. (Although sometimes people are annoying and mean yes).

I don't want to start off in helpdesk but I'm okay if I have to and then work my up. But I guess I'm asking will I not be able to get higher positions without an internship giving me experience for those positions? My professors and classmates are making it seem like law that you cannot succeed without one. And I'm having real bad luck getting one. I'll be working on my resume again but I think the fact I don't know my long term path in IT yet gets across to people hiring and they don't want me.

After getting then position a month later the IT Director also quit.

I have had experience (in high school they offered an extracurricular class which was like an internship where the students that took the course would repair the student laptops and help teachers with computer related issues.) and took computer science/web design classes in high school. It has been a couple of months and I have got the basic support stuff down. I am also trying to innovate and improve how certain things work (Creating an internal website for users to have a sort of homepage where they have all of the links and information that they will need/FAQ Support webpage.

I have found ITPro TV which seems like a pretty good source for basic information and learning. So I might ask them to pay for that but is there something else that someone would recommend that might be better or any suggestions on  what stuff to learn? Any info would be greatly appreciated.

I found out my dad was in the hospital a day ago and my mom will be staying with him for the duration. I live on campus 2 hours away from them, my brother in california. My mom has been completely over run with taking care of my dad, grandparents, me and my brother and our dog. She had to put the dog back into the boarding center again 3 days after they got back from california.

My mom asked me for some help with the dog and my dad as she needs to take care of herself as well and apply to jobs. She asked if I can come home for a few days just to take care of the dog while my mom is in the hospital with my dad. How do I explain to my manager without going too far into detail (not sure if it’s unprofessional or not) about my dad, but that I need to take care of my dog for 4-5 days at home because of a family emergency. 

They’re very understanding but some people react differently when you tell them you can’t come in because you need to care for your dog in a situation. How do I word this correctly and what Info should I leave out or keep in?

I’m not very good at not divulging into lots of detail because I know oversharing isn’t professional or whatnot, and they’re not my “friend” but my managers.

Edit: I just thought it’s important to note I just don’t like to lie to my managers about stuff like this, especially because they’ve been so nice and caring to me."

I’ve started my 6-months internship at the end of January, and I already feel like I might get fired. 

I study International Business (so a very broad career and curriculum). I’m currently on my third year of studies; on the first one, I had a broad introduction to study streams such as Marketing, Supply Chain, HR and Finance. As I already had some professional experience in marketing and absolutely hate HR and logistics, I took more finance courses on my second year. Now I’m on my internship (finance/accounting intern) which is mandatory on the third year (and then again on the fourth) and I realized I know nothing, and am finding it very difficult to understand anything that i’m doing at the job. 

Moreover, I was getting kind of bombarded with info and training from 3 different projects from AR (Accounts Receivable) and AP (Accounts Payable) and PO (Purchase Orders), all at the same time. So, I spoke to my manager to see if we could go a bit more step by step rather than training in all three projects at the same time (or at least not go through the 3 of them on the same day) so that I could at least process some information.

Now we’re taking a bit more like baby steps, but I still can’t get the hang of anything, and I see the other intern doing and understanding way better and faster than I am.

I feel like maybe I actually don’t enjoy finance as a career, as I also don’t enjoy doing my tasks, even the ones that I do understand (which are very few).

I guess what I’m trying to do here is providing some context to get some feedback on how I could change my mindset or just cope better with everything that’s going on. 
I know studying after work could be a good option, but I get back home so soul sucked and tired after work that i just want to disconnect from everything.

Thanks everyone for their time and apologies for the long post, but I needed to vent off a little bit"
11ek3kp,301,2023-02-28,My experience working in Germany,xl0ck0n,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/11ek3kp/my_experience_working_in_germany/,"Hey peeps, I saw a couple of posts here before about moving to Europe, I thought I’d share my experience living and working in Germany as an American.

Here’s a quick timeline, then I’ll dive into the details:

September 2018 - Decided to move to Germany, started applying for jobs there

October, November 2018 - Interview, accepted an offer

February 2019 - Flight to Germany

March 2019 - First day of work

February 2023 - Last day at the same company


#Background
I graduated with a CS degree in 2016, then joined a mid size startup in Atlanta doing mostly backend and data stuff with Java. So in total, including internships and stuff, I have about 3 YEO before the move.

Salary progression in the US (USD):

* Software Engineer

* 65k + 5k sign on

* ~68k after about 6 months

* ~73k year after that


# Reason for move
Prior to this, I did not have much context of Germany besides their soccer team, and WW2, never even thought of working outside the States. Then out of the blue my GF got offered a phd position in Germany, so we decided to head over together. In short, the reason was love.

#Job search &amp; interview
LinkedIn was the only place I looked at for job postings. I spent a bit of time curating my resume and cover letter to match each of the jobs I applied to, so in total I probably applied to less than 10 jobs, no more than 5 even.

My response rate was terrible, only 1 replied to me, but fortunately, it’s the one I really wanted. Went through the interview process, and ultimately received an offer. At this point, I didn’t have any other interviews lined up, and am already quite happy with what I’m hearing about this company, so I accepted the offer.

Interview process:

* Initial phone screen with HR

* Take home assignment (build a bowling game API)

* Technical interview, mainly discussing the app I built

* Interview with head of engineering

The whole process took about 2 months.

Offer (EURO):

* Jr. Backend Engineer

* Munich

* Unlimited contract with 6 months probation period

* ~54k

* 4k relocation

* 2.5k housing stipend

As you can see it’s not a great offer, but not bad either. Not very thrilled with the down level, but I didn’t have much experience with their tech stack (Ruby on Rails), so it’s whatever. They also wouldn’t negotiate, so I just accepted as is. At this point it’s about early December 2018, and now that I’ve got a job, I can just move over to Germany with my GF since her start date is around April 2019.

#Visa process
I made an appointment with the German embassy, there’s one located in Atlanta, so I didn’t have to travel far. Prepped my documents to apply for an EU Bluecard.

Roughly this is what I remember I needed:

* Application

* Employment contract

* Copy of diploma

* Copy of passport

* Proof of health insurance

* Flight details

* Housing details (hotel or airbnb is fine)

To my surprise, they issued me a temporary work visa that expires in 6 months. I had to schedule another appointment when I arrived in Munich to get approved for the actual Bluecard. The second appointment was pretty easy, just had to show up, and since all my required documents are already on file, they just approved it right away.

I highly recommend you to be diligent on this part, and schedule your appointment as early as possible because they’re super busy at the foreigner’s office. Available slots most likely will be months away, I’m talking about &gt; 3 months wait, probably more so with the influx of refugees lately. Not a big deal tho, your visa automatically extends to the date of your appointment I believe.

To obtain a Bluecard, your salary need to be past a certain amount, in 2019 it’s ~52k euro or so, and your job must be in demand in Germany. Also your degree, and institution must be recognized by German authorities, and should match your job field. For example, it wouldn’t work if you have an English degree and received a SWE job. You can still get a work permit, but not a Bluecard. Similarly if you have a tech/cs degree from some unrecognized institution like U[sic]GA or something, you’ll need to get another approval for your degree.

#Move
The actual move was quite rocky with the missed transfers, and lost luggages. Between the 2 of us we brought 5 luggages worth of stuff over, in hindsight that might be little too much. Worked out in the end tho since they found our luggages and delivered them directly to our hotel a day after we settled, we didn’t have to lug them around. We did not ship anything over.

#Housing
First 2 months here in Munich, I stayed at 2 different Airbnbs. With the help of the relocation service, I was able to find a more permanent place within those 2 months, and moved in there after on month 3. I stayed there for 3 years before moving in with my GF. The 2.5k stipend paid for the first 3 moths which was nice.

The rent for the apartment is 975 euros, that includes AC, electricity, heating, internet, and furnitures. It’s very small tho, about 25 square meters, that’s about 260 square ft. Flexible rental contract, I can extend it every 3 - 6 months. In the 3 years I stayed, they never increased my rent. It was also in a great location, right by the Isar river, and down the street from the Munich zoo, bakery, grocery store, and the U-bahn station.

Most landlords will ask for 2-3 months rent as deposit, this one only asked for 1 month, and I had no troubles getting it all back. All in all, I think this apartment was quite a gem.

If you have the budget I would highly recommend looking into relocation services, the one I had costed me about 3k euro. Their services include:

* Help with your settlement (address registration, opening bank accounts etc)

* 6 apartment viewing with a rep

So the rep accompanied me through the address registration process, opening bank account, apartment viewings, and rental contract help. That’s really all I needed, if you have kids they also offer help with school stuff. To me the 3k was worth it, and it’s covered by the relocation stipend. The remaining 1k I used to to pay for my flight and transportation cost.

#Work
I joined the company at a great time, they just received substantial funding, so the company’s in high spirits. We also got a boost during the COVID times with the uptick on digital fitness trends. It wasn’t until this past year we started having financial issues.

We use agile and has cross functional teams. I was assigned to a product team that focuses on the core training experience. Worked out perfectly because that’s what I’m most interested in. Other teams’ setup are pretty much the same, but they focus on other topics like monetization, onboarding, marketing etc which isn’t my cup of tea. A full team consists of:

* Product manager

* Engineering manager

* Designer

* Scrum master

* 1-2 AND dev

* 1-2 iOS dev

* 1-2 Backend

Typical startup mentality, lots of different initiatives, fast paced, abandoned projects etc. Most recently we tried to venture into the fitness equipment tech space, and ultimately ran out of funding. The whole product had to be abandoned a month after release, and 30% of people had to be let go, I was part of that 30%. That’s OK tho since I planned on quitting the same month anyways and move out of Germany. Now I’m enjoying my 4 months paid time off haha.

My salary progression at this company (EURO):

* 2019 - 54k

* 2020 - 64k (Promotion intermediate backend)

* 2021 - 72k (Promotion senior backend)

* 2022 - 76k

* 2023 - Laid off

I did get equities but not sure if it’s worth anything at this point. We get 28 days of paid vacation, unlimited sick days, plus Bavaria has a bunch of holidays.

For the most part it’s just API development on RoR, a little bit of web dev react stuff here and there. Truly enjoyed my time here, even tho it’s fast paced, I never worked overtime, except for that one time when we were dos’ed, that was an interesting week.

Company is pretty international, so main working language is English. That should be the case for most tech companies in Germany, especially the ones in big cities.

#Life
I mentioned earlier that this company is the one I really wanted to join for 2 reasons:

1. They’re in the fitness business

2. They have an onsite gym

The gym part is quite important because it’s a place I feel comfortable. I figured if I get culture shock or homesick or something, I can hole up at the gym and de-stress. And that’s basically what I did after work everyday, sometimes even both before and after work (especially during the initial covid time). I’m quite introverted, so never really explored the nightlife in Munich, and every other week I would train for 4 hours to my GF’s place.

Spring and Fall were the best times in Munich, summer gets too hot, and winter can be depressing if you’re not careful. Best part about Munich tho is how centrally it’s located, I can travel to a lot of places with just the train already. Too bad COVID really put a damper on our travel plans, but we’re still able to hit some of the major European destinations, and a bunch cities in Germany.

In early 2021, I switched to be fully remote, and moved in with my GF. Her university is in a much smaller town in east Germany, Jena. While the rent is much cheaper, it’s a little inconvenient to travel here. If we want to train to a major city, we’d need to first take a 30 minutes train to a nearby bigger station and transfer from there. Worse if we want to fly, closest major international airport is Frankfurt, and that’s about 3.5 hours away. If we have an early flight then we’d need to stay overnight at Frankfurt, which adds to our travel cost. Another down side to living here is that racism is more prevalent. It was a pretty big difference compared to Munich. We’re both South East Asian descent, and came from a small southern town in Georgia, don’t remember ever being treated differently in the US. Maybe it’s the recent rise in Asian hate, but it is what it is, we just shrug it off as long as it doesn’t escalate to violence.

What I love most about Munich is how safe it is. I feel safe walking by myself on an empty dark street. Public transportation is also probably the best amongst German cities. Biking infrastructure is also abundant, tho I don’t quite like that the bike lanes are shared with the pedestrian side walks. As compared to Atlanta, where certain places are a no go at night alone, Marta routes barely covers anything, and barely any bike lanes.

#Cost of living &amp; quality of life
To summarize real quick, cost of living is pretty equal between Munich and Atlanta, Munich might be a little more expensive because of rent.

Quality of life I feel Atlanta &gt; Munich for me, mainly because of family, friends, and food. As a healthy young adult without a family, I won’t factor in childcare cost, and medical cost. I think it will heavily favor Munich if you have a family (maybe?), and especially if you have any medical conditions.

I didn’t see a difference in work life balance, on both companies I am able to nicely balance between them, no crazy work hours, no terrible manager, no toxic work environment.

One major difference is your net pay, I think there’s about a 10% - 15% difference here in your net salary. For example, if I gross 6k each month, in Germany I would net 3.6k, and in US, I would net 4.2k or so. Not to mention that US SWE salaries are way higher than Germany’s. If you want to stick with non manga and non unicorn startups, 90k is pretty hard to come by. When you factor in the usd and euro conversion rate, my income has steadily declined over the years despite my pay raises.

#Taxes &amp; Retirement
If you don’t know, Americans are still obligated to pay their taxes even if they don’t live in the US, and you have to file your taxes each year. Most likely tho, there’s tax agreements between the different countries so that you wouldn’t be double taxed. That is the case for Germany.

In Germany taxes are taken out of your paycheck each month, that includes your income taxes, social security, health care, and unemployment. I guess it’s the same also for US salaried workers. If you’re single and don’t have other income, you probably don’t have to file your taxes for Germany, but if you change your mind, you can still retroactively file up to 4 years of taxes.

For US taxes, you usually have 2 options to reduce your tax obligations:

1. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, form 2555

2. Foreign Tax Credit, form 1116

For the first option, it is exactly as it sounds, foreign income is excluded as your income in the eyes of the US federal and state government. The exclusion amount is quite large, 100 something thousand. One downside to this is that I can’t contribute to my IRA

I think the second option is the way to go if your country of residence has higher tax rate than US, which is the case for Germany. And since you have income in the eyes for US government, you can also contribute to your IRA. Additionally, any unused credit can be applied to future tax years.

I was never able to figure out option 2 because of the state taxes. I still maintain an address in Georgia, not sure if I still have obligations to file for Georgia state taxes, but I file it anyways each year just in case. Every time I try to do FTC on TurboTax and filing for state tax, I always owe a lot. 

Regardless of the tax and income differences, I’m still able to contribute about 10k - 15k in my investments and savings each year. That’s about the same as I was doing back in Atlanta.

#Conclusion
Working in Germany has been fun despite some major cons. It has opened my eyes to different cultures and different ways of living, but I’m ready to move on.

If you have specific questions, feel free to ask me, more than happy to help out."
