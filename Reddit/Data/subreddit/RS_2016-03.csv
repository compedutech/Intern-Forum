48df22,1,2016-02-29,How to decline with grace?,Discardafterusingme,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/48df22/how_to_decline_with_grace/,"I'm at the last week of a ""marketing"" internship with a small local business and...its really not working out.

I accepted the internship thinking I'd be doing marketing and getting some concrete, relevant experience. I started working and discovered that I was the /entire/ marketing department, with no budget, no company marketing history, and no tools. I've pretty much spent the whole internship doing a ton of self-study. I have been able to set foundations for improvement but my main issue is the company.

Like I said before, its small. There are two owners who disagree about the company direction, nothing is recorded, my boss back-tracks on almost everything said (and nobody can hold him to it because nothing is written down). Who knows what else is not written down! It feels like I'm on a boat made of duct tape. I won't go into too much detail but there's other happenings that have made me lose even more trust in them.

I have a job interview next Monday, which is for a non-marketing position, but it's at a company that I have worked for before and they're more put-together at least.

How do I break the news to my boss? Ive never declined a job before. He seems to think that I want to keep working here and is already trying to build future plans.

48djsr,1,2016-02-29,Pursuing an internship as an information technology manager with a small company. They currently have no IT department. Should I be concerned? If I move forward what should I expect as a salary?,bryburn,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/48djsr/pursuing_an_internship_as_an_information/,"I'll start with a bit of background. I'm a 3rd year computer science major and looking for internships. I've been applying, and interviewing for internships in IT and software development. This one in particular stuck out. It seems like an impressive position to have, especially for an entry level candidate! ...but maybe too much for an entry level candidate?

The company is a small company, between 10 and 15 people on site. They're fairly well established and have been around for a few generations. However, they don't have an IT department yet. After interviewing with them it seems their plan is to hire a full time employee straight out of college as well as an intern in college. Then have these two be the IT department for the company. Specifically the first project would be web design and e-commerce management— managing it not creating it. After that they want someone to manage the servers, website, troubleshoot, and generally deal with all tech related things. Right now they don't have anyone on site they consider tech savvy.

I like that I could be ambitious and independent in this position, but at the same time I have to wonder if this is too much for an entry level position. I have some experience working in the IS department of my college. Working at the help desk for a while, then as a server technician. Only minor projects involving web design or management.

Lastly, if I do take the position I have no idea what I should ask for a salary. Glassdoor and those sites list IT manager as a fairly high paying position, anywhere between $55,000 and $100,000+. I expect that's a ridiculous amount to ask for an entry level position, and for a small company. So I really have no idea what the position should be paid.

What do you think? Is this too much to take on with my current experience? If not what should I ask for a salary?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."

48f1s0,0,2016-03-01,Last month I got rear ended by an 18-wheeler and it (obviously) totaled my Corolla. So now what?,legithappytobealive,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/48f1s0/last_month_i_got_rear_ended_by_an_18wheeler_and/,"So last month I got rear ended by a semi-truck on I-17 in Coconino County, Arizona. Traffic was at a complete stop due to an accident ahead and there was nobody behind me when I stopped. After about 20-30 seconds of sitting still I saw him behind me, had a quick thought that he might hit me, and realized I had no other choice but to stay put. There was a guard rail on one side, parked cars on the other, and parked cars in front of me so my only choice was to embrace the impact. I sat and watched him coming - sucked! - and stupidly braced myself. Left hand on the wheel, right hand on the e-brake (manual transmission, it was a reflex), and right foot on the break. He hit me and I jolted forward, felt instant neck pain, but was able to walk away. He had Minnesota plates/license. 

I went to the ER for an x-ray and CT of my neck, they said it was strained but OK, and gave me muscle relaxers. Since then I've been to primary care who gave me narcotics for the pain and referred me to PT. 6-7 weeks later, I'm doing physical therapy 2x a week for my neck and shoulder. The impact of the semi and reflex of my seatbelt not only strained my neck but also dislocated my shoulder, collar bone, two frontal ribs, and one in the back. The x-ray was only checking my neck so this wasn't identified by a doctor until PT a couple weeks ago. 

I was VERY fortunate to have been able to borrow a car from a friend until I was able to replace mine. My auto insurance reimbursed the already-paid-for Corolla but not at a rate that would've allowed me to purchase a car at equal value/relatively close to the same as what I had so now I've got a car payment because, financially, it's my only option right now. 

The other driver's insurance company hasn't contacted me. I haven't contacted them, either, because I'm still trying to heal and don't want to dive in until I know my body is taken care of. Since the accident, and it 100% was NOT my fault the officer said so(Maybe it's a distracted driver situation?) - I've acquired plenty of med bills, plenty of doses of pills, multiple and long-lasting injuries, and a monthly car payment (with an added bonus of increased insurance rates - whoohoo!). I'm an intern for a corporation and graduated college two months ago with plenty of debt, I pay all my own bills, and live on my own so I'm trying to handle this as best I can. 

My questions are:
Should I seek legal advice? From who/what kind of attorney?
Approximately what can I expect to pay for legal help (aka, how much MORE will this accident cost me?)
Should I wait to hear from the other guy or reach out? OR Do I wait until I have a lawyer to contact them? Should I do it or leave it up to legal?
What kind of charges should I expect if this goes anywhere?
When/should I settle? Or does this type of thing go to court?

Tl;dr: I got hit by a semi-truck on I-17 in AZ and he totaled my car - 100% his fault according to police - and now I'm stuck with med bills, a car payment, injuries, and no contact from the other guy. This accident has cost me A LOT so far and I'm not even better yet. Now what??"

I've had internships every year totalling 21 months industrial experience and have an interest in computer aided engineering and simulations.

Parts I've designed are in production now and I've taken products from sketches to finished installed components

Along the side I have founded an FSAE team as kind of practise run at running a company, I've recruited 12 other engineering and business students and we've attracted sponsors and started designing our FSAE car.



I also have skills in programming and have written a few thousand lines of Python currently used by a Fortune 500 company. 

I've learned web development skills and built out my own portfolio site 

I'm starting to build sites for other people and have done a few for local charities etc.



The main thing is I'm not sure how to spin my skill sets into some cohesive service or package, I feel like I could be a good consultant for product design but without 10 years experience in an industry I don't have the links and network to find potential clients

&gt;If you are open to new career opportunities, please respond with a copy of your resume and your preferred Google office location. This way we can match you to potential teams that fit your skill set.

I haven't finished school yet, but I *am* very interested in discussing internship/career opportunities with them so I took a couple days to tighten up my resume before sending it off. Two weeks ago I got a confirmation email (from a human, not a robot!) thanking me and saying

&gt;A Recruiter will be in touch with you shortly if we have a position that is a match with your qualifications. They will reach out to you to discuss potential career opportunities at Google.

And now here I am waiting to see what happens. A couple things on my mind:

1. I'm **not** a computer scientist (I just play one on tv!) but I've got a very strong background in it *as it applies to my problem domain*. I can tell you all about z-order trees and fast electrodynamics algorithms and monte carlo ising models, but I'm really worried I don't know some ""obvious"" bit of CS stuff that'll totally sink me, should they want me. Is this a valid fear?
2. It's been two weeks since I've heard from them; are we past ""shortly?"" Would they even contact me at all if they don't want me? Should I contact them now? Wait a bit?
3. If things go the way I want them to, I'm most interested in doing an internship this coming fall, then finishing school, then kind of seeing what happens from there (depending on if I like them/they like me in the internship, where I see myself applying my skills, etc.) Is this an idea that would significantly influence (either positively or negatively) any of their thoughts about me as a candidate?

All in all I'm pretty excited that they're even interested in me at all -- I *never* thought anything like this would become part of ""the plan."" It's just a very nervewracking experience because it's so different from the academic climate I'm used to. Hence my asking for advice :)"

Basically i'm trying to decide whether I should work up to a Senior Business Analyst type of role vs. Software Development. I like both, find both interesting, it takes me longer to program concepts, but i love the challenges. Some info about me:


Currently, I'm 25, half-way thorough University in ""Business Technology Program."" We're considered a hybrid between business side and software sides of things, have experience on both ends of the spectrum, a jack of trades is what I refer to it as. 

Currently, I work as a intern business intelligence analyst at a big Public company. (8month intern) I gather and utilize design, requirements, analysis, process improvement, scope management, and project coordination with stakeholders. I work cross-functionally with every department (engineers, I/T, supply chain, procurement, inventory managers, and project managers). I analyze vast amounts of data daily, prepare reports for senior level Execs, and spot anomalies in data. I took it upon myself to learn VBA and automate reporting (300 lines of code, felt very impressed), made queries in Access, Pivot Table for proof of concept and analysis, and minor SQL experience (company won't allow SQL server for me). I enjoy the project management side of things, managing teams, working cross-functionally, essentially being the ""glue"" between teams and achieving required objectives. I have experience in Java/SQL/ and Python (personal learning).







My question is:

1. Should I get a project management certification and work in the BA field? Work up to Senior BA --&gt; Project Manager?

2. Go into the I/T side of things, do more development and software testing, create applications to interface backend databases. (develop my Java/SQL/ and Python programming further?) 

I have such a strong passion for both project management, data analytics and I/T/programming and just confused where to specialize in. I don't want to move into another BA role, and my next intern role comes in September (4 months), really trying to figure out how to best move on from a business intelligence analyst is. 


I feel like at 25, i really need to figure out what direction of the Business technology world I want to go into. I feel like I should have accomplished a lot more. Probably putting stress on myself, but just looking for advice.





Current Skill-set:
•	Data Analytics (Access queries, pivot tables, SQL, excel, Vlookups etc.)
•	MySQL (self taught, beginner level)
•	Python (self taught beginner level)
•	Android Programming (currently self teaching myself)
•	Java (beginner, educated from Academics/personal learning)

48hqc5,2,2016-03-01,"I need advice bad right now, please help",BEnJiWithARABS,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/48hqc5/i_need_advice_bad_right_now_please_help/,"So I was writing this as an email for my Ochem Professor but I want to be more honest about how my problems are making me feel and saying certain things to him would probably be dangerous for me and weird for him, so I'd rather write to reddit.
I'm a Chemistry major and just some background to the kind of person I am, in highschool I was the dumbest, laziest, unmotivated fuck in school up until junior year. The counselor stuck me in 3 ap classes, 1 being Ap Chem. I've heard all kinds of things about it and people would laugh at the thought of me attempting the class, let alone Ap. Long story short, I worked my ass off, I failed dozens of times but I learned and grew, I was so successful I raised my gpa up to a 3.9 senior year by getting 4.2-5.0s my last two years, I was the only student to pass the Ap chem test with a 4. I didn't socialize whatsoever and I was pretty much in my room if I wasn't at school. I bought my own gym equipment so I just went to my basement, therefore I had LOADS of time to study and do HW, and I was happy doing just that (at the time). I went straight to college to study chemistry and I also started working at target a month before school. First semester was shit, second was amazing, summer and this past autumn was bad because my girlfriend left me in June and I didn't take it so well.. 

Moving on to now, my GPA is a 2.6 right now and I'm taking Majors OChem 2, Analytical Chem, and calc based physics 2. I was working full time last semester but I knew the semester would be hard and my grades the previous semester weren't so hot so I dropped my lab and hours at work to have 14 credit hours and about 15-20 hours at work. Now this is what I was writing to my Ochem professor,

""I'm not quite even sure how to tell you how I'm feeling but I am absolutely failing the class right now. I've never done this bad before, I've failed and picked myself up, I've grown so much up until this point in my life, and I've done amazing things by being persistent and optimistic no matter what, but I have never been the guy that brings the average down so much it looks scary. Without me, the graphs for the class would look so much more even. And honestly, without saying anything scary, I hope you understand how that makes me feel exactly. I've been working since I came into college, and I've done alright and started to get the hang of it, but apparently cutting my hours in half and being broke all semester isn't enough to be average in your class, and it's too late to put in my two weeks now and try to fix this mess.  I also teach taekwondo classes twice a week here which takes up about 6 hours. I dropped the lab for the semester so I could focus on your class, analytical chem, and physics 1251 but clearly it hasn't helped. There shouldn't be an excuse, I'm sure other students in the class are having it harder. Sir I want to improve and get better but I just don't see it, everyone else is beyond ahead of me and it's extremely difficult to find time for OChem. I stay up til 2-5 every day depending on when my morning class starts and it's all just to finish HW for other classes or rushing to attempt your lecture preps. I mean it takes me almost 1.5-2 hours for your lecture preps, and sometimes I'd feel better off skipping them and using that time to study, I don't know! Of course there are other things in my life that are bothering me and holding me back, but I know you don't care for more excuses. I love chemistry but Organic Chem is uninteresting to me and I honestly can't bring myself to be so passionate about it and passion is what drives me to learn. I'm not sure what to do sir, I'd like advice because I don't want to give up but do you think I should just withdraw? It's not like HS, this will be on my record forever but I'm not sure what to do, I'm willing to work hard but with all my constraints it's difficult"" 

I stopped typing and just figured I come to a place where I could let out how I really feel right now. After my girlfriend left me it took me almost 9 months to get out of depression, and I'm confident she's not in the way anymore for me to grow as a person. I'm interested in a girl right now and she makes me so happy, we have so much in common and we get along so well, she means a lot to me. I know teaching classes, going to the gym, socializing with my friends and all the thinking I have about this girl is taking up so much of my time, but if there's one thing I learned in my life, it's that make sure you're happy, even just a little bit. I honestly almost ended my life 2 times in those 9 months and every single day, the majority of my thoughts were spent thinking about horrible things. I never thought it would end, and then the semester started and I started to pick myself up big time and the girl I like has helped me a bit as well which is why she means a lot to me, it seemed crazy to me. I haven't been this motivated since back in high school when everyone doubted me and I proved them all wrong by becoming one of the top students. I don't want to just cut off my relationship with her, maybe my friends and work, but I can't just cut if off with her and try to talk to her again after like 3 months, I feel like she really likes me and I REALLY like her, I feel like it will ruin the relationship we have right now and possibly just end it.

The problem is I started to fall behind so fast in Ochem and Physics it's scaring me. The first midterm i got a 65/200 and the average was about a 65% but obviously me and a couple other students are outliers so far to the left of the graphs. Like I said in my email, I've failed, I've done bad, but I am consistently getting the LOWEST grade in all my quizzes and midterms. Physics I can fix, but Ochem, there are people getting 110%s and 100s on all the quizzes and midterms. Last semester my professor curved the class so  much I went from a 50% to a B, but that was because I had average/ slightly above average grades. I stay up every day, like I said, usually just trying to finish online HW or lab reports, and that helps me learn, but my classes need so much more time dedicated to learn. I'm trying my best but the reason why I didn't want to email him was because almost every day I'm handed back a quiz that makes me die inside. I'm a science major so I'm used to it, but it's weird, now I'm not average or better. Not even slightly, now I'm the worst score, and it's not because I'm dumb, I know I'm not stupid, but even the stupid kids in the class are doing better because they have the time to do problems and go over as much material as the professor provides them. I only have so much time to do what I can but it's not enough. I've been sad maybe even depressed over my grades before, but this is beyond what I can handle, it's killing me inside, I feel like my life is ruined at this point (sorry if I'm exaggerating)  but I don't want to turn to something else, I want to go into physical therapy or perhaps I do change my mind, the things I'm interested in require a great GPA. I thought about getting my PhD while teaching HS, I don't know, theres so many options, but I want to be something great, and right now I don't see why the girl I like would consider me in the long run if I'm not my greatest. Even if she likes me for who I am, she deserves someone great and I have that potential, I just can't get my shit together. I've done amazing things and I'm hard working, but these classes simply just need time. I'm trying to balance my grades, sleep, work, gym, and social life as best as I can, but If I'm not on top of it all, then I am failing. I have no one to help me except my adviser and I don't have time to talk to him, I don't have time for anything! If I had more time than I did to write this post I'd go see a therapist but I'm just writing this before my next lecture.

I have my next midterm next Monday and I don't have a lot of time this week to catch up, but I'm confident if I study hard from today I will get around average, but I just don't feel like that's enough, what if I fail again? So what if I get average this time? My GPA is still shit, and I just don't see myself doing something amazing like I did in HS with this class, OChem is the most uninteresting thing I've come across in my life. I love chemistry so I'm trying to accept Ochem but I'm not passionate for it.. I can't get any internships or get any nice scholarships because my gpa is disgusting and I'm scared I won't get into any Grad school I want. I went from pharmacy to physical therapy now. I want to be happy, and I want to work the rest of my life doing something that makes me happy and I want to spend it with someone I love. I do a lot of extracurricular, and research is in my mind, getting a Psych minor is too, I have a lot of things in mind, but I feel like none of that will matter if I fail Ochem and I just don't want to consider retaking it, I REALLY want to just pick myself up but at the moment I'm literally the bottom of the barrel in the class. I think the last day to withdraw is coming up so I feel pressured but I don't want to give up! I'm a stubborn guy and it's never threatened me like this before. I want to write so much, I want to go on and on (as if I haven't already) I want to write about everything that bothers me but I think I've said enough, I just want advice, reassurance, anything.. 

Please be nice, I know I've left a lot room to be made fun of or criticized but the last thing I want is more things putting me down. Sorry if theres any bad grammar or spelling I'm just rushing this because I need to study.."

Yes, I know it doesn't have any peripherals or an ethernet/wifi adapter, I'm hopefully getting those from my parents' computer when it dies, or if that doesn't happen before I build this I'll just find some that work.  I'm starting an internship in July, so this build is planned for a couple of months after that starts so that I have money to spare, and maybe get a part or two for my birthday.  However, I might wait for cyber monday and see if any of my parts are on sale, but I'm not sure that's something that happens.  At this point I'm just checking to see if there are any improvements to be made to the build."

I've had both great experiences and some days where I feel like complete shit. Just to give some background information: I am a 19 year old college freshman who is commuting to a local university because of how inexpensive it is. In terms of grades, I'm doing okay. Not great, but okay. I'll list my main concerns.

1. I feel like I'm not nearly doing enough for my education. I hear stories of college freshman doing so much more with their education and yet I'm still not sure what I'd like to do. I know I want to do something business related, but man, the idea of finding an internship right now might not be possible because I have no idea what I should intern in.

2. I can't afford to live in a dorm, so commuting is just simply what I am stuck with. I am going to look into joining some clubs, but still, I really don't know exactly what I should be looking for.

3. My lack of independence is starting to bother me. I still live at home while most of my peers live in dorms or apartments. While yeah I am saving money, I feel like I'm setting myself back so much in terms of being able to live on my own and take care of myself. I don't know if I'm thinking too much about this or whatever. "

After a long journey of breakup, alienation and depression  I finally have  the strength to take responsibility for my life. 

In the past  few months I learned a lot about myself and what I like  and don't like - finally, after lurking for so long.

Now I want to try myself out, experience New things, experiment... find my passion. And have already done a bit of that.

Problem is, I am a masters student with ca. 4 semesters left and I feel like I am running out of time.
I have excellent grades and am employed in the third job at the university, but I lack a profile (masters is politics, history, int. Law). Right now I should already have a dream job I strive for, and a plan, but I don't because I lost quite some time to my ""dark ages"" where I never actually did anything.

For Illustration: 
If I can stay in research, great!  I have connections and grades and interest, but I lack a profile. To develop that, I need a lot of  time, which would cancel options like longer internships abroad.
Is it dumb to travel the Balkans for 3 weeks this summer? I phantasize  about it every day.
I feel like an imposter when handing out my C2 certificate for English. Is Erasmus or work and travel in Canada a bad idea that late  in my studies?
Should I skip the internship at the UN for a more reasonable yet less desireable option (got a few of these), because I know the UN stuff will not lead to employment?
I am sleep-deprived to the max, so sorry if the text  was confusing.
The gist  of it is: I don't seem  to have the time to experiment, so I need to make wise decisions NOW."

So I just bought a dell Dell UltraSharp 4k UP3216Q 31.5. Sadly after a week and 2 units I am having to send them both back. Dell (like everyone) is cutting major corners. For these units they would never wake from sleep mode. On top of that, honestly for 1.4k they were pretty meh. Not to mention they don't work on a macbook pro (that is a pretty horrifying fail)

I am looking for a monitor because I have been using a mac screen so long. Now when I am connected to my other screens they seem blurry. I figure it it is time for an upgrade. I mean I got these 3 screens back in college (yay internships! Did I mention I am an engineer.. not excessive for my work)

I think that 32 inches was a tad small. I am looking to move away from 3 monitor set up to having just one really big screen. I do a lot of gaming, though mostly I am programming. Thinking 40 would be better.

I know the issues with having a TV as a screen. But surely there is a gem that over comes this. Especially with modern screens and with a 1.5k- 2k budget. Usually the issue is with input delay and color washing. Though with 4-5k TVs we also have the lack of display ports on many units... I am a sucker for 100% color correctness but so long as it's not washed out compared to the macbook next to it I wont care.. 

I did find http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-usage/pc-monitor/best

48k8lo,3,2016-03-01,Staying on Full Time vs. Looking Elsewhere,theroadtoelcs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48k8lo/staying_on_full_time_vs_looking_elsewhere/,"Hey Everyone,

Starting off, I wanted to explain a bit about where I am currently at. I currently a Junior pursuing a Bachelors in CS and have a few side projects that I am proud of, interned for another company part-time/full-time for about a 1.5 years, and am planning to graduate next winter. The company that I am currently interning for has about 500+ employees and is transitioning from ""startup"" to ""stable company"". I have been with them for about 9 months part-time/full-time and am allowed to work remotely while while I work part-time for during school. 

I was initially hired on by a manager who ended up leaving shortly after I started for a lead position at another startup. At first, I was honestly a little scared about this internship being a complete bust. The first month or so were a little insane as I was having to onboard, figure out the existing systems, and sort through codebases without much guidance. I eventually was able to get my head above water and I have now pretty much assumed almost all of the technical roles of my previous manager. After getting the existing systems organized and such, I proposed a major overhaul to my boss which was received really well. I am now in the midst of creating a new management portal, creating new demos, making our documentation better and effectively implementing that proposal. Last week I had one of the first public appearances within the company of what I have been working on and seems to have gone over extremely well. For all intents and purposes this has been one of the best opportunities I have received with regards to growing professionally. 

I have begun really thinking about what I want to do after graduation and plan to have a sit down with my boss later this month but he has been absolutely thrilled with my performance and is been openly willing to get me contacts for just about anywhere in the company. This is really where my question begins, I have a great connection at my current internship, what seems like multiple paths for career advancement and really have no major qualms working there. Post graduation, I am assuming for the most part 100k+ salary based off glassdoor and for the most part the ability to work remotely.

My dream has always been SpaceX, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla but as I type this post I cant help but think how insane it would be to give up what I already have and start over. I am curious if anyone who has been in my position or is able to offer some insight could chime in? Should I keep aiming higher or is what I have out of graduation something I should hold onto.

48kog8,323,2016-03-02,"My First Offer - Journey through unemployment, depression and college.",AggressionRanger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48kog8/my_first_offer_journey_through_unemployment/,"  I've seen a few posts like this, tales of peoples trouble to find a job. It always helped me along the way to know I wasn't the only one who didn't have 9 offers before graduation and entry-level salary of 100k. So here is mine, hopefully it will offer a morale boost, feel free to ask any questions about the journey. Sorry for the wall of text, I’m trying to keep it brief and not make this my life story.


For the first year and a half of the Computer Science program things were great, I worked as a 'Greeter' (bouncer) at a night-club and went to school. Although the job had shitty hours, I was standing around the majority of my shifts, which is great for someone who is writing algorithms and studying data-structures all day. I was able to hold a pretty respectable GPA along the way. As I was 28 when I started the major, I was in a bit of a ‘hurry’ to finish school and join the industry, which for me meant summer school and fully-loaded schedules at all times. If I can give any advice to undergrad students right now, it’s don’t do this. Take an internship. For me, I was misinformed of the following facts. I believed that A) Most internships were unpaid, and B) Internships were available year round. While both have cases of being true, for the majority of the industry, this is not accurate. I used the logic that I couldn’t afford to NOT be in school, as I needed the financial aid money to pay my rent. By the time my classmates started talking about their internships, and me realizing they were getting paid (a sufficient amount, enough if I had done the same I would have been fine financially), it was too late for me. 


Toward the middle of my senior year I was laid off from my part-time job. I was devastated. While the job wasn’t great, it had the potential pay-wise to keep me afloat if I wasn’t receiving financial aid (via picking up more hours). Previously, I was relaxed about the job hunting prospect because I knew I would be ok for the time being, had I had my job, which now I didn’t. I thought I might be able to scoop up a part time CS job being fairly close to graduation. I was wrong, and thus began one of the darkest chapters in my life.  Unable to get a tech job, a call back, or anything but rejection emails, I took a job cooking. A bit of background about me, I was a ‘cook’ for a decade; I hated it with a passion. I was so jaded from that industry in the first place that’s what pushed me to go back to school. I felt like a piece of shit. Despite how far I’d come in the last few years getting my degree, somehow I landed right back where I started, flipping hamburgers.


Alas, I was completely miserable, hated my job, wasn’t getting call-backs and my grades began to fall. I knew I was too far in at this point to back-out so I did what I had to. I wrote my resume, if I didn’t get any calls on it, I re-wrote it differently, and differently, and again, and again. I probably have around 10 ‘generations’ of the AggressionRanger resume, and I’m talking these list different projects, skills, ect. Each one probably took me 5 or so hours to write and a few days of revisions to make it send-worthy. Finally however, I ended up with one that got me responses. 


Interviews were no picnic either. Although I always did well in school (until recently), the process of problem solving wasn’t something explicitly taught. Every technical interview I had, I knew the solution, it wasn’t ever ‘out of my wheel-house’, but to sit there with a phone-stuck to your ear, trying to explain your convoluted first-logic was tough. I got rejected. It hurt, but I kept trying. Stress levels rose and I saw the timer-running out on my schooling, and realizing without that sweet financial aid, I wouldn’t be able to pay my rent. I would have to have 2 crappy cooking jobs to make ends. How do I interview working two crappy jobs 50 hours a week? More stress. Heart pounds. I don’t live alone, I have a family, so not paying rent means I have to explain to them why we are living inside a refrigerator box off the Freeway overpass. More stress, but I forged on. I learned from where I had failed before, and I tried to find ways to ‘plan out’ a problem better so in the advent I had an interview, the interviewer was a bit more clear on what the hell I was doing. It worked. Eventually I had a technical interview I was able to catch and explain the problem well, well enough I was invited on-site. Once on-site, although nervous and tired from 6 grueling back to back interviews, I went home and received an e-mail they would like to make an offer, and will call to discuss in a few days. Days went by, I accepted. Less stress. It’s over. No refrigerator box. No two crappy jobs, hell I was even able to put in my notice at the 1 crappy job.


I suppose the point of all of this, is to let others know you aren’t the only one out there struggling. It’s real. It happens. I probably put out 100 resumes. I had 12 interviews/technical assessments/HR screens from various different companies. It took 6 months. I started sending out resumes in August. November was my first phone-screen. Every-time I got rejected, I dusted myself off and went at it again, because I mean what is the alternative? It’s the hamburger- flipping the fucking hamburger is the alternative. That kept me focused. I stayed positive because my interviews/assessments/phone-screens were staggered. Just as one passed, usually within a few weeks another would come along. It’s simple, but it gave me hope, and that kept me going. They made it sound like with a CS degree people would be jumping out of windows to give you jobs. They made it sound like with a CS degree we would be a part of some elite, never jobless club that would rule the world and play Nintendo during the work day while eating catered lunches. Not true. The truth is, you will get rejected, you may be depressed, but most importantly, really, is to just keep going. Not everyone has a job ‘locked’ 6 months before graduation. Not everyone has offers from every Big-4 for a 100,000 starting salary with a 30,000 signing bonus. It’s ok. You’ll be fine.

I am currently at university/working a full time internship for the year and decided that I wanted to start selling hair as a side project. This is something that I'm passionate about and have quite a good knowledge of as I have been using extensions for about 7 years. 
I know the market is probably a bit saturated, however I feel there is somewhat of a niche in selling synthetic hair pieces/half wigs/three-quarter wigs etc. This is cheap, 'disposable' beauty that I feel a lot of women around my age would be interested in buying. 

I have previously received samples of hair, picked a supplier based upon the hair which I liked the most/that was the best quality. I took what I would consider to be a significant risk financially given that I am still in university in purchasing stock. 
I now have numerous hairpieces ready to sell but I just feel so overwhelmed that I don't know what to do, and am losing motivation.

I have been waiting so long to get to this point, that I feel I probably never actually believed I would do it. Now that I'm ready to start the business, I feel completely bewildered. 

Does/did anyone else feel this way? Are there any good ways to combat this?

Hey /r/EngineeringStudents,

&amp;nbsp;

I have the final update regarding that whole 5 hour interview 2.5 hour lunch thing that I posted about last week.

I didn't get it, which is disappointing, but that's life, I guess. I'm doing my best to stay positive and keep applying to more jobs and hopefully get more opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;

The most disappointing part, however, is how the company handled the whole thing. At this point, I'm not afraid to discuss the company and whatever since I'm no longer being considered.

&amp;nbsp;

I interviewed with Intel Corporation, and I'm fully aware (and want you to keep this in mind too) that my one experience with this one group at this one location is obviously not indicative of the entire company and their practices. However, the way they handled this was surprisingly unprofessional.

&amp;nbsp;

I interviewed last week, and received a voicemail on Monday 2/29. My interviewer told me that they would call back the following day (yesterday, 3/1) between 1-5pm to follow-up on the on-site interview. Now, I've received phone calls giving me bad news in the past, so I wasn't necessarily optimistic, especially with the quick turnaround time (only 2 business days between interview and decision) and the time of day I would receive the call. 1-5pm is near the end of the day, and you'd rather give bad news at the end of the day than at the beginning, I guess. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, that night (2/29) at 9pm, I received en email from Intel Corporation asking for a background check and references from my internship and all sorts of things. So I'm thinking ""oh OK, interviewer probably just wanted to let me know I'd be receiving this email to fill out their form before they make their decision."" Also, I won't lie, I thought I got the job. Not sure if background checks are done on all candidates, though.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to yesterday, 3/1, at 4:15pm. 

""Hi this is so-and-so from Intel Corporation, I wanted to follow up about your on-site interview! Do you have a couple of minutes to spare to discuss this?"" in a happy-sounding voice. ""After reviewing your performance, we've decided not to move forward with your application.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Oh, OK. Well, that's disappointing news to hear, but thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview and for considering me for this position,"" I responded.

&amp;nbsp;

Long awkward pause followed by ""OK,"" on their end. Now, I don't know if this is common practice, but every time I've had an on-site interview, I've always received some sort of feedback about what I did well, what I did wrong, and why I'm no longer being considered. So I ask, and the answer I received blew my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

""You need to know your subject better.""

&amp;nbsp;

Hmm. OK... I think to myself.

""Yeah, you should know your subject more,"" they repeated, followed very quickly by ""OK thank you bye.""

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Uhh, what? What does that even mean? How is this constructive feedback? You know, if this is how they handle themselves (again, reminder, this one group at this one location, not the entire company) then I'm almost glad that I didn't get it. I can't imagine having a good time working in a group led by this sort of behavior. Or maybe this is just my confirmation bias taking over, you be the judge of that, I guess. And why email me asking for a background check if I already didn't get the job? I also JUST got an email reminding me to complete the background check while I was writing this up, wtf?

&amp;nbsp;

So, yeah, that's that. I guess I'm just more shocked than disappointed at this stage. It's like, you've had a crush on a girl who you thought was perfect, then after your first date you find out she's a smoker or an alcoholic or something, I don't know. Crappy analogy but I already typed it out lol.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the takeaway, though. I know this is gonna sound like some hippy-dippy bullshit or whatever, but trust me on this. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Don't take anything for granted. Don't take things personally! Who knows, maybe someone's nephew applied for this position at the same time I was interviewing for it, or maybe they found out they don't have the funds to add an extra position. I had a good talk with my older brother and my parents about this, and I think these are the right things to take away from the entire experience.

48nrho,1,2016-03-02,Questions about references,kdashi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/48nrho/questions_about_references/,"Some background: the only work experience I have are from two 4-month summer internships when I was in college. They were both at medium/large software companies. However, I'm a very, very shy person, and so I never really networked well with the people there and haven't stayed in contact (the last internship I had was a little less than 2 years ago). 

After graduating, I moved to another country and took about a year off to deal with legal and health issues, and am now trying to land my first full-time job. However, I have a few questions about references and if a company I apply to asks for them. Right now, I only have my two bosses listed, but...

1. My boss from my most recent internship was on vacation when the internship ended, and so I emailed to ask if I could use him as a reference. He never responded. Furthermore, I stupidly forgot to write down his phone number, so I only have his email address. Should I (or can I even) list him as a reference?

2. I was never really close to my boss from my first internship, but were just on ""acquaintance"" terms. I haven't spoken to him in 3 years, and I fear that he might not even remember me if someone calls him. Are old contacts like this still okay as references?

3. Due to the way the project was structured, I actually ended up working more with other employees in a completely different office location (like, across the country) than with my own boss/local team. Would it be weird to email the other employees and ask if they could be used as a reference, since I haven't maintained contact since after the internship ended, and they've actually never met me in person?"

I need some on how to get out of my situation, which has been very negative for me.

In 2014, I graduated from a top university (in the northeast US). My intent is, and always has been, to pursue music professionally. As you know, this is a difficult path. So upon graduating, with no firm job plans, I took an internship at a market research agency. I strongly disliked the internship, but it was a job and I stuck with it. After 6 months of that internship, I was recruited for a full time market research position in Los Angeles. I decided to take the job, knowing I would dislike it, but wanting to take the opportunity to move to LA for personal reasons but also for my music career.

This month, I've been at this job for one year. I absolutely despise it. I completely dread going to work every single day, and I've felt this way for the entirety of the year. The plan was for this job to support me while I pursue my music, which it has, but this plan is not sustainable. The job is simply too draining and taxing on my mental state. I have made some great strides with music in the past year, however, despite this. 

I have been wracking my brain on how to get myself out of this situation. I need to get out ASAP. My main goal is to find another means of employment that will a) not be in market research or any related field b) allow me to better pursue music.

I am open to many different kinds of situations, and have been actively seeking new positions. I've spent much time on job boards applying to positions which seem like they would be better, but have never even gotten as much as an email back. My resume is in pretty good shape so I'm not sure that's the issue.

My goal is just to get out and do something else. I would be completely happy with a job at a restaurant or similar service position. However, even these jobs require experience which I do not have. I just need ANY other job while I do music.

I have plans for a ""backup"" career, which I would basically do if I decide that the music isn't going to work out. This would involve applying to and enrolling in a coding bootcamp - I have a history of coding and solid skills in this area, so I am confident I could make a career out of that if need be. However, this is not something I am entertaining as a possibility at this time period.

So any advice would be great on how I can get out of here. Right now I am in a tough mental state since it feels like any efforts I make are completely futile.

Thanks for reading."

So I may have messed up beyond belief. During a traffic stop for having our headlights off on a rather large party day for my college, the officer made our driver step out and breathalyze. After he blew 0.00, the officer had mentioned he smelled liquor coming from the car, and instructed us all to blow. I was cited for a minor in consumption after blowing a 0.047.

Today, I was instructed to go to court by my parents(first mistake, since I'm 18) to try and inquire with the prosecution attorney about a diversionary program to make sure the minor does not inhibit my ability to be hired for internships. I had done this similar procedure in a different county in the same state for a traffic violation, so I had thought I would have been able to do the same thing I had done there. Unfortunately, I was not aware I would have to speak to a judge for this. Once she got over the formalities(the typical is-this-your-signature, do-you-waive-your-right-to-an-attorney mumbo jumbo), she asked for my plea. It was at this time I interjected with my intention to speak with the prosecuting attorney. She made me sign a pink sheet stating I will come back to court at a later date.

I wasn't prepared to speak to a judge, only to a prosecuting attorney. I feel way over my head, and really just want to get this over with. Is it possible to just pay the initial $180 fine, have this minor on my record, and be done with the whole ordeal without having to go back for the pretrial? If so, how would I go about doing that? I'm sorry if this seems absurdly simple, but I'm not a troubled child by any means(not so much as a speeding ticket on my record(anymore)) so I really do not have any experience in a courtroom. Any and all advice will be very appreciated. Thank you in advance.

EDIT: I'm from Minnesota, and was cited in Lyon county.

About a year ago, I moved to Florida with my now ex and found a job that boosted my career in an incredible way. 

I manage the entire internet department including managing the CRM, updating the website, responding to all incoming leads and making sure our salespeople are following up, sending the right content, following the plan etc. I created all brand new email templates, set up a system and rebranded the entire dealership (created a new logo, templates, facebook page). I create bulk emails for sales and service and have almost tripled our internet sales percentage as well gotten our response time to under 8 minutes (which for a manual response in this market is pretty good).

Well, I've only been at this job for 6 months. Last week, I got the call that my grandma finally needed someone to look over her as her health is worsening. I've talked to anyone in my family that can help and while they're able to contribute, they're lives are just too demanding and they live too far away to provide a daily check in/shopping needs, driving to appointments and such.

So, I decided I want to move back to take care of her and since I'm relocating, I can find somewhere closer. 

However, I'm in a really bad spot. I have a 5 month gap on my resume from May until October because the job market was so bad down here that I couldn't find anything. Even receptionist jobs weren't even calling me back. I was primarily a freelancer for a few years including while I was in school, during my two internships, and my year long stint working as a wedding videographer. 

This job kind of fell into my lap and it's an incredible opportunity. But I can't stay. My problem is that I have no idea what to look for.

There don't seem to be a lot of positions open where I need to be for what I do and I don't know what other job my skills translate to. My current manager is 100% behind me on this and has even offered to help me format my resume and such to help better my chances. 

I'm just so lost and I'm running out of time. And it's even worse now because I'm living with my ex and the only way to get out is to move back home- which I can't do without a job. 

What do my skills translate to? And how I can speed along the process?

tl;dr I'm an Internet Manager at a recovering car dealership who has rebranded the dealership and overhauled their internet department. I have to move back to my home state and there aren't many openings for my specific position. What jobs do my qualifications fit and how I can speed the process up as I only have 3 months?

To my main point I am a Junior CS major. I am in the process of interviewing for a few different internships, one in particular is for Ashland. I live in the south so cost of living is much cheaper, the pay is $18 an hour which I imagine is probably above average for the area/position. My department head informs me that the intern training program is very well ran and they offer several options for concentration (server infrastructure, development etc.) So for me every aspect of the job seems great, but I'm not sure about extending my graduation a year.

Essentially they want you to go to school one semester a year and work the other semester and over breaks for 2 years. Would you all consider this a strong negative? I would be making less than any post-grad job for 2 years, however the experience would certainly help my chances of getting a higher paying job in the future.

This isn't a question of internship or no internship, obviously I would do this over not having any pre-grad experience. I just want to see other's opinions on the pros and cons of this scenario.

I’ve attended a play session at Naughty Dog and while I was there I was responsible of testing their game’s design and overall mechanics. I explored as much of the game as I could, and tested the different systems and features in the game and as a result I constructed my feedback and input and had a discussion with the developers of the game about what they could do to improve it. At the age of 15 I took an exit exam and started pursuing my degree in the engineering field because not only did I want to become an engineer, but I wanted to start building a good skill set through college and work experience. Thankfully my efforts have paid off. Game testing, developing and finishing team projects, working at a tech shop, and being a manager and tutor have helped me mold excellent research, organization, and problem-solving skills. I work great within a team, meet deadlines, and am proficient with Microsoft Office. On my free time I’m an avid gamer and have an obsession with Marvel and DC superheroes.

Sorry. 


I had a CS intern interview today. Seemed to have good rapour with the interviewer. She liked my answers to the behavioral-type questions, problem-solving stuff, and general Java questions (what is overwriting a method, what are all the primitive types and their sizes, etc). Then there were a few technical questions. She asked me, what is wrong with this piece of code? (There was a little bit more interference code but this is the basic problem):

_________________________________________________
Instructions: The code should print 10, how can you fix it?

int total = 0;

for (int i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++)

total = total +i;

System.out.println(total)
_________________________________________________


I was running off 3-4 hours of sleep the last two nights and stressed because of a midterm later in the day so I wasn't in peak shape, but still, this is the type of thing I explain to students every day (I'm a CS tutor)! I figured I'd talk through the problem to explain how I usually work through these problems to show students what is happening. So I wrote down 'total = 0' and 'i = 1' to track the variables as I iterated through the loop, crossing off the numbers and updating them as I went. when i = 4 the loop fails its condition and stops. Total is 6. I got to that point and then just blanked. Do I add some extra variable to keep track of i outside of the loop? What is the trick to this problem? After maybe 20-30 seconds of mumbling over the problem again trying to figure it out she says ""I'll give you a hint its in the forloop"". I'm feeling kind of frozen for some reason. And she mentions that I've already counted up the numbers with 'i' and pointed to where I had written (i=1,2,3,4). And then I'm like ""oh...well I guess I could just iterate the loop once more by changing i &lt; 4 to i &lt; 5. She said ""yeah, I think you were overthinking that one"".


But I probably spent a few minutes on that question... and had a little guidance (even though I was eventually able to solve it on my own). I then went on to solve the other technical question that was a bitwise (a|b) question that was harder and more obscure before the interview concluded. 


I don't have a ton riding on this internship, but I've been kicking myself all day! I literally solve this type of problem (and ones much harder) all day. I just froze/blanked out. Do you think I still have any chance of making it to the next round of interviews even though I couldn't code my way out of a paper bag on this one question? Has anyone else made an equally face-palming interview mistake? Doh! Thanks for letting me rant. "

Yesterday, I passed my second A+ exam and got the certification! If you're like me wondering if it's worth it to take, if you can float the $360 USD (coupons for 10% off each exam for the win!) it's worth to have just for the self-gratification being able to put that down on your resume.

Naturally it's a recruiter across the country, but a 30 minute phone call with him at the end of his day Monday was really refreshing. The client company provides hardware support for Dell, a cert is required for Dell, and is supposedly free upon offer of employment and open book.

$16.50 an hour plus mileage in my own vehicle. Based on what it sounds like, 30-40 hours M-F all on-site up to 25 miles around my (relatively small) city.

Hours before, I interviewed at my local college for an IT Internship. I haven't heard from the manager since that day (said he was going to be busy this week), but I got a tour of the asset deployment and help desk areas. I really, really, really, wish they'd skip the internship and go straight to hiring me part time for asset deployment. I struck a good chord with every single person I met along the interview, along with the manger who also happens to be a car guy.

Beyond that, still trying to get the State government to give me an interview for an IT job. Now that I've got a Cert on my belt I'm hoping one pans out. I was lucky enough to resubmit an open application before the deadline tomorrow for help desk- though they list Bachelors or Associates/2-3 years help desk exp as minimum requirements. We'll see how it pans out.

I think I've gotten on the right path here, thanks to this subreddit, /r/resumes, and /r/jobs! The only question is who is going to offer me a job first, and will I be able to continue my internship AND take the ONE CIS class I need to take this coming term at the same time?"

For years, we’ve been fed these tales of terror through Poltergeist, the Omen, The Conjuring, etc. I never cared for them. They never frightened me and still don’t. Religious areas fascinate me, but nothing frightened me. That being said, I remember my first experience with the occult.
 
Growing up catholic meant a few things for me. Drinking is an acceptable sin, and fish fry during lent was a weekly affair. The adults would bring everyone together, and in the large basement kitchen of the catholic school, they would smoke, drink, and fry fish. Lent meant giving up certain indulgences, but fish, beer, and cigarettes were never an option. It was here that I had my first experience with the satanic paranormal. That cold Friday in March when Jonathan Oxenkiller went missing. 

We were to the school promptly at 5:45, just late enough for everyone to be off work and early enough to start drinking for a long weekend. Almost everyone in the area would come out to different areas for fish fry, and for us it was always the same 7-10 families. With 5 people a family at least, with one have 7 children, it could be a big affair. 
It was Friday, March 10th, 1989 when a new family showed up. They brought along a case of beer and some homemade hushpuppies, so they were quickly welcomed. They said they had moved from Madison, WI and were told by administrators of the Friday Night Fish Fry. They didn’t seem odd or out of place. The father looked like the other dads, the mom was bright and cheerful, and their son looked like he wanted to leave. All in all, they were like every family there, except for the fact that they has one 8 year old son and no other children around. These northern Catholic families, you see, are notorious for having 4+ kids. But they were friendly. 

I went over and introduced myself to the boy. I was 13, and really not in the mood to play, but I was friendly enough. The boy smiled, and said his name was Johnny Oxenkiller. My first thought was how cool that last name was. With a name like Elskin, any name sounded cool, while mine sounded like someone coming off of Novocain. 

We sat around and I asked him how he liked it here. He said he did. But kept mentioning how they were going back home real soon. I took him as a young kid who didn’t like the idea of leaving things behind, and his parents probably kept assuring him that they would be headed back soon. Lying to children is easy if it makes them happy. 

He got up when he saw the other children running around. He wanted to play too. And given that the local priest was with us, cooking fish and shooting the shit, the whole school was unlocked and open to our disposal. So, he took off running. I, being the oldest of them, ran over and told them we should play hide and seek. And they agreed. So off they ran. We laughed and played and, despite being a moody pubescent, I did enjoy it. Until we saw the boiler room door open. When one of us was found, we joined up to find the others. And now into our 3rd round, Johnny was the only one left. We’d been playing the 3rd round for 25 minutes. The problem was, if he was in the boiler room, none of us wanted to go and find him. 
Eventually, we all agreed to go together, and since I was the oldest, I got the short end of the stick and had to go down first incase anything decides to jump out and kill us. But nothing did. The only thing we found down there was a pentagram and a piece of the boys shirt. 

The police showed up within 2 minutes of the call, while his mother wailed and his father stayed in a corner chain smoking. They were both hysterical, and the other parents were as well. The police got statements from everyone, and I told them what I saw. I then took them to the boiler room and showed them the scene. There was no blood. No nothing. The small window, barely large enough for anyone to fit through, was open. But there was nothing to explain the shirt fragment laying in the middle of the pentagram. The police took it as evidence, along with scrapings of the dried substance that painted the pentagram of the floor. 
The news covered it for the first 2 days. The young boy, who had been in town only a week, was taken from the catholic school he had just enrolled in that morning. There were no answers. We prayed for him, we hoped for him, and we grieved for him, even though we all only knew him for an hour. The police had told the Oxenkillers that the substance found was blood, and they think it matched the boy. DNA testing has making strides, but they couldn’t be sure. The city just hadn’t needed to utilize DNA testing up to that point. After 2 months, past Easter and almost into June, the search was called off. Little Johnny Oxenkiller was presumed dead. 

The case remained opened for a while, albeit cold and fairly inactive. The police were looking into every vagrant in the area. The Oxenkillers themselves were suspects for a while. But they didn’t fit the pattern. The father moved here for a new job, they both had clean records, and they didn’t do it. We all knew that. Because we all knew that this was the work of the Devil. 
See, we were fairly inexperienced in areas of the occult. Pretty much any other religion was weird and scary to us. World Religions class was mostly over one religion. Simpler time, but not an always better time. But we knew it. That the devil had come and taken the child. Especially since it was one of the holiest seasons of the year. He wanted and innocent, and not even God could have stopped him. 

A year had passed, and no one was allowed in the boiler room. No one wanted to go there anyway. It was the next year of lent. And we remembered the events of last year as we got together at the same school. Friday, March 9th. 364 days since Johnny went missing. And his parents showed up. They again brought beer, and those homemade hushpuppies. And despite their still apparent grief, Mrs. Oxenkiller was 5 months pregnant. She sat and talked with the mothers about trying to move on, while her husband stood with the men frying fish and talking about “fucking Chicago.” We loved to hate the Bulls. 

The little kids ran to play hide and seek, and all made a point to remind each other that the boiler room was off limits. After 20 minutes, I knew it was almost time to eat, so I ran to go get them. And staring in front of me was the boiler room door, wide open yet again. 

Father Mendelssohn came running first with me down the stairs. There was another pentagram but nothing of any of the children. Two were still not back with us as we called the police. He examined the lock and the door and saw that it was drilled out. It was then that I had two thoughts; either the Devil carries power tools with him, or much like every episode of Scooby Doo, he wasn’t the one behind this. A young girl came around the corner and said she couldn’t find her brother. Since she showed up, he was the last one to find. I looked up and saw the window, and sprinted outside, with father running behind me as several parents started to follow us as well. I found the window outside, and began calling for the boy. I heard a muffled scream, and so did father. We both ran towards it, which was in a small field behind the school. We were searching for nothing. It was now 7:00, and dark. We couldn’t see anything. The fathers came running after, with the mothers rounding up the kids. For some reason, the 14 year old spear heading a search and rescue operation was just fine for them. We searched and searched the field to no avail, until we heard a scream that still chills me to think about coming from the trees that lay 50 yards across the wide field. I had never the sound of someone being stabbed until that moment. 

We reached the edge of the trees after what seemed like an eternity. One of the fathers had grabbed a crowbar from his truck before running to catch up, and another grabbed a baseball bat from his trunk. In the dark, we couldn’t find anything and heard nothing besides our frantic footsteps and the sirens growing closer and closer. Why anyone thought it would be a good idea to play hide and seek again is beyond me. 
I was walking along a rugged path between the trees when I heard a gunshot. I called for the group to get over here. We went to where it was and that’s when I heard hollow ground. I kicked it hard and my foot went right through. There was a plywood cover over a hole. They grabbed me and pulled me back up. Then someone threw the plywood aside and someone climbed in the hole. They quickly climbed out, gagging and throwing up, as the smell hit the rest of us. 

When the police showed up, they quickly cordoned off the scene. Homicide showed up along with the coroner, and together they climbed in. With light on the scene, it looked like an old bomb shelter with the door missing. They had flashlights. Thankfully we didn’t, or else we might have seen horrors no one should face. 
In total, 2 bodies were found. One was an unidentifiable grown man. And the 2nd one, now completely unrecognizable and with a smell that could gag a maggot, was Johnny Oxenkiller. It was an underground den of death. Nick McElliot, the boy who was just taken, was barely alive. The men felt bad for not investigating further, but Nick pulled through. 

We never actually found out who the guy was. State hospital records didn’t match his finger prints, and no DNA was matched. Plus the gun shot suicide in the face didn’t help the police much either. Due to wounds on the hands of Johnny, or what they assumed to be wound through the decay, and on Nick, they presumed that he had cut them in the boiler room to draw the pentagram and then got them out the window to kill them. They found 2 handwritten notes in the den, along with a notebook of illegible ramblings. The note were mostly about the crimes, with one saying “The pentagram threw them off completely. I could do this all the time if I wanted.” The other note talked about his other shelter 2 towns over. There, they found 7 bodies. Perhaps the worst part, which I only know now because I saw the police report when I worked for them as an intern of sorts one summer, was that the journal had a few legible sections. And one of those sections talked about how the man had used the bodies for sex for months after he killed them. 

The police closed the case. Johnny was finally laid to rest. All Nick said was that the man had grabbed him and tied his hands behind his back so that he couldn’t get up on his own. Other than that, the man was no one. And, as I assume no one probably wanted to, nobody claimed his body. John Doe, as we called him,  was cremated. And,  I can only imagine, his ashes promptly thrown in the dumpster. 


____________________________________________

I lost a little touch with religion that day. Im still Catholic, I still go to mass, and I still go to my weekly fish fry during lent. But ever since then, some part of me died. Father Mendelssohn said it was the horrors I'd seen and read in that report and first hand. The scream and the horrors did nothing to help the situation. And I agreed for a while, until I started remembering it more and more with each passing lent. 

I finally realized why I was falling out of religion and why those old movies like The Exorcism and The Omen didnt scare me. With men like John Doe walking the earth, I didnt need to fear the devil. I had to fear my fellow man.

48sh0p,2,2016-03-03,Quick help with saving iterated elements to an array.,YungKob,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/48sh0p/quick_help_with_saving_iterated_elements_to_an/,"Hi all, I am an intern for an internet service provider and I was given a small project that involves coding in some python. I get emails every day from compliance companies that send me data about copyright infringement happening on our network. My goal is to have my script automatically parse the (mostly) irrelevant data in these emails, until it finds the &lt;IP_Address&gt; XML tag identifier. Then I need to save these address in some sort of array or list. 


So I have this method, which retrieves MIME messages from my inbox:
    

     def GetMimeMessage(service, user_id, msg_id):
    """"""Get a Message and use it to create a MIME Message.

    Args:
    service: Authorized Gmail API service instance.
    user_id: User's email address. The special value ""me""
    can be used to indicate the authenticated user.
    msg_id: The ID of the Message required.

     Returns:
       A MIME Message, consisting of data from Message.
     """"""
     try:
    message = service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id, format='raw').execute()

    print ('Message snippet: %s' % message['snippet'])

    msg_str = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(message['raw'].encode('ASCII'))

    mime_msg = email.message_from_string(msg_str)
    return mime_msg
    except errors.HttpError, error:
    print ('An error occurred: %s' % error)


And this method, which lists messages based on a Query (In my case, those dealing with 'claimed infringement':

    def ListMessagesMatchingQuery(service, user_id, query=''):
    """"""List all Messages of the user's mailbox matching the query.

     Args:
    service: Authorized Gmail API service instance.
    user_id: User's email address. The special value ""me""
    can be used to indicate the authenticated user.
    query: String used to filter messages returned.
    Eg.- 'from:user@some_domain.com' for Messages from a particular     sender.

     Returns:
       List of Messages that match the criteria of the query. Note that the
      returned list contains Message IDs, you must use get with the
       appropriate ID to get the details of a Message.
     """"""
     try:
      response = service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id,
                                               q=query).execute()
    messages = []
    if 'messages' in response:
      messages.extend(response['messages'])

    while 'nextPageToken' in response:
      page_token = response['nextPageToken']
      response = service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id, q=query,
                                         pageToken=page_token).execute()
      messages.extend(response['messages'])

    return messages
     except errors.HttpError, error:
    print ('An error occurred: %s' % error)



So I create a list with all messages that are unread and match my query:

            defaultList= ListMessagesMatchingQuery(service, 'me', 'subject: claimed infringement label:unread ')

Its output looks something like the following: 

    {u'id': u'xxxxx', u'threadId': u'xxxx'}, {u'id': u'yyyyy', u'threadId': u'yyyyy'}, {u'id': u'zzzzz', u'threadId': u'zzzzz'}, .... you get the point }

There are no responses to these emails, so the 'id' and 'threadID' values are exactly the same across all instances. 


Now, for all the messages in this defaultList, I want to call the above GetMIMEMessage method, parse the email for the ip_address, and if it exists throw the value in an array or list. Here is my approach at this so far:

    for msg in defaultList:

        currentMSG=GetMimeMessage(service, 'me' , msg['id'])

         #Extract the IP Address Field using the XML included in DMCA emails
          #get a string value of the current message

         loc1 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;IP_Address&gt;')
        loc2 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;/IP_Address&gt;')

            #extract the IP address:
          ipaddress = str(currentMSG)[loc1 + 12:loc2]

My first thought was to make an array like ""ips=[]"" then have an incrementing variable put each ip address into this empty array, so like this:

        i=0
        for msg in defaultList:

        currentMSG=GetMimeMessage(service, 'me' , msg['id'])

         #Extract the IP Address Field using the XML included in DMCA emails
          #get a string value of the current message

         loc1 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;IP_Address&gt;')
        loc2 = str(currentMSG).find('&lt;/IP_Address&gt;')

            #extract the IP address:
          ipaddress = str(currentMSG)[loc1 + 12:loc2]
         ips[i]=ipaddress


However, this always throws an ""Index out of bounds exception"" and I'm not quite sure why this is. 

Another approach I thought might work would be to count the number of 'id' labels in 'defaultList' then use that number to create an outer loop around this for loop that runs until i&lt;amount of elements in defaultList. 

I'm really stuck on this for a few days now and I would like some input from more experienced Python'ers. I am pretty new to python and coding in general so I appreciate you bearing with me till this point!

So my last of my scheduled interviews for an internship wrapped up and none of the callbacks were positive. Yeah, yeah, I know: I needed to apply to more places and put in more time on the job search, but the point is that I have no options this summer, so much so that I asked on Yikyak just now what fast food places are the best to work at this summer. This on top of all the other things, from diagnosed anxiety and very likely depression, ratio blues, getting a bottom of the class grade in the last mechanical properties test, an obnoxious as fuck housemate in CS who is getting interviews every other weekend on the opposite coast, social anxiety and the resulting no networking skills, no relevant clubs only fun clubs that i haven't attended in weeks, and very possibly getting fucked by scheduling resulting in me likely needing another semester.

The core of it is basically me thinking i'm in the wrong program. I don't hate my classes or the material, far from it, it's just tricky. Meanwhile my housemate (comp sci) when he sees us engineers study jokes like ""lmao what are tests, whats studying"" in between hedge fund/medical corp/NYC startup/silicon valley vc darling interviews. Given I'll have 40K of debt on graduating if I wrap it up next May and I'm so far along in this degree his words are piercing, like I've missed out on the actual way to get a job. I feel like I should have been in CS from day 1, and that I would be good at it, but it's too late and I've made my bed and now I'll lie in it.

My hometown is a small place in the middle of nowhere, 100 miles from a city where anything happens, but it's looking like I'll have to go back there and to my family this summer. I'm not sure I can face them and say I have no internship after getting ones (not in materials, but in engineering) the previous two summers, or tell them about my depression or anxiety issues. To them, I'm the perfect little brainiac who went to nerd school and is going to Change the World (tm). I'm not sure they want to know about these struggles i'm having and to them ignorance will be bliss.

As for classes, if there's a project involved, I kick its ass. I'm top notch at writing for lab reports and otherwise. My sophomore design project was so perfect, the only perfect demonstration the professors have given in years of teaching, and the only question they had after was ""Are you going to patent this?"" (someone beat us unfortunately). But the materials classes this semester, kinetics and mechanical properties, are just not holding my attention well. Kinetics is arcane and the teaching is not good, and mechanical properties I had to miss the first two weeks due to a very poor rechanging of my antidepressants and going through the book is not getting me to where I need to be. The last test - catastrophic, the lowest in the class. and by a big margin. The labs are fun and engaging (Except trying to do metallography on a broken toe (oh yeah i broke my toe because i'm a clumsy fuckass)) and I do great writeups and reports, but some parts of the math are just completely above me. There is also a nonzero chance that due to getting fucked over in scheduling I may need to take a prerequisite late pushing me to another semester.

So, all this combines and you get a crisis of faith. Why am I here? (not just at this school, but on this planet) Why am I in materials, and not computer science? Can I ever find a job without a junior summer internship? Can I afford, both in cash and ""face"" with my family, to take another semester, which is likely to occur if I drop Mechanical Properties?  Will I ever find love? Can I get confidence?

Will everything be OK?"

I am 26 years old and considering a career path change. I have a Bachelor and Master's degree in mathematics (pure math, and master's in mathematical cryptography -- not mentioning the subject on purpose). After my degree I was considering a PhD, but in my last term I was convinced by friends/family members to go into work. 

Fast forward to today: I have been working in a Canadian consulting firm for (roughly) the past seven months. Part of their consulting practice is configuring / developing some custom code for large financial service clients, e.g. insurance.

While the ability to save money is nice, I find myself desiring a different challenge. I was quite angry with myself for taking the offer initially, after finding out the nature of my role and how little of my knowledge I would get to use. I eventually carved out some software development responsibilities, but I know enough to understand it's not the real deal.

I have already applied and have been accepted to a degree program in Computer Science (undergraduate). If I can get all of my course equivalencies in order, I would take 3 (and if not, 3.5) years to satisfy the requirements. 

My questions to this subreddit are:
1. I have a strange feeling that I'm being reckless by leaving my job, even though I have strong desire for this change. I would love to hear your thoughts on the level of risk based on current industry conditions.
2. I am re-investing my savings from my 1 year of work into school and from what I can see, I cannot qualify for any scholarships. Would I be ""discriminated against"" for being an older applicant to internships than normally admitted? (somewhat related to question 4). Again, interested in your impressions and experiences.
3. What kind of work-life balance improvement (or change) can I expect as, e.g. an SDE? I know this depends strongly on team and company, but I am eager to hear your experiences.
4. If I graduate in 3-3.5 years, can I expect a problem with ""age-gap""?

My issue is that I applied for around 20 companies, starting in late November for software engineering internships. Almost all banks rejected me without interview which cut down on number of internships available in UK. I now have three leads and will go to interviews but in case I fail to obtain internship, what can I do? Build projects over summer and start applying early for graduate roles?
I spoke with a recent graduate in CS who found work successfully without internships and he told me to do market research, i.e. what is in demand in combination with choosing what interests you and delve deeper into that.
Regarding application for graduate roles, I am interested in trying out embedded software path, data science or something more sophisticated because I want to get into the field of IT that is more in demand and has higher barrier of entry, mostly to reduce competition. For embedded, my plan is to go on and do EdX course on embedded systems and learn C/C++. However, at the same time that would make me too specialized and there are a lot fewer embedded software companies(ARM, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel?) and most are highly competitive. I am thinking of a fallback plan of learning something like C#/Java, i.e. build a project and apply to more generic companies like banks(Morgan Stanley, JP, some hedge funds etc).
So, I want to be madly prepared for technical interviews(Leetcode etc.) and have some projects in both embedded software and somewhat more generic apps to show off.
I am pretty happy with embedded project prospect(welcome ideas anyways) but would like to know what project would be something in C#/Java realm and would take at most 2-3 months to complete but still show my skills.

Update: since last time I posted, I had interview with a bank'(rejected), a company from Switzerland who considered giving me a chance for 2 weeks but withdrew today(better suited candidates were found) etc."

I'm currently a Freshman at community college hoping to transfer for Software Engineering. I've been trying to land some Engineering Internships with some local tech companies. However, as a Freshman without much object-oriented programming experience (they want C# and Java) I've had a tough time finding takers. 

At my recent interview the gentleman I was talking with mentioned there was an open spot for a Web Developer Intern this summer. Throughout high school I played around with HTML, CSS, and have been teaching myself Javascript so I am more experienced in those web technologies than C# which is what their engineer use. 

Would an internship my Freshman year as a web developer still be useful if my ultimate goal is being a Software Engineer, or should I risk looking for an engineering internship and not possibly land any? Thanks! "
48vkzi,6,2016-03-03,Late(?) Career Change Advice,masetrax,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/48vkzi/late_career_change_advice/,"Some background on me: I'm 33 years old with a mortgage and young family and have been working in resources for the last 10 years. With the slump in that industry, I've taken the initiative to think about a career change and have always had a fascination with technology. I made a conscious decision that I wanted to do what I love, and I'm too short, old and fat to get drafted into the NBA (the lack of jump shot also hurts in this regard, but i digress) 

So, after some research, I've enrolled to do a CompSci degree part-time, majoring in Cyber Security, which apparently is all the rage (first mistake?). After some further research it has become obvious that I won't get straight into a position in that field without the degree, certs and experience in a higher level role like Sysadmin, which in itself will be difficult to get into with a few years in a similar junior level position. I have a strong interest in Linux and have desktop experience of a couple of years, and I am starting on a certification path (LPIC-1 &gt; RHCSA &gt; RHCE, a CCNA and an MCSA eventually) to lead to a RHCE eventually, hopefully by the time I complete my degree (5yrs).

I feel like the degree and certifications will come along on their own time, but the experience, that's a harder prospect. As I have a family to support and a mortgage to pay, taking an entry level position in Helpdesk or similar is not really an option, nor is an internship as I would need to leave my current full-time job to undertake it. Reading through threads, working on things in a home lab might be an option to show experience - but truthfully, how much weight does this hold?
I would leave my current job for a position if I could get paid the same, but the 25-30k pay decrease to go entry level for a helpdesk in AUS would drive me to ruin.

Any constructive advice?"

I'm very worried and alone.",PickUrBattles,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48wa2c/need_help_im_a_recently_diagnosed_adhd_medical/,"Hi, I'm a medical student. I got in the profession because I was scoring real well in school and had great interest in science. I never realised how my methods of thinking, study and my personality as a whole was different than my mates. My parents and elder sister were emotionally abusive and always poked me for being 'careless' 'non-attentive' or 'forgetful', ignoring the fact that they were the same too. My father was a physically abusive, sick man too, who beat us up and beat our mother even worse. After cracking medical entrance I got in the top Medical College in my state. But my studies went worse and worse and I passed all years on boundaries. (Little above 50%). I suffered great loss during internship as my girlfriend, who was  the first and only person I could really talk to, died in a shocking accident. I was devastated. I must have been damaged even worse, as I don't even remember most things from the next month.  I couldn't talk to anyone, and when i tried to talk to a very close friend about my pain, she basically said it shouldn't be such a big deal, people lose bigger things in life, like the other day a boy from our college lost his father. ""In your case, its a girlfriend' is literally what she said. She said she liked me as a friend before because i wasnt clingy or needy (which i maybe seemed like now to her). This was hurtful to me and needless to say i stopped dealing with people altogether. Nearly for a year i didnt go to college. I thought after i took time to grieve, everything will be normal. After becoming a graduate we're supposed to prepare for post grad entrance exams, which are really tough. I couldn't focus and at the time whenever i studied, it was harder than ever before. I quit studies and did a good job for a year. I realised my potential was more, and wanted to pursue studies again. I quit the job and started studies. After a few months, concentration started fading away and i got stuck again. I decided to sort myself out and I took notes, wrote my symptoms down, and basically diagnosed myself as an ADHD patient. Everything matched (for those doubting my self-diagnosis, I have studies ADD in great detail, know whole DSM 4 &amp; 5 protocol for diagnosing. I'm ADHD alryt.) I started on methylphenidate, sold here as inspiral SR, (in USA it's Ritalin). I need to share my experience and problems with people-ADHD patients or not- who're sensitive and friendly. If you can help, you're most welcome. I really need help, because awareness of ADHD is very little in our country (India) even amongst psychiatrists. I have psychiatrists telling me it's a 'fanciful' diagnosis. As if it's not real. Hope that doesn't happen here. 
 Anyway my troubles are these-
1. I'm depressed. The more days i spend on medication, the more I realise about how I have suffered in my personal life because of ADHD, and despite trying, I have difficulty embracing my ADD. How can I, when literally no one here even knows the disease and even if I explained it to them, they're in denial. I'm on fluoxetine 10mg, I kept the dose low because I'm afraid of rebound depression. I'm thinking of increasing the dose in a few days.
2.I need help in studying- motivation, tricks to focus long hours studying, any positive ideas.
3. Personal life is hell. I'm all alone. I have lost too many friends as I get 'disappointed' in them after a while of being friends. This is happening more and more after death of my Girlfriend as I'm hiding the pain from most people. 
4. I can't let go my childhood bad memories. I can't talk to anyone about it. Only one person I opened about it is gone..
5. I am seriously worried about my marriage etc. Like I'm not married yet, but I don't think I'll get an understanding person who'll accept me, with my ADHD plus my tragic past. Most people in my profession here are very self centred and that's why I never got in a relationship with a girl from my college. My GF was a paramedic and we were really each other's best friends. She was so good, my expectations of a partner don't even seem realistic now. Should I worry??

Anyway, I want to thank anyone who read it all, esp.ADHD ppl out there, cuz I know it's nearly impossible for us to go through a black n white page whole. I am new to reddit, so if I'm mistaken anywhere please help me correct. "

I'm a current IT noob, with no related IT experience (save fixing computers for exercise bikes and troubleshooting avionics/electrical systems as a commercial pilot) who wants to pick up as many IT skills as possible so that I can qualify for a job upon graduation with the eventual aim of becoming a 'digital nomad'.

I realize that getting hired straight after a bachelors is probably a pipe dream and I should just choose the field which most interests me or gets me the independence to work remotely so I can travel, but the thing is , I don't know what those are and with my responsibilities I cannot really spend a lot of time/money exploring possibilities.

Of these three IT majors , security appeals to me on a visceral level because it seems like Ill have to always adapt and constantly solve new problems in creative ways (this is all based on my imagination btw , I see it as a sort of white hat hacker education, probably wrong on that).  However I have new ideas for apps or software every few weeks but not the tech expertise to build an elegant program so I would like to know how to do that because of the entrepreneurial opportunities and maybe it will help reach my goal of working from ""home"".

I know this is a scattered way to consider my future major but I am truly clueless.  Id like to avoid the multiple mistakes I made when getting my commercial pilots license and do this in the most efficient, cost-effective way which will position me to take the next steps whether that be an internship, freelance, part-time work or anything that will give me a chance to apply my education.

Any advice would be appreciated , I am going through the stickies and old threads to get the generic info.  Thank you all very much for all the past answers, it's easy to take the help on here for granted but I never do because other users advice has had great positive impacts on my life.  Thank You all!"

It's my first job. I got it after finishing college, at the end of a one-year, part-time internship with the same company. As such, there wasn't an interview process to get the job.

Although I enjoy the work, the place it too small and disorganized, so advancement prospects are small. I have nothing like a mentor, and I'm the one making most of the positive changes in terms of design decisions, workflow, and coding standards. I'd like to move on soon, and to prepare for that, I've bought the two books listed in the title, and have begun practising my whiteboard coding.

One thing that struck me while reading *Elements of Programming Interviews*, is that a lot of the guidance seems to assume someone finishing college, or fresh out of it.

I'm wondering if the kind of interview process (fundamental problems solved on a whiteboard/something) described in the book is applicable to interviews for positions above entry level? Although I'm delighted to be brushing up on core algorithm and data structure work, I feel like most of my time working is not involved with that kind of thing. I spend most of my time designing systems for flexibility and maintainability, and representing business logic in the application, not designing the most efficient algorithm for a small task.

The university is not that great (all the math part is good, but that's all) - no actual projects, absolutely no signs of internship in my area, no subjects I want to learn more about, like AI or machine learning, tough schedule (half of the subjects are obligatory and completely pointless). So the options are to try to matriculate to the universities I'd love to attend, or to go through all four years at my university, while getting only good math education (not great, just good).

Moreover, for a long time I wanted to migrate to the US, so this is one more reason to drop my university.

I thought of applying to those universities too late, when the last year at my high school was almost over. I do have a lot of achievements on a national level (even though where I live it is not that hard to achieve this), and I've competed at International Science Olympiad. Also, I have started a club where I taught younger students math and programming and which was pretty much successful. My GPA at high school was average (I didn't care about it much, being busy with my club) being about 4.3-4.5 out of 5, at the university currently it is pretty much above average.

Is it ok to apply to those universities (for bachelors degree), while I'm currently enrolled in the university, or is it better to graduate first and apply for masters? Is it a big deal that I'm trying to apply while already being a student, wouldn't it be a drawback for my application?

A bit of background - I graduated from uni and spent 6 months unemployed trying to get just about anything. Even ringing places and asking to make tea for free with them wasn't working out for me. It was really getting me down.

One day I applied for a job way above my expected paygrade. Average graduate salary is £21k in the UK, I applied for something at £32k that come with all sorts of whacky bonuses and extras. It asked for years of experience and all sorts of extras that I obviously lacked.

I just applied because I was in a routine of just about trying everything and by some miracle, I got invited to interview.

I turned up and when I sat in the interview it was obvious this huge company was way out of my league as I was just starting my career. The people that interviewed me were also incredibly friendly. When I left, I rang my parents and said 'it seemed like a great opportunity, I'm just too aware that they're looking for somebody with way more experience.'

Somehow, I got a call back one day and they offered me the job. The company car. The bonuses. The phones and gadgets. The expenses paid trips. I took it.

I've been working here for about 6-8 months and I just feel like I'm always fucking up in an obvious way or not really getting stuff like I should. Sometimes I think this is natural but then I panic because my boss has gone into detail about how they had people who'd worked all these amazing other jobs for years that they turned down because they thought they'd give me a golden chance.

I am so grateful for the job and the amazing chance, but I can't help but feel I'm just not experienced enough and not on the ball enough and I'm letting my team down. I keep asking obvious questions and I feel like they're just too afraid to tell me I'm a bit more like an intern than a colleague. It's stressing me out because I try my best but sometimes my boss asks me to do things and I've no idea where to start. It stresses me out and I end up just pestering people who eventually do it for me or just tell me what to do.

What should I do? I'd speak to my boss but I don't want to sound ungrateful."

I don't have anything to put on my resume except my GPA and my job in an unrelated field (I'm 25 and going back to school). I read this sub a lot. I know I need to be working on a personal project to put on my resume, but every time I research ideas, I get so overwhelmed. I don't even know where to start. Everything feels so far out of the scope of what I can do. I do great on my assignments, but I feel like I am so far from building anything usable in the real-world. I get better grades than all the people that I know from my CSCI classes, but I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. Am I just hanging around mediocre people?


I can't even figure out what I'm interested in. There are so many specializations - web development, etc., that I haven't been exposed to in school. When it comes to figuring out what to do for a project, I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions.


I know I need to get moving, and fast, if I want to have any sort of internship lined up this summer. If anyone has any advice for me, I would greatly appreciate hearing it!

I am graduating high school soon and the questions about what I'm going to do the rest of my life are popping up (Have been for a while but ya know procrastination... ) I currently have an IT internship with one of my local towns but it has limited hours and I feel it may be limiting my ability's. I have been looking at a software engineering career for the last 2 years of high school.  I also finished all programming classes available in my school (Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Node.js). I additionally took a system admin class and network administration class which taught me about common IT issues / solutions, layers of the OSI model and other stuff (Mostly relating to the CCNA certification). I  have a wide range of knowledge with Linux which is my operating system of choice (Arch). Lately I have been interested with penetration testing as it is pretty cool but fear it might not be a sustainable career . I enjoy almost all of the subjects equally but cannot stick with a career decision.  I have credits with all of my local Community colleges which I plan to attend for 2 years and then move up to a 4 year . (The credits from the 2 year college append to the 4 year college degree for a total of 4 years)  So the question is what field do you think I would enjoy the most while maintaining a hefty income? (Because money is cool).

While I enjoyed EE, I also absolutely loved my two C++ classes (Intro to C++ and data structures, basically).


I'd really like to further look into going into software development as a career (especially since the job market seems much better).


 I know the common advice to an EE in my position would be to write embedded and low level code, but writing at that level is unappealing to me. Why would I want to write software where you have to optimize for size/speed to the extent you do for a microcontroller when I could be developing for a computer or mobile where resources are comparatively limitless?

I've spoken with companies about software positions at career fairs and the like, but unsurprisingly they tell me that they're more recruiting CS majors.

Do you guys have any advice on how I might secure an internship in software engineering? My resume is decent, 2 internships and faculty research, but of course none of it's in software, which seems like a hard sell.

Thanks for the help!

P.S: Would it be worth it to get a minor in CS even if it takes an extra semester (so 4.5 years?)"

* University of Maryland ~ 40k/year

* UIUC ~ 40k/year

* Michigan ~ 57k/year

* University of Pittsburgh - 6k/year

* UT Austin(in state) ~ 20k/year




I have gotten into the CS departments for all of these schools and Im still waiting for GeorgiaTech and Berkeley but I really think the decision will be coming down between Pitt and UT. My parents are willing to help me pay for college but they are really loving Pitt's price tag over UTs. I want to go to the school that puts me in the best position for exploring and ultimately has the best ROI in the end. Im not too sure what I want to do as my career. A lot of my friends just want a job at one of the Big 4 and I know those are nice jobs to have, but I believe theres more to be discovered than just a Google internship. I really just want to work on NASAs quantum computer or potentially start my own company. Or maybe Im just getting too ahead of myself. All advice is appreciated. "

I am fully independent due to my family background and have to maintain a full time job during school and the summer that pays $20+ an hour in order to pay for school, rent, books, insurance, car.... Basically everything. My gpa is also low due to the fact I started in Mechanical Engineering and struggled through those classes freshman year and earned a 2.0 my first year. Since then I have had a 3.0 gpa since switching to  MIS.

I have gotten turned down from jobs because of a lack of experience. I can't find an internship that pays enough/has enough hours so that I can even scrape by. I currently know VB.Net very well and have learned java and started learning php in my free time. I have even created websites as well as done a java project in order to add some personal experience to my resume in my free time. 

The job I currently have is a waiter/bartender at a nice restaurant that I have been working consistently through school for 2 years. Would the fact that I started as a bussed and moved up in less than a year to bartender and am now being looked at for a potential manager position in the next month or so help out at all?

The job search has become very frustrating and I don't know what to do. How am I supposed to gain experience if I support myself financially and have no wiggle room since even now I have to budget everything to the last penny. Are employers forgiving in these types of situations or will I have to take a terrible job out of college because I am considered unsought goods in the term of labor? If an employer even made a contact to my current manager they would say I strive to do well and am one of the best workers they have had work under them. What can I do to increase my chances of landing a decent job?"

I am an freshman studying computer science at a target school for the Big 4 and other competitive industries like algo trading. Basically, I have an opportunity to join an finance startup at my university as a software dev/data scientist, it's nothing too crazy, a commitment of perhaps 8 hours a week. 

In the past, I've made many sacrifices to maintain a solid GPA, like 3.85+.   I naturally did stuff like sacrifice my social life, and other commitments to make sure I was getting pretty good grades.

This semester, classes/activities have gotten a lot more time-consuming for me.  I'm sleeping less, rarely socializing for the sake of it, but I don't feel worse. In fact, I'm a lot healthier and I really feel like I'm learning skills that will help me make a difference in the long run. 

It's not that I don't do extracurricular activities. I'm part of a dance team, that's like 7 hours/wk. I'm part of a entrepreneurship club &amp;  some other low maintenance clubs (basically stuff that looks good on resumes and the effort to reward ratio is fantastic)

In college, has maintaining a good GPA really rewarded anybody? I mean, like a potential reward I see would be getting a job in something like algo trading/Palantir type stuff out of undergrad, but I doubt that's necessary in life for me to be ""successful"" in my early career years.

The seniors who I respect a lot, who are getting jobs at the hottest tech&amp;finance companies, don't really work on high commitment projects during the school year itself (I may be highly biased). They do great summer internships, but only a couple medium/low commitment clubs throughout the year. In the long run, I have no doubt they'll be running startups. 

TLDR - My schedule is booked with classes and random shit. Should i join a fintech startup at my university as a software dev/data scientist at 8 hr/week and learn how to code and make a cool product? Is that experience in college, of committing myself to a project, going to give me skills that will help me out in the long run? Or should I just maintain a nice GPA (which probably will only be marginally better?) and hope the rest will fall into place later?

Edit: I'm going for like a 3.7 GPA without the startup involved. With the startup, it might just drop to a 3.5 . Is that okay?"

Most of it has to do with my severe depression. I usually suffer from holiday blues, but due to some personal things going on in my life right now, my depression has been worse and I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore. I'll try to be as clear as I can about it. 

So my family is poor, dirt poor. By poor, I mean my mom making 30k a year poor. My dad died of cancer a year ago and my mom started feeling the effects of his death summer 2015, when my mom stopped getting my dad's social security benefits (my dad got in a car wreck that fucked up his legs and couldn't work anymore).  Because of that I vowed to drop out of school to get a job to help her pay bills if she couldn't handle it. I said I'd work, then pay for the remaining six classes I need to graduate. I was going to college full time, so I didn't work because there wasn't really a need for it, until now.

So right now I am not attending school and in need of a job. That's not the problem, however. I decided that I don't want to be a school teacher because I do not think I am mature enough or responsible enough to handle a job like that. Mom wants me to finish school because I'd be throwing away my education. I'm only 6 classes away from graduating, but I need to do all these exams for teaching that I feel would be worthless to take if I'm not interested in this field anymore. So I need to take all these exams, do some extracurricular stuff, and an internship to finish up my teaching degree. But as I mentioned before, I do not feel like it would be worth all the effort if I'm not going to enjoy being a teacher.

So now I don't know what I want to do with my life. Here I am at home just rotting away, all melancholy and shit with no job or anything. If I worked, I don't know what I'd want to apply for. I should mention that I've also developed a nocturnal schedule, so I sleep at 6 am and wake up at 2ish pm.  I'm a very sensitive person and am afraid of confrontations, so something like a call center or a security guard are out of the question (this is actually one reason why I don't want to be a teacher; because I'm too wimpy for that sort of job). 

But really, I just want your guys' insight on what I should do? Should I finish up on school or start career hunting?  I'm really burnt out on school and I really don't know what else to go for because nothing really appealed to me. What jobs/careers could you guys recommend for me? I only have restaurant experience, although I dislike working with people and have like no skills. I'm good at typing and art, that's about it. 

TLDR: Need advice on whether I should finish up on school or not or if I should just seek out other career options. "

I am building a product which logs website visitor information.

I need to be able to look for specific patterns in this visitor data.

For example, let's say there was a sudden spike in visitors tonight from 8 PM - 11 PM.

I want my product to be able to recognise periods when there is a spike in traffic.

I understand I could write some brute force code which does something like counts the number of visitors in every 5 minute period and compares the current value with the previous 5 minute period value, and then compares the previous 5 minute period value with the one before that, and so on for perhaps the previous ten 5 minute periods, and try to judge if traffic is increasing.

But obviously this is a horrible way to achieve this.

Are there any common pattern/trend algorithms or techniques or general best practices for this sort of thing?

Also, what is this area of study called? Is it statistics? If so, is this something I could hire a statistics intern to help with, or is it too advanced?

Sorry if these are stupid questions.

Thanks for your advice.

491vd4,21,2016-03-05,New grad - Front-End Developer [Bay Area],JM_Santos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/491vd4/new_grad_frontend_developer_bay_area/,"I would like to take this opportunity to share my experiences on my job hunt that started at the beginnings of this year (January, 20th, 2016). I will be really detailed about my background and what I have been doing lately. You can start making some coffee to go along with this post.

--- Before Graduation ---

First, as the title suggests I am located in the Bay Area (South Bay). I am a newly-graduated international student from a non-renowned university. My main focus as today is Front-End Development with hopes of some day becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

The reason I decided to do Front-end was simply luck, I was hearing from one of my friends that today's job market is highly competitive and a bunch of people are having a tough time finding a job after graduation. This prompted me to make some researches of what I should I do and how to prepare myself to it. I found that having projects was important, but one of the most attractive things for an employer is your working history (some people may disagree).

This was the main reason I started to dig in this new word of 'internships'. I went straight to Craigslist and started to send away my old resume. This went for a couple of weeks, until finally I started to get responses, many were 'sorrily to inform me that they have decided to move forward with other candidates' (Hahh). However to my surprise, one small startup offered me the chance to work for as an unpaid front-end developer (never did web on my life, besides basic HTML).

My main duties were to work remotely doing small features on websites or working with mocks. This went for six months, I would work for them on weekends or at night, they didn't mind as long as I met deadlines. It was kind of tiring, because I had to keep a part-time job at my school to pay for my studies. Nevertheless, for some reason the startup didn't do well and at some point I never heard of them, their site went down, and well I found myself without a relevant job.

I kept sending my resume just to tell myself that at least I was 'trying'. Lucky me, another startup contacted me offering me another remote job since they were lacking of front-end developers for a small project they had. This was the first serious job, I learnt about the cool stuff front-end developers do and got exposed to a bunch of tools and frameworks (huge learning curve by the way). They paid me nicely, $30 / hour for 10 hours a week. Sometimes I worked way more than that to compensate my lack of background. The money came nice, it helped me to pay-off all my debts at the university. This lasted 8-months, the project ended and the company didn't need an extra developer anymore.

Everything came together, my graduation date was coming, so I started to apply more seriously and at the same time tried to Ace all my final exams and projects. No offer came. 

--- After Graduation ---

A couple of weeks after my graduation date, I received my EAD card to do OPT (Optional Practical Training). This gave me the chance to work for any employer in the US if I was able to land a job before the 90 days of unemployment. At the beginning, I thought 90 days were more than enough, but to my surprises the hiring process is long and tedious in many companies. There are lots of interviews rounds, and waiting time between them.

Shortly after receiving the OPT, I started to receive emails again. The screening calls were easy, I made sure to apply for jobs which I thought I would be a got fit. Reading interviews questions online helps a lot, as well as doing challenges on Leetcode and HackerRank. Not sure how it goes, but perhaps many recruiters just simply 'Googled' their questions. I found that many employers had their own code challenges and deadlines (there are exceptions, and at the end every company has their way of doing things). These challenges can take pretty much of your time, I made sure to spend a good time on each challenge to shine over other job seekers. 

My tactics seemed to work, I felt at the top of the world, my preparation was paying back. Yes, I got many emails to tell me that unfortunately I wasn't a good fit, but at the same time I was getting a good number of interviews, video conferences, calls. 

The time came and I was invited to my first on-site interview. It was tiring, I had to speak with six people, one after another. It was the engineering team at that company. It was frightening, but I had the chance to see how they work and how this big companies in San Francisco work. Everything went just fine, I got asked about literally everything. The last round was here, the team lead wanted to speak with me and give a last challenge. He asked me to implement my own ""[pub/sub](https://davidwalsh.name/pubsub-javascript)"", but I truly didn't know how to answer it at that time. There was a silence in the room we were, and he was there taking notes on a printed copy of my resume, as I tried my best to answer his question. The interview ended, we shook hands and I was sent home to wait for their final decision.

Days passed and the email that I feared the most came on my email inbox, they decided to pursue other candidates. I won't lie, I felt terrible. They told me, that they were really impressed with my answer for their challenge, and stuff. My mood was down, for a couple of days until I decided to learn from this experience, and get ready for other upcoming interviews.

The process was tedious. However, I was getting better and better at interviews, my coding skills skyrocketed. The more challenges, the more books I read, and everything snowballed. After several weeks, I finally found a job in a small company as a part-time employee. 

I still keep applying, I am still aiming for a full-time position. I am guy with principles, I was totally clear with these guys on the part-time job that if a full-time job was offered to me in another company, I wouldn't be able to work during week-days and offered them the possibility of remote-work. They were happy to hear my honesty, and told me that it was fine for me to work remotely and weekends. 

Next week, I was invited on-site to a non-technical interview (this is the first time I have one of those). The truth is that I don't know what to expect, but these guys seemed really impressed with my answers for their coding challenge.

Appreciate the time you guys took to read my story. I will be updating it with more details, if I find people is interested of hearing how it goes for international students here in the Bay Area. I will also try to post my edited resume here for more details.

Note: Since this is subreddit deals with CS Career Questions, I would love to hear any advice/feedback that you may have for me!

There were 5 guys and me alone girl. Back then I was quite naive, very shy. As we were going to work together for 3 years I thought why not be friends with these people. So I started talking to them outside work. Everytime, everytime I said something to them or did something, they either mocked me or made some insulting comments. I thought may be I am so naive they make fun of me, so I started changing myself. I started dressing up which made me uncomfortable, changed my habits. But still their attitude dint change. And I didnt realise this has started affecting me. On top of it I fell for one of the guys which gave them more fodder to make fun of me. This affected me so much that I started failing my exams. That guy I fell for treated me like shit after he heard about my feelings for him and this hurt me. He left the office and I went into depression which continued till 6 months and affected my studies. A few months passed by the time 3 girls joined us for internship. These girls were out going, so guys became quite friendly with them and all of them started meeting outside office as well. They never asked me to join them.

But the girls used to bitch a lot about the guys. Said mean things about them. I made a mistake of telling one of the guys about all the mean things that were being said behind their back. When confronted, I dont know how but girls convinced them that I was a liar, jealous that guys are not giving me attention anymore and want to play office politics. All the guys believed them and for almost year treated me like shit. My boss sensed that there is something going on because work environment had affected. He paired me with one of the guys and gave us assignments which required us to work together. Initially due to work issues that guy started talking to me. I dont know what made him realise that I was telling him truth about the girls bitching but not only he started talking like a friend but also started believed i was telling truth back then. Last 3-4 months of my internship, other guys too started talking to me and treated me well.

But all these situations affected me so much that I was almost damaged. Even though they were friendly later I couldn't trust them again. I never believed a word they said even if meant well. Those 3-4 years changed me alot. Even now at 27 I am so scared  to talk to strangers that they will laugh at me. I have lost confidence in me. I dont speak my mind. I dont socialize and havent made good friends since then. I keep people at a distance.

I dont know how to deal with this social awkwardness."

If you think this post is inappropriate, I'll remove it and wait for Tuesday's internship discussion.

Hey guys! I was fortunate enough to secure an internship this summer. However, it is at small unknown startup and the pay is minimal, so I am there pretty much exclusively for the job experience (I have none currently).

Next year I will be in my penultimate year (a junior in american college terminology) and that will be my last chance at getting a prestigious internship before I graduate. I want to do all I can to increase my chances at getting one of these sought after internship positions. I know what to do for interview preparation, but making an impressive CV is that will get me an interview is what I'm struggling with.

Basically, what can I do during my internship to make that section of my experience stand out? I don't want to just write ""Worked at company X, was intern, wrote some Scala"". I can only think of doing my best to impress my boss and get him to give me more demanding projects, but maybe there is something else I can do?"

I'm currently an intern working for ~$6/hour in Western Europe. Besides that I'm attending university for a CS degree. I know that I'm heavily underpayed, but I do this for the job experience.

I have no problems at all with deep CS understanding and applying the stuff in the real world. Hell even calculus and statistics are not impossible to apply in the real world. It takes some time, but after a while you look at the needed formulas/papers like you would google for Stackoverflow solutions.

However currently I'm struggling with something different. I'm expected to know (in my opinion) too much about other fields such as chemistry, accounting, mechanical engineering. I mean really specific procedures, (patented) components, etc.. It was already hard enough to be competent on all major platforms (Web, Desktop, Mobile), how I'm supposed to know those unique platforms?

I know that I have no time at all to learn more about those things since I already use my weekends for university.

I approached my manager and he seems to not care at all. He just points at the deadline and yells at me that I should have this done by then.

If I follow the advices on this sub, I simply should find another job. However I'm stuck with this university for the next years and there is no other job except for remote work.

Have you ever been in such a situation?"

So I'm transitioning into software engineering from a non technical background (I've worked in communications and operations previously). I'm in the last year of my second bachelor's in Computer Science program from Oregon State. My end goal is to work in tech in New York either for one of the big guys like Facebook (wishful thinking) or one of the high growth startups like Birchbox or Etsy. I'm quitting my current job (scary) in order to do one of these internships as I believe I really need to get professional engineering experience in order to be a better candidate for full time. I have one with IBM in Texas on the OpenStack cloud software engineering team and one with Priceline in NYC Metro Area (Connecticut) doing software engineering for the marketing team. At IBM you work with a group of interns to complete a large summer project and in the other I'm going to be the only intern on the engineering team (but working with 10 other engineers) so I will be able to own projects all on my own.

4930h3,36,2016-03-05,Don't discount a good part-time MBA - it entirely transformed my career!,WeekendAtSternies,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4930h3/dont_discount_a_good_parttime_mba_it_entirely/,"Let me start by saying I'm not just trying to boast (okay, maybe a little), but want to impart some insights to a unique way of taking full advantage of a top MBA program and pivot your career. I'll lead with TL;DR and you can decide if you want to learn more: 

I took the GRE, commuted almost 400 miles round trip for part-time weekend classes, pivoted my career entirely from a non-quantitive role into a data analytics position after a year and a half, then accepted a dream job in management consulting just before graduation. And despite my distance from campus, I was able to hold several leadership positions with student government and clubs. Oh yeah, I also managed to get engaged to an amazing woman in the process (so fortunate she has put up with this and with me in this process).

Here's the story:
A few years ago I felt entirely trapped in a dead end career with no hard skills and no light at the end of the tunnel. While I had a BS from a top-15 ranked University, it was in a majorly qualitative field, and I knew I needed to go back to school to develop some hard skills if I wanted to pivot my career. I decided to prep for and take the GRE. I ended up deciding to apply to MBA programs.  

I was particularly intrigued by part-time programs - what intelligent business person wouldn't recognize the massive cost benefits to earning income while in school? Also, the benefits of applying classroom learning to the work place in real time seemed pretty cool. 

So many people and resources gave me so many reasons to discount the part-time experience. I heard things like: 

“It’s not as immersive.”
“Companies prefer full-time MBA students.”
“The professors aren’t as good.”
“There’s no opportunity to get involved outside the classroom.”

I call bullshit. A good part-time program is what you make of it. To me, a full-time MBA is like paying for surgery to fix the pains in your career (nothing wrong with that). However, a part-time MBA is more like physical therapy – it’s a lot of work and a major commitment, but if you give it all you’ve got, you’ll come out with not only the same education and great experience, but a stronger network of peers already working for organizations in which you may be interested, and a greater appreciation for what you’ve accomplished at the end. I’m not trying to say that a full-time program isn’t a lot of work and may not be better for a lot of people. But, you can’t convince me that a full-time student works harder and more than a fully-committed part-time student also working a full-time job. 

Anyway, I live in Baltimore, where the University of Maryland’s Smith School has a satellite campus. I gave it so many chances. I wanted to love it, but it wasn’t for me. There were some other locally highly regarded schools, but I wanted a degree with a strong reputation that I could take elsewhere if need be. I visited Georgetown. I liked it a lot, but they didn’t offer weekend classes at the time, and there’s no way I was sitting in rush hour traffic twice a week between Baltimore and DC – that’s at least 6 hours of lost time a week. It was out. My brother in NYC convinced me to take a look at NYU Stern. I visited and fell in love with the school. I also knew that a degree from NYU would carry weight wherever I went, and would help differentiate me if I were to stay in Baltimore. Sure, the commute would be tough, but on the train rides to and from I would be able to get things done. When I was accepted I knew what I had to do. 

30 months and 200+ Amtrak train rides later (I’m actually writing this on the train), I can unequivocally say that going to Stern for a part-time MBA was the single greatest decision I’ve made in my life (aside from proposing to my fiancée, of course). 

Despite my distance from campus during the week, I was able to take on leadership positions with student government and the one club that interested me most. I met some amazing people and made good friends for life. The curriculum and professors are all the same as the full-time program – some are better than others, but the good ones are PHENOMENAL. Also, despite what Stern tells you when applying, I was able to pick up a specialization in Business Analytics by taking exclusively weekend classes. 13 months into the program I landed a sweet remote part-time internship to help me gain some experience, and 20 months into the program I pivoted my career away from an entirely qualitative role in recruiting to a high visibility data analytics position with a world-renowned hospital. Now, with 2 months before graduation, I have accepted a dream job in Management Consulting with a firm I know you’ve all heard of – and I’ll be based in Baltimore, after all. 

Sure, I’ve sacrificed a lot of weekends, but the personal and professional gains have far outweighed that, and the social outlet with classmates has been great at alleviating stress. It helped to have a girlfriend and now fiancée who was nothing but incredibly supportive in the process, that’s for sure. It also wouldn’t have been so easy to do without my amazing brother and his wife welcoming me into their NYC home for at least one night almost every weekend I had class. But I have classmates who’ve actually commuted longer distances than me and with less of a support network, and they all seem to feel the same way as me about the experience. 

This is not intended as an advertisement for Stern, or to say “LOOK AT ME AND WHAT I DID!” I’m just trying to spread the word that there is absolutely no reason to think less of a part-time MBA program. I’ve spoken with many a hiring manager who agree. There are many great part-time options out there and everyone’s needs are different. I encourage everyone to consider this path. It’s been quite a ride.

Need some advice.,c0ded_truth,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4931a1/having_some_second_thoughts_about_chemical/,"I'm in my 3rd year of chemical engineering, and i've just been having some thoughts lately that I don't know where else to share. I should mention that because I didn't take a class that's only offered in the fall (I didn't know this until it was too late), it pushed me back a year and I can't finish in less than 5 years, so after this semester I have two years left.  I feel like I'm not as passionate about the profession as I once thought. I wanted to go into engineering because I've always wanted to know how things work, and I'm not finding any of that in chemical engineering. It seems to be mostly processes rather than making things or learning how they work. After doing some research, I was thinking about electrical engineering, because I've always been into technology. 

Another thing discouraging me from chemical engineering is the lack of opportunities around my area (I'm from Chicago) while I'm looking for internships. I often hear that chemical engineers don't have a lot of flexibility in terms of location, and I love my city too much to leave it. 

All this being said, I wanted to get some second opinions from here. Should I switch? What's holding me back is the fact that I will probably end up staying in school longer than necessary if I do. Can any EEs tell me what the coursework is like (besides that its a lot of math)? I really liked physics 2 and programming too (had to take a c++/matlab class), which I hear is done a lot in EE. Sorry for the long post, but I appreciate any and every bit of feedback!!"

I'm a first-year who took CSE 11 last quarter, and finished strong with a 98%. However, this quarter, I'm taking 12, 15L, and 20. 12 with Gary is fine, but 15L and 20 in particular I'm struggling with - the lab quizzes and exams feel like memorization of commands we've used maybe once, and I can never figure out what the graders want for the 20 homework. The first midterm was fine, but the last one I didn't do so well because of the proofs. It's also partially my fault for overloading myself with 5 classes this quarter, which I only figured out after dropping the 5th last week.

At this rate, my CS GPA will end up as a 3.25-3.5, which seems way below the cutoff for an impacted major. 

I know I really want to go into CS, though - I've already completed a few sizeable projects in high school, learned a lot of languages, and got a CS internship at a small company last summer. This will all be for nothing if I can't get the degree I want, though. What options do I have? Transfer?"

I recognize that I need to make a decision about graduate school and I am having a hard time deciding what path to take.

I am debating between a Ph.D. degree or a 1 year masters that my school offers. With my resume I was told I could get into a mid-teir Ph.D. program (~15-35th ranked) or I could get my masters degree in another year. I have to apply to the masters program, but I am not worried about being denied.

I feel like the Ph.D. would push me further as an engineer and is more prestigous. However, I am not convinced it makes financial sense. The starting salary for Ph.D. students is very high, but of course you lose 4-5 years salary and 4-5 years that you could be working on promotions.

I am worried I will look back and think I didn't go ""all the way"" or I took the easy way out. Do experienced professionals ever feel this way? Can other grad students chime in?"

Edit: This turned more into a life story than just career story. I decided to keep them in because it shows some of my personality. Please be gentle :)

----------

I've always done quite well in my teens, but wasn't sure what I should focus my energy on. I was lucky enough to go to an Ivy where I learned some potential paths for this world. I met a few people they were thinking of finance, so I tried to do that without much thinking. It just seemed safe and doable. I majored in math and econ, while doing a lot of literature which I enjoyed. 

Meanwhile the school's started to seem toxic to me by my third year. Nothing against the institution but perhaps I was going through a tough time and just needed to get away. I took a job at an investment fund for the summer, and when they offered me full time immediately I pieced together a major and then graduated. 

By this point I still wasn't sure about finance. It was a small shop so I got a taste of everything on the markets side. I wasn't particularly passionate about it, but I found it interesting and engaging on a daily basis. Meanwhile the location of the jog and growth prospect was probably on the bottom 20%-tile, so I decided I had enough experience to jump into something in a finance hub. 

After a while I got something in NY, not exactly an ideal position but at a great firm. I had folks pushing for me and I got some color that I could move to a position I like in some time. I was woefully unqualified for this job, so it was more of a lucked out 1/20 kind of outcome. I was very excited.

Unfortunately I'm still an immigrant in the US and just as I was about to join the position my green card application was denied. Without the proper work authorization I couldn't attend to the job, pissed off a lot of people. Then I had to go back to my old home and to wait for about 6 months while we appeal for the case, unable to do anything in terms of work with a contract. 

At the time I was really at a loss. I had to spend a few months piece myself together, no time to think about work stuff or it made me very anxious. It was the first time I had to deal with the dreaded ""resume gap."" On top there's the chance that I might have to be barred from the country in which I received 80% of my education. I thought myself as free-spirited and resilient or whatever, but when it happened I got torn to shreds. I spent days and weeks in my house not able to do anything. 

I have this finish-what-you-started mentality. So I started studying for the CFA (a 3 level test, each takes a year, equivalent to a masters for financial analysis and markets). Meanwhile I also started studying for the GMAT. I don't know why I was doing all of that but I'm used to keeping myself occupied and I just felt I needed to do something. Meanwhile I decided a master's program in finance would've been a good idea to round out the resume gap. I started looking at programs abroad and found some cheap ones in Europe, thinking that it would be a good place to be doing something while my case to process, for the unforeseeable next 3mo to 3 years. 

I spent 8-10 hours a day studying, for 2 months straight. Luckily I passed the tests and got a temporary respite, without any sense of relief. I felt myself cracking once the new year was turning. I had to get out so I left my home and started backpacking around the US. I wanted to trouble you with the proverbial ""yes I met a lot of people, it opened my eyes and showed me a new world"" associated with this vagabonding romanticism. I wanted to drink that cool-aid too but I just wasn't digesting it. I still felt the stress, even when my mind was off the job stuff. At this time I have this weird neck and back pain that started as a new form of anxiety that I have never experienced. This was about a year ago and I still experience it as I type. 

It was a good time and I can't deny that. Traveling was a luxury, no question. I felt some relief, and it was therapeutic to be just be on the move. My trip eventually took me across to Asia and then in Europe. I started to believe that perhaps my life was put on hold in a sense, so I could be doing this. I did meet a lot of people, with a lot of lifestyles. Some were interesting and wise, with colorful endeavors and passionate life dreams; while some were boorish and rude, and to this day I occupy some of my daily mind computing time with how they survive in this world. 

It was a good change, but in September I joined my Finance masters program in Europe. It was another 180 degree shift. All the free-spirit and unencumbered life and mindset was crushed by resume workshops and financial ratio Q+A sessions. I started applying for summer internships, while adjusting to classes, campus life in a new country, and a plethora of other things. There wasn't time to think about why I wanted to do all of this, I just needed to do it. 

As interviews and job offers started pouring in for others, I found myself empty handed. I felt fairly qualified but I see people younger and less experienced getting into jobs I supposedly wanted. A few weeks ago, I've come to realize that I've become damaged goods in this industry. I sold myself short, and now I carry a resume gap and a life story too long for an elevator pitch. I started feeling quite despairing, when some of my good friends in my current program, started teasing me. As I said before, I always thought I was strong and resilient, you know, first-generation immigrant background blahblah. But life keeps surprising you.

--------

At this point, this is not to say, entirely, that hey look at this guy he's just trying to prestige whore and he ran into a dead end in finance now he wants to find another high paying industry. I can't deny this definitely plays a part. But at least once I started considering switching industries, I started to see some of the unpalatable things about the industry that I focused my energy on for the past few years. The job, besides a high level quant job, seem quite repetitive, at least on the introductory level. And now my best chance at a job in finance is a middle-back office job, where I'm expected to grind it out for a few years and then perhaps hop to a better position or go to business school. 

Anyway, none of this. I can't seem to present myself in a positive light if I keep talking about this. But finally to get to the point. I have a few good friends that I stay in touch with, they majored/minored in CS, and I visited them quite a few times in CA and they seem to be enjoying their life and was very interested in what they were doing. Now I just feel a sense of dread when I think of finance. Sure the lack of job prospect plays a part, but just looking at the stuff and figures I keep wondering to myself man it's these shoddy arithmetic that moves mountains and cut down entire factory cities in this world. Once I thought it was exciting, but now I feel empty doing it.

I actually did quite a bit of Python during my math major, mostly for computation, along with MatLab. I really enjoyed coding -- kind of foolish but I like it when I watch my IDE changes the color of the text and when things run. I used a lot of VBA on my job, and when I had a lot of downtime I messed around with Django and built a half-working app that calculated taxes (this was before I knew what Git was). So this change to CS is really not that completely random. Meanwhile I was never fully committed in learning very deeply because I didn't see it as that major of an endeavor. 

I considered a CS career when I was in university, but as I was graduating I had the notion that the job market is fairly competitive and a CS major/major was indispensable. Yet recently a lot of the coding bootcamp articles started showing up on the front page and then I had some friends who were from non-CS but STEM background went into it and they were able to get the technical training and career prospect that they were looking for. So my mindset on whether it's possible to get into this field without a degree has definitely changed.

I travel a lot these days now I'm Europe. I only have courses a few times a week so I just buy a cheap bus ticket for 1-2 Eur and hop on and see things. I realized I really crave this lifestyle too, and CS seems to be fitting since the skill set gives the option to work remotely some time down the road. Meanwhile I started come to realize that most people that I knew in college, 80% of the once in finance, I feel that I never really knew them and they were just someone I simply said hi to. Meanwhile most of my closer friends are doing something technology related. Funny thing.

I'm still looking for jobs in finance because that's all I know for now. But I applied to two or three coding bootcamps and have some preliminary interviews. It's a big decision, and will cost a lot of money that I need to go into debt for. But at least at this point, my heart is pointing towards a career change. 

This always happens with me posting on reddit. I go off-topic and pour out my whole life. I don't speak English that much these days and my communication is kept to a 3rd grade level in this foreign language environment. Apologies but thanks for reading :)

------------------

EDIT with some specific question:

* How will employers in CS view my post-college experience? I don't want to tell a sob story, but it seems like I've committed to finance and even got another degree in it. How to present myself without making it seem like I'm quitting half way? I genuinely feel it's going to be a better culture fit but would that be good enough of an answer?

* Similar vein: will the financial knowledge be something I can leverage, say in a FinTech related start-up? I don't have golden experiences but my theoretical basis are fairly solid. I'm still interested in dev work for at least the time being but I'd like to keep the option of building my own firm in the future open.

* Bootcamps: after my research the only ones I see worthwhile doing at App Academy and Hack Reactor, maybe 2 other ones I can't recall right now. The quality varies very much but these two seem to have good market validation. Any thoughts?

* If I go to a camp I will mostly be doing the July - October cycle, most likely SF. Will the hiring cycle dry up by that time? Also the markets are kind of fickle these days and it's hitting VC funding, from the finance side. How do you feel like this might impact job market? Any color from the valley?"

I am currently in the first half of my 3rd year and by my school's calendar, I will return to school in the Fall of 2017.

The reason for me to take a year off is that I am too stressed from school and a bunch of other issues including health and mental. I am hoping that to take a year off, it will get me back on track with the energy and the motivation to finish my degree.

Currently right now, I am no where near the dangers of failing but I am seeing myself slipping in school. My marks from last term to this term is taking a drastic drop and I know I am feeling more apathetic towards my classwork and courses.

With regards to internships, I have already landed an internship at a big company in the bay area for this term. I am hoping that if I take a year off from school and apply for internships again (My school have a co-op program), companies will be able to balance out with my year away from schooling and working with the prestige of a big bay area company to ensure that I am not penalized as compared to my peers. I am also planning to apply for an internship for the summer of 2017 before I return to school to ensure a minimal gap between working.

The reason why I am asking these questions is that from this subreddit, I am seeing that having a gap on your resume is a major red flag to employers. If I am taking a year off, there will potentially be a year gap in my resume, I am hoping that internships will balance it out. I am unsure if my decision will penalize me and possibly regress my career."
498he1,166,2016-03-06,Got my first job offer - in microprocessor design!,blingdoop,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/498he1/got_my_first_job_offer_in_microprocessor_design/,"Hey guys, I never post anything but this may be my greatest achievement to date and I thought some people would be interested in how I got to where I am. I recently accepted an offer at a highly valued semiconductor company to work on the physical (back-end) design of their next-gen processors. This step is right between the manufacturing stage and circuit design, so I would be using CAD to place and optimize the circuits on the silicon. I've always loved doing CAD, and I've been very interested in computer architecture, so this was too good to pass on. 

I first heard about the job from a neighbor when I was home for winter break. She worked at said company doing physical design and told me they were looking for recent college grads. At first I was hesitant to apply, since I figured they would find someone with a higher GPA (I had a 3.1...and this company rarely hires engineers with only a BS). Thanks to mother who told me I had nothing to lose, I applied anyway and lo and behold, I got a call from the team's technical manager the next week asking for a phone interview. I want to note here that references are really good to pass the initial resume screen, but they are not part of the process afterwards at all. That said, I was definitely lucky that I had the connect to get me through that initial screen...most people don't get that opportunity. 

The phone screen was long but the interviewer (same technical manager I spoke to earlier) was easy to talk to and relatively laid back. He described the job position, asked behavioral questions about my resume, and then some basic-intermediate technical questions. I had studied quite a bit for the interview (lots of research on the company, looking up common interview questions relevant to the job, practicing elevator speech) so I was prepared for a lot of them. Some Qs I remember: why did you pick EE, what was your favorite class, what did you do in your pas internship, give an example of working with a difficult coworker or partner, hardest project you worked on and why, describe CMOS, difference between latch/flipflop, how to reduce timing delay, describe MOSFET I-V curve, etc. The one that took me off guard: why is your GPA not a 4.0? To which I told him that I mostly get Bs and As; I got a C in an intro to circuits class and a statistics class, which really impacted my transcript. I also added that I like to balance school and life, so sometimes my grades take a slight hit, but I am usually on top of things. The phone interview lasted about 75 mins but it was a positive experience. I got a call back about a week later asking to schedule an on-site interview!

On site interview was panel style. 5 people v. me in a conference room with a whiteboard behind me...pretty daunting. The lead team manager and the technical managers were there, along with 3 younger engineers. Having the younger guys there definitely eased my nerves. It was structured much like the phone interview: explaining the job (they showed me a huge detailed blueprint of one of their processors...couldn't stop looking at it, it was so cool), what they were looking for, asking me about my experience, and then a barrage of technical questions. They really enforced that they were looking for problem-solvers so the technical questions were more like puzzles, and there were about 7 or 8 in total. I solved all of the puzzles on the whiteboard, but I needed some help on a couple, which they were happy to give. They mostly wanted to see my approach, so I talked through everything I was doing. There were a couple of riddles, one simple scripting question, a geometry puzzle, deriving logic functions from circuit diagrams, and a couple others I can't remember. It was exhausting but by this point my nerves were at ease since I was in my zone, and there was a (much needed) water break in the middle. At the end they asked me when I would be willing to start (usually a good sign) and whether I needed relocation assistance (I didn't, which was probably a good plus for them too). I left feeling pretty satisfied but tried not to be too hopeful. 

I got a call the next Monday and was shocked that they would continue looking for other candidates. Their reason was that it was still early to decide, and they wanted people who could start around March, which is before my graduation. I was disappointed but I understood; they also told me they'd call in March if they don't find anyone (which I thought was BS since they wouldn't have much trouble finding new hires). 

Fast forward to February, I email the technical manager to follow up and let them know I am still interested. I mention that I am taking relevant classes for the job and that I had other interviews scheduled and a potential offer. He responds and said they still hadn't made a decision and there were no guarantees yet. At this point I felt I had done my best; even if I didn't get the job at least it was a cool learning experience. 

But the email might have actually worked! A few days later he emails me back saying that they had a slight change in their hiring process, and would be willing to take on new hires in the summer. I call him to discuss the next steps, and he states that he would be willing to offer me the position! I got the official offer from a recruiter a few weeks later and just recently accepted it! 

Hope this helps some of you still on the hunt. Pretty surreal feeling to have a dream job lined up months before graduation...never thought I'd be writing about this. So to all my fellow engineers, just keep working at it! GPA definitely isn't everything! If you guys have any questions or want advice or anything just hit me up! 

TLDR; neighbor referred me to job, longass phone interview, 4 hour 5 v 1 panel interview, didn't get an offer since they wanted people earlier, emailed back a month later saying I was still interested, they changed their hiring process and offered me a job post-graduation!"

I recently accepted an offer for the summer in Seattle. I had a few questions I was hoping some of the past Amazon interns could shine some light on:

1) What are your thoughts on corporate housing vs stipend? 
Here's my thoughts... I have a few friends at UW, so if I took the stipend, I would probably stay around there. The commute wouldn't be too bad (4 miles, 20-30 mins tops). Also, I hear that the corporate housing placement varies drastically, and it's kind of a hit or miss. I'm not too worried about mingling with other interns, if that's a main selling point for corporate housing.

2) What kind of laptop do they provide for employees to work on? Never used a mac before and just wanted to make sure I don't get blindsided.

3)What are things you enjoyed best about Seattle?"

49ane3,16,2016-03-06,I have a question on transfer functions (poles and zeroes stuff).,whatamidoing11,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/49ane3/i_have_a_question_on_transfer_functions_poles_and/,"I'm at my internship and a senior engineer mentioned to me that we would have to modify a specific shaper circuit we were working with.  It's current transfer function is 

TF=G  (s tau)/(1+s tau)^3

So one zero and 3 poles.  As a response to a unipolar pulse, it gives a bipolar output.  It outputs the derivative of the pulse essentially.  We want to change the transfer function to:

TF=G  1/(1+s tau)^2

No zeroes and two poles, which would output a unipolar pulse as a response to the unipolar pulse input.

Basically we're going from the top image here to the bottom one:

However, I've got to say, I don't intuitively understand *why* a ""differentiation is removed"" when you remove a zero and a pole.  I've gone back to my old textbook and notes this weekend, and can't find much on it.  I see how to determine a zeroes effect as a function of it's distance from the poles, but that's about it.  Any resources I find online for control systems are more introductory and never seem to get to this level.  By the way, the book I have is Control Systems Engineering by Norman Nise.

Basically, why does adding a zero and coincident pole ""differentiate"" the input signal?  I can see in Matlab simulations that adding a zero to a first order transfer function, like:

TF = s/(s+1)

Kind of does the same differentiation.  I just can't understand it intuitively."

I have loans through my CC now but all the schools I want to transfer to will require outside loans, to which I highly doubt I can get (I have meh credit and my parents have bad credit)

I also just don't care about my class subjects. I like my accounting classes but stuff like my literature class, programming, and math I just can't seem to put in enough care to do it. I know you aren't supposed to enjoy college classes but I have maybe showed actual intensest in 1 class out of the 16 classes I have taken. 

Here are my career goals and achievements so far: 

* I was an IT intern last summer at a big marketing company. I LOVED it. I love working with people, I love working in the city, I love talking to the other guys about how we can use technology in better ways, and I love working with computers hands on. I actually got accepted back full time this summer. One thing that struck me is that out of us 4 IT guys only 1 had an IT degree, the other had a psychology degree and one didn't even have a degree. My boss had some degree and certs but I don't recall it being IT related. 

* I work in a clothing store part time. I have done retail before and didn't like ti but this time I really enjoy it. I love helping people find their taste in clothing, I like trying to meet my sales goals and help my team out, and again I really enjoy dealing with people almost 100% of the time. My store has great co workers, solid managers, and room to grow and improve if I so wish (at least that's what I was told I don't know the details of that) 

* I have a blog about fashion and cars that I really enjoy writing for. If that was my full time job I would be very happy. 


* My goal is to get to IT consulting or IT management. I want to just work with people and computers and travel to do so if possible. However I really like the idea of somehow getting into the fashion industry but I'm not a designer, nor do I wish to be.

(x-post from /r/ProjectManagement),tafcasablanca,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/49b2vs/student_considering_a_career_leading_to_project/,"Good evening.

I am a senior MIS major attending a decent state school in the American midwest.  I have had multiple internships in software development and IT, and I am currently working as a part-time developer/intern.  This summer I am set to intern at a Big 4 accounting firm doing internal software development for Tax.  I hope to work at the firm after I graduate in December, and work for 2-5 years before moving into a different role; I do not intend to stay in development for the duration of my career as I hope to move into management of software projects.

I am currently in a Project Management class, and I am enjoying it quite a bit.  It seems like rewarding, secure, and varied work.  My professor is a big supporter of the Project Management Institute.  He encourages students to sit for the CAPM certification if they are interested in the field.  I am considering taking the exam in the summer to prime myself for the future and confirm that this is indeed the career path I hope to take.

Can anybody speak to the value of an entry level employee who holds a CAPM?  Is my plan viable?  How might I proceed after obtaining the certification?

Thank you very much."

&gt;Dear Recruiter (Or name if it's available),

&gt;While surfing the internet for internships, I came across this job posting and it appealed to me for many reasons. For one, I want to take my first steps into the field of computer science at a reputable and friendly company and I believe there is no better place than at [Insert Name Here]. [Insert Name Here] is always interested in working with and creating the most cutting edge technology where as I also like to work with the best to create the best. Therefor I think that because my views and your company’s views are the same, this could be an amazing opportunity for me.

&gt;I also feel like the skills and qualities you are looking for are all things that I have. Throughout my years of studying, exploring and working on projects with others, I have learned many things such as teamwork and leadership skills and more importantly, the ability to properly program and make proficient software. I know how to properly fit and work in a high level environment as I have previously done a co-op term at IBM. I also know how to take constructive criticism and to respect and listen to my superiors. I was a high school student who was put in a place with experienced employees and with the guidance and advice of the employees, I was able to easily jump on the right track and become seen as an equal. I truly believe that my values for meeting deadlines, respect to others and ability to easily work with others could come in very handy in this position. For all these reasons, I feel like I would be a great fit at this placement and I think we can make each other very happy by helping each other out.

SAT 2: 800 on Math, Physics, Chemistry
Class Rank: N/A
GPA: 4.55 weighted. Valedictorian has 4.62

Extracurriculars: Taking Multivariable Calculus at a local university. APUSH/AP Lang. AP French. 

Took AP Physics and Chemistry last year. 5s on both, and self studied for my 5 on AP Biology. 5 on BC Calculus and AP Computer Science also.

Schools: Asking about reach schools, MIT/Caltech/CMU/Berkeley/Stanford

Extracurriculars: Main things are Olympiads. I qualified for the USAJMO my freshman and sophomore years. With my AMC and AIME scores, I am likely to qualify for the USAMO this year. 

Plat division in USACO, qualified for Physics Olympiad semifinals last year.

President of the school's math club.

Volunteer with mentally disabled children 20 Hrs/month

Worked as an intern for a small tech startup over the summer and managed to implement a motion detection interface.

Attended fairly selective math program.

Questions: So, my issue is fairly obvious. I know my Academics are not going to be what holds me back from admission to university. I believe I'm a good writer, and I am well liked by the teachers writing my recommendations. HOWEVER, I am not well rounded at all. You've probably noticed the lack of sports or music in my extracurriculars. I know this is important to colleges, and I'm struggling because it seems a little bit late to try to build activities around those, and it also seems fairly fake to do so.

So my question is this: Are my Academics enough to compensate for my lack of well-roundedness?"

What could I have done better?,b6M6VPzc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49byux/relocation_for_an_offer_what_could_i_have_done/,"I'm getting hired anyway and only signing the contract is left, but I'd like your opinion on what could I have done better because I kind of feel like a dick. It's the first time I do this and also the first time I get hired except for internships.

The company told me to hurry up as much as possible and I wanted to but personal family issues have delayed it for various reasons, which I realize is no excuse (Mainly because it's something very personal I can't tell them about).

It's a job in a city 250 miles away. I was told earlier last week that they wanted me on board etc and that although there was no hard limit on the starting date they wanted me to relocate and settle asap and tell them when I'm ready. The truth is, I actually could've been threre already.

They sent me an offer letter friday 26 saying that I had to start in 2 weeks at most, but the guy over the phone said that didn't matter, that I had to hurry up but I wasn't commited to any hard limit. I said please change the offer letter so I'm not commited by written then. 

I've been calling and telling them about my progression and all, trying to give a good impression, but 1 week later (so last friday) I hadn't done any progress in finding a flat except for paperwork and looking for flats online, and I think they didn't like that.

Today I called again first thing and told the guy, in an attempt to fix things (he didn't seem mad though, I mean he was nice), that I was eager to start asap and that I was going to go there with the high speed train tomorrow morning to sign the contract and start seeing the flats in person since I had talked with the owners already, so I can start this week or the next. It must be noted that before I could start saying this he said ""hey, i was gonna tell you, its time to speed up your relocation"". It's a tech startup so they probably do need me. After I explained he said great and also mentioned the possibility of using Airbnb for a little if I needed it to settle earlier.

How should I take this? How much did I fuck up, and whats the best I can do now?"

Here's my situation, I am not getting an internship at all. I've applied to countless software dev internship positions but I am not hearing back at all. Its already mid of march and I was hoping to have some offer. And I do understand I don't have the best work experience for software dev internship positions.

On my resume, I have briefly pinpointed the important points of projects that I was involved. This is to give a reader better understanding of what that overall project was about. I did not disclose what was my roles were as I though that could be explained verbally. 

1. Starting with the GPA, I combined my 2 university GPAs (one is lower than the other). I don't know if this would be considered as a lie because one of my professors mentioned that some students do this. 

2. My skillset, I have proficiency in C, most of the other languages were self taught and have some familiarity. Also, I mentioned Javascript as one of the language tools (for work experience) but I don't have proficiency in this language. I am not sure if this is a good approach.

3. My university projects, I was not involved in some of the role as they were done by other teammates but I mentioned to help explain what the overall projects was about. Probably the 2 that I worry about is the Raspberry pi kernal and integration of application via Rest API, these were not done by me but another team member. However, they were a critical part of our project. 

4. For work experience, I fear I may have exaggerated about some of my internship experience; especially with ad hoc analysis. But I did do some SQL and SAS scripting work and analyzed large datasets (for BI Reporting). The iOS dev is in the same boat, some parts were exaggerated to make it seem more attractive. 

I will confess that I've exaggerated some parts of my resume in order to gain attention. I have not submitted the new resume as of yet but I don't know how good of an approach this would be.

I am not getting a summer internship at all. And I am not sure if this is considered as lying, what do you recommend that I should do? "

49durj,38,2016-03-07,TIFU by going to a friend's concert,angeloaspera,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/49durj/tifu_by_going_to_a_friends_concert/,"Let me tell you the story of how I learned the true meaning of shame the hard way on this one night. 

Obligatory, this happened last November.

A bit of context on that friend, I had some long-term feelings for her when we were in high school. Let's call her ""choir buddy"" (yes, I met her through joining my school's choir) and yes, there were still definitely some feelings during that night, even though I thought to myself that I Had moved on from her. 

There are three components to my shame that we have to be mindful of during this entire incident. 

1) I sat near the stage because aside from having the eyesight of a starfish with nearsightedness, I wanted to get decent quality photos of my friend since she was the type of girl who would look average on a normal day, but would transform into an absolute goddess the moment she dressed up and put on a bit of make up during her performances. And boy, oh boy, seeing her onstage and hearing her sing in full diva mode could resurrect any feelings that were otherwise thought to have been finished. 

Putting her on a pedestal aside, it didn't help that I'm not discrete in taking photos with my phone; added to the fact that my phone's screen is huge AF, the people behind me could definitely see the subjects of my photos if they wanted to but being the mindless idiot that I am, I didn't stop to care if the people behind me were judging or not. 

2) I noticed that whenever the songs had some solo parts by the other performers, they would have friends scream as a show of support for them, sort of like a fans club on steroids. And yet, alas, choir buddy's friends were nowhere to be found. So I took it upon myself to be her ""fans club"" for that night because why not? It was only for one night and besides, no one's gonna remember me anyway so for the remainder of the show, I shouted her name and screamed and cheered like a mad man during her solo parts without any regard for my dignity as a person, just so that I could show my support for her (and low key because I'm a total and hopeless romantic loser who would do anything if I thought that it was gonna get me anywhere closer to her) 

3) There was one song number where they actually wanted the audience to participate so they gave us a tune to hum and being the shy and publicly reserved people that most of the people my age are, most of us were quiet. 

Suddenly, from out of nowhere, the guy directly behind me gave it his all. He was supposed to hum but it was like he nearly screamed his lungs out, like a prepubescent Micheal Jackson without the charisma, or the singing prowess. The entire audience burst out laughing, which of course included me and being the dumbass that I am, I laughed like a monkey going through a stroke and an asthma attack at the same time. 

Fast forward to the end of the show, the performers were finally able to meet and greet their friends and family who watched the show and take pictures with them and what not. I went to the toilet quickly and as I was going back to my seat, I noticed that choir buddy was standing near where I was sitting, so I sat down some rows out back and observed them for a bit. I noticed a couple of things in observing her mainly that she was talking to the people directly behind the row that I was sitting in, so I assumed them to be her friends and that they were composed of some older people. 

And just like that, after a few minutes, it occurred to me...

HER FAMILY WAS SITTING BEHIND ME THE WHOLE TIME AND THE GUY I MANIACALLY LAUGHED AT WAS HER DAD *can you say FML?*

Thinking immediately of all the humiliating things that I just did in front of them, including her grandma, I sunk into my chair faster than the Titanic post-iceberg. 

And that, reddit, is how I learned what shame means, the hard way. Moral of the story: Be mindful of your actions. Be respectable at all times. 

TL;DR: Went to a crush's concert, did some crazy and borderline humiliating acts of extreme fanboying/paparazzi-ing only to discover that her family was sitting behind me the entire time. 

Edit/Update: I didn't really want to leave immediately after seeing her show. I actually wanted to compliment her and take a few pictures together but that dream had come to an abrupt halt after I stood up and took a step after I sat down again at the end. My right shoe's sole had completely separated itself from the rest of my shoe, because I forgot that the pair I was wearing that night was the same pair that I used during my internship that got worn out from my daily walk + commute, which led to me bailing out of trying to save face. Also, I appreciate the comments and I apologize for my lack of balls. "

I am a Junior comp sci student. No previous internships but a decent gpa and school. I got to the final round of Amazon and got rejected - wasn't the best interview.

Recently, I got to the final round of Capital one and thought I did amazing. I flew through the tech part and the case interviewer said ""just to let ya know you passed the case"". But guess what, I got rejected. 

these are both for SWE intern posts. 


Now for the summer I'll be working at a fortune 500 financial company full of legacy code. I'll be doing sys admin stuff mainly. It's a big drop from the SWE posts I was hoping to get. 

What is happening. Am I just not cut for the top jobs? You know maybe I expectations were too high. I always expected to get an internship and then a full time offer north of 85k fresh out of school because my friends did and because of the final round interviews I've been getting into. 

I guess maybe this place can tell me to lower my expectations. I am just lost. I don't know what to do and how to feel about this.

(Part 2),BiouxBioux,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/49e9ti/the_coop_experience_that_i_wont_be_submitting_in/,"[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4736vv/the_coop_experience_that_i_wont_be_submitting_in/)

I haven't had the time to write this out at all, but that's because I've been doing some digging. A better phrase would be: I've been *forced* into doing some digging. I confess, I've made habit of tucking salt packets into my pockets. The notion seems silly, but after hearing enough jovial greetings of, ""Still bothered by the sheet ghost? Better bring some salt!"" I gave in. And I think the entity gave in, too.

It didn’t change; it still looks like someone wearing a white sheet. I've nicknamed it 'Kumot,' which means 'blanket' in my language (Tagalog; pronounced ""koo-mot""). Personally, I know the cuteness of the name doesn't fit the creepiness of the figure, but it helps me, and I desperately need it. Because Kumot has been showing itself more frequently, especially since I tried bringing salt. I think it fucking *likes* the salt. It's closer than before, debunking my theory of it being trapped in the chem lab, unable to cross the threshold. It likes to stand under the overhead lamp of the entryway, casting ugly, yellow shadows over what I assume to be its face. What’s even worse is that its mouth is open and gaping. Difficult to notice at first, the sheet is taut over its open lips and slightly darkened with shadow where its mouth should be, and it seems to be breathing, the fabric billowing in and out of its hidden jaws. The *worst* part is, I can’t leave until it retreats back into the chem room. Fortunately, it seems to get bored of watching me after a while, and I can sprint through the door, fearing any slight brush of fabric…

A few days ago, as I was pointedly keeping my eyes focused ahead, not looking to my right, where Kumot was mouth-breathing. Eyes in front. X-ray. Capture. Label. Print. Don’t look to the right. My lower back was aching from subconsciously attempting to stay as still as a statue under Kumot’s gaze. Can I call it a ‘gaze’ even if I can’t see its eyes? I can feel them, though. Breaking, I shifted my sitting position to try and find a posture that I could hold without feeling uncomfortable. Salt packets spilled out of my pocket and onto the floor, their paper packages slapping against the tiles. Out of the corner of my eye, Kumot’s mouth closed, except that it took the sheet into its mouth and pressed its lips into a wrinkly, almost *mocking* smile.

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped bringing salt.

&amp;nbsp;

A bit shaken, I built up the gall to interrogate my supervisor as nonchalantly as possible as to whether or not someone had died in the lab. She laughed and retorted, with a twinge in her (Southern) accent that let me know she didn’t care, “Why? Somethin’ botherin’ ya?” When I retold the happenings, she laughed, albeit strained, for a good three minutes before brushing me off to answer the phone. This irked me, but I haven’t questioned it further.

I went to Devin, the security guard next. Usually very friendly, with bright blue eyes and white hair, he’s been employed at my company for about 40 years and a grandpa-guardian to a lot of the workers here. I convinced myself to ask him about deaths in the building. When I breeched the subject, he replied just as my supervisor did, but with less venom. I confessed about the unplugged speakers, how I could see Kumot (didn’t explain the naming part), and the salt packet incident. I regretted it immediately, the second time the words coming out of my mouth sounding as stupid as ever, and I worried that he’d report me for being mental, but instead his face turned solemn.

“BiouxBioux, this is an old facility that manufactures [I shouldn’t write it], and it uses extreme conditions to test the products’ durability. Of course there have been deaths. Multiple ones throughout the years I’ve worked here.” In my lab, I asked? “No, never by the x-ray, not technically.”  Technically!? He had to stop and greet other exiting employees the obligatory ‘good night and stay safe,’ but afterwards he turned back to me with a face that revealed his true age, not the jolly visage that receives those who pass through his security clearance.

Continuing, Devin told me that a man had died during a night shift in the MEL lab, which is across the hall from my lab. He had an accident with one of the machines that simulated extreme weather conditions, this much was clear; his head had somehow been doused in IPA, which we use to clean PWB’s, and set aflame in a temperature controlled environment. I found this hard to believe, but the news still made me sick to my stomach. However, what he said next really topped it off.

“His body was found in the chem section of your lab, covered with a sheet, like somebody was trying to hide him,” he brought his voice down to a whisper so that he could continue speaking while my coworkers went through his doors for the day. “But no one could’ve gotten in, not a chem worker, nobody. The records for the room’s entry were searched, and no one even used your lab during that time of night, and the cameras caught nothing. It was into that hot box and then your lab’s chem room.”

I almost shit myself then and there. Even when Devin reverted back into his good-guy-guard persona, I felt bile rising in my throat. “Don’t stress over it,” he cooed, stretching his arms over his head, “If you don’t upset it, it won’t upset you.”

Since then, I’ve been restless. I want so very badly for someone to just tell me that I’m hallucinating, that this was an effect of the x-ray, or that someone’s messing with me, but that relief never came. Instead, curiosity gushed forth like a flood. I spoke to more employees that have been here for years. I spoke to past interns. I learned that the building used to be two floors instead of one, but that an assembly lab on the first floor had burst into flames. Today, the first floor is used as an underground garage. Past interns have also warned me not to play classical music. They smirked as if they were telling a grand spooky story to some gullible kid. “Yeah, the old guy who used to work there wasn’t a fan of classical. He’s more of a rock kind of guy. Didn’t the intern before you warn you about it?” It seemed like Kumot never bothered any of them.

It was the intern before me that helped me piece it all together. Let’s call her Marge. We’d met before, on the day of my interview, and she shook my hand and smiled with a face that seemed pained. I didn’t think anything of it. Distressed, I shot her a couple emails during my lunch break the other day. Being that she was taking her third semester, I didn’t expect her to answer quickly, or at all, rather. But lo and behold, her reply was almost instantaneous. Yes, she has felt weird vibes in the lab before. Yes, she was warned about classical music and forgot to tell me. No, she didn’t know that so many people enjoyed classical music these days.

Yes, she knows about the fire, and did I know that the bathroom that started it was under the chem room?

And yes, she has seen Kumot, but she hadn’t thought of salt.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not fucking insane. Marge saw Kumot, too. Maybe that’s why she looked so relieved and yet so concerned when she met me as her new replacement intern. 

Just to seal the deal, I called a janitor into my lab while I was working and asked her to empty the trash bin. As I waited for the lab’s doorbell to ring, Kumot lingered in my peripheral vision, standing in the middle of the chem lab, mouth agape. I had flipped the light switch, illuminating the old chem room in a harsh, sterile light. I thought I could see the sheet sinking into its eyeholes, the shadows of its brow shrouding its face in a livid gloom.

The cleaning lady bustled in with a smile on her face and picked up the trash can when I pointed to it. Before she could even tie up the plastic bag, I asked her if she could see anyone behind me, cocking my head in the direction I wanted her to look. Stooped over in a position that was mid-crouch, she craned her neck to peer over my shoulder. Her eyes widened and her grip on the trash can stretched her blue rubber gloves over her knuckles, squeezing out a rubbery squeak. Lips parted, she found no words and nodded instead, gesticulating Kumot’s sheet with a downwards motion of her hands over her face. She immediately asked me to open the door and let her out, and I followed. Before shutting and locking the door, I saw Kumot smile once more, the lights of the chem room flickering back to pitch black."

So I'm in a bad situation. I currently attend an ivy league school majoring in computer science and have sever struggles with my mental health. I've had several internships in the past with some major tech companies (like Google, Facebook, Amazon). About a year ago I took some time off of school to take care of my mental health. I got myself back to a position where I felt I could finish my schooling (I held an internship and was able to function normally).

I returned back to school again this semester and the environment and stress of school has left me just as bad as before I left. I'm going to be failing my courses this semester if I continue like this. I am in my last year of school.

I'm seriously considering transferring to a state school near my home. Academically it would be a significant down-grade in schools. But, I would be near home and in a much less stressful environment where I believe I would be able to finish my school without the struggles I'm currently having.

How much would this hurt my CS career? It feels like I would have wasted so much time and money attending an ivy league school only to end up getting the degree from a smaller state school. I do still have several internships under my belt, but I'd no longer have the school on my resume.

Also, how would I explain this to potential employers?"

Right now I work retail at a job I love, and seems to have room to grow in. I'm also a full time IT intern in the summer. Last year they asked me to stay the whole year to fill in for the IT manager who was taking a year long trip but I said no because of school. I really regret that.

My question is should I maybe put off college for a little while and gather funds to afford college and maybe get my feet planted more in the IT field? I thought about joining the military to pay for school but I feel like that will set me back career wise and I think I would be disqualified for a back injury I got last year anyway. Can someone do college part time? Like working every day and taking one or two classes online, on the weekend, or at night? This summer I'm considering working the internship 40 hours a week mon-thurs and then retail on the weekend but maybe even the friday too, just not sure how I feel about working every day. Even this wont be anywhere near enough to pay for school but at least I could get a decent savings started (currently don't have a savings) 

Im not really sure what to do right now 

EDIT: I should clarify I'm not talking about quitting flat out, I'm talking about just going from full time student to part time and just taking a few more years to graduate. "

I interned there in summer 2015 and a minor problem has not been resolved yet.

We use some MS Excel ISA data sheets to help organize the process from quote to production. The sheets have been copied and pasted countless times and this has created some rough edges in the sheet formats, drop-down menus, check boxes, etc. We are looking at other possible solutions besides just using Excel. During my internship with this company, we obtained some trial software for [Megaflex Instrument Forms Plus PRO](http://www.megaflex.com/) but my boss didn't seem too impressed with the quality of the program. I am thinking we may give it another go because the desire to organize the ISA data sheet process has not been resolved and I am not finding a lot of solutions at the moment.

Does anyone out there use MS Access for this? Should I try to fix up these Excel spreadsheets? Is there another database management system program out there that is better and can streamline the process? Any input would be appreciated.

49jei0,6,2016-03-08,What is a fair salary/how do I ask for a raise working as a front end developer and system admin?,poochiny,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/49jei0/what_is_a_fair_salaryhow_do_i_ask_for_a_raise/,"Sorry about the throwaway first of all. I am currently a web developer/system admin at a small company of around 40-50 employees. Little background story about this job, my internship was ending and I needed something, I saw an ad on my university's job board for a ""part time network IT person"". I applied even though I have no experience dealing with networks other than in classes. I got an interview and on the interview, it was obvious that they didn't need a ""network person"", they needed someone to do PC support around the office and pay was $15.50/hr. I was pretty discouraged by this because I knew I wasn't going to learn anything, so on the interview they asked me about my web development and system admin experience and they were really impressed with my work so they went ahead and offered me a position.

I was very iffy because now I wouldn't be doing  only PC support but I would be doing PC support, web development and system admin all for the same price they originally advertised but at the same time, I had no job after my internship was done (where pay was $4/hr more). My now-boss offered me an extra .50 cents after 90 days if I demonstrated what my resume said. 

Fast forward now, the ""IT"" department is composed of 4 people and divided into two, IT infrastructure and web development. I am the only one out of the 4 that does both. Some of the tasks I do include developing static websites for clients using html, Css, js, sass (basically done with bootstrap) for their marketing purposes, email blasts, keep track of everyone's email accounts, try to come up with tech ways to save the company money and make sure the servers are running correctly.

I graduate in a couple of months which means no more financial aid and higher expenses. I've exceeding my peers expectations by completing my tasks fast and efficiently. Right now I'm roughly making around 35k a year. What would be a fair wage for the type of work and how would I go about asking for a raise? Thank you"
49jf5z,7,2016-03-08,Starting Out in Web Development?,LongHairedHeathen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49jf5z/starting_out_in_web_development/,"So I'm currently a sophomore in a great C.S. program working towards a B.S. in computer science with an emphasis in computer science. I think web sites and web development is cool, but I really enjoy making programs and more systems level stuff. I think backend/database stuff would be pretty cool too.

So here's my situation. My wife works full time and is going back to school for CS as well. We live in a decently new, probably too expensive, townhouse. We have no kids. We are both paying tuition. Financially, we have some money in savings and no debt, but because of tuition and rent, our bank account is steadily, albeit slowly, decreasing.

I really want to get a job that will give me experience in the field and pay decently so that we can have a positive net income.

The problem is that most of the jobs around here are for web developer interns, rather than software/QA engineer interns. I really don't want to be typecasted as a web developer. If I get a job offer in web, should I take it? Will I be stuck on that path? Should I hold out for software engineer/QA engineer intern since that's closer to what I want to do after I graduate?

Thanks!"

This led me to aim for a technologically inclined career. Currently, I am a freshman at a community college, aiming at a Computer Science degree. Although, after programming on the side and in some intro classes, I realized that is not what I love about computers as much. Taking an internship in IT made me realize that I prefer working hands on with computers, and the implementation of computers, etc. more than programming. I also have always been partial to business, so I believe that could help in directing me. I hate math, and that end of Computer Science is already giving me struggles. I don't believe Computer Science is the optimal path for me, but I am not sure what other options I have. I've heard a lot of good things about MIS. 

Basically, I need some help.

Thanks in advance."

I recently received an email from a recruiter. I'm not sure that it was a mass email (I've received plenty of those), but most of it is copy-pasted from their job description page. I have some of the experience they are asking for through school, but have had neither an internship nor a job in the industry yet. They want 2+ years of experience in a developer/engineer role. I have bachelors in C.S. and AMATH with a 3.5 GPA and analytic work experience from before returning to school to earn my degrees. Based on the ad, I am certain that I am capable of performing the duties described with an entry-level competency. I am a quicker than average learner and I have excelled and moved quickly through the ranks at almost every job I have had. I am so eager for a challenge. I have had contact through school with most of the technologies they use and am concerned that I just popped up through whatever filters they use since I list some of them on my resume. Am I just going to be wasting me time pursuing this?

1. How do I reply? She didn't include any instructions. Should I simply apply on their website or reply to the email?

2. Should I mention that I don't tick all of their ""required"" boxes? Is there a way to pair that with saying basically what I said above, that I am still confident that I can do the job? Sure there is a learning curve, but what position doesn't have that?

3. Or should I focus on the stuff that I have done and had experience with?

4. Or should I stop overthinking it and just shoot back a short note expressing interest? (I've been looking since June and am getting pretty depressed. I think I need to GTFO of my own head! :-/)"

49kf46,6,2016-03-08,"Absolutely overwhelmed and depressed. 4 Routes to Take, each one has downside. How do I pick?",Note2Self_NameNeeded,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/49kf46/absolutely_overwhelmed_and_depressed_4_routes_to/,"Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry for the wall of text. 

TL;DR: Overwhelmed, and not sure what route to take. 1) Continue retail, be depressed. 2) Continue computer programming, but eye problems. 3) Keep Masters job search, but no experience. 4) Start fresh with new degree, but limited time.  Are there any other options I'm not seeing? 

I was depressed throughout my Masters of Health Administration program, so I did not do internships, only 3 months of volunteer at hospital. Now it's too late to get internships because I graduated (legal issues with interns). The job search is extremely difficult and frankly very discouraging due to lack of experience. 


I'm running out of time. My elderly parents' health are deteriorating, so I want to make more money so I can give them the best care. My sister also works a very good paying job so she can take care of them, but what happens if she's not there in the future anymore? 


There's a few routes I'm considering, but I'm absolutely overwhelmed:

1. Continue working in a very stable retail job, with a stable, but slow pay increase, and almost guarantee to managerial position in 4-7 years with 65k salary. Downside: This job is steadily draining all that's left of my life energy. Depression will absolutely hit if I keep staying here. 


2. Continue learning computer programming since I've already invested 3 good months in it. There's a high chance of getting a decent paying job. I'm confident because I know I can be very good with practice. Downside: Programming is really fun now, but if it becomes a full time job, then it's no longer fun and only a job that pays the bills. Also, future promotions and pay rate can be limiting due to lack of computer science degree. Additionally, I'll be on the computer 9 hours a day for the rest of my life, and I have problems with my eyes. Doctor said accomodative insufficiency (weak focusing eye muscle). 


3. Keep applying for jobs related to my Masters Program, even though I lack experience and hope to get an interview. Apply for hospital volunteer programs and get experience. Downside: Will have to volunteer 1+ year, doing very simple work that only volunteers are allowed to do (some computer work, filing, sorting, organizing, answering phone calls, coffee runs, etc...). Downside: No idea if volunteering will lead to anything because luck will be heavily involved. 

4. Go back to school for computer science. This is a very long road, something I want to do because I can be good at it, and I love it, except it'll take 5 years. Pretty much guarantee a job because I'll do a better job networking and working on projects during school. I still need to get letters of rec, pick a school, take prerequisite classes before applying. Downside: Very long road with limited time, eye problems, and high student loans. "

But my issue is my teacher is not that helpful. We have projects and I have to just google frantically until I can put everything together. 

Are there any YouTube guys or any sites where I can really break down what I'm trying to do? I want to learn more but my book is pretty limited and times is contradictory to what my teacher says. 

Another question I have is how much experience do I need for an internship? I know a lot of people and two people said they would get me internships this summer. Which is awesome! But I am doing really simple Java programs so do I know enough to take the internship? I don't want to be in over my head and screw up the internship. 

Lastly, is there any site where I can post my code to get help? I posted on stack exchange and everyone downvoted me because my question was too easy. But I didn't know! And it's really hard when you get stuck if you can't find someone to help point you in the right direction.

I know that all of my interviews (phone screen, in-person meeting, shadowing, happy hour) have gone incredibly well but it's been three days since they said they were going to make the decision. 

The hiring manager said that she would call my references on Friday and get back to me on Monday. Then Monday came and she asked me for a reference from my old boss. I gave her the contact information and she said she would get back to me by Tuesday. Tuesday rolls around and I hear nothing. Today, I reached out to her at 5:30pm re-affirming my interest. She reached back out an hour later and asked if I had time for a phone call tomorrow. It sounds positive, right? But this is where the story gets complicated. 

There's a reason why I didn't want to give my old boss contact information. A little insight on her personality: She's publicly perceived as a really great person. A guru in her industry and a B-list celebrity in our town. Everybody adores her but she has a narcisstic and histrionic personality. It's hard to be around her for too long because she distracts me from doing my job and because she needs so much interpersonal attention about her life. I managed her company for two years. I completely created the infrastructure, on-boarding system and kept her company afloat and thriving. I helped increase the client count, raised money for our packages and became known as the ""rock"" that kept the company stable and secure. I was working well at that job but it came at the cost of incredible stress. She wasn't a good manager and was barely around. She constantly went on vacations. I had many nights working alone trying to make office rent for that month. She knew I was unhappy on some level, but I was too young and nervous to state anything (I'm 24 now, but I started working for her when I was 22) and she never dug deep. Regardless, we had a good working relationship because our personalities complimented each other. I am a team player but I learned how to work independently since she wasn't around. Why? Because I was her only employee before I started hiring interns and recruiters to have some company.

So at this point, things are chugging away. It's not great, but it's fine. Everything started to come to a head when I went on vacation. She said I wouldn't be getting paid for my time off (another example of why she wasn't a good boss) so I trained two of our interns to take over my responsibilities for that week. Things were bad that week.

The interns were constantly blowing up my phone and asking me questions about EVERYTHING since my boss didn't know how to answer them. I spent my entire vacation stressed out and then, I thought: I just need to quit. This isn't worth it anymore. I loved the job but I didn't love working with my boss. I was not happy anymore. I came back into town, trained the most competent intern to take over my place, and handed in my resignation. Things were in the positive since she threw me a going away party but during my resignation conversation with her, she told me that she did NOT want me to quit even though I held my ground. Since then, I've spent the last few months growing angrier and angrier about the situation. I am mad that I let her take advantage of me and I am even madder at myself for allowing that to happen. I have been spending the last few months working on my communication style to become a better employee. I went NC on her and haven't talked to her in the past few months, so it's safe to say she knows I was not happy. Coupled with the fact that the intern is her new right-hand man, who I spent many late nights with explaining why I needed to quit (stress, under-managed, over-worked.) So, it was a bit out of the ordinary for me to text her randomly asking for a reference that very day. Afterwards, she texted me that it went ""fine"" but I don't know what that means. I am not sure what my boss said. I don't think she even knows about all of the things I did at her company because she wasn't around. 

Which brings me back to this company. I want this job. It's exactly what I'm looking for but managed by a qualified team of people who clearly want to support me and give me the tools for success. They have been keeping me very clued in on the process, and I don't think they have many other candidates they are reviewing for the position so my odds seem good. One of the girls on the team recently became promoted as the manager for the division, opening up the space for the position I am applying for. 

My other references followed up with me and told me that their phone screen went well and the company loved me. But I don't know. I feel like I am stressing myself out for nothing but this is a big deal to me. I want this job very badly and I hate to think of my old company (which was mentally abusive and I am trying to get over the trauma of working with my boss) might've stopped me from getting this new job. When the new company asked me about my relationship with my boss, I said that I was still helping them from time to time and I had a great relationship with my boss. Because that's what people do in interviews and I couldn't outright explain the whole situation to them. 

My question is, do you think that I got the job? Do I have anything to be worried about? Or am I just freaking out for no reason?"

**TL;DR** (yet)- I liked the premise of this month's contest so much that this - my first contribution to this amazing thread - just sprang forth. The fundamental question that got me was, 

&gt; ***""How far does our humanity get removed if you change the elements of what makes us human?""***

In the spirit of all of the good HFY stories I've read in here, I decided to write a story about what I feel *really* matters when it comes to defining what makes H-so-mutha-fucking-F-Y...

The humanity inherent in all of us, and the people closest to us who help make us so. :-) 

Enjoy. 

**EDIT:** There are, in fact, pancakes mentioned once in this story. It's more of a buddy comedy than a NSFW thing... I tried not to make it weird. ;-)

*******

""Stop bullshitting me, man! You knocked him out with a *ration bar*?!""

He had this low rumble of a laugh... I swear to God it rattled the empty shot glasses. It was so, you know, *full*. He at least had the good grace to lower his head while he chuckled. 

""Well,"" he rumbled, ""To be fair, I was panicked. I did throw it kind of fast."" He honestly looked sheepish. Like he was embarrassed about it. 

""But I mean, that thing couldn't have weighed more than, what, 60, 70 grams? How fucking fast did you throw it?""

""I dunno. Pretty fast, I guess.""

""But Piglet, aren't those Space Rats kinda, you know, BIG? The Vids say those things are like, two-and-a-half meters tall..."" I thought for a second. ""Wait, how the fuck did he even sneak up on you guys?!"" 

I hopped off my barstool, and sort of pantomimed what I thought was a giant rat on tiptoes, sniffing around being sneaky. He was crying from the giggles watching me wrinkle up my nose and wriggle my imaginary whiskers. 

I sidled back up to the bar and got back to it. ""Seriously, though. How strong are you guys now?""

He shrugged. ""Hard to say. My staff Sergeant went home last year on leave, and visited his little brother during Spring Training. He said they clocked his throw at around 350kph."" 

""I CALL BULLSHIT, PIGLET!"" I barked. Everyone around me jumped, even the ones that couldn't stop staring at *him.* He just smiled. ""You'd damn near tear your own arm out of the socket just trying that!""

""It's true! Hand to God!"" he laughed. God, that laugh. I mean, it was still the same laugh, just... Meatier, ya know? Like Piglet was still in there, just wearing this giant fucking *meat suit.*

I'd missed that laugh. 

""So,"" I asked, after we'd stopped giggling, ""Tell me about it. What made you go through the process?""

*******

I met Samir Pritkin in 8th Grade. He'd moved to NewSanDee after his dad got a job at one of the biotech research firms in the area. My mom was working there in a different department, and we ended up at the same school together. My dad died when I was young, so his family would have us over all the time. 

The only thing remarkable about Pritkin - who our classmates took to calling ""Piglet"" because kids can be assholes - was how *average* he was. He wasn't tall back then - maybe 1.7m... Kinda thin, but not overly so. Nothing that hinted at what he looked like *now.* 

Sleepovers, girls, prom. Every formative moment of my young life he was a part of, in some way. 

When Becca Wilberg broke my heart sophmore year of college, Samir tubed out from Iowa State and dragged me to every dive bar around campus, every sorority party, and was a shamelessly incompetent wingman to every girl who walked by, trying to whore me out. 

Me, mostly athletic at 2+ meters and fit from Track and Field, looking like the saddest blond sack of shit on the West Coast. 

And Pritkin... God, he had ZERO sense of decency trying to 'hook me up.' 

At 1.7 meters, maybe 65 kilos soaking wet, and brown as a coffee with cream, he was like the weirdest, most depraved carnival barker ever. 

""LAAAY-DEEZ!!! Check this guy OUT! Don't you want a piece of THIS MEAT!?"" 

Fucking SHAMELESS. 

Becca showed up that Sunday morning looking to get back together, when she saw me in tangle on the living room floor. Three girls from Gamma-O (one an actual Randirian!) in various states of drunken undress around me, with a shirtless, skinny-assed Piglet in boxer shorts and a frilly apron making pancakes for us in the kitchenette. 

Probably the best thing that could've happened to me, in repose. 

Samir's the closest thing I've ever had to a brother. I'd kill a skiff-load of Space Rats for him... 

After he went in for the Augments, though... That didn't seem necessary. 

******* 

He didn't tense up, so much as the meat-suit kind of contracted slightly. ""My ex-girlfriend Shari was on Na-Praxis when it got taken,"" he rumbled. 

*Shit.* 

""Jesus, Piglet... Why didn't you tell me?"" We didn't used to keep things from each other, but a lot had changed since the colony had been destroyed several years ago. One day he and I were talking, the next day Na-Praxis happened. 

Three days later I get a vid from his mom telling me he'd volunteered for the Augment Corps. No word, no goodbye... Just gone. 

Then tonight at the 10 Year High School Reunion, in walks this big, brown, hulking **Thing.** He walked right up to me, all 2 point 7 meters of brown muscle trying to wedge it's way through the double doors, and gives me a surprisingly gentle hug.

... And except for a shit-ton of odd stares from a bunch of our former classmates and a burgeoning crick in my neck from looking up at his gigantic ass, it was *Samir.* I fucking cried, right there in the lobby of the restaurant, hugging my best friend returned from the Void. 

I snapped back out of it, and went to playfully slug him in the arm. Stupid. It was like casually throwing a punch at a cinder block. ""OW! Jeebus fuck! What, are you bulletproof, too?""

He smirked. ""Only small arms fire. Stings like a sunuvabitch when they hit. I mostly go out on patrols with the Powered Armors now, what with the Space Rats dicking around. Talus is... I guess you'd say it's a rough deployment. Better than some places I've been, I suppose.""  

We'd talk about Shari when he was ready, so the change of subject was silent but acknowledged. 

""I'll bet. I've thought about a transfer to go work on some of the new colonies. The architecture firm I work for now is great about the opportunities, but honestly, I'd miss home. OH! And surfing! How long are you in town for? We should go surf off Oceanside Pier!""

""Ahhh, I wish I could Rhett,"" he sighed. ""Side effect of these Augments is that I sink like a fucking rock. The carbon-fibre bone is light and all, but the tissue replacements weren't exactly aerogel, you know what I mean?"" 

""No shit, Piglet."" I flopped my hand like it was broken at the wrist. He smirked again. ""What I don't get is how you can move so damn fast if they replaced everything with fucking granite. I build buildings. I don't keep up with the Biotech. How's it work?""

""It's complicated, even for me,"" he replied. ""For one, I've uh, got more than one brain now.""

""Well, you could've used all the help you could get, ya lunkhead."" 

""Fuck you, Rhett! I did just fine in school, thank you very much."" He took the good-natured joke in stride. That was good. Samir was still in there, even if he did look like a swollen fun house version of himself.

""What's the second brain actually for, then, if not to improve some very middling math scores?""

""Well to improve reaction times for one. And it's not a full brain so much as it is a 'neural shortcut.' It's tough to understand without having it done, but I can sort-of 'see' and 'hear' out of my hands.""

""That has to make handshakes awkward as fuck,"" I quipped. He laughed, his head thrown back, the muscles of his neck like bundles of whipcords.

""Fuck I missed you Rhett. It's good to know you kept your sense of humor, *Akhi.*""

""I missed you too, Brother. I'm just glad you're okay! You want another drink? Or, I dunno, a gallon?"" He pursed his lips together, and kind of waved it off. ""Lemme guess, side effect?""

""Yeah,"" he looked down into a beer glass that looked like it was made from a kid's toy set in his hands. ""It's this liver. I could drink 3 liters of Fire Water and still not get more than tingle for a few minutes. There's some nasty shit floating through the air on some of these worlds. 

""Nanite-laced Lungs, 2 extra kidneys... Extra kidneys, for chrissake! Hell, I can pump enough blood for two clydesdales to run at a full clip with this heart..."" He gingerly set the beer glass down. 

""Even my fascia is augmented. It has to be. Like that ration bar knockout? You're right. If it wasn't all tied in with nano-tubes and the neural netting, my muscles would blow their way right outta my skin if I moved fast enough. It's not something you think about until you come out of the tanks they keep you in.""

""Wait, wait, wait, go back Piglet,"" I asked. ""Neural netting? So you're kind of like running by some sort-of 'fly-by-wire?'"" 

""My dad can explain it better, but it's like this: The human body really is an *amazing* machine. Allah, God, The Great Pumpkin, evolution. Call it what you want, but we work GREAT, considering... But if you end up augmenting one thing, you blow out something else. Gunny told us stories about the early Augments. They'd go to lob a grenade, and the new musculature worked so good grunts were spinning their arms out of the socket with the effort. That's why we didn't really get it down until a couple of decades ago.""

""No no, I get it."" I was catching up to him. ""Like in architecture, I can't just use the same reinforcement for a much larger building, or forget to calculate wind shear at height. I guess I just never thought about joints as joists.""

""Oh, shit, *Akhi*! I forgot about my joints!"" His awe and enthusiasm was palpable. ""Holy shit, man. They're like bullet-proof hi-bounce balls!"" I missed my best friend and his grin. 

Akhi... Slang for *Brother.* After a couple of hours, it was like he'd never left. Never been gone. He was the same old Piglet.

*******

Well, not quite. Quite a bit more, really, but still the funny awkward 'brother from another mother.'

We visited and caught up over several hours, his big, meaty paws surprisingly gentle when he went to pat me on the shoulder. Or when he was shaking hands with our other classmates. He was getting quite a few admiring stares, of course. He looked like he belonged in a Pantheon, chiseled from Marble.

In a moment of quiet, I asked him about it. ""Trina Herrule is fucking eye-raping you over there, Piglet. Fess up: you're plowing the field out there, aren't you?"" He smiled and nodded his head no.

""C'MON, man. What are you, shy all of the sudden?"" I laughed, but I could tell it was actually bothering him a little bit. Even at what looked to be over 175 kilos, he was like a giant holo-star. The idea of it seemed to make him uncomfortable.

""Naw, man. I can't,"" he said. 

""What, they didn't expand the plumbing and the pipes when they hulked you out?"" I looked at him sideways. ""That seems like a glaring omission, if you know what I mean.""

""No, no, it's not that. In fact, it's kind of obscene what the nanites and gene therapy does to, uh, *things*, if you catch my drift."" He had the grace to be a little embarrassed about it, which in our friendship was a kind of *patois.*

""Well, if Sharna Ollman's shit-talk was true, any size improvement would at least make it VISIBLE,"" I dead-panned.

""Still an asshole, I see.""

""Who, me?"" I mocked. ""Well, if my Uncle Barkus is telling the truth...""

""Which is doubtful..."" he interjected.

""HEY! Anyways, if he's telling the truth, my dad was a total ass, so at least I'm less so as the generations go down the line. Who knows? Maybe my grand-kid will be almost normal.""

""Doubt it,"" he shot back.

That's the thing about guys; we can bust each other's balls, and it's in good fun. 

""Back to your dick size, though,"" I tacked back.

""Please, Allah, no. Let's not.""

""Fuck you, man! Spill it Piglet. You gotta be CRUSHING it with the ladies!"" Seeing a dude that size squirm was actually fun, in a relatively benign way.

""No, for real. I actually can't.""

""What, did they break it off or something?! Those bastards!"" I shook my fist at the sky.

""No, you moron... I don't want to *kill* the woman, Jesus..."" He leaned in - ""It's against the rules to, uh, attempt *congress* with a non-Aug. I could actually wreck the poor girl. Not metaphorically... I mean, *literally*. I'm on an En-Limiter right now as it stands.""

""The fuck? What's an En-Limiter?"" I had a good buzz going, but he'd just introduced new language into the lexicon of our conversation.

""*Enhancement Limiting drug.* I'm dialed down."" 

""Wait, hold the fucking tube. You're dialing it down right now? Why would you do that?"" I'd seen him pick up 2 grown-ass women with one arm and flex for the camera without a hint of strain earlier for pictures.

""Rhett, I want you to think about what would happen if a guy like me - with half the reaction time of a normal person and the ability to lift a family transport without a Powered Suit - could do to a person if we walked into a place like it was Casual Fucking Friday. I'd gesture in a conversation and forearm someone into the second floor... *The hard way.* I gotta be careful around people, even dialed down.""

""You mean...""

""What I mean is,"" he continued, ""Is that it's a huge responsibility going Full-Aug. I can't just go thrust some random hole, if you catch my drift. It's against the Law. I could actually kill a Citizen by trying to have sex with her.""

""Well, at the very least, you'd smother her. I mean, look at you, you're a god-damned Nephilim."" I got it, but man... ""That's a helluva sacrifice. Sex is one of the things that makes us, well, *human.*""

""Oh, I know, *Akhi.* Besides, that doesn't mean I don't get any at all. There's a lot of really good women who went Full-Aug that are kinda... 'Good Sports,' I guess you'd call it. I'm not a monk, you know.""

""Not with **that** attitude you're not.""

""Har-fucking-har, dickhead... And yes, I miss it. I miss a lot of things that I took for granted. Normal stuff."" he seemed to stare off and get a little morose. I figured I'd try and bring him back to here and now.

""Like what. Fitting through doors?"" 

""Yes.""

""Having shirts that couldn't double as a tent?""

""Not really. That part is cool."" The corner of his mouth turned up a bit.

""Laundry day sucks though, right?"" I jabbed.

""The cleaning bill *is* a little steep."" A verbal perry.

""And you must leave a mean streak in your boxers.""

""Okay, that's just gross.""

""And your food bill has gotta be a real shitter.""

""You don't know the half of it.""

""Oooo! Speaking the shits! End to end, it's gotta be a cross country video call!"" I looked at him in mock seriousness.

""Oh my GAWD you're an asshole,"" He moaned. 

""That too! Your turd-cutter must be able to cut clean through a bridge cable!"" Even I couldn't keep a straight face on that joke.

""Your mind is a box of filth, Rhett, you know that?! Why are we friends again?"" He'd ask whenever I went into out-there joke territory. 

""Because,"" I said in a solemn tone, ""Nobody else would. Also, I'm awesome. Also humble. Yeah, that's it, I am fucking stuffed to the GILLS with humility. I'd have to be. I'm fucking amazing.""

""So you've said. Repeatedly."" His deadpan humor was there, just with a surprisingly basso rumble behind the voice. 

I looked down into my scotch, then. The years of being without my best friend, wondering what had happened to him, if he was okay, if I'd ever see my *Brother* again... 

""I missed you, Samir."" 

""Hey, don't get all weird on me now, Rhett,"" he gestured, palms up.

""I mean it. I'm happy to see you. One day you were here, the next... Your mom and dad filled me in on a little bit.""

""Yeah. Alab even came out to see me, under the auspices of checking on some of the gene therapy I had done after a bad patrol."" He looked down at the bar.

""I'm sorry I left like that, Akhi. That was wrong of me. It was a messed up time."" He slumped a little bit. ""I was actually on a call with Shari when they got hit. She wanted to come out and see me after she was done with her internship..."" 

He continued: ""I could *see* it happening. I *saw* the hull breach that sucked her out of the station."" He paused, then: ""I was numb. I remember walking into the recruiting station the next morning. Turns out, being a candidate for Full-Aug was something I was uniquely qualified for.""

I tried to lighten the mood - ""Scottish dad, mom from the Saudi Arabian peninsula... I suppose it was either that or some gangly, sickly brown kid who got sunburned when the sun was still behind the clouds.""

""Well, thank a god I didn't turn out like **you**, ya wet dream of the Old Nazis."" That lopsided grin again. 

""You look like you did alright,"" I told him with a smile. ""Still doesn't explain why you didn't call.""

""Well, about that,"" he sighed. ""I'm really sorry, man. In my defense, I feel like what I do matters... I like to think it matters to all of us. Not just the colonists we protect, or to the leaders here on the Home world. I mean to *humanity.* I take it seriously. I want to honor my mother and father with my service. My family here. Shari... Man, Shari."" 

The sadness on his giant face was visible. Like seeing a brown bear that was about to cry. 

""But you, *Akhi.*"" He looked down at me. ""I wanted my Brother to be proud of me.""

""Shut up, Piglet. You're gonna make me blush.""

""Good,"" he quipped. We looked back down at our glasses.

""Samir?"" I asked softly.

""Yeah, Rhett?"" he said, with a hitch in his voice...

""I was already proud of you, man. Thanks for looking out for us."" 

""*It's my privilege*,"" he said. 

He looked like he was gonna well up with tears, but I hadn't seen him in so long, I had to tell him...

""... And listen, you dumb ass bag of muscle; the only thing you had to do to make me happy was be safe, do a good job, and come have a beer with me at the end of the day. Okay, Piglet?""

He put a giant arm across my shoulders, and hugged me into his giant side.

""you got it, *Akhi.*"" He wiped a tear away with his other hand.

""I'm not buying YOU the beer, though. I'll lose my fucking shirt having you waste a keg on that god-damned super-liver of yours."" I looked over with a grin.

""Lightweight,"" he smiled, and squeezed a little harder on my shoulder.

From across the bar at the pool tables, Mike Kershawn - former-football-jock-slash-huge-dick-for-brains shouted, 

""**Oy! Poofters!** Get a fuckin' 'otel room, you two, right?!"" Several of his former teammates guffawed along with him. 

Welp, there goes THAT bonding moment. 

""I kinda wanna go over there and break a foot off in his ass. Piglet,"" I muttered. 

""I'm inclined to let you on principle,"" he nodded and looked back like a mountain of menace in their direction.

""Me? Fuck no, pal, I meant break YOUR foot off in his ass. I'm apparently the bottom in this power couple of ours."" 

""Awww, and I just got these things polished!"" For a guy his size, the mock whining sounded ridiculous. 

""Fine then, Jennifer. I don't want to have you ruin your pedicure or anything.""

""What. An. Asshole."" The sigh was also WAY overly dramatic... But who cares? My Brother was home from deployment. 

I got up. ""Do me a favor, would you? Walk me back to the Old Hotel Del? I was trying to keep up with you in the drinking department until I found out you were a ringer for drinking games.""

""Why the hell not?"" he laughed. Then, ""Hey, I forgot to tell you! I can see in the *dark* now! Some of the Augments are actually fairly useful.""

""Well, at least you're good for something, Piglet,"" I giggled. Damn, it was good to see him again.

""Yeah, yeah... Hey, how about tomorrow we meet up for breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and you can say hello to Y'Quirai!"" We lumbered towards the doors.

Something about that name bugged me... ""That name, Y'Quirai. It sound suspiciously familiar...""

""She should,"" he chuckled. ""Remember that time Becca showed up at your place outside UCSD and you were-""

""HOLY SHIT!"" I yelped. ""Is that the Randirian from that night?!""

""Yup,"" he was grinning like an idiot. A very large idiot.

""As I recall, she damn near scratched my balls of that night. Randirians are... Sporting, to put it nicely. I never quite felt like I could tame her."" I didn't remember much from that evening, but I do remember a lot of growling.

""Funny you should mention that,"" Samir replied. ""It turns out  that the, uh, 'robustness' of her species puts her on my pre-approved list of available, you know... 'Targets.'""

""Hunh,"" I mused. ""So, you, uh...""

""Yup. A few times. We both had to blow off some steam.""

""WOW."" 

""You're telling me,"" he winked.

""I take it the Management is going to be making sure you two are covering the cost of the repairs to your room, Monsieur Peeg-let,"" I said in a grave tone.

""It's reinforced. Also, shut up.""

""Thank Christ. Does said room also come with a scratching post for Madame Y'Quirai, or is she using your new and giant wookie dick for that purpose?""

""SHUT UP, RHETT! GAH!"" I think he was actually blushing.

""Really good to see you here, Piglet."" I giggled again as we walked.

""I'd say the feeling is mutual,"" he shook his head, ""But you are one sick fuck.""

""I know,"" I replied. Then, I mockingly flopped into him. ""Carry me, Piglet!""

""You're such an asshole, Rhett,"" he smiled, and then hoisted me over his shoulder without an effort.

""Hey, ya giant turd, either put me down or learn to treat a lady with respect!""

...

I have 2 offers on the table right now, one is for a Co - op (summer and fall 2016) at a local company.  The Co - op extends my time in school and my grad date to December 2017, which allows me to get a 2nd internship next summer before I graduate. The Co-op deals with developing OS's for single board computers (controlling various functions of vehicles mostly). The internship is in Business Intelligence (data analytics) and doesn't extend graduation.

My whole family is moving to the west coast over the next few years and I'd like to follow, plus it seems like the best opportunities are out there anyway. I'm wondering if there are any people (especially recruiters/employees from well established west coast companies) who have an opinion of what track would be better?

I've heard that Business Intelligence is a super marketable skill but i wonder if only having 1 internship experience prior to graduation will hurt me. (I decided on the majors late and spent last summer back packing).

What is your advice?,IAmOnASinkingShip,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49mjm7/i_think_i_am_on_a_sinking_ship_what_is_your_advice/,"I think I may be on a sinking ship, and I need your help thinking rationally about it.  Here is how things look.  
  
A few years ago I had an awesome internship at a software company.  It was an amazing place to work and I loved everyone there.  Eight months ago they called me out of the blue with a job offer that I couldn't refuse.  I was told that one of the two owners of the company was breaking off of the main company and taking the product that I had worked on when he left.  I was hired under the understanding that I would be joining this new company when it split off.  
  
Several of the engineers decided to move to other branches of the company, so my boss wanted to rebuild the team.  Unfortunately things became vicious at the company and the other owner began trying to dismantle the team (he actually informed my boss that he intended to do so if his terms for the split were not agreed upon).  Long story short, people have quit under the stress and yesterday the last engineer other than myself accepted a crazy offer from the other owner and left.  My boss has treated me (and as far as I can tell, all of the other employees) very well and he pays me very well, so I am hesitant to bail.  I am wondering what you would do?  Here are some considerations:  
  
* The new company will be financially secure for the near future.  My boss keeps the books open and we have client contracts that will keep us in the black for four years if we do nothing but basic maintenance on our current clients.  
* Minus the insane shit that is happening right now, it is a dream job.  Very flexible, very good pay, I get to work from home 90% of the time.  
* The split will be finalized very soon and we will be able to get away from the toxic environment we have been in.   
* We are already looking at applications to hire a few new engineers as soon as the split is finalized, so I won't be the only one for long.  
* I don't have a Computer Science degree.  I have undergraduate degrees in unrelated fields (I took a minor in CS).  I was working on my masters in CS when I took the job offer.  In total I have about two years development experience(8 months at this company), but I worry that without a degree I will be unable to get another good position.   
  
I am somewhat excited by the idea that I will be able to play a big role in building the new engineering team, but I have a lot of doubts and I don't think I am capable of thinking rationally about this right now.  What do you think you would do?  Stick it out and see if I can build an awesome team?  Go back and finish the Masters?  Try to find a new job?  Thanks so much for reading my wall of text!"

Recently got hire by one of the big 4, hasn’t been smooth sailing :/

* I’m using a hand-me-down computer from the interns.
-	The same code base takes 20X slower to compile on my machine than other developers’. It’s a physically inferior machine by $3k.
-	Asking me to setup random project and NEVER go back to it. Some projects are not compatible with each other and causing trouble.
-	Trouble with setting up stuff and no one willing to help.


Maybe they want to get ride of me because of my race, but can’t fire someone for that. However, they could fire someone for incompetency (i.e. not able to produce result) What scares me the most is that if I’m the manger I would willing to do that.


I already signed the contract, so I have to stay for a year. Cause, don’t have enough to pay back the sign-in bonus and there’s a good chance the manager knows.



Have anyone experience this before? Is it a good idea to bust out that old interview handbook and start to prepare for the worse?

49oshg,2,2016-03-09,Comfort Zone,GrovyleXShinyCelebi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/49oshg/comfort_zone/,"Hi CSCareerQuestions community,

I'm a sophomore in college that have been reading alot of the posts here, and a recurring theme in here seems to be that I should NEVER be comfortable.  Period.  I should always be taking risks, because they force personal growth, and if I ever get comfortable I'll be unemployable and layed off.

I've been a chicken my whole life and I have a VERY, VERY risk averse personality.  I have ALOT of anxiety issues as well with stress.  For example I got accepted into a top 3 CS school and rejected it for a local CS program because I had Aspies and at the time of graduating high school my life skills definitely weren't good enough to survive alone in a dorm (from personal experience), and (more importantly) if I went to school locally I would graduate with ZERO debt thanks to a really good scholarship.  My life skills have definitely improved since then (hopefully since I have to live in a dorm for my summer internship) and I still feel like this was the right decision given my case, but I'm starting to feel like in this field this kind of thinking is not sustainable- I have to be challenging myself to do things I have no idea how to get done to force improvement- constantly- or I'll be unemployable at 40!

I like reading CS blogs and learning new languages occasionally in my spare time (I'm learning .NET framework right now to prepare for my internship), and I (very) actively participate in all of my school's CS-related clubs.  I also have a decent portfolio of personal projects and I'm thinking about adding a personal website to it.

As a sophomore is there anything else I should/could be doing?  I hope one day of making it into a ""Big 4"" company like Microsoft and Google, or at least any large company whose core product is software.  Is it OK if I go ""slow and steady"", focusing on learning one thing at a time and on my school extracurriculars as well as class or should I be living fast and hard?  Are there successful people in software who made it without zig-zagging?  I've seen enough action movies and anime to know that a ""fast and furious"" life is not for me; I NEED my comfort zone...

And lastly failing that how can I get out of my comfort zone and task risks a bit more easily?  I take failure VERY personally (I guess this came from the strictness of Asian parents plus my complete lack of self-esteem).  Every time I play video games I only touch the easiest settings and immediately uninstall them the moment they get too hard, or if they don't have difficulty settings (Dark Souls, for example).  I'll probably end up taking the same approach to life as well...

Thanks for your thoughts!"

I'm an Italian student who went to Galway, Ireland, for an Internship. Finding a house for 3 months in this period is not an easy task, and there was only one available before I started my travel. There was the possibility to pay in advance 1 month rent+deposit in order to secure the room, and I did so as I didn't want to live in a hotel for a long time.

One of the persons living in this house sub-rented one of the availabe rooms through daft.ie, a famous website for house selling and renting.

Problem is, the house is not what was promised, is dirty and some commodities are missing.

I would like to search for a new one, but before doing so I would like to know what would legally happen if I leave the house without paying the other months (see contract in the link). Keep in mind that one months is already paid, and I've been here just 2 days.

I can't afford to pay for many months while living somewhere else, and since I was scammed I'm not willing to do so.

I would just like to let them find their keys on the table and the room empty.

Can you give me some advices?

Thank you very much

I am in my senior year and I've already sent out my resume and applied to a ton of places. I don't want to leave this rock unturned, should I go ahead and ask the VP in there are internships available or go through HR? What would you do, since it is so late into the year. 

Btw they DONT post these internships anywhere, publicly or internally yet we always have these interns appearing.

However I made a rather stupid mistake by confusing a co-op/semester internship with a summer one, so now I am thus on the hunt again.

After browsing this subreddit, it would seem that a lot of you have had success finding internships even at this time, so I'm interested in hearing your tips for success. I've applied to a good number of places already, but for the most part have been unlucky (managed to reach the phone interview stage for Amazon but I got fucked up after :/). 

So some notes:

1. I am currently a junior, and admittedly I don't have as much work experience as I would like. I am a TA for one of my university's CS courses, and I did a pseudo-internship (it was in a university out-of-country and it was at their CS department so not really industry but it was CS-related, so hence pseudo), but otherwise that's about it for relevant work experience.
2. I have a decent amount of projects, both school-related and out-of-school, and have them on my Github. I also have a personal website (albeit not too fancy) that contains somewhat similar information.
3. I've tried to take advantage of my school's career website, and have also been using LinkedIn, AngelList, Indeed, and LookSharp. Any other useful resources would be great!

At this point, what are some small things I could do to help improve my chances? Any resume tricks (things to include or not)? What are some key factors that most companies look for that I should have? I'm not desperate yet, but my mistake has obviously cost me more than I would like.

Edit: A lot of you guys suggested start-ups, which I am more than excited to work for. How did you guys find out about the start-ups in your region? I live in NJ, but I am willing to relocate if I have to."

I've been considering going to grad school since highschool. But I'm currently a sophomore and have no experience in either research or industry. However, I was luckily accepted into an REU concerning research in topics I feel passionate about within my major. Just some background stats about me: 



* Major: Computer Science

* GPA: 3.6/40


* School: Top 30 for CS

* Experience: REU will be first experience in cs for me. 


* Research Interest: Security


Not sure what else to really say about me. I'm not really the type of person to decide on something prior to having to. But I feel like if I end up wanting to go to grad school I'd have to prepare somewhat. I don't have strong relationships with any professors for letter of recs- but that might be due to large class sizes and not getting involved in research at my home university. 

Would it even seem like I'm on track to being a good candidate? I always imagine grad students being top of their class students- and the schools I'd like to get into are somewhat competitive: University of Texas, University of Minnesota, University of Washington, etc. 


Does anyone have general advice or anything they can tell me based on this post? I'm not sure if I want to go to grad school and I'm not sure I have what it takes. I truly enjoy learning and being in school- but the cost might be a problem (I will have moderately high debt after undergrad which might make grad school a hard financial decision) and I don't have internship experience so I don't know if I would want to move onto industry after graduating. I know I can aim for an internship next year but its not guaranteed and there's the possibility of me just having a bad experience at it.

I didn't attend college for myself, rather my mother sorta forced me into it, I would rather have taken these past two semesters to go out and experiment in the real world. I currently have my eyes on accounting, and if I could implement some programming into it, that'd be great. Really, I would like to just take time to get odd jobs and internships to see what field I'd like to stay in, rather than piling up the student debt without knowing for sure if I want a degree at this point. 

My aunt is partially for me going out and finding a job, in fact, she's the one that made me want to join the accounting field after she told me about her experience with it as a college student (even though she didn't like it). She recommends Co-op, but my mother is pretty fierce about me staying in school and would probably go off on me if I called her and said I wanted to dropout.

Throughout college I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do; I’m okay at research and writing so I ended up a history major, which doesn’t exactly lend itself to obvious career paths. I never took advantage of the many internship opportunities that go with being at a prestigious university in the middle of DC; while my classmates were working on Capitol Hill or at international NGOs, I spent every summer back home as a barista. I graduated with honors, a thin resume, and no experience or inkling about what sort of work I’d like to do. 

I figured that some writing and analytical skills might carry over from history to a field like law, but couldn’t land an interview anywhere as a paralegal or entry-level assistant. In the meantime I worked as a server and bar-back at a high-end restaurant. Then I tried looking for a teaching position: I liked writing, had experience editing, so I eventually got a job at a small urban Catholic high school teaching English. 

And I hated it. Spending hours making lesson plans, only to see them go to shit because one kid is acting up, the constant disrespect and discipline issues, standing in front of a class expecting to be entertained all day, it all just wore on me. The school gave me no curriculum to work from and virtually no support: it was just me and 90 kids. So after one long and terrible semester, I resigned. 

Now, I have no idea what to do. I’m still at the restaurant. I know I definitely don’t want to teach high school again. I was considering pursuing a PhD in history, but the job prospects and lifestyle of academia seems like a horror show right now; I don’t have the drive or direction for such a cutthroat career. I’ve looked at museums, publications, law firms, communications, research: anything where research and writing might come in handy. I’d also toyed with trying to make something work at the restaurant: I work hard and learn quickly, if I set to it I could try for bartender or manager in a few years. But I don’t know how viable an option that is, or whether I’m cut out for the restaurant industry. 

I know I’m not a good candidate on paper. Hell, I know I’m not a good candidate in person either. I’m just tired of sending cover letters out into the void. I feel frustrated, lost, and left behind by my peers. I’m only 22 but it feels like my options are already limited.

Recently, I met with a bunch of companies at a career fair and gave many of them my resume. I received an email today from one of those companies asking me to come in for an interview next week.

I remember that this company was one of the ones I was least interested in after talking with them. When searching them online I didn't find many results, and the only company address I can find is about 3.5 hours away and the pay probably wouldn't cover much more than the rent. Most importantly, I am not sure what type of work they are looking for. From what I can tell the programming work they do definitely doesn't match my skillset.

What should I do? Would it be worth it to drive a couple of hours for the interview next week? Is there any somewhat professional way to ask in the email what skills they are looking for in potential employees?"

My current job is as an IT Specialist but I ended up being the only IT person for the entire company (500 employees, 15 locations in 6 states) I was able to do a few projects such as establish HIPAA Compliance via our email service, perform 2 365 migrations, setup alternative locations (Networking, pc/software setups in other states) and did a lot of process improvement from when I was hired as well as some other projects. 

Now that I am starting to update my resume once again and look at what jobs are available. I am struck with this familiar feeling of self doubt, fear, and lack of self worth. As a recent IT Graduate I can only say that I have done only so much in this field. I did internships in college and worked for a few fortune 500 companies while studying but it seems when searching for IT jobs the requirement difficulty is no where close to being similar to searching for, say, an HR position where it could be more closely related to Can you HR? 

Each job is different, each job requires XYZ that I have no idea how I would be able to be in an interview, and pass that interview because there is no way that I could say I have worked with that technology.

Even reading some of the things in /r/sysadmin make me wonder what I've been preparing for all my life because it apparently isn't what you guys are doing.

I really could use some advice for looking for new jobs in IT. 

Reason I am leaving my current job is because they pay way under what would be considered acceptable for an IT Specialist, let alone what they actually have me doing. 

I would love to get into fields such as Unix admin or IT security but without the 7-10 years it seems they all require, I am at a loss for how it is possible.

I would definitely appreciate some input.

In my institute, they have some deals with companies to allow us to work on a project with them as an undergrad/intern. We get graded by the college, but one of the developers in said company mentors us during the project. Obviously, this is a huge opportunity. 

However, my current project isn't going too well. My original mentor left the company, so I got a replacement brought in. The spec for the project was very spotty at best when I first received it, so now it's even worse. I don't know where I'm going with it, the new mentor is going off scope left, right and center and I'm panicking. 

 I'm having issues essentially giving them what they want, so to speak. I'm working and working at it, and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. It's taking the dive a failed project is taking.

Now, we also get offered the chance to interview with the company, and I'm terrified this will affect that and/or other development positions I got for. 

I know I want and can do the work- I interned all last summer at a development shop, built their mobile app across WinPhone, Android and iOS. I loved it: I knew what they wanted, was left to program it and it went amazingly well.

I love programming and tech, but I'm just worried this one project will completely mess up my future. I've learned so much from doing this project as regards to failure and proper management, proper spec outline, etc but is there any point to it if I fuck it up?

TL;DR: Will an undergraduate or an internship project under performing due to multiple outside issues affect my career as a developer in general?"

[Resume](http://postimg.org/image/t8l6906i9/)
_________________________________________________________________________________
I have long list of great excuses regarding ( family, personal, and school issues ), but honestly I was lazy with my job search with 0 motivation.


I applied to about less than 10 jobs, most of em' named companies. I've gotten two interviews and wasn't offered the jobs at the end ( both ended at the behavioral... for reasons I can understand )


I was in a bit of depression and completely dying out work ethic for a long period of time and only recently I've been able to recover with a help of a friend who inspired me to come into computer engineering in first place.

Loooong story short, this semester I've started to get good scores in school again, working on problems on cracking the coding interview, and what I'm most proud, although not related, is I've started to exercise for the first time in like 2 years.


I'm confident about myself than I have ever been, but, at the same time, I'm writing this post because I'm insecured about not having a single internship experience under my belt as a junior. I feel like I've started to mature and got myself together little late in the competition and I want to play the catch-up game.

I want to stay motivated, work on projects on my own, and further enhance my skills as a programmer.
I know it's a very broad question, but what would you guys do in my position to become a better/competitive programmer. 

I don't know what exactly I want to do in future, right now I'm doing embedded and computer security which is both very fun for me. I want to work on something and develop my skill over this summer on my own to find what I'm most passionate about because I understand that it's a bit too late to find an internship.

I thought about running away from burdens of my life, but if I wanted to make money I want to do it while coding and nothing else. So I'm going to accept my failures, stop the excuses, and try to advance. If you guys can throw in any advice I would very much appreciate it."

This isn't just a ""this happened to me once and I'm bitter"", but more of ""this happens more than 50% of interviews and I'm tired of it.""




More context:

I found this subreddit during my freshman year and saw how important internships and experience was for students in order to get ahead of the game when you graduate. I did exactly that, I worked my ass off to get my first internship the summer after freshman year, and continued that mentality all through school. I've had 2 1/2 years of full-time (summer)/part-time (during school) experience working at 3 different companies working on both mobile and web development. Down time between jobs have been no greater than a month or 2 (just for taking a breather). These weren't joke positions, and I was actually apart of an Agile environment and exposed to many aspects of software dev than a normal CS student wouldn't be familiar with (if he's had no or little experience).




I feel I've done everything I possibly could have done with not being at a top-tier school, and getting as much software development experience that I could get to be able to provide to a company than a typical ""new grad"".




I started looking for roles for a full-time position after I graduate, trying to explore all my options, and I'm shocked how irrelevant my experience is to technical hiring managers, lead engineers, etc (not recruiters, the people hiring). I've talked to about 12 companies since my start (still talking to some) and most of the responses I get are:



""Looking at your resume you don't have any practical experience""

""We're actually looking for someone with more experience and not just out of school"".




I'm not talking about the Big 4 or being from Stanford. I've interviewed with both big and startup companies, but the experience is the same. No I didn't work at huge notable companies, but I did the best I felt I could.




Has anyone ever experienced this themselves? Is my experience actually that irrelevant? I've had friends at my school experience the same issue, and some even try to omit the fact they're in school as long as they can to avoid it.

The companies I've been interviewing for have been in LA/OC, Chicago, SF/Bay area, and NY.




Sorry for the rant, hope I don't sound pretentious or entitled. It's just the hard work I've put in these last 4 years isn't coming out to the result that I've read about or expected. Hearing these opinions put me down and really don't give me much hope for after I graduate.



*tldr* A CS senior with 2 1/2 years of software work experience is getting told by companies that his experience isn't practical and is still receiving ""new grad"" discrimination."

I have a choice of either choosing a good internship (from a reputable company - Data Analyst internship) or choose a summer research from a university (Cyber and Civil Infrastructure - I don't know how good this opportunity would be towards my future because it asked me what my top 3 projects I wanted to work on, I chose software, embedded systems and hardware).  

My long term goal is to go to grad school and obtain my masters in computer engineering. I think the research might help me but my current problem is that I have a GPA below 3, haven't taken GREs (which I know I'll do bad because I struggle with reading), and have mediocre internship experience under my belt. 

I thought about taking the research and on the spare time, I will be learning more about programming, algorithms, APIs, etc. (basically strengthen my programming logic and problem solving skills,  reading the Cracking the code interview (I haven't finished) and work on an individual project myself). I am trying to get ready so I can be competitive enough when I am close to graduation; I graduate by the end of this year.

I've also completed an internship at a startup over the summer.

A little problem though. I've come to a realisation that I'm not entirely sure I want to work as a Software Engineer after I graduate.

I chose Software Engineering because I loved maths, computers and coding from an early childhood. I've loved the technicality of it and have been praised. The pay in the US from what I hear is quite good for now. Simply put, I chose it because I was good at it and it seemed like a lucrative career.

The degree at my university is also troubling me. I've come to the realisation that the degree is just a glorified Comp Sci. There's not much distinction and it feels like I've wasted my time.

Truth be told, I find the work uninteresting and unappealing. 

And I think I'm more interested in the physical Engineering disciplines. I thought about switching to Mechanical Engineering.

I feel like I'd rather be learning about Fluids, Thermo and Dynamics rather than Finite Maths, Databases and Networking.

I'm aware switching degrees at this stage isn't the wisest of decisions but I feel stuck with this degree in terms of where I can go with it. The thought of working as a dev. with a code base for the rest of my life seems depressing.

If anyone could knock some bloody sense into me or give me some advice on what I can do in this situation, that would really helpful."

I cannot choose between two jobs and I need to make a decision by tomorrow. 

Job A

- already accepted
- In my school. 
- Around 1.5 year contract. 
- working logistics and project management for school leadership programs

Job B

- Government border services internship
- competitive selection process (not selected as of yet) 
- higher pay but you only have a contract for 4 months. 


I am leaning towards job A because I already got it, has great experience and a longer term. However, I want to get into government (public policy) in the future and B is a chance to get a foot in the door. 

For job B, I have to complete a written test (around 7 hours but I am great at standardized tests). Which do you think is worth it? 

I can clarify information, feel free to ask!

I'm a senior, about to finish my CS degree, but I'm struggling immensely. I'm not even sure I'm going to pass my final classes because the concepts have completely gone over my head now. On top of that I've been applying for various internships and jobs since I was a sophomore and have gotten a few interviews but I've been turned down everywhere for the last 2 years. I've even branched out to IT positions to apply for and still get turned down.

I pretty much have no motivation and I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. I feel like I've made a mistake choosing computer science because I'll be honest, I'm an awful programmer and probably the worst in my graduating class. There are freshman that are more skilled than I am. I enjoy programming but I'm just terrible at it and there's no way I'd be able to pass any technical interview without being walked through every step of the interview.

The main problem is that I went into the field practically blind. I had no clue what code looked like, what a data structure or algorithm was, or any of those concepts. I was always told that I can be whatever I wanted to be and being the naive, ignorant, dumb as a brick, recent high school grad that I was, I decided I wanted to work in the video game industry. So I picked the most common degree in the industry which was computer science. Boy was that decision a mistake, I learned quickly that what you want to be might not actually be what you want. Even if I managed to land a job in that field with the slim chances I already have, the 80 hour work weeks and no job security would have killed me. After my sophomore year I realized that the video game industry was not the reality for me and I should have jumped ship then but here I am, about to graduate unemployed with no plans for the future.

All I wanted was a relaxing, stress free job where I could work on things that I already enjoy. I'm your stereotypical ""spend every minute playing games and watching anime"" kind of guy and I just wanted a job that would allow me to continue that lifestyle. I figured making games would be the logical solution since I've spent tens of thousands of hours playing them.

So now I feel stuck, I can barely get out of bed in the morning, I'm most likely going to fail my classes, if I don't fail I'll graduate unemployed and probably have to get a minimum wage job. At this rate death sounds better than having to deal with the fact that I wasted 4 years, being yelled at and disowned by my family for being a failure, and living the rest of my life barely getting by.

**tl;dr**

* About to graduate with my CS degree.
* Might not graduate due to not doing well in my classes this semester.
* Been turned down from internships and jobs for the last 2 years.
* Not skilled enough to pass a technical interview.
* No motivation, waking up feeling exhausted.
* In desperate need for some guidance or someone to point me in the right direction."

We have one friend who knows a lot about car mechanics and their engines and recently he got a job at Sikorsky aircraft. We don't know what his position is which led us to the debate. He dropped out after his first semester in college to get the job and he said it pays $20 an hour. His college major had to do with computers so I assumed that he most likely got an internship or position that had to do with computers since his dad had connections within the company. They debated with me that he most likely got a position working on aircraft mechanics due to his experience with working on cars and having a lot of knowledge as an auto mechanic, I said not likely cause in my opinion aircraft mechanics and auto mechanics are two completely different things to work on. Where as they argued that he already has experience with auto engines so it would be a lot easier for him to do the job and better guarantee him the position. So basically what I'm asking, is there a huge difference between Aircraft and Auto mechanics and if one knew how to work on one would it then be easy for him to transfer over and work on the other?"

For various reasons,I couldn't choose computer engineering, and as a result I learned fundamentals of programming through Matlab (duh, I know) and couldn't attend classes on operating systems and networking. However, I did attend a class on web programming (HTML+CSS,PHP,Javascript,intro to Ajax) and a practical course on computer security, which I really loved (they introduced networking and OS concepts, taught pentesting steps, a few tools ,how to edit exploits and get them to work, and a bit about digital forensics).

 I'd like to get a job in computer security,specifically penetration testing, but wouldn't mind working on incident response and the like. 
Now I have been given two internship possibilities, both in the security field. 
Offer A, from a company belonging to an international group: the job is about identity and access management systems. They offer a first month of initial training(apparently including networking and operating system concepts from a practical standpoint), then a paid internship with possible assignments abroad. 


Offer B, from a relatively small local firm(150-200 people): the internship is related to pentesting and they give me the possibility of choosing between network and webapp pentesting. No assignments abroad.


A and B pay the same salary.


If I choose A, I may get some training on networking and operating systems but the topic of the internship doesn't seem very exciting. 


If I choose B, I don't get any training on said subjects but the job seems to be more interesting. 


Note that I would like to enrol in a Masters program(where I will learn a lot about networking, not much about OS) and I just want to carry out the internship to gain a valuable job experience, not to start working without a Master.
With that being said, what should I do?"

Yes, I am THAT new to the job and this may be little too early to even think about it. 

24 years old, I have my degree in Fine Arts and a diploma in Animation. I have to admit I have very little job experience at my age; no paid experience in the creative industry, just internships and volunteers here and there for past 3 years. When I was 20, I worked at a restaurant for a month, that is until they fired me and that was it.

Now I am on my three-week trial period at a grocery store, shelf stacking and being a cashier. After about 48 working hours, I already feel very incompetent at my job. I am very slow, and keep making small mistakes everyday but I know I can get better if I stay willing to learn and improve.

My question is; should I? This may be just another excuse of mine to run away from tough situations; I know I am a little spoiled child who had not earned a penny by herself until now, but after the three-week period, with my contract signed and sent to their head office (yes, they are still in my hands unsigned), I will be a legitimate employer and will be obliged to give a *one-month's* termination notice when I want to leave my job.

Now I am still looking for jobs related with my degree but once I become a legal employee at my current place, will it be harder to get a job with a immediate start?

I already have an answer; I am not quitting at this point with no job offer at my table, and two more weeks of my trial period left. This job will probably toughen me up a bit, and some extra money in my wallet.

I am probably just a little lost as to how long I should stay at my current place. This year I am on a post-study work visa which gives me a year to stay in this country to get a job, and with a job that is related to my degree, a permanent resident visa (which is like a green card in US) is no longer a dream. And to achieve that, I want to maximize a possibility of getting a job in the creative field and minimize a risk of not getting it.

What do you redditors think? Any thoughts or advises will be appreciated."

The basic question is whether I should accept an offer from Duke university for a Masters of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering program after graduating form University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am an international student with a 3.0 GPA and I graduated in Dec 2015. I do not have any internships under my belt, but 2 university research positions have helped me gain experience in robotics and Engineering research. However, I didn't have much luck getting a job after graduation. I think being an international student who would require visa sponsorship to continue working in the US after a few years, has a little to do with it.

What I need now is input from someone who has graduated in engineering from Duke, or has had to make similar decisions before. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 



Pros| Cons
---|---
 there is this fact that companies are more likely to sponsor an international student after a masters degree than after a bachelor's degree.| UIUC was definitely a better university for Engineering than Duke and since I did not score a job through UIUC, I feel the chances of scoring one from Duke are slimmer.
Research would indicate that my GPA is likely to improve at Duke significantly, compared to UIUC. | Dukes alumni network is about one third that of UIUC, and even smaller if your look at just Engineering.
Duke has a smaller Engineering population, especially in Masters, and therefore I am more likely to get noticed by companies that come to Duke. The staff and advisory may also be able to provide personalized help due to the small population. | Smaller engineering population might sway companies further away from hiring an international student.
There is the fact that this degree requires me to do an industry internship in order to complete my degree. So I guess that would open doors to jobs in the industry. | The question 'Why did I have to move to a university with worse credentials than my bachelors' might pop into an employers head.

this post isn't meant to be a humble-brag. I am simply seeking advice on maximizing my opportunity when I graduate. I'd like to give some context to my situation.


During university, I was not a stellar student. I have plenty of low math and cs grades, but some high math and cs grades. I did not take school as seriously as I should have. I'll graduate with most likely just under 2.5. I did not socialize well with my peers. I feel that my mental state during university was unstable, slightly depressing outlook on life. It caused me a lot of unnecessary stress.
I was also doing a double major in math and cs. I will say the cs courses have better grades. In particular last year I averaged 3.22 in cs courses. This term, I'm expecting decent marks in hard courses. But the damage cannot be undone. 


With this weighing me down, I put in significant effort to obtain internships and successfully did. I have 1+ years worth of experience from internships. I have learned an incredible amount from those experiences. In particular, the last internship really taught me software development of a product. I was a contributor to core features. I learned how to be more confident as everyone was encouraging me to be. 


Fast forward to now. I'm applying to places such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and medium sized companies doing interesting work. I have a very nice formatted resume, taken from advice on this subreddit. I have a personal website that reiterates what my resume says, and expands on my interests and shows some projects I worked on.


I want to know what my prospects are because the last internship are making me an offer. It is expected to be between 50-55k with benefits. This is pretty good for the area, even though 70k new grad is also possible somewhere else.  But I don't want to accept it until I can judge my job prospects.


This is mainly because the company is a startup and lacks mentorship and seasoned developers. I want to learn from the best. Everyone there is essentially learning how to do what they do. Many of these guys switched from another career. I cannot discredit their intelligence though. Just their experience. There are many times where my expertise is actually considered. This scares me because I don't know anything relative to seasoned software engineers.


The other aspect to this is how much I want to move. I'd like to start in a new big city and meet people, cute girls. Start that social life adventure I've been postponing for far too long.   


The other component weighing me down is my experience comes from startups. I think companies will look down on this because I did not learn from well defined sources. They'll see my no name internships, low gpa and dismiss me as intellectually inferior. I want to know how true this part is.

Anyways please offer your thoughts. Again, I'm looking to maximize my potential as a new grad. I understand how my position can be considered successful and do not take that for granted. I got very lucky the last 3 years. "

I am about to graduate this spring semester with a 3.0 in an IT related degree, Informatics.  I have a few internships experience through my state university.  The reason for my low GPA is due to my untreated ADD that I've lived with for so long.  It is difficult for me to stay in a spot and consume 10+ pages of literature without medication.  I had to take 5 summer courses just to bump my GPA up and that shit was expensive for my parents (sad face).  Adderall has been saving me.  I'm trying to not get addicted to them but damn do I love Adderall sometimes.  It really helps sustain my love for books and learning new concepts/ideas.  This semester, I have been on top of my schoolwork and even finishing extra credit assignments.  I have really decided to change my mentality of taking school very seriously.

The truth is, I feel like I have missed out on a great education.  I want to go to an Ivy League school because I believe that they are the best of the best when it comes to schooling.  I wouldn't know what to do pursuing a Masters degree.  In addition, I am still trying to learn better habits of studying, reading and taking notes.  I think that graduate studies will cost more because I wouldn't be able to apply for scholarships with a low GPA.  The goal is to pursue Ivy League education (columbia or cornell).  I already know that MOST of you will say NO to a second bachelor and yes to a Masters.  I am a little concerned about pursuing graduate studies because I recently changed my mentality and habits towards schoolwork (and addy) but I know that I can excel if I work really really hard.  Basically, I want to take a few more extra years to build up a solid application for grad school.  If I were to pursue a second bachelor, I might go the Finance route.  I might be able to convince my parents to financially support me for a second Bachelor degree.

My question is... when I graduate, should I go for a second bachelors at another school, work hard and do well (3.8+ gpa), and apply for grad school/law school at an Ivy league institution?  What is my best strategy really?

The main point is that I'm in my last semester of my bachelor's in electrical engineering. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.704 as well as two summer internships while I've been in college. I have multiple projects (including my senior design project) to demonstrate my problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills.

That all being said, I *still* don't have a job offer for when I graduate in about two months. Most of my peers that I know have had offers for a couple of months now from great companies. I've been applying to positions starting after I graduate constantly for the past 6 months or so. My resume (with contact information removed) can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ywyKy8YIRiLW43LVUzVEpJMU0/view?usp=sharing).

I've had interviews for about 8-10 companies. Three of these companies I went through the entire process, even through the last ""final on-site interview"" for all three, but then received ""we will not be extending a job offer to you at this time"" emails for each one. I don't believe I'm that bad at interviewing, I'm very outspoken and have been complimented on my interviewing (latest of the three companies had feedback that said ""you did quite well with the behavioral questions and provided great detail, keep it up"").

I really don't know which part of the process I'm failing at. I believe that my credentials, experience, and skills are comparatively good to the other students I know that have received offers. Could you guys offer any advise?"
4a6vuh,9,2016-03-12,25M beginning to have doubts about the career I've wanted for as long as I can remember.,sts816,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4a6vuh/25m_beginning_to_have_doubts_about_the_career_ive/,"For as far back as I can remember, I've been fascinated with space and space exploration. I've always been a bit of a tinkerer as well. Every time I got a new gadget or my family got a new appliance, I had to know how it worked. The idea of using something day in and day out without understanding it seemed abhorrent to me. This was back in middle and high school. So once high school started drawing to a close, I naturally gravitated towards engineering as a college major. Mechanical engineering, to be specific. At this point I was still 110% sure of what I wanted to do. 

Fast forward 4 years and I graduate with good grades but with no internship experience. I naively thought companies would be throwing offers at my left and right because of the ""STEM shortage"". Boy was I wrong. It took me 7 months *after*graduation to finally get a job that paid $28k. Those were an awful 7 months laced with self doubt, second guesses, and worry. I was pissed off at the idea of making $28k with a 3.5 GPA in engineering but my first loan payments were due soon so I took the job. 

I never broke stride in my job search though despite actually having a job at that point. I was applying to better jobs the same afternoon that I accepted that offer. Within the first week of working I knew the job was going to be terrible. Mind numbing, tedious paperwork followed by cleaning up algae build up from the industrial size refrigerators. Not exactly what I had in mind for a first ""career"" move. Not only did the work itself bother me but the structure of employment really got under my skin. I hated punching that time clock every day. I hated that my lunch time was dictated to me like I was 8 years old. I hated being an *employee*. 

After 7 months there, I finally landed what I thought was the best job I could get in town. It wasn't in aerospace like I wanted but my title would be Design Engineer. This would be a real stepping stone to an engineering position with an aerospace company. My long term plans were falling into place. Finally, a real title with real engineering involved. I was psyched. I joyfully gave my 2 weeks notice and loved seeing the look of shock on my manager's face. ""You're leaving?? But why? I can't imagine why! We pay you less than half an entry level engineer's salary to clean water up off the floor!"" Okay, that last part was my own addition. 

I waltz into my new job looking like [this](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2014/sandbox/news/140811/leonardo-dicaprio-1-435.jpg). After a couple months, I drag myself in looking like [this](http://practicallyviral.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DiCaprio-Crying.jpg). Turns out, that job wasn't nearly as amazing as I thought it would be. I'm still doing mind-numbingly simple work that I could teach to a lobotomized, autistic cow. Even worse, I am chained to my desk for 8 hours every. single. day. I stare at the computer screen dreaming up creative ways to kill myself at the office. 

""I could throw myself out the window."" 

""How many pricks to the jugular vein with a thumbtack would it take to kill me?"" 

""Maybe I could drown myself in the toilet...""

That desk is where happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment go to die a slow painful death. At 4:30pm every day, I log my time and every time I punch in that ""8"" into the hours field, I can't help but think that's 8 hours of my life wasted. 8 hours of my life that I'll never get back. 8 hours that I could have spent traveling. 8 hours I could have spent meeting new people. 

Travel. 

Now there's a way to live. Back in school during my last summer I made the easy decision to backpack through Europe for 5 weeks instead of chasing down that elusive internship. Easily the best decision I've ever made. Every day was a new adventure with new people in the hostel, new food, new sites and new experiences. I truly felt like I was living life as it was meant to be experienced. Being rather poor growing up, I had never even been on a plane let alone been out of the country. ""Vacations"" were always to Illinois to hang out with my dad for a week or two. This trip was like nothing I ever experienced and haven't since. There isn't a day that goes by I don't think about that trip. Even now when I'm getting on a plane to visit my mom and sister down in Georgia for holidays, I can't help but be pulled back in time to my first experience in an airport. I absolutely love airports now because they remind me that trip. I love seeing all the interesting people and wondering where they might be going or what adventures they're about to embark on. I love airports because of all the *potential* they have. I could travel to anywhere in the world from an airport and that excites me. The big monitors flash before as I walk to my gate. Los Angeles. Denver. Hong Kong. London. Berlin. Singapore. Munich. 

The problem with travel? It flies in the face of the lifestyle my desired career offers me. 2 weeks of vacation time a year is hardly enough time to see the world. Hell, I need at least a week of that just visiting family for the holidays. That leaves me with at most 5 days to really travel. After seeing 9 countries in 5 weeks, spending 5 days or so in one location won't exactly scratch that itch. Especially when I know it'll be another year before I can hope to do it again. That's the really depressing part. Now it seems my two desires are pitted against in each in my mind. I can pursue some sort of lifestyle that allows me to travel and likely do irreparable damage to the career I've always wanted. Or go down the comfortable, stable path that might get me to designing rockets at some point in the future. 

How do I choose my path?"

I've spent the last 2 years taking an odd collection of classes at community college, working part-time, and dealing with depression.

Over the past few months, I've began programming and I'm interested in it as a career. What I find most appealing is that tech seems like a very meritocratic career. If you can do the work and have demonstrable examples of your skills, you'll find a job. I have around $5,000 saved up and I can live with my parents indefinitely. I've though a lot about studying and programming full time at home, going to meetup groups, building up my resume with projects, finding an unpaid internship, and eventually progressing into a real job. 

Is this possible? Is a degree absolutely required? The reason I'm hesitant to go to college is due to rising tuition costs and a fear of not finding work after college. My parents are too wealthy for me to qualify for loans.

Here are my questions:

1. Is self-studying and creating projects a viable way to progress towards a career?
2. Are companies moving towards requiring degrees from all candidates?
3. What is labor market like? Is there a shortage, surplus, or normal supply of developers? 
4. What does the market look like it'll become? 

Right now my ""plan"" if any is to get much more serious about learning. I have enough money to purchase a variety of courses on the educational sites, along with CS textbooks, and course material.

Assuming, I did work through Computer Science textbooks and the material covered in CS program, what would I be missing? I've taken and passed Calc 2. Is the material in a CS program too difficult to self-study alone?

Thank you for all the help."

I'm in the same boat as many others right now. I graduate this June and don't have a job lined up yet. I should also mention that I HAVE to move by the first week of June. I had an internship at a medium/large logistics company over summer '15. It sounds like they might be interested in hiring, but I have yet to receive an official offer. I don't think they're in a position to to do so when I'm months from being able to start (small dev team, only 4 total devs). I am still in contact with them though since it's in the same building as where I currently work. 

I've sent my resume to 3 other companies as kind of a trial run. So far I've received one rejection, one no answer, and one company asked me to take an online coding challenge after which they rejected me.

I'm pretty sure the only major problem with my resume is that I don't have any personal projects outside of schoolwork. There's two reasons for that: The first one is that I've had to work and support myself through school, so time is in short supply. The other one is, honestly, just a lack of ideas. I can't think of anything within my skill range + time requirements that would impress a potential employer or represent my skill accurately. 

One nice thing is that this coming quarter I only have to attend part time (it's all I need to graduate) so I'll have a little more time. I'm trying to decide if I should throw some kind of project together in the next 2-3 weeks then start applying, or spend that time focusing on getting more applications out. After those 2-3 weeks I will only have two months to get all the way through an interview process and be moved into a new place. During those 2-3 weeks I would be able to work on either for around 30 hours total. Of course a project couldn't amount to much with only 30 hours, but I could sure get a lot of applications out there in the same amount of time.

That's why I come to you guys. I know I'll ultimately have to make the decision myself, but I would value some input. Do you think sacrificing ~30 hours of applications for a small app/project (of recent grad 'skill') would be worth it, or given my small sample application history, do you think I should focus that time on actually getting a job with what I already have?"

I graduated in May of 2015 with a Bachelor's in Finance. I didn't do too much networking but I still have some friends from college that I remained in contact with. Unfortunately, most of them moved out of state. I did not do an internship during college but I held two part time jobs (server in a chain restaurant / front desk at a nursing home) which I currently still have.


When I graduated, I was not in a good place. So many things happened in the span of a few months. My pet had been killed in a car accident, my significant other of 6 years cheated on me, my father was told he might have cancer. I know there was more but those were the main 3 as far as I remember. This all caused me to stop caring about everything and I fell into a deep depression and I half-assed my way out of my final semester.

I did not enjoy my graduation and I did not feel happy with myself whatsoever. I have had low self esteem for quite sometime. But things have changed drastically in a year. I have a new significant other who is amazing and nothing like the last, I have accepted but forgotten the loss of my pet, and my father was told he was cancer free! I started therapy and I am taking medication for depression and also for my lack of focus. My self esteem has also gone up significantly.

I have now decided I have fought my inner demons and I am ready to start the job hunt. My main goal is to get a full time job in anything even remotely related to finance. I am in the NJ/NY area so I know that means a lot of competition but I hope it means a lot of opportunities as well.

I need advice on where to start, and most importantly, what skills I need to sharpen up on in Finance. I need to know what is mainly expected of me in interviews so that I can refresh my memory. I still have most of my textbooks, and slides given to me by professors that I can review. I wish I had not taken a year off but things happen and better late than never, I guess.

Thank you very much for anyone who has any advice for me and I apologize for the long post. "

I'm thinking of applying for jobs in the States as well as for a Masters in my final year of undergrad. My end goal is to end up in industry in the US at a decent company.

My questions are

1. What's the absolute best school in Canada for a CS Masters? I'm currently torn between Waterloo and Toronto.

2. Should I do a course-based Masters or a research-based Masters? Also, what would be the implications regarding funding?

3. Is it very competitive to get a Masters at a top school? My grades are decent (mostly 80s, some 90s, few high 70s) but my resume is a bit lacking: no internships (yet), one research assistant job remotely related to CS (no publications), a couple minor personal projects.

4. Is it worth doing a Masters in the US? For a Canadian, it is much cheaper to do a Masters in Canada, about 1/4th of the cost. Then again, can schools like Waterloo/Toronto/McGill hold a candle against CMU/Stanford/Berkeley/UIUC?

5. How competitive is it to get into a top American school? My GPA currently is about 3.6/4.0 but I will probably be able to pull it up in the last two years if I focus on it."

I work for a small web company(3 devs, 1 sys admin, 1 IT manager). We work with Java, PHP and SQL databasese and we've recently taken on a third year college student as a dev intern(this is part of their course).

We weren't expecting the intern to do much, just give him some relatively simple stuff that the main team doesn't have time for. One of these small projects we gave him involved some looping and integer comparison and at the end we wanted a boolean returned. This task was really to find out what level he was at(silly management didn't bother with a technical interview in any way). 

So it turns out that the poor guy has nearly zero coding skills or logic. Fine, I thought maybe he just needs to brush up on the basics so I find it some youtube tutorials to follow and sign him up for code academy. So over the course of a few weeks he completes the tutorials and I told him to have another bash at the project we got him to do before. Well same story again, the basics just didn't stick and he doesn't really understand how to debug.

I'de love to be able to sit down with him for a few weeks and teach him some stuff one on one but I can't with my workload. So I'm at a loss on how to get this guy moving forward.

Any ideas?"

A month later the kid I sold it to decided to smoke on the bus and ratted on me. He also claimed what he was smoking came from me, which is bullshit (noone saves a 5 sack for a month) . He told me everything he gets comes from his brother. So he's trying to save his own ass while screwing me over. When I was confronted by the police I originally pleaded the fifth but they kept pushing and I gave in.

Back at the beginning of February I was indicted as a Juvenile. I went to my pre-trial friday and was told that I had to deny the charges till I get a public defender since I'm a minor and it's a felony charge.

My first question is, since I couldn't confess in court till I have a lawyer, can they still use the confession the police officers obtained as evidence?

Also I'm pretty sure that the kid wasn't smoking what came from me, but the court might be using it as evidence thinking it came from me. There were also 2 no contact orders, one for the kid who was smoking, and another for a loudmouth(highly uncredible) on my bus. So I'm guessing these are their witnesses.

The charge didn't include the fact that it was on school grounds (thankfully) which would've made it an F4 instead of an F5. My magistrate put me on verbal house arrest till my next court date.

I'm highly successful for my age, with more certifications in my vocational programming class than anyone else. I have a Government internship and a job at a Pizza Shop. My grades are pretty well, though they took a hit after I faced a 21 day expulsion and ended up having to retake my economics class. I'm a senior in highschool.

Ohio has a mandatory license suspension for all drug charges and I'm trying my best to avoid that. I figured my two options are to either fight it, or convince the prosecutor to maybe change the charge to disorderly conduct considering how small the amount in question was and whether it's really worthy a felony charge.

So my two questions are, would the confession be able to be used as evidence since I didn't have a lawyer and am a minor, and would trying to get a plea deal and getting it changed to disorderly conduct be too far fetched?

I'm a good kid who made a dumb mistake. I just want to be able to move on with my life and put this crappy phase of my life behind me."

So this started back in February.  I opened dialogue with my landlord about the possibility of me moving because of an internship, and she finally told me that the condo is already being put up for sale.  I have a month to month lease so this immediately got my concerned that the condo could sell and I would be without a home and have to scramble to find a place to live under no notice.

Landlord went away on vacation, claims to have not gotten any of my messages or e-mails that I will be giving notice and moving as of April 1 or April 15th, whatever was more convenient for them.  Landlord claims that because they did not receive my notice until after it was under 2 months that they wanted to hold me responsible for 2 months.  They claim that earlier conversations in text do not constitute as notice to them.

I explained how I cannot be held responsible for them going away on vacation for nearly a month and being unable to get in contact with, and I made every effort to contact them.  

We made an arrangement where I would leave my 52 inch TV here for their daughter to have, in exchange for:

1) rent owed for April 1st until April 15th
2) being let out of my lease as of April 15th.

My lease has a clause that states

""Either party may cancel or change terms of this agreement upon 60 days written notice. The notice period may be lengthened or shortened by written agreement, but no less than 7 days"".

As this agreement was via e-mail and she offered those terms, I began making my moving plans with April 15th as my end of lease term.

On a side note, the realtors have been wanting to show the place under no proper notice.  Originally they were coming and going as you please and forcing me to leave the property including one day that I was in bed ill with a 103 fever and unable to talk.  I started insisting on requesting 24 hours written notice.

My landlord comes to me yesterday and tells me that by me requesting 24 hours notice, I am causing problems and that I am just looking for drama.  I tell the landlord I have a lease and that affords me some rights in Ontario, and it isn't unreasonable to expect 24 hours notice.

The end result of this conversation is that the landlord says she will no longer abide by our agreement in e-mail and she wants me to be gone by March 31st (just over two weeks) and that I am not a lease holder.  I have a ""room rental agreement"" only which lets them do whatever they want and if I don't like it, too bad.

There was even an implied threat that if I insist on 24 hours notice that I can be removed at their leisure.

I am trying my best to leave by April 1st anyways but they are insisting on the end of the month but I have classes on April 1st that I cannot miss.  I e-mailed my professors and I hope that some arrangement can be made but not sure.  

Does anyone know my rights?  How can I force them to abide by the original agreement that was made?  Am I allowed to enforce 24 hours notice before they can enter my room? Who should I contact?

At this point I am fed up with being walked over by landlords.  They say that I am causing them problems by wanting proper notice and that I am flipping out for no reason and that they are within their right to show it however they want and that it is apart of daily life that I just have to put up with.

They are also excessively showing and requesting me to be gone often.  How excessive would constitute harassment?  What kind of  'reasonable enjoyment of premises' am I entitled to?"

I'm happy to have a job, but the pay and responsibility ceiling is low, and I'm not sure where I can go from here (other city jobs that is). I have made good contacts with several department heads, but it seems like I'd still be looking at entry level positions/excluded from many jobs.

I do not want to go back to school for another full degree. Would a GIS certificate open up career options for me? I just want something that I can progress in and make decent money and not feel limited. I very briefly did some GIS work (2 days) in one of my internships and really enjoyed it.

Any advice for going from customer service to GIS/planning/stormwater/etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

4adbq3,3,2016-03-14,Trouble finishing CS degree... switch to B.S Interdiscplinary just so I can graduate?,jarex13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4adbq3/trouble_finishing_cs_degree_switch_to_bs/,"I'm a ""senior"" at the University of Central Florida. I transferred here from a different school where I was about a year and a half away from graduating, but for personal reasons I transferred to UCF and due to different programs and credit loss, it'll take me another 2 years to graduate the CS program. 

I have debilitating mental health issues that make school difficult and frustrating and I worry about my ability to complete the program before I run out of money. While I have difficulty with school, I have taken a wide range of courses and am a decent programmer with experience in multiple languages. 

I've worked two QA testing internships and have a decent amount of personal projects. If I take an easier route and finish an interdisciplinary degree, just to finally get a BS, will it be difficult for me to get a job and start my career? Could I potentially get a masters degree eventually? Or should I just suck it up and try to finish CS despite how much I'm struggling?"

I am in third year at university as a foreign student and do not qualify for good stuff like maintenance loans. I am in UK. The problem is that my parents are not rich, I quit my job to focus on my studies and banked on getting an internship but it seems like I am out of luck. At this rate, I will run out of money in 7 months from now. I would consider getting a loan from a bank but it is impossible because you need some income to qualify. Private loan companies are crazy once you do the math and see the debt spiral one would go into.

I am looking for options on how to leverage CS and programming skills to earn some money. I was thinking of freelancing, I need roughly 650 pounds a month to pay my bills. I need some realistic advice on how to not go bankrupt in the middle of my 4th year and whether it is realistic to learn skills to earn that much each month from freelancing or other means(I can't think of any others)."
4ae7jq,6,2016-03-14,"My first ""career"" out of college -- is it time for me to jump ship? Advice?",throwaway402314,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4ae7jq/my_first_career_out_of_college_is_it_time_for_me/,"I apologize in advance because I feel like this post is seeking very obvious advice, but this is my first ""real"" job I've had and  I find myself apprehensive to leave because I've come to establish such good relationships with my co-workers and I'm loyal to the company. To make a long story short, my good friend got me a job at this company, his father's company, three years ago when I was struggling to find any non minimum wage work after graduating college (IT field here). I worked my way up from being an intern, to hourly pay, to a full-time salary position. I'm really grateful to have had this opportunity and that my boss valued my hard work enough to promote me and give me several raises.
 

 
Now, the bad:
 
 
I've had at least a half dozen paychecks bounce in the past two years. In the past year, in particular, the company has had a hard time with revenue, and I've had many checks come in several days late, bounce, or get put on hold for long periods of time. Sometimes a check will be just going through finally when I get the next pay period's check. I have to pay all of my bills early because I'm never sure if the next paycheck will go through. I can't really make much headway with taxes and paying off credit card debt because it's tough to create a budget when I'm unsure when exactly funds will be available. Also, for the first two and a half years, my boss was paying all his employees as contractors (1099), which I'm pretty sure is illegal. When the last couple of checks have bounced, he's just claimed that there was no reason that it should've bounced, but that he'll send another one (I work remotely, out of state). No apology. He also once flat out lied about sending one. Today I got word that one of our chief managers quit, and apparently nobody has heard from the company's accountant in about ten days. There is more but not entirely related to me so I won't go in to that stuff. No healthcare, no benefits, though I do have flexible hours and can work from home full-time.
 
 
Wow, writing this out really reinforces the idea that I need to jump ship ASAP. It's a little tough, however, as I'm loyal to my friend, love the people I work with, and there are some really good perks. However, I think my boss leverages the benefits to cushion all of the negatives"

I'm wondering if I should finish a udacity nanodegree and go through their recruitment channels?

I'm currently a junior in college with a PM internship lined up at a top company in SF. Last summer, I was an SDE intern at an eCommerce company and this year, I'm an SDE intern part-time while attending school at a local startup. 

Ideally, I'd like to go full-time at the company I'm interning at this summer, especially since I'd like a career in PM and have no interest in furthering my CS knowledge. However, my dad urges me to apply for my school's 4+1 BS/MS combined program, which would require me to stay an additional year to get my MS degree. He claims that an MS will allow me to, over time, receive quicker promotions and essentially climb the ladder faster.

What are all of your thoughts on this? I'd definitely like to be VP/SVP level one day, so would an MS in CS help me achieve this, or will I be alright with a BS? I go to a decent engineering college (top 10 public university in USA).

On a side-note, I'm also considering potentially doing an MBA sometime later down the road (5-10 years). "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How reliable would you say the salary data from job hunting sites is?  I've had a couple applications where the interviewer was surprised at my asking salary.  I based the numbers on local comps from those sites.  On a related note, what percent pay increase do you see people ask for and receive most often?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zidex?context=5)|The data is fairly reliable. We often have our customers do some background research on glassdoor.com or salary.com to understand the scope of opportunities that are available to them.
 |Having too few data points (e.g., less than 5)
 |Have a very wide range (auto-red flag)
 |A salary in a very different location for the same job (often salaries account for cost of living multiples).
 |The second answer - there's huge variability depending on the situation, industry, type of company, years of experience, etc. People asking for raises within the same company often have to take into account company wide caps (e.g., some companies put a blanket moratorium on raises in difficult years) and try to negotiate hitting the top of that cap (e.g., 3% for some companies).
 |When it comes to switching jobs, we've seen people get a 100% raise and other people choose to take a pay-cut as they want to work in a industry that they personally care about more. Sometimes people move with the same pay to another place where the chances of a successful long term career are higher. The rule of thumb here is to keep assessing opportunities on a regular basis to make sure you're not being paid significantly below market wage for the role/responsibility you have!
[I'm in high school right now and have vague ideas of what I want to do,  sciencey spacey stuff,  but I also want to do other things.  My question,  is how important,  if I do switch careers eventually,  is it to start studying and working early in a field to actually thrive in it?  How easy is it to make up for education and experience gaps in these highly technical careers if you have experience in another? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zi4ll?context=5)|First of all, its great to hear about your interest in sciencey spacey stuff. Kudos to you for trying to get a head start on the process!
 |It's totally fine to have a diversity of interests. You should use your time over the next few years to experiment/learn about these both through academics and practical application (e.g., internships). That will help you narrow down your options once you have to make a formal commitment.
 |If you're not sure about what to do - think about going to a college that has some level of flexibility with choosing your major (e.g., a liberal arts university)
 |Many highly technical careers explicitly ask for undergraduate (and often graduate) degrees in the sciences. It's very difficult to transition into them unless you have that experience. Research some jobs you might want to do in the long term and look at the requirements so that you're not caught off guard. It's generally easier switching careers from a technical track to a non-techinical one.
 |It's often possible to switch careers laterally from one technical position to another. Besides that, other things you pick up and demonstrate (e.g., team-work, communication skills) are also highly transferrable 
[What do you look for most in a candidate when considering them for a job? Specifically, what are some universal tips on how to improve my resume or interview skills?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgs1v?context=5)|Try to be action oriented, displaying what you accomplished, in quantitative terms when possible. Each bullet points should point towards a specific achievement / skill   Make sure your resume is targeted for the type of job you're applying for. Usually that means finding a group of opportunities that are similar and ensuring your resume checks the boxes for these  Practice is really important for interviewing. We see peoples interviewing skills getting better and better as they go for more opportunities. If you haven't interviewed in a while, find some people who will offer to do a 'mock' interview to get you back in the zone.
[I'd like to hear this as well. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0znm2h?context=5)|Hi IWorkedForThatPlace, clever name!
 |There are two answers for this, depending on the root of your unhappiness.
 |If you are unhappy with the role function (what you do day to day), we would recommend finding opportunities where your expertise can be used to open new markets and challenging growth opportunities. For example, we recently saw an IT industry professional who managed to break out by becoming an expert onboarding new clients across multiple international cities -- this revitalized his career and he is now at a corporate strategy level at his company.
 |The #1 source of unhappiness is usually due to a flaw in your boss, whether its style, empathy, reasonableness, etc. Often we tell jobseekers looking for a happy switch it is less important the type of department you are in, but more how you mesh with the team and how human your manager is.
 |Best of luck!
[Haven't worked for years in a proper job that I'd care to list on my resume.  How would I account for the gap in years? should I just lie or tell half truths?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zhrg4?context=5)|Hard to tell without the specifics of where you've been working, but one important point: Never lie on your resume - it's increasingly easy for potential employers to do background checks, reach out to previous employers to confirm what you did, etc. Even if you get a job and start working, and are later exposed, it might lead to termination of employment.
[I don't need to work, but I really want to.  How do I account for those lost years on a CV or resume - especially if I want to change careers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zjsf0?context=5)|We also see people who dip their toes in the water by initially taking on part time / contract based work. That also helps build a track record of recent work experience on the resume that makes the leap more manageable from both sides.
[Any recommendations as to how get as many informational interviews as possible? Or how do you go about expanding you network.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zk0mc?context=5)|Hi -- making sure we understand -- the informational interview you mean are phone calls to learn more about a specific job function?  Just like in business, warm leads are best. Acquaintances of friends and family are usually more than happy to spend 15 minutes on the phone with a recent college grad, especially since mentorship usually feels worthwhile for experienced professionals. Make sure you are professionally searchable, ie a LinkedIn profile, academic CV, or personal website that someone can learn about you before agreeing to speak with you.
[Question: I'm working on a portfolio. How would be the best way to showcase my photography (few hundred photos\), my related video content (I have quite a bit of notable content\), and my outside related content (filming weddings and other celebrations, etc\) in a way that would be most attractive to an employer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgu4m?context=5)|Order your most recognizable / brand name / corporate work in the beginning, and save specific work you are especially proud of for around the 80% mark. Essentially you are looking for the reviewer to have two aha moments so they can better categorize you and describe you to peers -- one where they say ah okay this person is ABC, an XYZ music company professional, and then skimming -- oooh this looks great -- memorable impression.
[If i am going in for an interview at a really really relaxed and layed back startup, should I still be dressing up in a suit and tie?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zofov?context=5)|No. Do some research on the company, and if it seems like everyone including the senior management are very casually dressed, you wearing a suit might signal the lack of a fit with the company culture (even though it could be really far from the truth!).  If you're not 100% sure, it's always better to err on the side of being slightly over-dressed. For start-up roles, for example, we often see people coming into the interviews wearing plain jeans or khakis, with a tucked-in, button down shirt (for guys).  In any case, you should still be smartly dressed, with simple, clean/crisp clothes.
[What is the absolute dumbest/stupidest thing you've noticed in someone's resume?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgwjj?context=5)|There are some silly mistakes that could be corrected very quickly. These include having a very unprofessional e-mail address (something like sexyguy69@gmail.com). It's the first thing that people will see on your resume and having an address like that sends across a bad signal. The other common mistake is leaving placeholder text in the summary section (e.g., loren ipsum). 
[Do you ever get people that hand you resumes that are grossly, almost hilariously, overqualified for the job. (Server at my old Waffle House had a masters in engineering from Georgia Tech\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zgwjj?context=5)|We get that sometimes - under-employment is a significant issue in America. Our goal is to help people who are in that situation find the best position for them that they would also be personally excited about.
[Honestly speaking, how much does (successful\) overseas work help a resume? In my case, as an Australian working in IT in London on a 2 year visa and are doing quite well, I'd like to make that a standout point when I do return back home. Is there a 'best' way of doing this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zh0r4?context=5)|Research potential employers to find those that will reward you for overseas experience (we've given examples of a couple above)
 |Make sure you indicate the location of your employment on the resume prominently. It'll be self explanatory that you were in London.
[Thanks for the reply! So for it to actually make a difference, I should make sure the future employers values overseas work, how would one go about finding that out? Just the simple question? Or just hope that it's something that stands out and I get asked about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zirhu?context=5)|Sure - whenever you're on your next job search, you should be able to research that point.
[I know Unilever is a big one for it, my SO works for a subsidiary company of Unilever and it's taken her a long way in her career. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zirhu?context=5)|Generally speaking, multinationals that have offices in 10+ countries value international experience and mobility as they often have to incentivize staff to move abroad or manage people with a variety of backgrounds. Regardless, it should be prominently positioned in your resume!  
[How important is the length if CV/resume? Long or short? Being student and soon in job markets (IT/ICT\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4adpkw/iama_professional_career_advisorsresume_writers/d0zol0f?context=5)|If you're a student, absolutely keep it to **one page**. If you have a portfolio/github profile, you can put a link to your projects as well.

4aeszz,2,2016-03-14,Internship Dilemma,MiltownVet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4aeszz/internship_dilemma/,"Hey there,
I'm a sophomore computer science major and was recently given offers to intern at two companies this summer. One company specializes in VR and the pay is better, but they didn't test my technical skills and I'm worried I won't be able to contribute or handle tasks given to me if I'm not familiar with a specific language.

On the other hand, the other offer I received the company tested my technical skills and understand my skill level but the pay is a little less. Their code is mainly Java based and that was my first language and the language I feel most comfortable with.

What should I do Reddit? Accept the more exciting internship that pays more and run the risk of not being able to perform, or accepting the internship where I will be able to hopefully contribute more (at least at first). "
4aevaw,1111,2016-03-14,"TIFU by asking if, “Everything was kosher”",Goddab,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4aevaw/tifu_by_asking_if_everything_was_kosher/,"After weeks and weeks of going back and forth on a quote for a client, I sent an email to my sales representative (we will call her Sue) saying, “I will be meeting with the client tomorrow to go over the final plan and make sure everything is kosher.” Thinking that my work was sorted for the morning (it was supposed to be a slow day) I closed my laptop and went to go get a tea. 

&amp;nbsp;

My phone rings. It's Sue. I answer, “Hi Sue, what can I-” and then she starts.

&amp;nbsp;

“You didn't tell me you were on Kosher! This is a disaster! No one told me you were on Kosher! You have missed all these meetings already! And we only have two weeks until Kosher...” See, our sales representatives have a lot of different clients and projects on their plates at any one time, so they have a tendency to shorten the project names to single words. In this case, I had forgotten that 'Kosher' refers to a major project which they have been working on for over a year with. But not my department. We have nothing to do with 'Kosher'. Ooops.

&amp;nbsp;

Sue continues for about five minutes until she finally has to take a breath (honestly I was impressed with her apparent lung capacity) and I jump in with, “You misunderstood, I'm not on Kosher, I was just asking if everything with MY quote is kosher.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Well of course YOUR quote doesn't have anything to do with Kosher. Why would it? Not EVERYTHING is Kosher,” she snapped back.

&amp;nbsp;

“I know that not everything is for the Kosher event Sue, it's a saying. 'Is everything kosher?' is just a way of asking if everything is all right. So, is everything all right with my quote?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Uh, I haven't looked at it, but I guess it probably is... So you aren't on Kosher?”

&amp;nbsp;

“No, I am not. Is there anything else I can help you wi-” and the line cuts. With a big sigh I get up to go make my tea. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now making tea does not take very long, so I was surprised to see someone waiting outside my office upon my return. It is one of the interns (Danny) holding what looked like the King James Bible, only printed out on office paper and put into a D-ring binder. “Can I help you bud?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Here is your copy of the Kosher briefs. I know there are a lot of them so I hole punched them and put them all in the binder in correct order from oldest to newest...” Danny trails off, no doubt seeing the look of despair on my face.

&amp;nbsp;

“I'm not on Kosher. It was a misunderstanding.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh. But I was told you were... what should I do with this then?” Danny asked, looking a little depressed that all of his hard work was for naught.

&amp;nbsp;

“Recycle it.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh. Okay... but they just sent out a memo about wasting printer paper and if my manager sees this in the recycling bin...” His voice trails off.

&amp;nbsp;

“Fine. Give it to me and I will hold on to it until Kosher is over, and then get rid of it.” I take the binder out of Danny's hands, and sit down at my desk. As I open up my laptop, wondering where I am supposed to hide this enormous binder full of briefs for a project that I am not working on, I notice that my email notification is going ballistic. Ding. Ding. DING. I open the first one, without really looking at the heading wondering what just went and lit itself on fire and why I needed to know so urgently about it...

&amp;nbsp;

Someone went and added me to the Kosher mailing list. Great. Hundreds of emails are coming in. Everything that has ever been sent as part of this group mailing list is coming into my mail box. I call IT. “Hey guys, can I be taken off of the Kosher mailing list? I'm not actually part of Kosher.”

&amp;nbsp;

“BUT THEY JUST SAID YOU NEEDED TO BE URGENTLY ADDED TO KOSHER. TELL SALES THAT THEY NEED TO SORT THEIR SHIT OUT BEFORE THEY CALL US AGAIN!” Click. IT and sales get into it on a regular basis. This response was basically what I expected. But hey, the emails have stopped, so that is something I guess. The phone rings... Just dreading what is about to come, I pick up.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hello...?”

&amp;nbsp;

It is my boss (Mary), who has been trying to sleep in this morning because I was supposed to be holding down the fort on a slow morning. “What the hell kind of hornets nest did you kick?” Mary says, in a bemused and slightly sleepy tone of voice. I explained everything that had happened and I swear she did not stop laughing for at least thirty seconds. “So it is all sorted then?” Mary asks.

&amp;nbsp;

“I think so?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Good.” she replied before hanging up, no doubt to go make some coffee and start work on deleting the few hundred emails that I had inadvertently had forwarded to her inbox.

&amp;nbsp;

I take my first sip of tea. It is cold. Joy. Ding goes my laptop. Another email. From the head of the sales department this time and it has been sent to the whole company:

&amp;nbsp;

“In the future, we would prefer if people would refrain from using the phrase 'is everything kosher' in official correspondence as it may lead to some confusion.”

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR I used what I thought was a very common phrase to ask if everything was okay, which set off a firestorm of emails and phone calls, pissed off multiple departments and woke up my boss on her day off all before 8.30 for a project that my department is not working on.

4affzw,1,2016-03-14,"I always have these crazy ideas for games, but get frustrated when I don't get results.",HappyZombies,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4affzw/i_always_have_these_crazy_ideas_for_games_but_get/,"I like to think big but I feel like maybe I'm thinking too big for game dev. I will give a little background on my programming. 

I have been programming for over a year now, I primarily do web development ( I am actually currently in an web dev internship), but I also do some C++ on the side (I really like this language). I also do a little Java and Python here and there.

During my time of learning, I downloaded Unity and Unreal Engine (which I preferred Unreal so I'd like to work with that), while doing tutorials online I would have these crazy ideas on the incredible game I wanted to create, I entered in the ""I want to get this over with so I can make my game already!"", but then, I'd get frustrated because I didn't know what I was doing. And as such, I would get turned off by game dev. So I stuck to web dev because I was a bit better at it. 

I don't plan to study/major/become a game developer. I would like this to be a hobby of some sort and stick to web development. I just would like to make simple fun games so I can have some fun with programming. 

I find it difficult to take it easy and process it all. I know game dev is crazy big and all that it takes, so I'm asking if perhaps anyone has some kind of guide on how to tackle this. I know all the ins and outs about programming (granted I don't know much about animation, and 3D graphics/2D sprites). I know I want to aim at something, but I don't want to aim too high and then be disappointed in myself.

(Hopeful, yet lost Engineering student.)",ArF995,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4ag5dj/how_can_i_change_and_become_the_person_i_want_to/,"First off, I'd like to say that I've just made my account minutes before posting this, for the purpose of posting this. I want this to be something I want to commit to, and I don't want it to be a throwaway account.

&amp;nbsp;

Also I'm not really sure if I should be posting here or elsewhere, because I have a mixture things I want to deal with, not serious enough to post on r/Depression, but I'm not happy enough to just shrug things off.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

***Anyway***, here's the text wall.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, about me. I am the son of a single mother, (my dad left us when I was young) it hasn't affected me adversely in any big way but my relationship with my mother has been difficult at times. You could say I was a bit of a trouble-child, nothing serious like drugs, running away etc. but I would be quite lazy, sometimes disobedient, and generally a pain in the ass. My childhood has obviously shaped who I have grown to become now (still pretty lazy).

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I am 20, and I have fairly recently withdrawn from university to return in January next year (to sit my 3rd year second semester again). I study Chemical Engineering, and though I am really passionate about it, I doubt if I am capable and I sometimes have quite low self-esteem about the whole thing - I always seem to be sceptical. 

&amp;nbsp;

Last year, I knew I was at a disadvantage and I wanted to take time out of university before my 3rd year, (honours). Now, my mum is a very stereotypical Iranian parent. As long as I can remember she has always been pushy about my studies and about being successful, and this has and still does put a lot of pressure on me. She insisted that I stay in education, so instead of taking time out before 3rd year, I ended up having to leave half-way through. This was mainly due to the stress, depression, and a fear of failing my whole 3rd year. At the worst of times, I would think about what I might end up doing to myself if I failed my second semester, or what I would do with my lfie. I didn't do very well in the first semester (B,D,E,F were my grades) and I was constantly worried - I still am - about my ability and grades.

&amp;nbsp;

Throughout my university experience, I have focussed so much on doing well, but rarely actually been able to apply myself properly. It’s caused me a lot of stress, and I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much. At the time of withdrawing I realised I had no hobbies, no close friends, and that nothing made me happy. Other than that I also feel remarkably out of place, I’ve been told I’m mature for my age, but I’m pretty sure people just say that – I don’t feel mature enough. I hate the student culture, and (mainly up hear in Scotland) the obsession with drinking. Sometimes I feel like I’d fair better in some other time; I was reading “Surely your joking Mr Feynman” and he was discussing his university days and I just feel like these days we don’t have these cliques that push each other to succeed and the fraternities and traditions. I thought university would be older, more mature, and full of people who want to make something of themselves. But it just feels like it’s mainly fully of 20 somethings that don’t quite know what they’re doing with their lives (me included). I know I want to do engineering, and my dream is that I could make a difference in the world somehow (Most of my friends are just in it for the money.) But, again I just don’t know if I can do it, or what I’d do or want to do otherwise.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I am currently living at home with my mother, trying to study, and develop my skills; find an internship and a part time job, among other things. I have a friend who is in industry (he can’t give me a job trust me) and he advised me that taking a year out is very likely going to be interpreted badly, by future employers etc. so told me to keep in mind that a year out could be destructive.

&amp;nbsp;

Since last year I’ve tried to keep a journal, and I have plenty of really good plans but I need to put them into motion. I hope I can keep up with my studies and try to become more knowledgeable and capable (is there a sub for this kind of improvement?) I also want to try to take up some hobbies and sports (I’d be open to suggestions, right now I have an Arduino and I’m messing around with that).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



**tl/dr:**

&amp;nbsp;

**I hate who I am now, want to be better (more productive, happier). Love engineering though worried I can't do it. How do I change it all?**


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


I know I cannot just get a shitty part-time job, and do some resits, and return back in January, same-old same-old. I know I need to change, and become more mature and capable. But sometimes I just don't know how, or if I can be capable. I need to change, r/selfimprovement. I need to become the type of person Does anyone have similar experience, or is anyone in the same situation?

&amp;nbsp;

I’m open to any questions if I haven’t filled in the gaps.

I am literally blasting out my resume to everything I come across and I've had 3 interviews which have led to naught.

Also, where does the desire for highly intellectual work fit into the desire for entrepreneurship?",blastbking,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ag7te/how_do_i_find_a_job_that_isnt_boring_also_where/,"The other day I was reading the [Do CS Careers get any better?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4a3bdo/do_cs_jobs_get_any_better/) thread and I could really empathize with OP. I'm a junior in college pursing a BS in CS and I've done a bunch of software internships and in every one of them, I've felt somewhat bored or otherwise not intellectually stimulated. I think maybe it was that I felt I didn't need to go to college to just glue together some APIs, and I was craving an experience closer to what I've had with classes (enjoyed working with computer vision, machine learning, and robotics).

Realizing that I might need to get an advanced degree to get a job where I apply concepts from these fields, I started getting involved with research at school. I have some iffy grades on my transcript from underestimating certain classes though, and poor grades in math classes, so I have doubts about my ability to get into a good graduate program in robotics. If possible, I'd like to skip the graduate school part and go straight to industry, but I'm not sure how to do this.

1. Can anyone here offer advice on how to find a job I'll be interested in without getting a graduate degree?
2. If I do need a graduate degree, can I get a good job in robotics without a degree from a top program?

I have the option of working at a pure SE team at Google this summer, or staying at school to do research. Part of me really wants to be an entrepreneur, and part of me really wants to work on things that are intellectually stimulating (rather than the next ['sugar water'](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/25/sugar-water/) company). Once I thought an ideal scenario would be to complete a PhD and start a company based off my research, but after a VC told me this was incredibly uncommon I took a step back and reevaluated this. I think the ideal scenario would have been working at or founding a company like [Cruise](http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/) but I unfortunately was rejected.

3. What should I be considering when picking between these two choices for the summer? Which would you pick in my situation?
4. I like research and work that's more intellectual (vs rote software engineering, which I'm good at, but is dry). I also really, really want to make my own startup. What do I do? Is getting a PhD mutually exclusive with founding a successful startup?

Also, [here's my resume](http://imgur.com/MtUU9rP), I'd appreciate any feedback."

I'll have a degree in Finance and MIS from a decent university in canada (top 15). I know some basic coding (mostly web programming) and some SQL, I'm familiar with statistical analysis and I have a good fundamental knowledge of finance (CFA level 1 cursus basically). My only ""real"" work experience outside odd jobs has been doing an IT internship at one of the big banks in Canada.

I'm fluent in french and english altho I don't know where my french skills could be an asset in the US. I'm often told my english is strong but I do have an accent and my vocabulary is less rich than in french. Would that be a problem ?

Other than that I'm fairly familiar with American culture through media, internet and geographical proximity.

I don't have much money but I do graduate with no debt.

I've heard it was best to get sponsored by an employer but I'm unsure if american employers would be willing to recruit someone from a foreign country with no experience or little technical knowledge. I'm not sure how I should proceed.

Prospect of full time in 3-6 months. I have seen the other posts about the law and all that, I will be working on an app they have in the play store, updating it to a newer version that is already on iOS. So it will probably benefit the company, and me with experience I guess building Android apps with other developers. 

I have already worked an unpaid internship with this same example for 6 months while I was still in school a year ago. Was basically promised the same, and when the time came(finished building a signup app for their service and released into store) they said they really liked me and wanted to hire me and all of a sudden stopped communication with me right after that. Now do I do the same again and risk it with this company?  This would be my second unpaid/below minimum wage offer I'll be receiving since job searching in January. Is this becoming the norm?

I am 26 and here is a little back story. 

I worked as a Business Systems Analyst for 2 years before my company decided to outsource most of IT.  I applied for a lot of jobs and finally got an offer for a QA Analyst position.  I was hesitant at first but I took the job because of good pay and I needed work.  I've only been in this QA position for 2 months but I already don't like it for several reasons.

The manager that hired me is no longer my manager.  The training has been non-existent which sucks because this is my first QA job.  I am not good with coding but I know enough to use Selenium Webdriver in Java.  Thing is, I realized I don't really want to be in this position and I feel like the longer I stay here the harder it will be to get out.

I feel like I would enjoy Sys Admin but I don't think anybody would take a look at me for this position.  I have worked computer support/IT for the past 8 years in some fashion.  I worked a year in computer repair, a 3 month internship in network admin, 1.5 years as a computer tech for a college, another 1 year internship, and a year on a help desk is included there.   

Could I get a Sys Admin job without getting certs?  I really don't have the desire to study anymore after college.  I know that's lazy of me but I feel like my work experience should be and to get me something better. EDIT:  to clarify the ""not wanting to study"" comment I meant I coming home from work to study a book for months. I have a family and not sure where I'd find the time.  I know u need to keep up with tech but most of that can be done on the job.


 Is there anything I can do besides certs?  Is there another position I should be looking for that doesn't deal with a lot of coding?

Also, would it be beneficial to talk to my manager about this?  I don't know if I can ask to pursue a different position in IT within the company after only 2 months and I don't want to let on I may look fit other opportunities."

Dear Human Resources Team,

The intent of this letter is to express my interest in the Marketing and Public Relations Internship. With my past experience in marketing and desire to expand on it, genuine passion for working with people, and my technical and organizational skills, I feel that I possess many qualities that would make me a valuable addition to (place)'s staff.

With several years of experience in leadership positions, I am a team player, effective organizer, and have education and experience in marketing that I seek to build upon. During my time as the Museum Manager at the (museum), I have strengthened my ability to market and sell our merchandise to individual visitors as well as plan events and organize tours. I am confident in my abilities and possess sound judgment as well as an instant connection to people.

My strongest points are my creative abilities and understanding how people work and what they are receptive to, not only from a marketing standpoint but from a persuasive standpoint, as well. At (museum), I also managed its Facebook page. Through creative tactics, I increased the likes on the page by 17.5% in under four months. At (newspaper), I manage the Twitter account and have increased tweet impressions by 3,300% in one month. On top of creative marketing tactics, I have a crucial eye for design as I have been an avid drawer who designs on the side for the past 11 years.

As a final note, if it is of any concern, I do have housing for over the summer in the (internship) area despite that I am based in (home state and school state). I look forward to providing more information in an interview.

Sincerely,

(my name)"

I graduated with a degree in history about 9 years ago. I fell for the whole, ""You can get a degree in anything"" bs. Well after working a few crappy jobs, I returned for my masters and I told myself that I would only go back if it was deemed ""useful""

I was looking for something that I was truly interested in. Careers that attract me are non profit work, government and teaching. The problem with teaching though is that it seems hard to find a job OUTSIDE of teaching once you have been doing it for a long time, especially with a history degree. Due to the impracticality of my degree, I really do not like my bachelors degree. 

I decided that I wanted to work in non profit management or government work or even management in the private sector if they will have me. The issue that I am having is that everyone that I know with a business degree works a decent white collar office job(which I like) and it seems a lot of liberal arts degrees do not. It makes me feel like I majored in the wrong thing at the bachelors level. Every liberal arts grad that I know is practically doing either retail jobs, working where I work at(call center eww) or teaching. 

My options that I have considered are to either 1. Go back for a certificate, there is one that is a grad certificate in non profit management at my local university. I could use the internship there to network my way in. 2. Go for another masters in management or try an MBA(I am not too good at math though) or 3. Try another online bachelor's degree in corporate communications(more useful).

One person once asked me what my ""dream job"" was. My dream job would be to either get a Phd in Political Science or Public Administration, but I have NO SUPPORT from family at all, so if I did that, and still couldn't find a job, then I would be REALLY SCREWED. So what advice can you guys offer me?

I am here because I am a college student looking for a better-paying job before I apply for graduate school. As of now, I'm working this crappy, fast-food job that does not provide me with any relevant skills whatsoever. 

**Some background information about me:** I'm a college junior pursuing a degree in mathematics (concentration in computation) and a minor in computer science. I am in the top 15% of my class and am also the *Vice President - Public Relations* at my local Toastmasters group. As for previous employment: two crappy fast-food gigs (one in high school and my current one) and this unrelated manual labor job. There are also some other things that I have not put on my resume because they were from high school (on golf team, was a section leader in the marching band and in the National Honor Society to name a few things). As for skills, I am proficient with MS Office, Java, Python, some basic HTML and can type 93 words per minute.

4al4ih,0,2016-03-15,So I lied about something on my resume,imlegitscrewed,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4al4ih/so_i_lied_about_something_on_my_resume/,"Today I applied to my first internship in the finance industry. I met a recruiter during a campus conference, who was thoroughly impressed with me and encouraged me to email him my resume so that I could be considered for a quant investing role. I won't mention the name of the firm, but they are definitely a household name to you guys.

I've only done SWE internships in the past, because I'm a computer science undergrad, and as a result have never been asked for my SAT score that hedge funds/banks tend to do. So when this company asked me for mine, I was a little shocked, because 1) I frankly don't remember the breakdown (M;W;R) and 2) I didn't think there was a way for me (or at least them, legally) to retrieve scores for a test I took almost 5 years ago. This is where stupid comes in: I'm already at a prestigious university that is definitely a target school for a lot of firms across many disciplines. I got in with a (real) 2250 SAT, but as I was adding my score to my resume and completing the application online, I had the urge to boost it by 100, to a 2350 (my logic at the time was that since I don't remember the breakdown anyways and I don't want to pay $31 to find out, it probably won't matter). Now I've just submitted the application and I feel shittier than ever.

So I'm asking for some personal experience: have the companies you've applied to ask to you verify your scores, and if so how and when? I'm going to rescind my application by saying I've gotten another offer from a different firm just because I don't want this to haunt me for the rest of my career. But I definitely need some anecdotal and legal advice here, to help me come to peace with myself and know if there's a possibility I've perjured myself or something."

It pays $16 an hour. Honestly this position won't really further my career goals and probably won't be too demanding based off the work I was told I'd be doing. I verbally committed because I was basically told I needed to or they would go with someone else. I will be signing the offer employment soon (although I might have the option to stall this).

Now I just got invited for the final rounds at a much more prestigious company. This is a more of a hands on software development position, they treat their interns very well, allegedly they pay much higher than $16/hour, and they typically keep their interns around for full-time positions. I would definitey become a much better programmer here. The only downside is that it's about a 45 commute each way. 

Ideally if I get position B, I would take it in a heartbeat. However, I don't want to risk losing position A because of stalling to sign..and I'm not sure if I can go back on the contract if I do sign. I am aware that if I end up choosing company B that I'd be burning the bridge with company A, and I'm ok with that...but I don't want to end up with either position.

Can someone help me out? If I sign, am I still legally allowed to back out and work somewhere else?"

last year I married my beautiful wife who happens to be an US citizen. Since she's very limited here in terms of furthering her journalism career we've deceided to pack our bags and move to the US.

I've studied life sciences for 4 semesters at the university, but deceided midway through that I'd rather have a career in IT.

Currently I'm finishing my accelerated fellowship/traineeship/apprenticeship (I don't know what the US equivalent would be) as an IT Specialist for System Integration. Meaning for 3 days a week I'm working full time in the IT department of a fairly sized medical company - we have 3 branch offices and I support around 70 users with their everyday IT related business.

The other 2 days of the week I'm in school and learn all the fundamentals of hardware / networks (through CCNA) / software (OS, Firewalls, Backup etc.)

Usually this is a 3 year program, but I managed to accelerate that to 18 months + 5 month internship. I'll be done by the end of july after an written exam and a successfully performed IT related project (I'll create redundancy for our local VoIP-Server).

Of course I still feel that I have a lot to learn and try to learn as much as possible during my time in school and work.

So my summary:

I'll have a degree as IT Specialist for System Integration, CCNA,
MTA 98-365 and 2 years of experience in help desk / system administration / network administration, ~2 years of experience in call center customer care (Amazon)

Also I'm bilingual (german / english) with the potential for trilingual (my russian is a bit rusty).


My questions are:

What positions would be suited for me?
Where do I best start looking for a job?
What salary should I expect?
And what concerns me a lot: do I stand a chance without a bachelors degree?

Every bit of help is very appreciated.

I'm really excited for my western adventure.

I did reasonably well in semester 1 and had time for rest. In 2nd semester, I do not have time for anything else apart from university.

The problem I see is that: I feel tired and exhausted about my prospects as CS grad. I feel stuck on bigger and bigger projects and that makes me depressed instead of excited to attempt tackling problem. I find programming hard, though I am interested in interview type questions and feel like jumping when I solve a problem. I also have some serious health issues that further brings me down and increase anxiety. Courses like OS, computer architecture are incredibly challenging and takes me forever to understand what is going on.

I know people who claim that if you like programming and can program, then you should persevere in university and if you happen to get worse grade, make up for it with internships and projects. I might have an internship this summer with a bank but I am very depressed to find that I suck at working in real world as well.

Honestly, I feel overwhelmed as the user in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wbyq7/cs_undergrad_here_nearly_giving_up_how_did_you_do/

It seems to me like I do not have a knack for programming and am too slow to be successful in the field. I like many aspects of CS though but idk if I can ever become productive in this field. I really think that I am depressed because when I don't understand something I tend to wallow in pity instead of trying to tackle a problem. I am afraid that CS and programming itself might be causing a lot of depression.

Could you advice me on this situation? The other subject I am interested in is medicine and I have grades to get into it but I do not know for sure if I want it just as I am not sure about CS. Also, I don't know if I could survive med school with poor health."

I was walking around my neighborhood and came across a tiny kitten in a storm drain. ( Well a shallow basin.)  I felt sorry and tried to catch him.  He hissed like a wild cat and bit me. Now I had never heard of a feral cat in my life and so I thought he must be scared.  It turned out Mr. Kitty was feral and I was in deep shit.

Fast forward through my Doctor having a bird.  

I am in the ER and this absolutely amazing looking intern comes in and tells me he has to inject a block into the nerve of my finger where the bite was.

First time in my life I ever asked a doctor "" Is it going to hurt?"" and got a slight chuckle and : ""Oh yeah.""  As an answer.

Fast forward through torture session by hunk.
Now I get same doctor coming in and sticking me in the arm with a pink liquid filled syringe.  I am sitting here with a swollen finger and throbbing ovaries ( Intern was really hot.) and don't even flinch.

So I'm waiting for them to tell me I can go.  Then I get the choice of the day:  "" So, Leg or Butt?""

I chose butt hoping they meant an injection and my buddy the intern would be doing it.   While waiting I try to sneak out to the bath room. That was when I hear a deep voice say "" Where do you think YOU'RE going?""
I turn there is the biggest woman I have ever seen holding two huge needles.

I won't tell you where she put them, but you know.

I went home with antibiotics, a rabies quarantine and a sore ass and finger.  I STILL got toxoplasmosis ( Cat scratch fever).

I'm an 21 y.o. IT student in Switzerland, and I come from the south of France. I've been offered an 6 months internship in a great tech company based in Tallinn, in Estonia. The company and its culture looks amazing.

The problem is Estonia is pretty far away from Switzerland (you have to take 2 planes and pay quite a lot of money to go there), so I wouldn't be able to go back to Switzerland more than once or twice. I have my girlfriend there, and my family lives in the south of France. 
I think it would be quite hard for me to move away from Switzerland, especially since this is already ""abroad"" in my case and that I wouldn't be able to see my girlfriend, friends and family for quite some time. Also, I don't really know Tallinn and I had mixed feedback about it.

Freaking Out and Looking for Advice,CS_Throwaway_17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4apdhv/424_days_and_counting_freaking_out_and_looking/,"So this will be a long winded post. I have been lurking this sub for awhile, and have probley read every thread posted in past 3 month. I should probley stop because it gives me more anxiety than answers, but I figured I would post my exact situation and develop a specific game plan before I graduate next May.

So first a little background into my situation. I am 26 years old. I originally went to school for Biotechnology, and was premed but in 2011 during my Junior year I took a part time job at an Investment Real Estate company as a Sales Rep. Long story short I ended up being a top performer and quickly became the Sales Manager. During this time the company blew up, when I started there was a handful of Sales Reps, by the beginging of my senior year I was running a sales floor of about 15 guys. I was convinced by the CEO to drop out of school and focus on the company full time. As taking a 19 credit semester of upper level science classes and working 50+ hours a week was burning me out to say the least.   , and getting a taste of money and the ""life style"" made it a no brainer for a 21 year old kid. To make this part short, the company got into some shady stuff and I quit, one of the principals of the company took my advice and jumped ship as well and invited me to start a company with him in Texas doing pretty much the same thing but by the book. We delt with mostly Australian, Singaporean and New Zeland investors looking to purchase property in the US. (This is how I was able to work and go to school at same time as we operate at night due to time difference).

I made the mistake of taking equity in the company as opposed to a salary. (Dumb kids with dreams of making it big). Things went well for first few months and then everything went to shit. The aussie dollar plummeted and our demand for our services plummeted. Even during the time it was going well I found myself enjoying analytical work, things like writing VB scripts to automate property reports from excel documents etc then being a Sales Director. I decided last summer that it was time to cut my losses, that I gave it a good try and learned alot but I was burning through my savings and was months from being in financial trouble.  I decided to come back to the East Coast. After few months of job searching and plenty of offers I realized that I actually hated sales (specifically non consultative sales, non techical sales) . I was always disappointed even when I was doing well I didnt finish college so I decided to go back.

I reapplied to my old college and got in with little trouble. I did the math and had enough savings to cover tuition and living expenses for 2 years without working. (It might sound obnoxious but I just couldnt imagine working a 10 dollar an hour job even part time so I decided I didnt want to work and putt 100 percent focus into school). I knew for a fact that I had no interest working in a lab for 35k a year so going back just to finish my science degree wasnt an option. I decided on Computer Science equal parts due true interest and return on investment. 

Fast forward to today. I am half way through 2nd semester at a relatively known CS program (Not top 10 or anyhting like that). I am starting to panic that I wont be marketable upon graduation. I  am absolutely Acing all my CS classes, for example Data Structures which is considered a high failout class and a weed out class, I got 100 on both midterms so far (average was in the low 50s), this isnt me bragging I have huge advantage over these kids because I have zero distractions I am not tempted to go to a frat party on a thursday night etc. 

So the main reason for the post. I am looking for advice to most efficiently utilize the year I have before graduation (really closer to  under a year as I would need to be applying to jobs starting begining of next year). I am worried as for one I am rushing through this program, I am completing a CS BS (not BA) from scratch in 21 months flat. I have no projects and no time for internships (to graduate on time I have to take two summer classes which equates to 4 hours a day 4 days a week, thats not counting actual studying and school work that goes with it). 

The program is also theory heavy, I am hoping the rest of the program may give me more exposure to other languages etc but from what I heard not so much. As of now I only have exposure to java, I speak to upperclassman and they seem to know a handful of languages, multiple internships etc. I am taking one 300 level class right now and even the kids cheating off me and looking to me for help on programing assignments seem to have an array of skills sets, internships, projects etc.

I dont have the luxury nor the desire to take any amount of time to find a job after graduation. I need to have a job immedaitly after graduation, a well paying job and a beneficial job to my career. I will be 27 when I graduate so I feel like in the scheme of  things I am already starting 5 years behind. This sub is giving me anxiety hearing the stories of people applying to 100s of jobs and not even getting interviews.

So here are a list of questions I have and thank you to all those who take the time to answer any of them.

1. Does a high CS GPA benefit me. I feel like I have academia down to a science. I know exactly how much time I need to put in to any assignmment or preparation for an exam to get the score I want. I am also noticing that it is not a linear correlation between grades and time commited. I could easily get straight Bs putting in 25% less time, and probley pass all my classes putting in 40-50% less time. Am I better off not being GPA driven and use the time towards self study etc.

2. Will my work expierence give me any benefit. Obviously coming from a sales background I am extremly confident in my ability to sell myself,  but my concern is CS is the one field were portfolio and knowledge trump all. I am hoping very legitmate work expierence, showing I can lead, work in teams, meet deadlines etc will give me an advantage competiting for jobs. Side question: What type of sales type roles exist in the CS field. I definetly dont want to go back to generic sales, but I would consider leveraging my sales expierence for a role that still utilized and improved my developer skills while acting in a sales type role.

3. Self Study. I am debating what would be more beneficial to my marketability. I currently allocate about 10-15 hours a week for non school related study, and I feel I am not even scratching the surface of the dozens of frameworks, programmming langauges etc. If the end goal is the best, most educational and highest paid first job, am I better off sticking to one thing and becoming an expert at it, multiple projects etc  in specific topic, or is diversity important. I am currently about 2/3 the way through CS 193A Stanford course in android development. I am enjoying it alot and working on two projects I expect to put on the play store. However I am worried because for example, I was invited by some upper classman to be on a Hackathon team assuming because I am the ""smart kid in class"" however these guys are debating between weather they are going to use node, python, or C. I know java, thats it.  As much as I want to commit to one thing, I also worried I am limiting myself personally by not getting exposure to other things.  I am realtively confident that I enjoy mobile development. 
Side Question: I am also worried project wise that what am I doing might not demonstrate skills enough. For example one is a real estate investment calculator, is it beneficial trying to incorporate things and features into side projects simply for the purpose of showing above average skill.

4. Mobile web vs native. Simply am I hurting myself by not learning JS, I dont see any classes that incorporate it in my program, and my main side focus has been android development. Also am I better of focusing on android or is it beneficial to learn iOS as well. Are there any roles that would actually require knowledge of both.

I am sure I will think of more. Thanks again.

Another student at my university would eventually take over the internship once I head out to another job or grad school theoretically.  I've worked hard and expressed to my boss (in December) how much I enjoy working with the company and if anything opened up to notify me.  But, nothing has materialized since then.  

Now I'm being contacted by recruiters/companies and have started to interview with them (no job offers yet).  Is it unprofessional to tell my boss of these other companies (sort of forcing their hand to see if they did have something planned), or should I just wait and keep interviewing with other companies until they (the company I currently work for) come to me?

i kind of need a neutral perspective on all of this, this is why i thought i would tell you guys.

Ive had a lot of soul searching in the last few months after the passing of a loved one and they told me to pursue something i am passionate about, something that has stuck with me since they said it and not to waste my life in a job i don't really enjoy just to pay the bills and appease everyone else.

So from this, i have took the decision to study further and pick up some professional qualifications which will help me on my quest and i already have an internship for a sports blog writing a few articles a week about mainly European and English football.

I feel im really at a crossroads here. I have studied hard for my Economics degree but i am just not passionate enough about it and i am only still 22, i feel that i will regret it if i dont go for it.

 * In Toronto
 * Would be working with security consultants doing penetration testing, source code review, vulnerability assessments etc.

* **Security Engineer Intern**
 * $1000/week
 * At a very successful and well known Canadian startup
 * Will be part of small security team and doing things like managing their bug bounty and working on some low-level security projects.
 * Located far from Toronto, would have to relocate and pay rent

In terms of compensation, the second evens out to the first with rent factored in. The biggest downside to the second is the fact that I would have to relocate and I'm afraid I'd be miserable there. While I might be miserable, I know it would probably be a more valuable experience. I'm leaning towards the first mainly because it seems ""good enough"" and is the most convenient for me but I want to know if I might be shooting myself in the foot.

For those working in security, talking about security engineers/malware analysts/penetration testers, would the first internship narrow my options in terms of security jobs later on or would it still help me with non-penetration testing focused roles after I graduate?

I've just finished a stint at a startup in SF and after moving around in several departments I've realized data science is what I want to do. Before working at a startup I was in college part way through my sophomore credits before I dropped out to work for this startup. Now I want to go back for a degree but want to pivot out of marketing and into stats/CS degree for undergrad. Ultimately I want to pursue a graduate degree (PhD maybe) in Computational Science. I wanna do lab research or possibly high level industry work as a data science lead or R&amp;D.

I'm debating about getting an associates degree or two at a community college to save on money and in theory have a better developed resume for internships in DS / undergrad research experience in my region. I say two because at the institution I'm looking at I can get an A.S. in Information Systems which will give me CS1010 and CS1020 as well as supporting course work in SAS and SQL which I feel will be useful technical skills to have under my belt. The second degree would be in mathematics and would be for the sole purpose of having the degree title on my resume as well and getting math credits for cheaper. I've also considered getting a single A.S. in general engineering and doing a double major in CS and Stats to diversify my credentials. I feel like double majoring in stats and CS after having 2 A.S degrees in math and information systems provides no benefit besides possibly giving me an edge applying for research internships / undergrad research experience in my Sophomore and Junior year.

In summary, how would 2 A.S. degrees in information systems and mathematics look on an interns resume while they were essentially perusing the same two degrees at a 4 year institution, compared to someone who has a single A.S. in General engineering who appears to be pivoting away from it and into a data science role with a double major in stats and computer science?

Please, no pulled punches here. Any and all criticism is welcome. I'm trying to make a pretty serious decision and don't want to waste my time or leave any value on the table by making an ill-informed decision.

This morning there was a post on the program's Facebook page about ""look what our students/alumni are doing now!"" and one of them was an **extremely** toxic person from a group project last semester.  (Toxic as in I actually emailed the prof about it and came *this close* to filing a formal complaint and refusing to work with them.  Toxic as in this person was reprimanded for their unprofessional behaviour in their internship interviews.  Like, really really toxic.)

So of course the toxic person was in the lab, but we didn't interact with each other.  There were a few other people that I know in there and the whole vibe was just ... ugh...  I'm glad I'm done.  

Honestly, I don't even think it is a good program.  I did learn a lot, because I had to in order to get through it, but only 1 lecturer was any good and most were truly terrible.  One I think actually bought her degrees, got through by submitting work she'd paid for.  I could go on - there are plenty of problems.

You hear a lot about the importance of alumni network and the lifelong friendships you make at university and yadda but I don't see any of that happening for me.  I pretty much just want to move on and forget almost everyone.  I would leave the FB group but jobs are posted on it.

Following the interviews they offered me the intern position, but to my surprise needed a response within 2 hours which I thought was crazy.


Since I have never had an internship with a company before though I was worried that If I did not take it, I might have passed up my one opportunity for an internship, so I went ahead and accepted the position. 


More recently, I got contacted by a big company for an interview, a company that I have wanted to work at for years. So I went in and interviewed with that company and to my surprise was given an offer for that position.


I would enjoy both positions, but the position with the company that I have wanted to work at is much closer ( 15 minutes vs. 50 minutes ) and unlike the summer internship that I accepted already, this position goes longer than just the summer.


My question is that If I have already signed all of the paper work for the first company, can I still turn it down? Or would there be repercussions to that? I know it is a rude thing to do, since they went through the whole process to hire me but for my career I find the second company being more beneficial to me, as well as closer and a higher pay.

---

Before you roll your eyes, just hear me out. 

The phrase ""hard work"" has been seized by those who seek to disparage and denigrate others. We hear it from condescending parents, [the folks on Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTi_AQOeizA), [snobbish peers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOV8QBfaGZU), and self-flagellating workaholics who think that anything less than a twelve-hour day is a sign of laziness and entitlement. It's become loaded with so much derision that it's nearly useless in conversation. 

This is unfortunate, however, because there really is value in working hard. 

But not in the way that it's typically understood. 

I'm not talking about working two minimum wage jobs or grinding out one's days in a tiny cubicle doing something you hate. Nor am I talking about working for free at an internship in the hope that someone will toss a few scraps of opportunity your way. That's definitely *hard*, and it is *work*. It's just not the *hard work* that I know and understand. 

Hard work is about passionate, worthwhile dedication to activities that provide a sense of meaning and purpose. It's about deciding what makes our lives worth living and focusing our time, effort, and energy on those pursuits.

Hard work is separate from our jobs. Sometimes they do overlap, but it’s bigger than that. Our jobs are rarely part of some grand purpose for our lives. They’re just a means to a paycheck. That’s it. So instead of waiting for the right job to come along and tell us who we are and why we matter, let’s work hard to discover that for ourselves. 

I live a full and active life outside of my job.  After leaving Teach For America only to find that law school had become a debt trap and the past six years counted for nothing, [I took it hard](http://frankbeard.org/2016/03/16/how-i-stopped-being-a-victim-and-became-a-runner/). But I reinvented myself and discovered a love for endurance sports--especially running. I work hard to every day to become a better athlete, and I hope to eventually run the [Grand to Grand Ultra](http://g2gultra.com/)--a seven day, one-hundred and seventy mile race through the Southwestern United States. I also cycle and swim, and I'm building a fitness resource to help beginners revitalize their lives like I did. Nearly all of my spare time is invested into this, and I love it. The sense of satisfaction that it provides is far more than I'll get from any job.

Others have found purposeful activities of their own. They pursue yoga, draw comics, play in local bands, learn skills like woodworking, and volunteer their time. Some spread the message of their religion, and others spread the message of no religion. 

Sometimes this generates income, but that’s not the point. What matters is that they're actively living life and pursuing something that matters. They aren’t sitting in front of the television, living life vicariously through the stories of others. Nor are they living the consumer life and thinking that everything will be better with the next purchase.  

My generation was [hit hard](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income) by the economic crisis, and we haven't recovered. Many of those who have jobs are underemployed, working long hours for less pay than they deserve. Some have moved back home to reduce expenses, and I’ve even heard that, as a whole, my generation will never reach our parents' level of economic security. 

This had led to a lot of anger, confusion, and self-doubt. People wonder what they did wrong, regret past actions now that they see how the game is played, and feel anxious about the future.

These folks would really benefit from hard work. 

But they shut down when I talk about it, because they don't hear an uplifting message about taking control and embracing life; they hear a condescending message about accepting drudgery and the daily grind. 

This is a problem.

Hard work is incredibly beneficial. It enriches our lives, and it focuses our attention and energy on things that matter. It keeps us from wasting away with constant entertainment, alcohol, comfort food, and succumbing to the lie that we need a fancier home, a nicer car, or a bigger television. It stops us from thinking that we need to finance ""the good life"", because an active and meaningful life is far better than that.

Hard work is when Megan Tan didn't let her post-college failure define her, but instead owned her situation and [created a podcast](http://www.millennialpodcast.org/) about her job-hunting trials and tribulations. 

Hard work is when my friend John didn't settle for a conventional nine-to-five, but fought to build a career spreading a message about his religious faith.

Hard work is when [Josh LaJaunie](http://www.richroll.com/podcast/josh-lajaunie-2/) pursued long-distance running and healthy living even though he weighed more than four-hundred pounds. 

For many of us, hard work really *is* the key to living a better life. 

Just not the hard work that we usually hear about.

Specifically, I have a python script that constantly pulls in data. I'd like to pipe this data through to a front end in real time and show a constantly updating representation of the data there. Can anybody point me in the right direction in terms of resources, or recommend the right stack to do this sort of thing? Thanks! "

Starting as a very junior intern working my way up, promotion after promotion and title change after title change.

Currently, I am having a little bit of pushback from H.R. in presenting my case to go from *intermediate* programmer and business analyst to *senior*.

I would not be asking for the promotion if I didn't think it was warranted.  What I am noticing in the organization that more and more people are coming to me for answers and how things should be implemented.  I'm leading the business analysis side of things in many projects and also can code and maintain different ongoing projects using PHP, C#,  .NET, OpenEdge, Javascript, VB as well as maintaining servers and numerous document management systems.

An important point is:
There is another guy who is probably even more knowledgable than I am but we are comparable.  He is intermediate as well.  

But the main thing is that apparently there is *another* guy in another department with the title senior developer - he has nothing to do with the projects we work on and frankly I didn't even know he existed until 6 months ago.

It might be arrogant to say, but I could code this guy under the table.  he is around 50ish years old and stuck in very old ways, he hasn't adapted at all.  The projects he is maintaining and updating are just.... well I believe his title is senior just out of 'years of service' so....

HR is reluctant to upgrade my title for political reasons.  A) They don't wanna ruffle the 50 year old guys feathers.  and B) If they give me an upgrade they would also have to my colleague since he is comparable to me.

I need to present a case with solid references as to what EXACTLY a senior developer is.  I think it's age discrimination to not call me a senior just because I am significantly younger and not basing it on my knowledge.

Wondering if anyone has any experience or help they can offer.

Cheers!

I've done no AI or machine learning, haven't taken a class in design or software testing, and my tech electives are already maxed out.

With all that said, I'm still doing alright and  I recently accepted an internship for a big 4 company this summer. 

What should I be doing to prepare for my future and fill in the gaps I've created due to laziness?

Is it too late to do AI, design, and testing? Should I review databases, Discrete and OS? Is it too late and too little use to study linear algebra and calculus?

My school frustratingly forces CS students to take the standard 60 general education credits as well as 15 interdisciplinary credits. As a result I only take 15 computer science related classes in my entire degree, so my learning will have to be outside of school.

Should I let my GPA in my interdisciplinary and general education classes drop (to a 3.0) so that I can focus more on my field?

The digital format is then where most of the information is processed such as what was done to prevent it from happening.

The website it's put in is basically a bunch of text boxes and drop downs.

I'm an undergrad graduating this April and I'm looking for some advice going forwards, I do want to end up on the buy-side doing quant work.

* I started university originally pursuing actuarial exams (did 3 in 8 months) - did an actuarial internship 
* Didn't feel there was enough tech/finance (I've always been interested in tech and finance, did coding competitions in HS for fun, never seriously, hacker stuff in HS, etc)
* Joined a startup for a bit, did a lot of grunt work, learned a bit about NLP, advanced math/CS that was over my head
* Went to a big tech firm as a PM, learned UX design, visualizations, powerpoint, a bit of software architecture and design patterns 
* Joined a large investment fund doing quant work (mostly data processing and analytics), but learned tons about the investment process and pipeline and the maths involved

My education is in pure math and finance, there's very little CS so I've had to self-supplment:

* I've self taught myself algorithms/data structures by auditing classes at school and online courses, I don't know the sort complexity of every data structure by heart since I haven't taken 16 courses where this stuff pops up on a daily basis
* Same with machine learning and general AI
* I'm pretty versatile with any language, I spent 2 years fiddling with assembly when I was younger and just use references when I program, and I read quite fast so I pick up a book on best practices / patterns etc and I'm good to go

I haven't taken the GRE (same with CFA) so I can only apply to grad school later this year (I've bought a prep package for GRE and started going through it). I've contacted some headhunters and will see where it goes, my GPA is ok: roughly a 3.7/4.0, I could've done better but I've had to help my family business all throughout undergrad as I don't come from a rich background

1. Should I just self-study for a bit and apply to grad school later this year? 
1. Find whatever job and apply to grad school? 
1. Try as hard as possible with headhunters/myself to find a quant position?

Any thoughts is greatly appreciated, I also don't mind showing my resume if you PM me"

* I know who I will be working with and what type of project I will be working on at company A. Company B is a total shot in the dark - I may not even like it there.

Backstory:  I graduated from university in 2002 with a degree in Urban Planning.  Worked in that field for a bit, but struggled to get a job without a masters.  Fortunately, I learned a lot of skills in my internship due to my boss, beyond just skills and knowledge in my field.  He made me learn as much as I could with Access, Excel, Word, Powerpoint and other programs and I became very proficient in everything.  

After my internship, I did some temp jobs for a while, where I tested very highly with software use and accounting (I don't know how) with the temp agency, so I was always placed in tech oriented jobs.  I worked at a university where as a glorified secretary, I was able to streamline their data collection for new applicants and target the sources of new applicants so that they could better focus their marketing efforts.  This all came from this conversation: 
""When prospective applicants enter the data from our website, how do you access that database file.""
 To which the school replied, 
""Can we do that?""  
I asked them if I could take the time to find out, they said yes, and about a week later, I took a process that had taken over a week to do, and pared it down to a couple hours.  
Previously, they would go through each record, one by one, and have someone enter it into an excel spreadsheet.   Then they would print the spreadsheet and type labels.  Once I could access the database file, I imported it into excel, did a mail merge, and printed the label.  I also wrote a manual on how to do it.  They were very impressed.  I have a lot of stories like this from my work history, but I have a hard time demonstrating it.  Anyway, I then worked for two months for the sales and marketing department of a large company, which was a crash course, for me, in sales and markets.  But I learned how to market so that we could make warm calls, instead of cold calls, and learned a lot of other things.  After that, I settled into software testing at an insurance company’s headquarters while I job hunted for something permanent.   While there I only increased my computer and tech skills.  

I was finally hired permanently by a fortune 500 company that had an excellent corporate structure a great management training program and they gave me the tools to be my own boss.  I did really well with that company, progressing through the ranks very quickly and earning a lot of awards.  A lot of what I owe my success to was being able to translate survey techniques, I learned while going to school as a planner, into marketing in my area to increase business.   Also applying some of the marketing that I learned while temping in the sales and marketing department.   I was able to generate corporate business at a level that raised the bar for the entire state.  I’m very good with people, too, so service calls and sales calls were very natural to me.  I do push back quite a bit with management, if I think my ideas are better, and that’s a personal flaw I’m working on.

Fast forward to now.  I left that company and have been teaching ESL for 6 years, abroad.  I really see myself as an expat, but not as a teacher.  I want to try to find something in the world that I can do that has a career path and is something I can do well with an organization that will benefit from my skills and my ability to problem solve, but I haven’t the slightest idea where to start.  I guess this is a problem I’m having a real hard time solving.  Any advice would be helpful.  I really hope that being out of the game for 6 years hasn’t made me unemployable.  




TL;DR B.A in Urban Planning, worked as a planner for a bit, then temped.  Have strong computer skills and a natural problem solver.  Worked at fortune 500 company for 4.5 years, then moved abroad to teach ESL for 6 years.  Want to stay expat, but don’t’ want to teach. Not sure what to do.

4axa7i,38,2016-03-18,I was adcted to confort and it was the cause to almost all of my problems,hatebacon,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4axa7i/i_was_adcted_to_confort_and_it_was_the_cause_to/,"TL; DR: had a great life in Brazil but felt like I was very mediocre. Went to India to get out of the confort zone and realized that it was the confort that was making me mediocre by shifting me from what is really important in life. What makes me happy and motivated is not being confortable. It is my ability to conect with people and make a positive impact in their lives.

This is mostly a very personal rambling I wrote as a terapy. 


Some time ago I had a very confortable life back in Brazil. I had a confortable house at a confortable place, worked in a confortable job that allowed me to chill with my friends during work and had a great social and romantic life. 

But at the same time I felt desperate, like I was stuck in this mediocrity and would never live my dreams and become the person I wanted to be. My job, despite paying me enough to allow me to have a little independece didn't provide me with any professional growth or challenge and it wasn't near to what I wanted to do. Despite having great friends and a girlfriend I aways had a inferiority complex in the sence that I wasn't a good company, I wasn't fun enough, I was too shy and too boring to deserve their company. I was never motivated to improve myself, was aways procrastinating and had no passion in life. I was at the CONFORT ZONE and didn't know how to get out. And for some reason I thought that maybe all I needed to do was shake my life by having a completelly new start. 

I was looking for a new beggining and an opportunity to work in another country in a position that made me more valuable as a professional. Also I wanted a challenging place to help me getting out of the CONFORT ZONE. So I accepted an opportunitie to work in a big company in India as part of a professional internship.

Man did I regret this at first. The shock was bigger than I would have ever imagined. In India everything is a challenge. Crossing the streets, negociating with the cabs and getting them to understand you, using the toilets, finding decent food that won't make me sick, and most of all finding a place to live as a foreigner. 

So why did I do this? Why did I felt this need to getting out of the CONFORT ZONE. What the fuck is even that? Shoudn't we persue confort to be happy? Why did I leave this great life I had, spend so much money to basically live in a shitty place, so fucking hot and with a very stressfull and dificult job? I am such idiot. 

But then something happened. I adapted. I got used to living with less and realized how little I needed to live well. I realized how much the confort I had before made me take the life I had for granted and shifted me from what is really important in life: people. 

If it wans't for the people sharing this experience with me I would have come back in the first week. But one thing I realized is that no mather where you are most of the experience you have is the quality of your company. It is the conections you make with people, the shared stories and experiences and most of all your capacity to make a great impact in their lives.

Back in Brazil I didn't put an effort to change my life because I had a lot of great things to distract me from that. Videogames, Netflix, great food, parties,  confortable bed and so on. I felt empty because I was lost in all those things and didn't feel the need to put any effort in finding my place, because the place I had was very confortable. I was adcted to confort almost the same way an adct is to heavy drugs. It made unable to move on and depressed about how nothing changed. 

As I see most people are so focused on confort and getting a confortable easy life for themselfs that they loose the abity to look at the others. Why leave the apartment when I could stay home watching netflix and buying food online? 

Getting out of the CONFORT ZONE made me realize how all of that was just a distraction I made for myself to keep being mediocre and to feed my fear of change and commitment. Now I know what is really important and feel happier than ever and more motivated to be a better person and competente enough to change people's lives."

Recently I recieved an offer from this start-up, that does infastructure consultation, mostly in the realm of Linux data storage. I will be working on writing test cases for their continous integration platforms (among other things) and working on their monitoring program. Because of its small size, I'm going to be learn a lot and it's invaluable exprience. It's nice that they're in LA as opposed to the bay area because I'm stuck in LA with a lease than runs through the end of August. Also I get to work remotely one day of the week.

However the stickler is that the salary is at $2000 a month. That comes up to $12.50 for a 40 hour work week. Suffice to say, it's really low even for a start up in LA. I'm in no position to negotiate; companies I've applied to have gone radio silent or I was rejected after the first round interview. Being this late in the hiring season for summer interns, I feel like I don't have much of a choice.

I'd be happy at about $16 an hour. I'm not hurting for money and I am willing to forgo the privlige of working 1 day remotely for that increase. Is that too much to ask especially with no bargaining power?

I was then hired full time in August 2015 at an annual salary of 62,000 as a ""level 1"" systems admin. This was in Division B.

I just applied and received an offer for an internal position doing IT security. I accepted the job at 73,000 and I am starting in April. This is a level 2 job and this is in Division C.

Should I ask for another raise once I receive my MS in computer science?

I'm currently a high school senior who's interested in the cybersecurity/networking field.  I've already received the Network+ and Security+ certifications, both of which I realize are fairly low in their overall difficulty, but it's a start.  I was accepted to Capitol Technology University (I'd love to hear some feedback on this school if anybody is/was enrolled here at some point), which from my understanding has a pretty fantastic cybersecurity program.  As of right now, it looks very possible that I will be receiving a full ride through the school.  In my interview for the scholarship, one of the professors was impressed and informed me that I would be able to potentially meet with an NSA representative that would be visiting the school on the 31st.  I guess my dream job would be to work with the NSA, a goal which I realize is fairly far-fetched, but if I were to get an internship as soon as freshman year, I believe I would be well on my way.  I recently started looking into Kali Linux and am preparing to set up a ""lab"" of sorts to practice and learn about penetration testing.  I was wondering if possibly anybody has any suggestions for what else I should be doing to help increase the odds of landing this internship.  Any help would be awesome, thanks (and sorry for the stupidly long post).

tl;dr
High school senior looking to go into the cybersecurity field.  Was offered a potential opportunity for an internship with the NSA as early as freshman year of college, suggestions/resources to help increase my chances of landing it would be greatly appreciated.

Edit

I am a second year computing science undergrad student (3 year course), and got offered an internship with a great company. I've been to the interviews and did pretty well and eventually got an offer, and to be honest it was my favorite company to work in by far out of all the ones I've had interviews in. 

Fast forward to today, where I have my induction meeting prior to starting on Monday. At this point i havent received any contract or schedule yet so i believed that i would work 5-10hours a week, and once summer starts i could work full time as needed.
Today, in my induction meeting i discovered that this is not infact a summer internship which is what i applied for, but it is in fact an internship over the following 3 months during which i have university. In the next 2months I am also expecting 6 assignments which will massively influence my grade, and in the 3rd month i will have final year exams. Throughout the internship i am expected to work around 25-30 hours per week.

I am planning to inform him that i cannot possibly work more than 15hours a week, but even that seems like a risk. Has anyone been in this situation? Did you cope with internships and lectures and projects at the same time? 

Thank you so much for reading!"

This is currently my fifth year, and I still have one more year to go (switched majors/couldn't focus on full course load). Some of you may retort that I may not be cut out for school, but ever since I have been going to therapy and taking my medication, my grades have improved (4.0 this year) and I am able to take a full course load. The majority of my courses that I am taking this year are the most difficult courses I've ever taken (upper year stats/math/econ) so my recent success is not the result of bird courses.

I have a great GRE score and I have even completed the CFA I to signal interest (I know it's not necessary) so I'm not an unintelligent person. I also started a student organization from scratch, and it is now one of the most successful student run conferences in Canada. So ambition, motivation and working in a stressful environment is not a problem for me.  

Here's my dilemma: 

1. Despite an uptrend, my transcript is a mess. I think it is unlikely they will take a chance on someone like me. I will be eliminated before I even get an interview for an entry level analyst position or internship. Is this accurate thinking?

2. Because of program limits, I will be graduating with a psychology major, with minors in econ and stats. However, the majority of my courses are in mathematics, mathematical statistics/finance and economics. I was thinking about going to graduate school, but I'm not sure how well that will translate to finance. I'm also not sure if I am even a good candidate for a good school. 

3. I can explain why I used to be so shitty at school, but I doubt recruiters care. They have a dozen other kids who have less baggage. 

4. I asked my school's career counselor but they seem to be out of touch with today's job market. Firms might not have cared about GPA in the past, but a vast majority of them use it as a screening tool today. 

What would you suggest? I am in a precarious and fragile stage in my life, so I must handle this with the utmost care and urgency. 

TL;DR

-Got shitty grades, couldn't complete courses because of an undiagnosed health problem. 

-Got good grades once treated and medicated.

-What are my options to make myself more competitive? "

I'm currently a computer engineering freshman at a pretty decent engineering/cs school, and midway through my second semester. I took introductory electrical engineering last semester (pretty much useless, learned the absolute basic of control systems and a little Matlab), and am taking the second OOP Java class this semester (tested out of the first one via AP credits), which isn't too bad, just takes a while to really understand the concepts.  

When I first decided to go into CE, I had the dream that I'm pretty sure a lot of CS/CE majors have: intern at some small company/government during underclassmen years, move up to some bigger companies, then move to the west coast after college and live comfortably while working at a startup or at Microsoft/Google/FB/etc. 

The problem is, I am just so lost with regards to my chosen path right now. I currently have essentially no professional experience in coding (the only experience I have are the projects that we do during class and a couple hackathons I went to where I just programmed the most basic things - essentially dead weight), and to gain some experience I am actively applying to internships around me, but haven't gotten any offers yet and am pretty sure I won't get any due to my lack of experience. I have plenty of friends around me that are also CE/CS, but they have a ton of experience (some of them already interned at Microsoft after freshman year, or know a bunch of complicated stuff using Java/Python/C that I have absolutely no clue what it is), and most have already received internship offers. As a result, I can't help but feel like I'm so far behind my peers and am already starting my career with a disadvantage.

I also have no clue as to how much more ""basic"" stuff (iterator/comparator, generic classes, etc.) I would need to learn before I can actually apply that knowledge in actually programming something, for example at the most recent hackathon my teammates were coding something with packets and TCP or something and I'm over here coding for loops and writing things to a text file...

I was also told by upperclassman CE majors that there aren't exactly jobs that are made for CEs, but rather CS-focused or EE-focused jobs, and CEs have the skillset to do either one. However, wouldn't that be counterintuitive, since a CS recruiter would go for the CS major rather than the CE, and the same for an EE recruiter for an EE job? 

At this point, I'm not sure if I should switch from CE to EE &amp; CS minor, or if I even want to stay in this career. Before college I didn't really have a major that I really wanted to do, but I wasn't bad at coding in high school and it was fun when my code worked, plus I liked playing with Arduinos so I chose CE.

Sorry for rambling, but my thoughts are just so jumbled right now and I have no idea how to progress from here. I guess the tl;dr version in questions are these:

* Is a CE career even worth pursuing if my heart isn't in it 100%?
* Does having a CE major put you at a disadvantage when compared with CS or EE majors for jobs?
* How would someone with essentially no experience get experience, especially with the fierce competition?

Any help would be appreciated, I'd just really like to hear some other opinions on my current situation."

They want me to rewrite the back-end of their mobile application from as the sole developer of their company to scale with their userbase. 

The original application was outsourced by the founders of the start up. But now they are looking for an intern to rewrite their application to scale up.

Problem is, I am their only developer. And will be likely working 40+ hours week. I'm worried that without a more senior developer to guide me, I could completely fuck up this opportunity. 

That being said they do have a tech mentor, but I likely won't meet him every often. And I don't have much experience yet (1 internship at a small local company where I wrote unit tests, and did a little bit of web dev), but I do have a couple of idea of what tech stack I use when I do rewrite the backend mostly from reading about the newest technologies.

My fear is that I could completely choke this kind of experience and get a bad placement rating from my program at school, which screws up my chances of any future coop placement. But if I can pull it off it could be a rocket for my career.

Is right for me, as a relatively inexperienced developer or should I go for a more standard work environment?

1. Does declining to answer the voluntary sections (gender, veteran status, disability, etc.) reduce your chances of being considered? I understand it's voluntary but does it factor into the position? I feel that answering it correctly can hamper my chances (I am an Asian male and the industry is saturated with us) for the sake of diversity and affirmative action.
2. What about applying for multiple similar positions in the same company? Would they not consider you because you essentially spammed your application to increase your chances?
3. Do companies prioritize applicants near the position location? e.g. if I'm currently in LA and the position is in Florida or Maryland would the company prefer students that already in those states? If so then I might as well just focus on openings in SoCal only instead of trying my luck (or lack thereof) everywhere."

so in the last 6-8 months luck was really on my side I guess…sadly I am a guy who always thinks a thousand steps ahead and worries about my future. But maybe I should start from the beginning: 

6-8 months ago I was hired by a big company as a working student, actually I was hired in a technical department of the company (I am apparently good with computers and mobile devices - which might be the reason I was hired there). Already before I graduated they offered me a full-time job and I thought and still think what a great opportunity that is and still can’t believe how lucky I am.
But in the last couple of weeks thoughts came up like „is this the right job for me?“, „do I wanna do this for the next couple of years?“ or „what about graduate school?“. Point is, currently I feel like I don’t learn anything at all, because mainly I am doing the same tasks almost every day with just little variations, but still I work hard, stay long in the office, come into the office during the weekends if help is needed and I always try to be as supportive for my team as I can be (which is the reason why they offered me a full-time position after I graduated I guess). 

I think the reason for my concerns is, that I’m actually having Bachelor’s degree in international politics and during my studies I spent many years abroad not only to study but also to do several voluntary internships….I loved my work I did back then…and it still makes me happy and sad at the same time when I’m thinking about it, because the work I was doing during my internships is what I would love to do for the rest of my life (international politics, human rights, foreign affairs etc. etc.). The last couple of nights I couldn’t even sleep because all my thoughts were about going to graduate school or at least apply for jobs that I am interested in. But first of all, at the same time I can’t imagine myself going back to school (now that I am completely independent so to say) and second of all getting a job in the areas I did internships in, very often requires an advanced degree or at least several years of experience in a political area -&gt; and I just can’t count my current job for that….I don’t even need my degree for what I am doing there…it has absolutely nothing to do with international politics

So basically my question is: Did any of you ever had similar thoughts during their first job, and if so how did you deal with them? Did you „follow your dreams“ so to say or did you stick with your current job and never looked back while being happy with that decision?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions 

Cheers!

I'm currently in my last semester in school for a BS in CS, going to a no-name university, and I'm also currently in my first internship.

The internship itself is really great.  It's for embedded dev, which I enjoy, my boss is happy to teach me something I don't know, everyone is friendly, the atmosphere is very relaxed, my opinions on things matter, and I'm able to do most of my work remotely.  

After finishing up the first project they had me working on, my boss said that he wants me to work for him, and that he would have a job offer for me after he gets back from vacation (2 weeks from now).

On the surface it sounds like I should take this offer in a heartbeat, but I have a few problems with the area I would be working in.  The main problem is that it's a very white trash town, and I happen to be gay.  While it has had newsworthy problems with people having property damaged or being beat up for being gay, I don't fear for my safety.  The town is also getting more tolerant, and it's a college town on top of that, but it still isn't very welcoming.  

The other problem is that I'm almost 100% sure I would not be making that much money for the work I would be doing; if I had to guess, I would say the offer would be for around $35k/yr. The business itself is small, about 15-20 employees, business isn't exactly booming, and the area is cheap to live in.  For example, I could get a 1100 square foot 2 bedroom apartment, with an attached garage, for $800 a month.  Because I don't think I would be making much, I don't think I could afford to live in a nearby city and commute whenever I needed to be there in person.  Also the closest city I would like to live in is an hour away.

I put in job offers to other places recently, but I really doubt I will get an interview or have an offer from any of them before my boss comes back and gives me an offer.  And considering my school isn't well known, my GPA isn't the best, it's a little harder for me to just fall into a job when I feel like it.

So my question is, what do you guys think I should do?  If I hear back from another company before my boss offers, I'll most likely take that.  But I don't know what I should do if I get my first offer from my boss.  I really do like working here, and I can tolerate living here for a few years I guess, but I'm afraid that if I take his offer that I might miss out on something better.  Then on the other hand, if I reject his offer, and if I don't hear back from anywhere else, or if I bomb any interviews I may get, I'm jobless.  I would also like to try and avoid only working here for a month and then jump ship to something better asap.  I have too much respect for my boss to do that.

**TL;DR**: Have a job offer on the way for a job I like, but in a shitty city.  Pay is most likely not going to be good, although good for the city, and commuting isn't reasonable.  No other offers currently on the table.  What do?"

He's suffered a lot of loss in his life and has no family left. He also told me ahead of time that he was prone to feeling intensely very fast. 

I tried to tell him yesterday that this was going to fast and mixed with my inexperience I wanted to just stay friends for a while, but he broke down crying thinking that I'm about to abandon him. We've only seen each other in person twice, never kissed, and only held hands for three seconds when my cousin wasn't looking. 

I don't know what to do because my anxiety is acting up from this and though I don't want to abandon him, I don't want to hurt him anymore than I already have. What should I do? 

On a positive note, he is very intelligent and has a lot of information, and he makes for good company, but I just can't get comfortable for a relationship right now. He doesn't force me to do anything I wanna do, and though he's sad about my decision, he said he would respect it, though he still thinks I'm trying to let him down gently. 

My question of course is what do I do?"

I'm entering my freshman year of college next year and have a business I idea I want to develop throughout college. I have declared as a Computer Science student, but I also am considering adding Business - Entrepreneurship to it.

Right now I spend the majority of my free time studying artificial intelligence through online course work like edX and Coursera. I want to start a business that is fully powered by Artificial Intelligence. 

- In my state - California - the LLC fees are $800 a year. Can / should I start a LLC for ""business"" expenses like hardware, software, and servers. (I don't expect to be profitable for several years).

- Once I get to college how to do I protect my college from attempting to take credit for my idea? Can I work on it on school provided resources? Can I use this project for research and internships for credit hours? Can I use the ""educational software"" to build out my product? Can the college take credit?

- Is it best to launch a commercial product while in college or after college?

- Should I ""start"" my business while in college? Like bring in mentors, raise money, and advertise the product?

- What is the best way to gain exposure to a highly technical business like artificial intelligence while you build out the product.

Thanks In advance!"

Hi all,

I’m a University student with 9 months until graduation (bachelors of IT, networking and IT security). I’ve been lurking this sub for some time now, and I have to say nothing has ever gotten me more excited about tech then the devops movement. That said with graduation coming up I’m trying to focus my last few months as a student on acquiring useful knowledge and skills that could help me land a job in the field!

**So here’s what I’ve already done:**

Certs: 

* CCNP
* CCDP
* I’ve attempted the CCIE written
* JNCIS-Junos

Internship experience:

* General PC support/workstation deployment (Government)
* Access Management/Level 2 supportish (Permissions/account management for AD, File permissions, propriety application stuff, etc.) (Government)
* Enterprise Networking Support (Cisco)
* 2x Presales/Lab admin (Cisco)
* Jr DNS network administrator for an internet registration authority (this summer)

Relevant Lab experience:

* Butt load of experience with Cisco Configurations in routing, switching, telephony, ASAs, wireless, ucs, etc.
 * I run a full cisco enterprise stack at home, Security appliance/UCS Server/Switches/Controller &amp; AP
 * Got the chance to pretty much run an SE lab
 * Deployed multiple full stack networks 
* Loads of time spent messing around with ESXi/vCenter
* KVM based Openstack, setting it up manually/from scratch (nova, keystone, rabbitMQ, Gluster, swift, cinder, horizon, neutron etc.)

Coding:

* Super comfortable in python
* I can hold my own in the following with syntax help from google: C++, VB, Java, JavaScript/JQuery, HTML, PHP

**Heres what I’m planning to do over the next few months:**

* Develop a full stack web app (already in-progress, about 60% done coding the app)

 * Develop automated scripts/workflows to compile/test/deploy code on an Openstack cluster when someone commits to the main truck
 * Develop a Vagrant/Ansible based dev environment for myself and roommate (who’s doing the front end) (this is approx. 75% done)
 * Attempt to scale the app and see how many requests/sec or maximum clients it can take (load ballancers/DB cluster/multiple application and front end servers) 
* Openstack automated deployment from bare metal, something along the lines of pxe booting, which triggers an Ansible script once the OS is installed, or maybe boot off my soon to be Lego SAN?
* Distributed storage, probably mess around with live migration while I’m at it 
* Loads of coding (Hacker Rank)/creating a Github profile to post samples
* Mess around with other tools (Puppet/Chef, Salt, etc.)
* Loads of reading on HA, Ansible, Devops culture, SDDC, Openstack, etc.

So my questions, am I on the right track? What changes you would make? Anything else I should look at? 

Any advice in terms of career paths or what particular job titles I should be on the lookout for? I’m thinking of trying to go for a new grads SRE role, but i have more experience in the network engineering domain"

I will be graduating in January 2017. I have talked to some companies on a job fair a few weeks ago, exchanged some business cards, etc. I was approached by a very interesting company (Company A), and have been at their headquarters for a first interview session.       
   
 
They were very positive (as am I btw) and are interested in inviting me for a second round in April. However, as they have stated in their e-mail themself, they do realize that it might be a bit early for me, should they present me with a contract to sign. They propose that, if I do indeed feel that way, they can arrange to have the second round of interview in September instead.     
    
Personally I feel like September would suit me better. I have done an internship at another company (Company B), and although I'm not sure about starting my carreer with Company B, I would like to have a talk with them first as well (without mentioning Company A of course). However, my girlfriend and others think that this will lower my chances with A because I might seem uninterested.      
What do you think? Company A knows I will be graduating in January 2017, and has stated that this is no issue."

I feel like I've been getting a little experience in a lot of separate career paths. I'm in the middle of my internship hunt, but no offers so far. My strategy was to apply to as many internships that I could find where I met all the basic requirements. Moving forward I want to narrow my career goals, build my skills, and do better in the future. The first step in doing that is to find out where my background would help me most.

Here is a basic outline of my background.


General:

* Junior CS major with a math minor
* GPA of about 3.35

High Level Languages:

* Java - 2 years experience
* Python - 1 year experience
* R - .5 years experience
* C++ - &lt;.5 years experience

Low Level Languages:

* x86 Assembly - .5 years experience
* AVR - .5 years experience 

Information Technology:

* Server Technician - .5 years
* Tech Help Desk - 3 months

Project Management Skills:

* Assistant manager at a learning center (Leadership)
* Taught English as a second language abroad (Communication)


I've applied to internships in software development, software engineering, android development, data analysis, machine programming, general information technology, sysadmin, and project management. In which career path do I have the most marketable background? How can I make myself more marketable in that career path?

I would really appreciate any help, tips, guidance, or constructive criticism you can offer."

In the fall I interviewed with a company in my field and I was happy to receive an offer from them for the summer, which I signed in December.
I recently discovered that the internship will require me to pass a hair collection drug test. While I do not smoke very often (at most once or twice a week), after reading about hair tests I am concerned that I will not be able to pass. The last time I smoked was in late February and I expect to take the test in mid to late May. I believe there is a good likelihood that I might fail the test given that time frame.
The advice I am looking for is not necessarily how to pass the test, but what to do in the event that I do fail. I am confident that failing the test will mean that I will not get the internship. This presents a multitude of problems. Since I am in my Junior year, if I do not get any technical experience this summer I fear that my full time employment outlook will be poor (I turned down a return offer from an aerospace company in order to accept this internship). However, since it is so late in the recruiting season I do not believe I will be able to apply to another company. My second option is to seek out research for the summer with a professor, but I am not sure how to navigate this route properly. If I go to a professor now to ask to do research then he or she will likely be upset in the event that I do pass my drug test and inform them later on that I will not, in fact, be working with them. If I wait to hear the results, then I doubt that any professor will be receptive to a student asking to get a research position so late in the year.
Any and all advice would be appreciated, I fear that if I do not work this summer then I will be putting my full time career in serious jeopardy.  "
4bahd7,1,2016-03-20,Looking for guidance on Info Security as a career,Phenoix512,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4bahd7/looking_for_guidance_on_info_security_as_a_career/,"So here is my position I'm a first generation college student and a professional self doubter(thanks for that family) plus I started and finished college in my late 20's. I have a bachelors of Science in Info Tech from a decent school not Ivory league but decent. I have tried talking to my professors for advice but they seem unwilling to give direction to even a straight question like does a masters degree help in the IT world. 

Clearly can't ask family who either tell me I'm dumb for going to college or respond with I don't know anything about that stuff. 

So I'm pretty deep in loan debt my choice and all but my current job doesn't cover beyond rent and food and internet. 

So a nearby university has a info security masters degree but the one class I have taken mainly involved the guy sounding paranoid about companies gathering data on you that you leave the USA your computers and phones will be compromised.

I don't disagree but I don't think its anymore likely in Europe then the USA that your device could be compromised. Anyways I dont feel challenged yet in the class it feels like a entry level. 

I was hoping for an education more on par with Offensive Security or CEH instead I fear this will be like a class where we password crack windows 98 with Cain&amp;Abel.

However I need to prove my skills and dedication to move from my light IT work experience of 2 jobs 2 internships all part time to at least a full time gig with the opportunity to earn a place in IT security.
the jobs and school have given me some experience in Cisco commands line, SQL, C#, Kali, Snort, Apple, Windows.

I have no certs I failed my first attempt at ccna and want to make sure I pass the second time. 

So basically I need career advice people how do I make my way into full time IT and eventually IT security. I'm lost is the masters a good path even if I'm not learning? Should I just give up? Because I'm like 29 now so maybe I'm to old for entry level.  

I need real honesty my friends do more then enough in the everything will be OK field. So please give me honest opinions that will help me move towards working in Info Security."

Research or Startup?,plokiju21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bb0nz/which_job_should_i_take_research_or_startup/,"Hi Reddit, I have a big decision coming up, and I was hoping to get some advice. I'm a third year computer science undergrad student. I think that I'd like to apply to do a masters in computer vision or machine learning after I graduate, but I don't know exactly what my long term goals are yet. I have two summer job offers; one is to do some bioinformatics work for a biology prof at my university, and another is to make educational apps in unity at a small start-up over the summer. 

The bioinformatics job would help me get some research experience to appeal to grad schools (I have none so far), but I think I'd be the only computer science student there, so I wouldn't be able to learn as much from others. Bioinformatics seems really interesting, but I'm kind of worried I'd end up just being tech support for the biology department. I'm not sure if I'm interested in bioinformatics as a career in the long term either, but I am interested in DNA and biology as a personal interest.

 The start up sounds like they're doing interesting work (they mentioned some computer vision things they're working on, which I love), but I have a feeling I'd mostly be doing less interesting bug fixes and related tasks as a summer student. Also, I already did a 16 month internship at a similar small company doing QA work, so maybe it would be beneficial to do a much different job this year, both to stand out on my resume and to get more perspective on what I want to do long term.

I understand there are a lot of other factors to consider between the two that I haven't mentioned, but from a career perspective, does one seem like a better idea to anyone? The jobs both seem like completely different paths, so it's hard to know what my best option is. I'm still trying to figure out my exact goals in life, but I want my resume to look attractive to both grad schools and the industry to leave my options open until I figure it out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Then I need to do my final project, and afterwards decide on further education.

I would like your help, suggestions, and experiences with:

1. Decide on my final project
2. Decide on a new education
3. Decide on a career path.

I have a lot of thoughts, so sorry for my wall of text.

---

**Final project**  
It is recommended that we find a company who needs a solution, and then create it for them. I have the following possibilities:

1. Stay at CompanyX and create as much as possible of a WS12 RDP/DC/mail environment, while helping with 1st level support.  
++ More job experience. They can help me with my project. Higher chance of continuing in the company (see *education*)  
-- More 1st level work.
2. Find a new company that needs a solution, and create it.  
++ Experience in another company. I could create a solution someone needs.  
-- I have to find out which company. I lose a bit contact at CompanyX.
3. Find a project myself I find interesting. E.g. I am volunteering in an org. that needs Nagios that I could set up.  
++ I get to do exactly what I want. I could combine it with my CCNA study (see *education*).  
-- But not something to add to CV.

---

**Education**  
My education ends this semester, and I do not have a plan for what I should do. One thing is to start at another school which does apprenticeships (switching between company and school every few months), however it is a very practical education, pretty far from a university degree.

I see the following choices:

1. Start an apprenticeship at CompanyX.  
++ An easy choice, since I have contact with them. At least I can continue somewhere.  
-- I need to learn CCNA, because they will teach CCNP at the school.  More 1st level. They have bad security practices (same PWs for all clients), no password rotation **anywhere**, no cold backups I know of, etc. They hate on Cisco because of all kinds of reasons. All employees are young (avg. below 30).  
-- (All this doesn't sound as the best place to start your career IMO)
2. Find another company to do the apprenticeship at.  
++ I get experience with a new company.  
--  I have to find out which company.  
3. Find another education?
-- I probably have to move. I am not much for complex theories.
4. Find a job at a company?
-- Will most likely be helpdesk? And it stops my education path.

---

**Career path**
With both my final project and further education in mind, I have not idea what I want to specialize in. But I could see myself be a sysadmin. I am into automation/scripts, practical work with hardware, and security.

I see the choices:

1. Windows Server
2. Linux
3. Networking

Of course a sysadmin must know something about everything. But for example choosing an apprenticeship means I will be learning network through CCNA/P, and they teach Windows only.

**Any suggestions or ideas are very welcome! I feel like I am totally lost.**"

Edit: I should add that I'm not ruling out a career in the tech industry. It's more like I just want to be able to consider all my options and I'm intrigued by the idea of applying my knowledge to finance."

Today I just turned down an offer at another company which offered me a position in the summer or the fall. I refused because 1) the ""co-op"" office already signed a contract with the first company that hired me and 2) the job is different, but not necessarily guaranteed to be better.

Am I freaking out over small things or should I take this seriously? I'm contemplating pulling out but I wouldn't want to get on the bad side of the career office that might eventually help me get a full-time job later.

One one hand, there's Java. It's got many job opportunities, but mainly in SE. And I kinda don't enjoy the language as much.

On the other hand there's scala. Thanks to Spark , it's gaining traction. And I enjoy writing in it. But the job opputunities are far  less in Scala compared to Java.

I read the FAQ already, which has been helpful, but it doesn't really help me shake any of my anxiety.

Recently, a lot of my classmates and friends have been receiving offers from companies for summer internships, and I'm stressing out because I've just started looking. To make matters worse, I have no job experience and my first semester GPA was a 3.0. My parents aren't really a helpful in the way that while they can offer moral support, they can't really give any helpful advice.

So my question is: Where can I look for internship opportunities other than LinkedIn? Should I still send in a resume/cover letter if a company has a ""3.3 GPA requirement"", or any qualifications that I don't quite meet in general? Any general advice for someone in my situation?

This post is part of [My Career Series](http://allenchou.net/my-career/).  
  
_Note: This post was written before Uncharted 4 went gold, so it might contain tones or implications that Uncharted 4 hasn't gone gold yet. Sorry for the confusion._  
  
I started working on [Uncharted 4: A Thief's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End) almost two years ago, and here we are, less than two months before release. This would be my first shipped title as a full-time game programmer (I shipped [Planetary Annihilation](http://www.uberent.com/pa/) during a summer internship). Looking back now, I realized that I've really come a long way since I first wanted to make games more than a decade ago. I would like to take this opportunity to write down this journey to share with you and as a note for myself.  
  
  
**I Wanted to Work at A Game Store**  
  
My first contact with video games was when my dad got me an original [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) as a present while I was in kindergarten. My only two games were [Super Mario Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land) and [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy)). That's when I got hooked on video games. Later, I saw my cousins getting a Super Nintendo (SNES) when I was in 2nd grade. I went over and played with them pretty frequently, but we had to take turns as the SNES only has two controllers. After bugging my parents, I finally got my own SNES to play with. My favorite games were the [Super Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bomberman) series. I even went and got all of the Bomberman games on the Game Boy.  
  
In 4th grade, one of my friends brought over his Nintendo 64 (N64) and [Super Mario 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64); that was my first time playing a 3D game and it blew my mind. My friend and I made a deal where I would buy games slightly more frequently than he would, and we took turns owning the N64 and the games every couple months.  
  
Around this time, when asked what I wanted to do in the future, I would say that I wanted to work at a game store so that ""I could play video games all-day during work."" This all changed when, in 5th grade, my homeroom teacher brought a PlayStation (PS1) to school to let us play while we waited for our parents to pick us up after school. One day, as we watched in awe as he showed off how good he was at playing games, he said:  
  
""You know what's more impressive than being good at playing games? Making games.""  
  
That, was when I decided that I wanted to make video games.  
  
  
**My Pre-Programming Phase**  
  
Back then, I knew of almost no resources on how to make video games. The best thing I was able to do was make very basic animations that reacted to mouse clicks in [Macromedia Flash 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), which I learned in computer classes. In middle school, I picked up a 3D modeling software called [TrueSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSpace) and started experimenting with building simple character models, which I hoped would be someday used in a game (of course this didn't happen).  
  
When I started high school, I joined the Computer Research Club, in hopes of finally learning the technology behind making video games. On the first club lecture, I discovered that I did not like programming and preferred making game art; programming seemed daunting to me and not as visually attractive as art back then. So, I was detached from the programming aspect of game development for a while and focused on learning [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop) and [3ds Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max).  
  
I was introduced to [deviantART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeviantArt) by a friend of mine in Canada. I started making and submitting art work to deviantART (both 2D &amp; 3D) quite frequently; also, I picked up a lot of spoken English and internet slang along the way. After noticing some Flash games uploaded to deviantART, my interest in making games with Flash re-kindled; I gave another try at programming, and once I got through the steep initial learning curve, it didn't seem as daunting as it had before. I started using [Swift3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_3D) to render 3D models into Flash vector format to put in games. My most complete project was a bunny dancing game called ""R-Squared de Dance!"" which, unfortunately, was never fully finished and was lost. I did submit to deviantART a [Valentine's Day wallpaper](http://cjcat2266.deviantart.com/art/R-squared-Valentine-s-Day-23314724) with all 4 characters, though.  
  
  
**My First Contact with A [Naughty Dog](http://www.naughtydog.com/) Game**  
  
One of my friends visited me and brought his PlayStation 2 (PS2) from the US, along with a copy of [Jak and Daxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter). The PS2 games sold in Taiwan were mostly Japanese titles; this was my first time seeing a PS2 title from the US. I only heard about [Crash Bandicoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot) back in the PS1 days and didn't know that it was developed by the same studio that made Jak and Daxter. Shortly after, during my sophomore year in high school, I got a PS2 because I couldn't resist the temptation after hearing all of my friends talking about their PS2 games during lunch breaks.  
  
During a summer break, my family went to visit some friends in California. I saw that their kids also had a PS2, with a whole collection of US games I'd never seen before. Intrigued, I asked them to bring me to a local game store. They brought me to a GameStop, and on the shelves I spotted a copy of [Jak X: Combat Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_X:_Combat_Racing). That ""weird-looking green-haired guy with an orange giant squirrel-like sidekick"" instantly reminded me of my first sight of the original Jak and Daxter. I thought it looked interesting and decided to give it a try, so I picked up the game.  
  
Jak X brought me a cinematic gaming sensation I had never experienced before. That was when Naughty Dog made a mark on me. I started having crazy thoughts about how amazing it would be if I could work at Naughty Dog. So there I was, staring at Naughty Dog's website, clicking the tempting hyperlink that read ""Want to join us? Click here!"" A question popped up: ""Are you still a student?"" After clicking ""yes"", I landed on a page that basically told me that Naughty Dog did not have opening for interns and ""If you want to join us after graduation, you should pay more attention in math classes."" This, was the pivotal moment that made me adjust my attitudes towards math classes. Math became my favorite subject in high school, and I put a lot of effort in mastering vectors, matrices, geometry, statistics, combinatorics, and probability.  
  
Fun fact: I tried programming a solver for linear systems of two variables in [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), so that I could use it to do my math homework. I did not handle divions-by-zero, and when the computer told me the answers were [NaN's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN), I thought it was mocking me for being a noob, which has similar pronunciation in Chinese to NaN.  
  
In my last high school semester, our Chinese teacher asked us to write a mock-up letter addressed to our dream company, be it real or fictional, and describe ""why they should hire you."" I was the only person writing a letter to a foreign company which, of course, was Naughty Dog. Back then in Taiwan, working for a game company was generally frowned upon by parents and teachers, as video games were ""what made kids bad."" However, I did have good grades, so my teacher did not give me a hard time for wanting to work at a game company.  
  
And there came the nation-wide joint college entrance exam.  
  
  
**Addiction to Naughty Dog Games**  
  
I did pretty well in the exam, so I basically got to choose whichever college and whatever major I wanted. Determined to make games and becoming interested in programming again, I told my parents that I wanted to major in Computer Science. My dad, however, advised against that and suggested that I major in Electrical Engineering. He said that, as a pediatrician, he spent seven years in medical school learning everything besides pediatrics, and focused on pediatrics after becoming a medical intern; his argument was that I should not hop directly into focusing on what I was most interested in with tunnel vision, and should learn other related disciplines first, so that I could have a broader view.  
  
My dad was pretty convincing, so I agreed; I chose Electrical Engineering and focused on hardware stuff, including electronics and integrated circuit design. Meanwhile, I still took some classes from the Computer Science department. Having a low-level understanding of hardware did make it easier for me to learn programming and computer architecture. For instance, I learned how to build computer memory from logic gates, and that helped me understand how memory access works. I also got to learn the gate-level design of full-adders and multipliers, hence their differences and why one is more computationally expensive than the other.  
  
After my parents sent my sister to attend high school in the US, I remembered the fun I had with Jak X, so I asked my sister to send me copies of the Jak trilogy. As I went through the three games, witnessing the incredible work put into the game design and storytelling, I admired Naughty Dog even more and officially became addicted to their games. I went to Naughty Dog's website once more, and saw the reveal trailer of their secret PlayStation 3 (PS3) project, later known to be [Uncharted: Drake's Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted:_Drake%27s_Fortune). I wasn't very into shooters, ""but it's Naughty Dog, it's got to be good."" So I picked up a copy of Uncharted when I visited my sister in the US during a summer break; knowing that the PS3 was not region-locked, I waited until I returned to Taiwan to get a PS3.  
  
I played Uncharted. It was fun and technically impressive; I mean, look at the WATER on Drake's pants! However, it didn't give me the same charm as the Jak trilogy. To me, it felt like just another visually impressive action shooter with endless waves of enemies for target practice. So Naughty Dog dropped off my radar for a while.  
  
Two years later (junior year), I saw the [E3 live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z5pjDpszLM) of [Uncharted 2: Among Thieves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves). It completely blew me away. Did Drake just slide down and jump out of a COLLAPSING BUILDING, while IN-GAME? That sealed the deal. I got the game on release and powered through it; it was such an incredible game: stunning visuals, fun gameplay, awesome storytelling, and lovable characters. This was when I re-gained interest in Naughty Dog.  
  
Then, I graduated from college.  
  
  
**Going Abroad &amp; Joining The Kennel**  
  
Before I started my one-year mandatory military service, I applied for the undergrad program at a college focused on game development, called [DigiPen Institute of Technology](http://www.digipen.edu). I've already written about [my story at DigiPen](http://allenchou.net/2015/07/digipen-the-game-school-i-went-to/), so I'll fast-forward a little bit. [Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_3:_Drake%27s_Deception) came out during my second semester at DigiPen. In spite of a few flaws in storytelling, I still thought the game was fantastic, just when I thought I couldn't like Naughty Dog more.  
  
Soon after, Naughty Dog released the [reveal trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLGxubfC1Ik) for [The Last of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us). This game completely caught me by surprise; a serious post-apocalyptic survival game is quite different from Uncharted's lighthearted adventures. I thought it was a nice change of mood and appreciated that Naughty Dog was willing to try something different. At PAX Prime 2012, I went to Naughty Dog's booth that showed a live demo of The Last of Us. The interior of the demo room was set up to look like the rundown hotel where Joel and Ellie fought the hunters. The demo itself was an impressive demonstration of hardcore gameplay, where Joel and Ellie fought for survival while out-numbered and out-gunned. Such harsh circumstances and pressure imposed on the player was a first among Naughty Dog games. After the demo, I got an Ellie T-shirt and lined up to get an autographed poster by [Neil Druckmann](https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann) and [Bruce Straley](https://twitter.com/bruce_straley).  
  
I got a copy of the The Last of Us right upon release. Being able to emotionally connect to game characters is such a rare and beautiful experience. Ellie felt like a real companion, not just some emotionless sidekick controlled by AI. The rich interactions between Joel and Ellie made the story feel so alive; they fought together, they cared for each other, they shared jokes, and they experienced the same emotions together. Not many games had reached such level of compelling storytelling. I gave Naughty Dog my deepest admiration and respect, again.  
  
When studying at DigiPen, I always had the slightest hope that some day I might end up working at Naughty Dog. After successfully landing an internship at [Uber Entertainment](http://www.uberent.com/) and attending various career workshops at DigiPen, I was confident that I could get a job straight out of college. I had all these plans in my head: getting a job around the Seattle area where DigiPen is (perhaps [Wargaming](http://www.wargaming.net/), [ArenaNet](https://www.arena.net/), or [Sucker Punch](http://suckerpunch.playstation.com/)), working in the industry for a few years, applying for job at Naughty Dog, and then finally working there if I was lucky.  
  
Little did I know that destiny would speed up this plan a little bit for me, where I came straight to Naughty Dog after graduating from DigiPen. You can read this story in detail [here](http://allenchou.net/2014/02/joining-naughty-dogs-kennel/).  
  
So here I am, working at my favorite studio, making Uncharted 4. As a huge Naughty Dog fan, I feel so honored to be working on the closing chapter of Nathan Drake's adventure.  
  
This has really been an uncharted journey.  
  
After Uncharted 4 is released, I will write about what I have been working on since I started at Naughty Dog. Stay tuned. :)"

I haven't interned with any companies, and not for the fact that I haven't looked but rather because I've been working.

I spent the last 18 months working as a part-time full-stack webdev and more recently left that position for a part-time security researcher position (I had actually applied for an internship).

I see a lot of worried posts regarding having no internships, and while I'm not concerned in the least, I'm curious as to what the thoughts of the community are regarding this.

Does part-time work == internship == coop? Is one better than the other? 

The main advantage I can think of for internships is the possibility of getting your foot in the door at a ""big 4"", but I'm not too fanatical about that."

However, I am torn between them, and my deadline to choose is this Friday. Background on me: junior at a pretty good school, with no prior internship experience.

Company A is a startup that seems to be very well funded-they have been growing very quickly and are headed by a team of executives who have been successful in growing a startup in this area in the past. Their office is very nice and modern, the people that work there are closer to my age, and the pay is slightly better than company B. However, the position I was offered is with the front-end team, so I would be primarily working with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which are not really my areas of expertise as I only have basic experience with all of them.

Company B is a more traditional company. It is slightly larger than company A and has been around much longer. They do contract work for the military and aim to build intelligent systems (think AI/ML). They have a lot of PhD's, generally appear to be older, the office environment is less exciting/new, and they pay a little less, although they offered to potentially negotiate up to the other offer. Here I would be working with Java, which I do not really know currently but I am not worried as much about because I have experience with C++/Python.

So my question is this: for someone like myself, where this will be the only internship I have before graduation, which should I choose? I have interests in both fields, but since this will be my only experience, I am worried about being pigeon-holed into front-end dev jobs when I apply to full-time next year with company A. With company B, I am worried that I will find the work boring or will be stuck to more menial tasks due to my lack of academic experience in the areas of ML/AI. Overall, I could see myself working in either field as a full-time job, but I am not sure which I would pick at this point since they are so different.

Any help/insight to this situation would be greatly appreciated!"

One of them said most could not pass a FizzBuzz test. So I went to find the test to see how I'd do. So far, 3 months of learning with CodeAcademy, Automate the Boring Stuff, and CodeCombat (Silly one I know, but it really helped to embed concepts). 



&gt;The ""Fizz-Buzz test"" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:

&gt;""Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.""

99.5% is surely exaggerating, but it made me feel good for a while that I was able to do this between 5-10 minutes of thinking and tinkering. It's a small milestone for most. 

What other tests like this indicate if you're ready to take on an internship to work with python?"

I've been trying to keep a level head about this, even as friends and family are freaking out about it more than I am, but I don't even know what to do at this point. I basically missed out on two months of prime interview time. I've been reaching out to every person I know that may be able to help me and applying to every place I can find that is still hiring, but its been tough. I don't even know where to look any more. Can anyone help with any information that could push me in the right direction? I'm scared that I won't be able to get any type of internship now.

If it matters, I am a Junior. Funny enough, a similar thing happened last year (when I was a sophomore) with a startup that had hired me as an unpaid intern, but then later said they didn't even have enough money for that leaving me without a internship even closer to the summer. Being a sophomore, I was okay with it since I didn't think many sophomores got any type of internship."

I tend to look at the requirements, do some investigation, and then fiddle with things until it works. As an example, I am working with SQL and dealing with a lot of logic and most of the time I change some logic around without really knowing what will happen or at least not right away. If it works, I run a bunch of test cases on it and move on if it continues to work, if it doesn't then I repeat the process. 

I am kind of worried as the more I read, I feel that I am lacking on the knowledge of looking at a problem, writing down a solution, and then going to implement it. I usually have some rough ideas of how to get the data (join x to y and a to b) but when it gets down to it and it isn't producing results, I just start fiddling until a new idea comes or fiddling works out. The worst part is that most often if I don't finish the task in one sitting, it takes me some (sometimes quite a bit) of ramp up time to remember where I was/everything I did the next sitting. I've tried taking some notes now after each session to reduce this but it still happens and ultimately I feel like I'm wasting time. I'm not sure if this is because a lot of things are still new (lots of new tables/data models) or the style of approaching problems is not as well-planned and more experimentation based.

Has anyone ever felt this way and moved towards a more 'sound' approach to solving problems?"

Two weeks ago I interviewed extensively on location for *company*. Today I was contacted by a different member of the same location of *company* for a phone interview for what appears to be an entirely different position. Of course I'd love to explore all possible opportunities but I also don't want to come of as trying to ""play anyone"" for the best angle.

Granted, I didn't realize the internship was for a C# developer or else I might not have applied (I haven't used C# hardly), but I see this term ""strong experience"" thrown around a lot. What is a good quantifier of strong experience? Is it a number of years or lots of side projects? Or is it all HR jargon that I should do my best to ignore? 

Also, is it normal to be turned away by HR from internships for not having enough experience? I was under the impression that as long as you could code and have good grades in your classes you'd have a shot at at least an interview or a phone conversation. If that's not the case, I need to adjust my tactics.

4bkrv6,15,2016-03-22,I feel really lost: Computer Science to Computer Information Systems major,sweetkairi,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4bkrv6/i_feel_really_lost_computer_science_to_computer/,"(I posted this on college confidential as well)

So I'm in my second semester of my freshman year at The City College of New York (CCNY for short). It's an okay school, and I am a computer science major. I'm required to take calculus 1, 2, 3, and differential equations (something like that). I had to drop calculus 1 last semester because I did really bad on the midterm (it was an evening class, my schedule was a whole mess and I really wasn't prepared for the transition to college). I'm retaking it this semester and it's a struggle but I'm definitely understanding the material more. 

I am also taking an Intro to CS course where we're learning C++, and its honestly really hard. The material went from moderate to really complicated, my midterm is in 2 days, and I'm honestly considering dropping the class. I'm not the only one either; most of the class is really lost and the recitation TAs don't help us at all. We literally show up, take a 15 minute quiz (which is impossible, how are we supposed to figure out a C++ problem in 15 minutes???), and leave an hour before the class ends. A friend and I tried to ask the TA for help before a quiz (since we always have a lot of spare time after the quiz is done) and he just said, ""no, we have a quiz soon"". When someone asked him about tutoring, he told us to use the message board where we can ask questions and the instructor posts up announcements, not actual/physical tutoring. We have had 2 group projects so far and the TA was supposed to make us explain/present them in class, but our TA seems like he doesn't know about them. Doubt they'll get graded. I know a fair amount of Python, Ruby and JavaScript, and honestly I dislike how C++ is taught here. I learned through workshops and an interactive classroom setting, more hands-on. The professor here always backtracks, doesn't fully explain things, and kinda assumes we know more than we actually do. The only other Intro to CS professor is even worse.

I've come to realize that this major may not be for me and even though I love programming (when I can learn at my own pace and I have the benefit of a good instructor), I'm terrible at math. I don't think I can deal with another 3 semesters of math. A friend who was a Computer Science major at Pace told me she did well in all her programming classes but her math classes really lowered her GPA. She never graduated and she only had 1 year left.

I'm honestly considering switching from Computer Science (CS) to Computer Information Systems (CIS); it's more of what I want to do with security and programming mixed together, and it involves a lot less math. I'm considering transferring to the New York City College of Technology (City Tech for short) since it has a 2-year program for CIS, and then a Bachelors in Technology if I want to continue, and CCNY doesn't have this major. Only problem is, I've been talking to friends, current students, and graduates, and I keep getting mixed reviews.
Some enjoy the school; one was a CIS major who's graduating soon and he enjoyed how it was very hands-on. He currently works for the MTA. I also heard that there's a lot of internship and job opportunities that are offered (no one takes advantage of them though so its a lot of space available). However, other people have told me that the buildings aren't well-maintained, the environment can be depressing, the students are ""lazy"" (they go to class but don't really excel and a lot play video games in the cafeteria all day), and it feels like high school. Some told me that the professors weren't great, and some don't offer office hours/tutoring. Most classes aren't difficult and the work is ""mediocre"" (a current student's words). I heard from two CS majors that the major classes are hard, and the CIS major who's graduating said the transition from CS to CIS should be smooth. He also enjoyed the school and the environment didn't bother him.

Another problem is that the graduation rate for City Tech is very low: like 15-25% in 6 years or so. I asked a previous student and he said that it's low because a lot of people end up transferring out or dropping out, and a lot of older adults come back while working to take classes /certifications. I'm not entirely sure how a graduation rate is calculated but the low rate in this school really bothers me.

They take walk-ins until August for admission to Fall 2016, and it's not selective at all. My counselor for a success program I'm in is currently on vacation so I have to wait to hear back form her next week about this. I've asked plenty of people and even though I'm 90% set on transferring, I'm not sure if it's the right decision. CCNY has a better reputation, but City Tech has the major I want. I also commute from home: 1 hour and a half for CCNY, while City Tech is only about 20-30 minutes away. It would be a better commute for me and I'd be learning what I want, but I don't know if I'm making a mistake.

A friend who has been working in the programming/IT industry for almost 20 years has told me that it doesn't really matter where you get your degree from or if you even have one sometimes: its about your work experience in the field. And that's true: I've looked at job applications that ask for 5+ years experience, not necessarily a 4-year degree. I do want to get a degree eventually, and I also want to take advantage of internships, but I'm not 100% sure if I'll excel at City Tech. I'm planning to schedule a tour soon once I talk to my counselor and finalize it if I do indeed go through with it.

Any advice? I feel really lost and stressed about this whole situation honestly."

4bl5wt,5,2016-03-23,How to make parents accept what I want to do? Advice? [rant],throwaway139284,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/4bl5wt/how_to_make_parents_accept_what_i_want_to_do/,"throwaway because I don't want my parents to know about this

Asian american, first generation, female (important later), current (undergrad)college student studying computer science (important later), parents pay for all of my financial needs. Dad does medicine related things that are related to chemistry, mom does mom things (don't want to go into too much detail). Compared to other asian parents, they are probably considered lenient and liberal. Growing up, I basically just needed good grades and to let them know where I am if I'm not at school and be back by a certain time (I don't go out much). I was able to avoid a lot of physical and mental abuse but it still happened when I was about to fail a course and they were trying to get me to increase my test scores so that I could pass the course. 

Since before high school, they have been pushing me into pharmacy and made me think that my only option is to go into pharmacy. In other words, they made it so I never considered a career path that wasn't pharmacy. I go along with it because I don't really know what I wanted to do, I was interested in the healthcare field, I liked science classes, and they wanted me to have a high paying job and be successful. I manage to get into the college they wanted me to get into and was accepted into the ""pre-pharmacy"" program (not actually called this). 

After 3 semesters of getting bad grades in all science classes (big difference between the grades I got from science courses and non-science courses) and getting a little more than half way through the pharmacy prerequisites (with some physical and mental abuse), I decided to try something new by taking a programming class. I had never programmed before and never even considered computer science as an option but I have always been interested in it. I take that class and realize that it is something I want to do for the rest of my life. I change my major to computer science. My ""compromise"" was to do a biochemistry minor (only 4 more classes) to make them happy but I don't know if I can do that anymore when I get panic attacks every time I see or hear something related to chemistry (I get panic attacks by just looking at the chemistry building and smelling things that remind me of a chemistry lab). 

Parents are mad that I changed majors (~$3k more in tuition every semester because engineering) and basically throwing away everything I've done since middle school. They also wouldn't admit to friends and family that I was doing computer science. When someone asked them what I was majoring in, they would tell them that I was still undecided. They would rather say I am undecided than say I am studying computer science.  

They think that I can't find a job in computer science despite all the reports of how good a computer science degree is right now. They think that I would have better luck finding a job as a pharmacist even though by the time I graduate with a pharmD, there is supposed to be about half a million more pharmacists than pharmacist jobs (I showed them multiple studies that said this). Their friends even told them their children and their children's peers were having trouble finding jobs as recent pharmacy school graduates. Telling them that there's no way I can get into pharmacy school because of my grades doesn't work either. 

My mom seems to be coming around and encouraging me to do what I want after hearing about how successful her friends' daughters are doing in the tech/business industry. My dad is still very against me doing computer science. He keeps saying that I won't be able to find a job in computer science and that I need to get at least a master's degree. I think his problem is the fact that I'm a female going into computer science. He's completely fine with his friends' kids going into computer science and computer engineering (kids are male) and stopping at bachelor's degrees. 

It doesn't really help that I still can't find an internship for software development (I'm anywhere from 2 semesters to 10+ years behind my peers in terms of programming experience and I don't want to move this summer). 

When my friend tried (multiple times) to talk to my parents to make them understand why computer science is a good field for me to go into, they agree every single step of the way until they try to add me into the picture (when my friend tries to show them that they were actually talking about me the entire time). 

Does anyone else have parents that can't logic?

TLDR: How can I make my parents (mostly my dad) accept that I am doing computer science (and I can be successful with it)? "

They said the offer is a tentative offer which won't lock me into accepting the final offer I'll get upon graduating but will get the paperwork started for the security clearance. The only information I have been given is the salary.

The offer is about 20% lower than the average starting salary for my major at my school but I don't know if I'm a position to counter. My GPA is a little low but the people I interviewed with told me my CS minor and internship experience really stood out and is why they wanted to interview me. I didn't actually apply, they found me through my school's alumni network.

Is it reasonable to ask if there's any chance of increasing the salary at this point and, if so, how would I go about bringing it up gracefully? Is it normal to not be informed of other benefits?

Yes, I did try to report him to no avail.  The only thing that I was able to do was to switch advisors and get an off campus job to try to pay the bills.  The job is horrible and doesn't pay well at all, and it's more or less prevented me from working on my research this semester.  At this rate, graduating will not happen for me.  I like the advisor I am working for (I had worked for him before on joint projects) and I like what I do.  I have grant, scholarship, and fellowship applications out there (about 8...worked all last semester on those things!), but I am not holding my breath anymore...I need to be proactive.  Does anyone have advice for non-traditional funding opportunities...eg, going through military, national lab, or a company?

I have a summer internship lined up in my field in industry so I am super excited for that!

Should I take it?",ColdFUUUUUsionHAAAAA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bnoig/offered_position_working_with_coldfusion/,"Hello all, throw away here in case.

Some background: 
I just earned my B.S. in CS in December with a 3.2 GPA from a pretty shit tier state school.  I have no internships and no relevant work experience.  I've got 2 personal projects, but honestly I probably can't talk about one of them comfortably since it was a while back and it was pretty rushed.  I have no other offers and have only got a tech screening coming up at a very large animation studio (although I have no idea when this is going to happen, I just have a contact there that referred me and told me it's coming).  I've been applying since December ( very late start, I know and I regret it ), and have got a test from google, and 3 interviews ( including this one ).  


I just received an offer for a backend developer.   I was told I'd be working with a really old system that is in ColdFusion.  He straight up told me that the position wouldn't really be good for career development, because ColdFusion is dying.  The pay is pretty low with a 25% bump after 3 months, with no benefits except for standard PTO.  The team would just be me and the lead developer that I interviewed with.  


The job is 2 blocks from my house so that's incredibly nice.  I'm not in a dire situation where I need money to sustain living, but my grace period is running out on my loans and I'd like to be able to start collecting to pay that off asap.


I have contacts who work as a QA at a very large satellite service provider and they feel very confident they could get me in there as a contract QA, and this would be in about ~2-3 months.  Although, I think this is a manual testing job so that might not be much better.  The company itself would be a lot better though.


Should I just take this ColdFusion job and search in the meantime and just jump ship soon as I get something I would like?  Or should I just skip this job and hold out for something else?  


**TL;DR:**
  Just graduated, no internships, no experience.  Received job offer with low pay and no benefits with 25% increase in pay after 3 months and I'd be working with ColdFusion.  Extremely close location.  Should I skip this job or take it and jump ship when I can?"

I'm nearing the end, so I will finish the term, but I'm wondering if my situation has been normal experience for working in computer science or whether this has been atypical.

I work alone maintaining old systems for the most part. I rarely ever talk to or see anyone, so I work remotely. No one reviews my work or helps me improve. I also feel like I'm only learning proprietary things that aren't transferrable. For a while, I was spending all my free time outside of work doing personal projects to keep my skills strong and learn new skills, but I got burnt out. All my free/personal time was spent ignoring my family and fiance so that I could develop myself professionally through side projects, but I just got sick of it and I've hence stopped.

I feel depressed because it feels like I'm doing nothing relevant or meaningful. I feel like my psychological state has gone downhill over the term just from isolation and meaninglessness. I'm wondering whether in the future I will be able to find jobs that challenge me and allow me to develop myself professionally? Or will it always be this race to pursue things outside of work, leaving you no time for balance in life? Are a lot of companies like this, or is this highly unusual?"

To my problem with anxiety: Unless I am with very good friends I can't really handle social situations comfortably. I am usually drunk when with people so I never really noticed it before. But today I had a gathering with a couple people and I stayed sober.

I realized that I am just not at ease in those situations, even if it was just sitting around a table talking and mind you I actually knew the people I was with. I just can't unwind, really.

I sit there unable to even hold a conversation with anybody. When women are present it gets even worse because then I just shut down completely.

Although I was always a rather shy person, I don't think this is simply shyness anymore. And this is really affecting me.

I noticed that also in school I'm not comfortable with interacting with my classmates freely. And seeing that I'll start a new internship in two weeks with completely new people I've never met before I'm also anxious about that.

All of this is a rather recent development, so I am kind of at a loss here. Do you think this is some sort of SA?

Coincidentally I have a appointment with my psych doc tomorrow and I'll definitely talk with him about this."

I want to get out of my place and live the good life elsewhere, so I found the Purdue CS program. I also found a place in Ontario, U of Toronto. The other place was all the way in Scotland, called Edinburgh. These all cost the same (a shitte tonne) so I wanted to compare their programs and stuff.

So from what I learned there is some introductory Java and then some C for memory stuff. Is there a good co-op here? I read somewhere that you can only pick one and must stick with it, but not really sure if that's the case (if it exists). In Toronto they have like an internship, but its like 8 or 12 months and only one. Ya I know you can find others as a CS major but still good to have it to start or as a backup.

I'm not sure what else Toronto offers in their program but apparently the weather is cold there, but whatever. Does anyone know what I should be looking into when choosing one of the schools to go to? Since I completed some first year courses these places just gave me an unconditional, so I can chill until the fall. 

If I had more knowledge on these CS stuff, I could  look at the programs and compare the curriculum, but idk..sigh. 

So what would you guys have for your opinion if you had to choose one? They  are so expensive so I need to figure out as much as I can from all sources."
4bqh7n,1,2016-03-24,Transitioning from Intern to Employee Suggestions,whattododev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bqh7n/transitioning_from_intern_to_employee_suggestions/,"Here is a quick rundown of my situation. Back in May of 2015 I got hired on as an intern in Columbus, Ohio to do mainly C++ and MatLab development, but I also had to typical ""intern work"" of groundtruthing data. Since I started working there I obtained my A.S. in Software Development and I got accepted to a local university where I’ll be getting my B.S. in computer science. I’ve taken control over two projects, help with small scripting to make life easier for full timers, and handle a lot of Q.A. work for some of the other products. My boss spoke with me yesterday and told me he thought I deserved to be paid more and get benefits and he was going to put in for me to get hired. Well his boss instantly approved it, and once some paperwork is done, I’ll be getting an offer letter. 

My major question is how I should handle coming into this situation. I absolutely love my company and I can honestly say that I enjoy all my coworkers, but I understand that I need to look out for myself. My pay is currently $15. Since I’ve started working there I’ve gained tremendous experience in computer vision and machine learning. I am now one of the 3 C++ developers at work and I am starting to keep up with the two full time developers.  I feel like now that I have my degree and the almost year experience I have, I shouldn’t settle for less than $17 an hour. Should I expect a 13.3% increase to my wage like that? 
One of the biggest factors on why I’m not reaching for the stars and trying to get the biggest salary possible is because I really enjoy the type of work I’m gaining experience in. 

#### To Sum It Up
* Started working a year ago at $15 an hour
* I was offered a job today (waiting for offer letter and offical amount)
* Gain experience in C++, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Python, &amp; MatLab
* I want to ask for atleast $17

The biggest issue with me is if they don't want to offer me $17, should I walk? They hired me when I was underqualified but I don't want to be underpaid because of my ""starting wage.""

4bra2r,11,2016-03-24,Pros/Cons of Paid Research versus Internship,IEEEngiNERD,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4bra2r/proscons_of_paid_research_versus_internship/,"Hello all. I've been offered a position as a research assistant at an R1 institution. The position is full time during the summer and is paid, albeit not as much as the internship I have already accepted. However the position would continue through the following school year so I would make more money in the long run. This would give me a chance to develop skills that are outside the scope of an undergraduate degree. The research heavily utilizes digital signal processing to analyze data. Also this position offers more intellectual freedom and autonomy. I've got the option to choose which questions to ask and how to answer them to build towards the larger issue. I also will get a key to the lab to work in whenever I want which is sweet. 

The internship I accepted back in February is full time during the summer. It's also in the power industry which I think I will enjoy but don't know for sure. This is a chance for me to learn something about myself that I didn't know.    The position seems to offer much less mobility. I'll be working directly with professional engineers and am the only intern in the department. Because this is a small company, roughly 150 employees, they do not hire many interns each year. But because of this I will be able to work on a large project and do a professional presentation on my work to the board at the end. This is also my first internship and I will be a junior next year. If I take the research position I will have to rescind my offer, which burns some bridges. However I'm thinking I will enjoy signal processing more than power anyway. 

Those of you that have done research what are the advantages/disadvantages to doing an internship? I imagine that if I plan to go into graduate school that research would be better. Have any of you rescinded an internship offer before? Research seems to offer more mobility in the long run whereas going into industry can pigeonhole you into a specific focus. Also I'm a non traditional student at 27 and this is my second degree. So I need to decide if graduate school is for me sooner rather than later. 

TLDR: Offered a sweet research assistant position at R1 institution. On-going position through summer and school year, potentially entire undergrad. Also offered industry internship. What do? "
4brf9n,4,2016-03-24,Options after graduation (going to Nevada?),Another_Alex,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4brf9n/options_after_graduation_going_to_nevada/,"I graduate at the end of May and its accurate to say that although my GPA is awful my experience more than makes up for it.  (As much as experience can make up for GPA.)  I possibly have the opportunity to do a 3 month internship with the federal government in Nevada.  The reason why I'm interested in this instead of pursuing a job straight away is the following:

*  My field is environmental engineering so being able to work in more than one environment is important for my career.  Its not really, really super important to have immediately.  But its good to have.  (What I mean by physical environment is the desert vs. hilly forested regions which is where I live now.)

*  I've always wanted to live on the West Coast and this would give me the opportunity to explore that option without having to commit for an extended period of time.

*  Since its with the federal government I'm hoping doing this will make applying to federal jobs easier.

*  Again, moving to the West Coast thing.  If its something I decide I want to do it puts me in the perfect place to pursue that geographically.

*  To be totally honest, it gives me three more months of not having to face the ""real world"" and just having fun doing something which I enjoy for the sake of doing it, not because it builds towards something specific.

This is what I'm worried about:

When this internship ends in August I need to have a job.  As in, when I go back to the East Coast I need to have a job ready and waiting for me.  I don't have a lot of wiggle room.  I'm applying to my state's state government and being on the west coast won't allow me to be there if I get an interview with them.  Let alone with private companies.  And I can't afford mental health wise or financially to go back and forth from Nevada and the East Coast the whole summer.

How do I start dealing with this now?  Is contacting recruiters and letting them know that now I'll be free in August or September instead of May a good option?  Are there just fewer entry level jobs available in August and September?

I'm not sure the best way to evaluate my options.

Thank you."

Originally I had thought as long as I had the right courses and knew some languages and a small personal project or two, I could at the very least land an interview for a Software Development internship  this summer, but so far no dice.  I know I'm a little late to the game but out of maybe 50 or so applications over the past couple months -- keyword optimized as best as possible without straight up lying -- I have gotten one phone screen and one upcoming interview for a ""DevOps"" Co-op.

I had a feeling that the ""BAAS"" or Computer Information Systems major might be hurting me, but from reading posts on here about all the non-CS degree developers I figured it might not matter much, especially since most job descriptions listed the degree requirements as ""Computer Science *or related field*.""  I only used that particular degree since it allowed transfer of all my AAS credits.

Most of the courses I'm taking could be put towards a BS in Comp Sci , but changing majors would add a couple of semesters which could be tough financially.

ManagerMom: Great, Here's the account info. I'll got to run out to a lunch meeting but I'll reach out again afterwards.

I signed on to their account and start looking through the charges. Right under the bill is a bright orange link for usage terms. That's where the Oh shit, kicked in.

Manager: WHAT?! Oh my God, oh my God! How did this happen? It was a free account. How can they do this? Why doesn't it have some type of max limit set??

Me: Yeah, it looks like someone manually increased that limit from $200 last Friday night to $200,000.

Manager: Oh my God, Oh my God, @#%$!!! What do I do?! How is that possible the limit on the credit card is only $5,000.

How can we evict her without being associated with drugs?",Dowser_Dan,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4btkco/one_of_my_roommates_has_started_selling_narcotics/,"Hi,  I currently live in **Boston Massachusetts**.  I found an apartment with a small group of other people, I'm a student so finding relatively nice apartment at a decent price seemed like a great setup.  Except one of the three other people I live with was a major pot user (or at least I thought that was all at the time) and studies some BS major so she has lots of ""free"" time.

The first semester was fine, I just asked her to smoke in her room but this eventually  lead to her and her sketchy friends smoking in the common area (which was really ok), I did technically purchase weed from her once but other than her account there's no record of that happening.

Lately she's started having friends over until 2:30am almost every week-day, although my other roommates and myself have confronted her about this as professionally as possible (asking nicely, and coming up to ask them to quiet down late at night).  She's also started making ""rules"" about the apt like who can use what shelves, when people can be over (ironically making a rule about no ""loud noise"" or ""guests"" after 1am, a rule she regularly breaks), and sending a barrage of texts whenever she finds something ""wrong"" in the apt.  For reference here she has an ""internship"" where she ""works"" 20 hours a week at an improv club.  This just means she has even more ""free time"" to find things to complain about.  My other roommates and myself are in classes and generally don't have time to worry about petty things she finds to complain about (which she labels as us being ""inconsiderate"").

What's most worrying is that she not only has a mild coke addiction (using more than once a week for the past 5 months), at times going on ""party binges"" of 6-days or more at times using up money she pays rent with.  She's also started **selling both marijuana and cocaine** from the apartment.  I was sort of ok with the weed, but since she has her ""clients"" come to the apartment to pick up, I'm starting to get really uneasy.  Also, her rants are becoming more and more abusive and accusatory.  She was gone for SXSW last week (where she was ironically arrested for public intoxication, such a surprise right?), and the apartment was as peaceful and clean as its ever been.

Initially I just wanted to ride it out, and move into a new apt in September, but now I'm really considering having her evicted.  Since our lease specifically outlines the possession of narcotics is means for eviction.  Myself and my other roommates just don't want to be charged for knowing she was selling marijuana, or implicated for purchasing marijuana from her.

I'd also like to avoid any of this going to court.  She's going to university on a full scholarship and is tight on money so I doubt she'll be able to afford a court case, but I'd also like to avoid tainting my currently clean record.

**TLDR; One of my roommates is starting to be abusive and is selling both marijuana and cocaine from my apartment.  Myself and other roommates did purchase marijuana from her but don't have any in our property in the apt.  We want to evict her (due to a term in the lease that sights possession of narcotics as means for eviction for a Tennant) but we don't want to end up getting charged for knowing she was selling weed.  We also don't trust a single thing she says (she's been caught dealing marijuana multiple times before as well)**

Any advice on how to go forward with this?  Sorry for the rant, just a bad situation and didn't know where to ask for help."

Long time lurker feeling lost.

My goal upon graduation is to get a great computer science job (either Big Tech [Google, FB, Amazon, MS, etc.] or unicorns[Uber, Palantir, Dropbox etc etc]), preferably in the US but don't mind if it's in Canada in one of the reputable companies (Amazon Mississauga, IBM Markham etc.). I'm willing to relocate anywhere on the continent really.

I want to know whether this is a realistic goal given my scenario, and whether anyone else has achieved it from my position, but more importantly, what I need to do in order to get there.

My scenario: 

I am approaching the end of my 3rd year of 5. This means that apart from this upcoming summer, I have one more summer to get an internship.

So far I don't have any computer science job experience whatsoever (no internships). No internship for this summer either, had some interviews but failed (see below). Applied to GSoC but that's a 50-50. My school is a no-name Canadian school (global ranking 200+, not a target CS school at all), and my GPA is ~3.5. I don't have significant personal projects but I am working on expanding one and have an idea for another major one. I'm going to be working on them in the summer. I am not particularly well-prepared for technical interviews but I will be going through Skiena, CTCI, PIE etc in the summer. Lastly, I am not so great with interviews in general, not very well-spoken, get sweaty, stuttery and nervous which leads to not being able to answer questions to the best of my abilities. This is also something I will be working on, thinking of joining Toastmasters or something.

I realize that I have somewhat of a plan but I want to know if people have been in my shoes and have any other tips. Is my dream unrealistic?

TL;DR: No internships so far, school name is belch-worthy, shitty interview skills, want a Great Job when I graduate in two years, what do?"
4btp92,1,2016-03-24,Signing forms before formal interview?,DarthNihilus1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4btp92/signing_forms_before_formal_interview/,"I applied to an IT Security internship for the summer. I've been contacted and conducted a brief phone interview (describe current work experience, favorite classes, knowledge of certain languages/systems) and am set up to do a phone interview (would have been in person if it were not for distance) and the recruiting contact has asked me to sign several legal forms BEFORE this interview is conducted.

I apologize if this is normal but I am curious.


She said she'd accept them within the week after the more official phone interview, but I don't feel comfortable signing official things that may not be needed or appropriate before any interview. 

Does this mean the interview is a formality at this point? I need to be weighing my near future options and this, albeit the first tangible opportunity for the summer, was not described exactly the same across the places I've seen this listing and I can shoot for higher if I stick to applying to more places.


In any case, I'm just curious."
4bv0q8,9,2016-03-24,"Seek employment elsewhere, stay where I am for now or leave when the time comes?",EverSilent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4bv0q8/seek_employment_elsewhere_stay_where_i_am_for_now/,"Hi, sorry for the vague title, but I couldn't really think of something that's descriptive enough for my situation. 

Essentially, I'm currently on work experience. I'm working as an intern, and I'm in my 3rd year of my degree. The intern work is 9-5, and is also counted as a part of the degree (standard bsc in computing). Naturally, working 9-5 I get paid... but very, very little. 

Now, normally since I'm in an intern position that would probably be pretty standard, however the company I am working at is basically throwing full time work at me. I had to learn a myriad of new technologies *fast* when I started working, and I've been working on small-medium size features that customers see. As well as that, I spent 2 weeks refactoring the entire codebase to newer standards by request of the only other developer on my part of the project. So, essentially, I'm an intern working pretty stressful, full time work where I am a big or relatively big cog in the system.

Now... as you can imagine, a company that pays people intern wages and asks what you would expect from a graduate with a few years experience is... really not the most ideal place to work. In fact, it is the polar opposite. I'll spare some details here, however trust me when I say the boss is a very difficult person to please. I'll spare some details there.

The other issue, as well as it being a pretty terrible place to work, it is also going to be of little value to me learning wise. Reason being the only other programmer on the project is quitting in a months time. So... there goes a very large chunk of what I can learn from working here (which is largely the point, this is part of my degree).

Now, my contract expires in just over a month, however I know for a fact I'm going to offered a tiny raise to stay during the summer months. That being said, I dunno if I should. Money is money, I don't know if I can get a job elsewhere. Certainly I'd love to, but is there really anywhere that'd accept me for the summer? I'd even happily settle for part time work post summer in another company for what hours I can manage per week but I know a fairy tale when I see it.

I should mention that if I leave at the start of the summer, there is no one left to train the new intern (Yes, new intern...) on how to maintain the project. Now, mind you, I seen some of the guy's work. He is a good bit behind me, and I personally am only just about capable of doing the job maintaining it for the summer. I could certainly teach him, but if I'm not there to, there is no one who can teach him. What I am trying to say is I think I have a lot of leverage. How should I use it if I am going to stay?

tl;dr -- -- I have a crappy job as an intern. I am going to be asked to stay for the summer, do I try to use the leverage that I have to get better pay or should I start finding other offers now?"

I was previously in school for chemistry (I got an associate's degree in chem lab tech), but decided to switch to CS instead of continuing down that path.

I've only been programming for a year and a half and I feel like I've learned a great deal in that amount of time. I've had phone interviews with Google and both phone and on-site interviews with Bloomberg for internships. I didn't get any of the positions, but I still think that even acquiring that on-site interview was an achievement, considering the short amount of time I've been programming for. 

I've recently come to sort of a plateau in my learning. I feel like I have a firm grasp on a lot of programming fundamentals, but I don't know how or in what direction to expand my skills.

I'm constantly trying to learn new things, but I often get discouraged after a week or two and move on to something else. There is so much to know in this field that I feel it is impossible for me to get a firm grasp on anything beyond the fundamentals that never change.

I want to be good at programming. I want projects under my belt. I want a fully fleshed out GitHub account that people can look at and be impressed by. But I currently feel like a level 19 Magikarp. So close to actually being useful, but all I can do currently is splash around.

I just wish I had some direction so that I could know where to spend my energy. I imagine many of you have felt the same way. What did you do to get yourself to that next level?"

As an intern there, I'm using ESXI a lot to manage virtual machines for the devs so I would like to set up a homelab at my home to help myself learn. I have quite a bit of home server experience (Apache, deluge, SSH, Plex, etc) so I'm just looking for some input here. 

I only own one computer that I can leave on as a server, though. So this might be kind of tricky. Here are the specs:

* i5-750

* 12gb DDR3 1333

* 2 available rj45 ports

* Arch Linux

Currently, I've installed VMware Workstation and ESXi on a 100gb partition. I've allocated 6gb of my memory to this machine as well. From here, I'm wondering what the best course of action is. Ideally, I would like to have 4 VMs living within this machine that handle all of the networking for my intranet:

* DHCP server (centos)

* DNS cache/adblocker (debian/pihole)

* PFSense

* Active Directory (WS2012)

1) Do you guys think that my computer will be beefy enough to handle running all three of these VMs 24/7 without slowing it down too much? It's the main computer I use for pretty much everything so it can't be too bogged down by virtualization. 

2) Is there anything else you recommend that I do to help myself learn? 

3) Any other helpful servers I should set up for my home lab?

4) How exactly do I manage the physical aspect of this lab? Do I run two additional patch cables from my available RJ45 jacks to my router and assign them static IPs from my router? And then tell Arch Linux, cell phones, my laptop, etc to use those IPs as the DNS server and such?"

First let me explain a little - I made sure to focus on a couple of big projects as this seems to be the norm with engineering resumes. I'm guessing hiring managers get a better sense for your abilities from 'I did such and such on this project to this and that end result' rather than 'i worked at such and such place for 2 years and was in charge of x y z.' I left off a job I had a while ago that wasn't engineering related (drove delivery truck for an industrial sheet metal fab company). One specific question I have is whether I should include this and omit one of my projects.

I did not have the money to attend an out-of-state school without going into huge debt (FAFSA is a troll) and settled for what many would say is an average state school. If it's helpful to know, I did not start coding seriously until September 2015 (I did HTML/CSS on my own though).

Regardless, I landed an internship at a ""big 4"" equivalent company as a freshman (no, this isn't EP, Explore, or a freshman program).

Here are some tips that made a huge difference for me:

1. Find a company that you are interested in on LinkedIn and email one of their tech recruiters with a brief message about yourself that shows your ""enthusiasm"" for contributing to their company and hints at wanting to have a phone call/coding test. I personally found great success with this - if I hadn't done this, I probably would've gotten no reply for many companies (as a fresh from a state school).

2. Get a job working part-time as a software engineer in your field of interest (I like webservices/APIs/full stack). This one took a lot of work and a lot of luck for me. I applied to like 500 companies and probably got like 5 replies. Now some of you may say that a full-time student doesn't have time for working part-time. I somewhat agree for difficult schools, but for someone who is at an average-difficulty state school in freshman year, I think there is definitely time each week to work if you build a schedule around it (I worked/am working 30-40 hours a week on 14-18 credits). RIP my social life somewhat. Regardless, working 30-40 hours a week with code is going to force you to get better no matter what.

3. Practice the heck out of Leetcode/HackerRank (especially string manipulation, arrays, hash tables, sorting algorithms, traversal). You should know Binary Search Trees and various algorithms (BFS/DFS/Size/etc), but I personally did not get many of the less used in real-world data structures (BSTs/LLs/Graphs). Then again, I didn't interview at Two Sigma or Jane Street.

4. Do not get discouraged from failing interviews. I like to think of interviews as interview practice (the more you fail, the better you get). I probably failed at least 30 interviews in this journey (after applying to/cold-emailing 500+ companies).

Debatable:

1. Make an eye-catching resume. This one is probably not as big, but having a nice design can make you stand out. At the very least, use the CTCI resume format so that you aren't hurting your chances by having a badly-organized resume.

Anyways, I hope this helped out some of you who may in the same boat (or a different one?). Feel free to ask questions/PM for advice."
4bzktg,1,2016-03-25,Two summer scenarios,excursionist,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4bzktg/two_summer_scenarios/,"So, I've been sending out applications and had one interview, but at this point I don't have an internship related to my major (mechanical) lined up for this summer. (This will be the summer following my third year in college out of five total.) I'll keep applying, and am also working on possible research assistant spots with faculty at my school. But at the end of the day I may be looking at picking between the following two summer scenarios:

1) I previously worked two summers at a fairly large technical facility in a position that I'd call somewhat technical but not engineering per se (this was in the safety office). There's a fairly good chance I can get that for a third summer. Networking my way into an engineering spot at the same org, however, hasn't panned out yet, and it isn't clear that going back for a third summer would help on that front. Also, my expenses are really low, so money is not a big driver here.

2) Otherwise, I can devote the summer to a project or projects that hopefully might add to my resume. This might be something that would involve doing some designs in SolidWorks, getting parts fabricated and putting together a mechanism of some type. In this scenario I might also spend part of the summer working on skills like Matlab and Python.

So, if you were me and those were the two choices, which would you go with for the summer?

I need advice on whether I should still try to get into the CS program at UW (from what I've read on here, it's insanely competitive). My highschool stats are:

- GPA: 3.98
- SAT: 2180/2090 (800 R, 620 M, 760 W), (710 R, 730 M, 650 W)
- Swim Team Varsity all four years, went to state twice and was team captain senior year
- National Honor Society Officer (Webmaster)
- Self studied AP CS and got a 5 on the exam
- Internship doing CS at a national lab
- Volunteered at local library
- Did club swim for a billion years

I thought I had a pretty good shot, so I'm pretty shaken, but essentially my question is, should I pursue CS at UW? I really have a passion for it, but am worried that I'll be screwed after two years... I have an offer from Cal Poly to go directly to their CS program, but I really had my heart set on UW.

4c0ky6,1,2016-03-26,Advice on leaving my old job for a new offered job.,mackemist,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4c0ky6/advice_on_leaving_my_old_job_for_a_new_offered_job/,"So I work in an FDA regulated medical manufacturing company, and recently got an offer from a much larger/global company handling their IT area.

My current pay is 25/h., which the new job said they'll match., plus full benefits. With lots of opportunities for growth. Overtime pay @ 1.5 10-20/h per week average.
Btw.. I'm a workaholic, I do my 40 there, plus 15-25 on Uber. And research with stocks.

I dont feel i should ask for more as they are also training me for 3 months to get fully in sync with their software and flow. Then I will be transferred to night shift( which I am 100% ok with, no kids btw). Leaves my mornings to pursue school more and not deal with people and traffic while shopping. I am also leaving my current city for another where housing is 4x less., so I am excited about that too.

I have a lot to gain on this new job., but! I know my old job is going to freak out when I give them my two week notice. Reason for it., they are new owners and most of my work is not scripted or written anywhere. Everytime I tried leaving before I got 3-4$ raises to stay (with the old owner). I can probably get more from them especially now., but I dont want to stay anymore (unless they compensate me enough to equal the 4x housing costs, &lt;80/h)

However., I don't mind keeping my options open with the old job just in case things dont work out. How am going to pull this off? I feel I have a plan. The new job is giving heavy training that I can utilize and implement into my old job, which they would benefit a lot from., so I was wondering what is the best way to deliver the news and try to cut a deal while keeping the ball in both courts.

Work part time managing the old one through remote services? Claim I am taking a 3 month internship? Have them ship raw products to me and drop ship them from my new location to the customers?

What would you do?"
4c2av1,1,2016-03-26,"[20 F] MilSO, engagement is on the rocks, about to graduate with AA Advertising but feeling like I need to serve a ""higher purpose"".",br0kensins,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4c2av1/20_f_milso_engagement_is_on_the_rocks_about_to/,"Hi, reddit. :-)

I'm a 20 YO female living in South Texas. I attend a local community college and will be graduating with an Associate's in Advertising-Public Relations in May. It took me three years to get here, and, as life would have it, I'm not really even sure I enjoy my major. I feel like community college has taught me nothing, and I'm just receiving a piece of paper with an obscure purpose.

I'm also currently in a relationship - well, actually, I'm not even sure at this point. But, I was in a relationship of 9 months with my fiance [20 F], who is in the military (Army). We had decided to get married upon her return from her current deployment (9 months, Korea), which is probably going to be late this year. I'm not sure exactly when she'll return, but she shipped off in January. Problem is, she recently cheated on me and I'm not sure where that leaves us. I am still very upset about it and have not made any amends.

I currently work at an internship in the Graphic Design/Marketing department of a local museum, and it's actually pretty cool, I enjoy it. I like design (which is what my college studying has been geared towards), and I think it would be very satisfying to actually get paid to do it. I've always loved art, and I enjoy graphic design. The problem is, as much as I feel that I enjoy it, I wonder if it would be very fulfilling farther down the road. I have recently (over the past year or so) felt the need to do something with my life that is ""worth something"", or that serves some kind of purpose. I don't feel like I know any skills worth knowing; or any skills at all, really. It makes me feel useless and down on myself. I technically shouldn't even have landed this internship - my background in graphic design comes solely from a semester I spent out-of-state, at a private college. I have learned nothing in my 2 1/2 years at community college (except maybe how to work 40-hour weeks and still manage to keep up with class, because my classes are somewhat of a joke). By sheer luck and fairly good BS'ing skills, I managed to land the internship that will probably end when my classes are over.

I am a bit averse to joining the military, after experiencing it through my (ex?) fiance. The toll that the military has took on her makes me apprehensive of enlisting, so while it's always been an option, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to take it. I have had an interest in EMS for quite a while, and that's been a heavily considered option. I know it makes hardly any sense, as I have no background in medical whatsoever (unless House and Grey's Anatomy count :-).) But it seems like it would be something that would prove to myself that I can do something that is worth living for. Something that challenges me to my limits - something that will make me realize what my limits even are. Something that will make me feel fulfilled, something with purpose.

Also, I live at home with my grandmother, who has insisted that I move out by this July/August. I can virtually go anywhere, as I don't really have anything tying me down to any one location. My (ex?) fiance will be at Fort Hood when she comes back, but I'm not counting on any plans with her at this point, because I don't know where our relationship is going to stand by the time she returns. Oh, and I don't want to live in South Texas anymore. :-) Not sure about the rest of Texas.

Advice for such a change in interests, rocky relationships, long distance, military, EMS, and how to pick a place to move to with virtually no direction would be appreciated. Or, hell, just drop in and say hi, if you're just as lost as I am. :-)

**TL/DR:**
[20 F] getting an Associate's in Advertising that I'm not sure I enjoy. I want to do something that will achieve a sense of self-fulfillment, and fulfillment of a feeling of purpose. Engagement with military fiance is on the rocks, she's not due to return from overseas until the end of this year. I have looked into EMS but not even sure where I'll be living in a few months. I am lost. :-) "
4c2zzb,6,2016-03-26,Summer Courses or Internship? (or both?),Alpha-B,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4c2zzb/summer_courses_or_internship_or_both/,"I am currently a Junior in college with no real work experience in the field (CS Major). My only experience was last summer when I volunteered in one of the university office buildings helping out with desktop support. Other than that I've only held a few retail and fast food jobs. 

I am thinking of doing an internship but I also would like to take summer classes that would help me graduate on time. If I don't take these classes, I most likely would have to stay for an extra semester to complete all my credits, which would cost me a lot more than doing the summer classes now. Two of the classes are online but the other is in class for 6 weeks from mid-May to the end of June (4 days a week from 9am-11am). Basically my schedule would be for the first 6 weeks i have one online and one in-person class. And the next 6 weeks I would take another online class.

I would like to know your opinions on if it is worth it to take the classes in order to graduate on time and not have to pay for an extra semester, or if I should go for an internship and try to get some experience? Also, I have never applied for an internship, so does anyone know the likelihood of a company working around my schedule for the first 6 weeks until I am done with the in-person class?"

Beyond that, what am I missing? How important are internships and co-ops? What about game dev conferences, extracurricular activities, etc? How do I keep my options open in the event that game development isn't what I should to be doing?

By the way, my long-term goal is to create a game that becomes a large esport, so the activities I partake in should facilitate that."

This problem started about a week ago. After about an hour of streaming Netflix on Chrome, my computer crashes. It isn't a ""normal"" blue-screen crash where it displays at least some sort of error, but it just blanks both my computer screens out entirely, either black or some other color, usually tan or purple, with absolutely no text. When it does that, ctrl+alt+del doesn't work, I can't shut anything down, and I have to do a manual power off/restart. A list of my computer parts is shown below:

-Motherboard: ASUS ROG Maximus Hero VII 
-CPU: Intel i7-4790k Devil's Canyon Quad Core
-RAM: G.SKILL Trident X 4x8 GB DDR3 2400
-GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 970 w/ ATX 2.0+
-OS: Windows 10 that I upgraded from Windows 7 pro
-SSD: Samsung 850 Pro 256 GB (also holds my boot for my OS)
-HDD: WD Black 1 TB 7200 RPM
-PSU: EVGA Supernova GOLD 850 W
-CPU water cooler: Corsair H100i w/ 240mm fans

At first, I thought it was a problem that went beyond just Chrome/Netflix, but I also spent a few hours each day using Chrome for applying to internships and school work WITHOUT using Netflix, and everything went fine. I've also spent a few hours each night playing the Witcher 3 on ultra settings and everything goes well. But stream Netflix for an hour or two, and it decides to shit the bed.

To start trying to come up with some solution, I enlisted the help of my friend that is my tech guru. Our first solution was to put my computer into safe mode, uninstalled my current drivers for my GPU, and manually installed the most current ones again. Didn't fix the problem. We then tried a memtest to check if my RAM was working the way it should be - it is. Still have the same problem. We then did a Prime95 torture test. It reached 100% load on my CPU, but it didn't crash, which is good. BUT I still have a problem. Then as a last ditch effort, we uninstalled Chrome and re-installed it. Still crashes after an hour. I've also installed WhoCrashed to try and find what exactly is crashing, but it comes up with nothing.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I've tried looking everywhere to try and find a solution. It's not like this is a huge problem, but it's still annoying and I don't want it to become an even bigger problem. So please, any help or insights would be helpful."

My department is segregated from the other i.t. departments so its hard for me to learn from the actual sysadmins and the likes so getting a position I could gain more career knowledge in would be very beneficial.

However, I've become stuck choosing between 3 choices: 

Western Washington University (WWU)- mid sized liberal arts call eve with a good undergrad cs program which many compare to University of Washington's. 

Oregon State University (OSU)- A larger public university which seems to have a decent CS program as well as many opportunities for internships and work study. 

Purdue University- Very well known for computer science as well as having tons of opportunities for internships. 

This choice is really bothering me because I can see a lot of benefits to all of these universities. Western is cheap (since its in state for me) and also has a good undergrad program but isn't nearly as recognizable as the other universities. Oregon State gives me a lot of opportunities to do work study as well as get internships but I don't know how good their program is. Finally, Purdue is a bit of a special case because I didn't get into the CS program there but was offered the opportunity to apply to any other major (I chose IT with the intention to transfer). I'd go there if I thought it would work out but obviously I can't predict the future and have no idea if I'll be able to transfer into the cs program. 

Cost won't be a huge issue in the decision but I obviously don't want to waste my parent's money. If anyone has any advice on what I should do it would be greatly appreciated. 

Just as a side note these are the only 3 choices I have and UW is not on the board because I got turned down from there.

I originally had a week to work on this, and I initially told them a week is fine. 

But I found myself completely slammed this week. The company I'm interviewing with knows that I currently work somewhere very demanding where putting in a lot of hours is common. So I emailed them this morning asking for an extension so that I could get next weekend to work on it. It's due sometime tomorrow. 

I figure I should've emailed them during the week sometime rather than waiting until Sunday. But I wanted to ask if you guys think that they'll be likely to be cool with it. If you're a hiring manager or someone who has given interviews before, how would you respond to the situation? If you've been in a similar situation, what happened to you?

My question is, for next year as a student on a Pre-Med track (or even during the summer) what can I start doing to really better myself? (internships, volunteer work, shadowing, grades, organizations, clubs, pretty much anything that I could do to be a more well-rounded student).

I know that probably seems very vague and pretty easy to figure out, but I want to hear what others who have or currently share the same track as me have to say. I guess I just came to the realization now that I really want to be the best I can, because I don't want to be in any way similar to the person I was in high school (mainly academic at this point). I really struggle to find the motivation to study, but I know I need to do it and I really want to better myself now, starting today, so I can potentially change my life. 

Thanks for listening. "

I'm currently a senior Computer Science student (graduating in December of 2016, not May). Originally I had intended to get an internship for this last summer I'll have, to gain some professional work experience. But now I have the opportunity to develop an Android application for a company I won't name here. I have a lot of personal projects under my belt at this point. Most of them are related to mobile development, but not all of them. Also, I have done some contract work in the past, but it was less official than what this would be.

Basically my question is this: can working as a contracted Android developer give me comparable work experience (in terms of what an employer would see on my resume) to what I could expect to gain from an internship?

The prospect of working as a freelance developer after I graduate college does interest me, and I know that this would be a good way to get my foot in the door. I just don't want to close out any options I might have otherwise had. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Directionless after high school, I chose to go to a state school and major in I.T. This degree was pretty ""soft"" as far as far as technical ability is concerned. It was a type of degree that made you okay at everything but a master of none. I noticed this after my sophomore year was up but decided I should stick through it as I could gain experience at an entry level job and I would most likely be better off with a four year degree than without one. And enjoyed working with computers. To add to this my ability to do complex Math is sub par, so computer science seamed like a bad choice. This major seamed like my best option. 

During the summer I got a web development/design job for a local company. At the tail end of that summer I developed a severe anxiety/depression issue as I started my senior year. I battled through my final courses while getting my mental health under control. I then graduated. Knowing I need more experience I started looking for jobs and of course, things haven't been working out. I've had a few interviews for basic networking, working with databases (Using SQL server and T-SQL). I'm glad I got the interviews but I have been coming up short. I'm mediocre and it shows. 

I would like to point out that I don't think I will really be happy in the I.T. field for the long haul, I chose it because I thought I could make good living and I like working with computers. I'm a creative person, I love writing, philosophy, working with my hands, cars, comedy. I'm good with people, no one seams to hate me. I have good ideas floating around my mind all day, but I can't seam to get any of them in motion. Mostly because of money issues.

I've been working on bettering myself and my anxiety/depression is in a much better place. However, Im almost 23 and I'm watching my life turn upside down. I'm tormented everyday that I'll be at a shitty job forever, and I do nothing besides apply for entry level jobs that I probably cant get. I did well in school and loved learning and I miss it. I have tons of hobbys and ideas for things but they lead to nothing. I need to be making a lot more money than I am now (25k). 

My questions are as follows...

I can work on getting my ccna and get into networking. This would be a hard skill that businesses want. Hopefully I can get an internship when i do this and have an in with a company. 

I can go back to school for business, get further in debt and be out by 25, and be more employable. 

I can really polish my resume maybe get into some database work, gain experience, move up from there and maybe go to school on the side. 

Scrap the whole thing an just say IT work isn't for me. Go into a trade and better myself as I go. 

I realize I'm right where I should be in life. No where. I let life happen to me and it's my fault, no one elses. I'm looking for ideas, clues, maybe personal experiences. I'm ready to grab life by the horns and work my ass of. I'm just not sure what to do. 


sorry for the long post.

The thing is what I really like about computer science is creating ,codes , ""worlds "", softwares , where  I let my creativity and my intelligence free (but I always keep the objective in mind ) ,where I make the rules and understands whats going on and where I am able to add,change , evoluate my creations .

I know for sure than coding is my thing , I really love it and I can do it for the rest of my life as a job . 

But ....but networking seems really cool as well and unfortuantely so far the few classes I had about it were lame classes but I don't want to misjudge it  I know it could be interresting .

It's just that I don't want to focus my self and my career on coding and then have regrets like ""Oh I wonder what it would have been if  Iwas into networks "" . 

Both of the interships are paid the same ,with the same amounts of hours per week , that's not what interrest me anyways . The point of this intership is my self-developpement .


Edit : I forgot to tell , my prime factors are money , evolution (in terms of career/jobs)  and the job itself (I would prefer working on stuff that interrest me ) . Which brings me a question, won't Big Data/networking jobs pay more (if they don't already ) than coding jobs in the next 5-20 years?


After that 2 year undergraduate degree I plan on doing  a master Degree of Software engineer and I will specialised my self depending the outcome of the internship.

I've been a long time lurker and right off the bat, I just wanted to say thank you for being such a great resource. 

About me:

* 2.9 GPA at a non-target state school. 

* Luckily I got 2 internships and from those experiences, my biggest takeaway in terms of technical skills was learning SQL, and Java.

* I have a couple of projects on my resume but nothing impressive.


My situation:

I have the option of graduating this May or delaying my graduation to Fall 2016. I've been applying to full-time positions but haven't received the kind of traction/results I wanted. Although I do have offers from both companies that I interned at, I rejected the first because:

* The amount of technical debt and bad practices they're dealing with is crippling the organization IMO.

* High turnover (Example: They've been trying to hire a senior developer to be the ""technical voice"" in the organization and help with their tech debt, but has been filled 3 different times in 1 year. Also, my manager when I was intern there who was an exceptional guy has left as well.)

* When I was an intern there, they didn't let me get involved with other teams/projects, and when I spoke to them about the full-time offer, it seems the same will occur. 

Now as for the offer from the second company I interned at, I'm still holding off since I'm still interviewing with other companies. Although I think I will learn a lot and grow well working for this second company, I was hoping to get better offers. So, I was thinking if I give myself more time to get ready for tech interviews, and build more complex projects that I've been wanting to work on, I'll get more and better offers. So far I feel like my job hunt has been a failure and the offer I'll end up accepting is an offer I got just because I interned at that company already. Should I delay my graduation or is that just being greedy?"

3). The only classes I've taken at school at the moment are

- discrete structures.

would it be best to start applying for internships?  The only resource I'd be stuck with is stuff like Cracking  the coding interview since I haven't taken a real data structures class yet.

They did, however, mention doing data analysis and something about databases. And also doing a presentation to a senior leader at the end.

I've spoken to the hiring manager in a phone interview and asked if there was a way that this could translate into a full-time position and was flat-out told no, though it could be a recurring contract position with the contracting company.

If they decide to go with me would it be wise to quit my full-time position for this opportunity or should I just keep searching for full-time work? I've found it hard to translate from being a Production Engineer to Desktop Support/IT Support when asked. I don't really have many expenses/college debt to pay off and part of me thinks this would be a good opportunity to get my foot in the door, but at the same time the uncertainty of the four-month contract and not having the possibility of it translating to a full-time position is giving me cold feet.

Any thoughts? Sorry if this is all over the place."

4cc495,1,2016-03-28,Focus on college or keep splitting attention with temp job?,JT1989,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4cc495/focus_on_college_or_keep_splitting_attention_with/,"So I'm a vet and currently using my G.I. bill to go to school. For those unfamiliar, it pays tuition, some of books, as well as a monthly stipend to help with cost of living. Initially I used it to go to a technical school and I got what I was hoping would be a promising internship from that. 

I got the paid internship last January while I was still in school. For the next 10 months I went to class in the morning and worked at night. The pay was decent and in conjunction with GI bill, I was living comfortably. When I finished school I was told I would be working 40 hour weeks. I like the job a lot, very independent, boss looks out for his people, once I take over for the guy who is retiring my worth goes up. Plus experience in a prestigious field. But because I'm still considered a temp so I make the same amount as when my skills we very rudimentary and I don't receive benefits or paid time off. My temp pay was just barely paying the bills if not putting me slightly behind every month. 

So in January I decided to go back to school to get the GI bill money again. To get the most use out of the time I need to take 12 credits, so I'm taking 2 night classes and 2 online. I'm definitely burning myself out, and going full time on both is going to cause my GPA to suffer. The sadder part is I make take home more from the GI bill than I do from my full time job. I've asked multiple times since I finished my finished my technical certification if I would be brought on full time. And I get told to be patient and that it is in the works, and that things like this move slowly because the company is getting bigger. 

Now if I stay on the grind I'm on I can make enough to put a down payment on a new car (I need it badly), but I feel I won't get as much out of my classes, and not get as high of a GPA as I want. If I leave the job and get a part time job somewhere easy, my GPA will go up and I think I will actually retain what I'm being taught, but I will lose the opportunity where I'm at, and make less money than currently. I think I might as my boss about switching back to part time while I focus on school and they figure out if they really want me or not. I feel like I'm being friend zoned by my job, but then again it could just be a slow process that will pay off later."

I face a dilemma of choices. I don't know what sort of future I want to lead. Working in Engineering right out of college? Entering finance? Going to grad school?

I am an electrical engineering sophomore. I was offered a fairly competitive co-op internship. I will work until December, don't know when I start.

However, it will cut deeply into my Junior year. I am heavily involved in my school's extra curriculars, board member for more than one club. Between a Junior year load and working 20 hours, I fear I will have no time to focus on my ECs. I think my ECs are important for future job opportunities that involve leadership (like in aerospace for example).

One of my extra curricular activities is working with the school investment club, going on competitions with them, this may lead to a job in finance. It seems very promising. But I'm not sure if it fits me. Not sure if engineering fits me either.

I've also learned about the merits of grad school, getting masters in EE (I originally chose engineering because I didn't want to go to grad). Grad school requires excellent grades. In this case, I should just ignore the co-op during the semester and focus on grades, then research.

Very conflicted.

So in summary, I need to choose between a co-op that would cut into my leadership experiences, my extra-curricular activities in finance and eventually choosing finance as a career, and grad school.

How can I do a cost-benefit analysis? What should I consider?"

Typing this all out felt good to get out of the system and having everyone here willing to read my wall of text makes me feel a lot better. I do feel quite relieved now that I've had a few hours to let this all sink in! Again, my thanks!

** TL:DR; Started a job 7 months ago. It was going great up until January when my boss and I had a falling out due to miscommunication. She said I was lying. Tried to repair the relationship since then, but was let go today ""Terminated without prejudice."" This is despite the fact that I was continually told that my attitude was an issue. The department has a high turn around rate (no one on the team has been there over 9 months, except the director who is 15 months in). How do I position this in interviews for new work? **

*

Apologies for the long story. I'll jump right in. If you want to skim past what I think was the final straw, the last few paragraphs should suffice as everything else is what led to the straw breaking incident.

*

Ok, well I just got home after being terminated without cause. First time in my working career this has happened and I am a bit surprised. I guess the best way of explaining the situation and while trying to give an partial account of what happened would be to start from the top.

7 months ago I started a new job. I was hired by the director of the department. My manager was then brought on board at the same time and started 2 days before I did. We were tasked with launching a new method of communication for the company; we developed the strategy together and worked well with one another. Flash forward 2 months and we are launching the new method of comms. This is when things start to get a bit turbulent.

We both came from different career backgrounds, but found success in each of our areas of expertise. When it came to the execution; I was, according to the director, in charge of that. However, my manager, being new to managing people (she had mentioned that she only ever managed interns before hand, and not senior level employees) was insistent on micromanaging to ensure that I knew ""how to do my work"" (her words). I politely indicated that I don't do well in that type of environment but would do so for now. She confirmed that this would only be temporary if she saw that my work was deemed acceptable. 

Fast forward to January (1 month later) and my work has been deemed acceptable but not great, but moving in the right direction. 

The next monday, I'm pulled into a boardroom where I am given a stern warning by my manager that I started packing up my belongings at 4:55pm on friday. I'm told that the work day ends at 5. She also mentions that she noticed that I take my lunch every day (incorrect, I take it 4 out of the 5 days, even though I should be taking it every day). At this point I'm highly irritated as I've never had my time managed like this. I point out that I actually left at 5:10pm, after the workday had ended. I also pointed out all the overtime I was doing (at that point it was about 35 unpaid hours in the last 6 weeks), which she was aware of. So if I were to leave 5 minutes early on a friday, I shouldn't be approached this way. Especially that the 35 hours doesn't include all the PM monitoring I am doing from 5pm-11pm daily to ensure that things are running smooth. I'm told that all those extra hours don't count because it's part of the job. I disagreed but in the end, took my lumps as technically she isn't wrong.

Later that week, I pass my probation, and with that I meet with the director for a touch base to see how I am faring and to get my feedback. At this point I am told that I am doing well and to keep up the great work. I am then asked about how I view my relationship with my manager. I'm encouraged to speak freely (I was told before hand by a co-worker that the director is open to hearing about any issues); I take the opportunity to say that there are a few  minor hiccups, such as the micromanaging and time watching. I'm quite upbeat that we can still move past this, and that these are things that should be ironed out with more time. I'm told that the door is always open and if I need to talk about anything, to come see the director.

2 weeks later, I get brought into a board room again and am told that previous meeting. I have been notably more aggressive towards my manager. At this point I'm floored. And I tell her that I am surprised that she is saying this. I apologize to her, stating that I never had that intention. I ask her if she can bring up a point in time when I made her feel this way, so that I can see what did or said that caused her to feel this way. She says that she can't pinpoint on moment. Again, I say that I am taken off guard by the observation; I tell her that this is the first time I've received this feedback from anyone. She quickly says ""That's because no one has ever had the guts to tell you."" I tell her that I want to work with her to work past this miscommunication. She again, says that it's all me and that I am making her feel uncomfortable. I apologize, and she says that my talk is cheap. At this point it doesn't seem to be getting better so I say that we'll work together to get back to how it was before hand.

At this point we had another instance where there was a miscommunication. End of day, she asked me to do something out of office. I asked her if the next morning before work would suffice. She said yes. I show up at 915 as planned. And she pulls me aside saying that the work day starts at 9. I reminded her that she asked me to do something and she said that she didn't remember and that I should be reminding her in those cases.

A few weeks go by and the only real notable instances are during our weekly touch bases where I am torn apart stating that my work isn't good and that I need to improve. I ask my manager if we can sit down together and review my work so that we can see where it needs to improve to meet her standards. Her reply is ""I'm not doing your job for you. Figure it out.""

At this point, I go see my director (March 10) because there isn't anything constructive that is being addressed and the relationship is toxic. The director states that I'm the only one that has brought this up, and because of this she won't do anything about it. I do know that the other team members have an issue with the manager's managing style but haven't brought it up yet, even though they planned to. I don't mention this because it really isn't my place to do so. She continues by saying that the problem must be me. The director goes on vacation. She comes back last monday.

On Thursday, I get an email from the VP, with my boss CC'ed on the email, asking me to pull down some content he saw on social media (my responsibility) because there was an error on the image. Note: This image was provided to me by his department that he manages.I reply to the email with ""Ok, the image has been removed."" I then walk over to his office to apologize and explain the situation; but he had taken the day off since friday was a holiday. So I walk back to my desk and I see that I have an email sitting there from my boss which states that ""my response was insufficient and that this is yet another time where I show that I can't accept criticism. I've emailed *VP Name* to apologize for your mistake and to ensure that it'll never happen again. This is about accepting your mistake and not hurting the department's reputation."" I reply with ""I went to go see *VP Name* at his office to explain the situation and apologize for the mix up. I felt that it was important to let everyone on the CC know that the content was removed, before apologizing. Also, could you please let me know which other incident you are referring to?"" Moments later she lets out a loud sigh while sitting at her desk. The day ends and nothing more is said. I send an email to my HR rep, asking to meet with her on Monday as I feel the situation has deteriorated beyond repair. And without the support of my director, I feel that I need to go on record with what I feel is a toxic work environment.

I come in to work today and do what I need to do in the morning. As I come back from lunch, I'm brought into the board room by my manager where the HR rep I emailed is sitting there. My manager says: We're letting you go because it just isn't working. I'll let *HR name* take over and she leaves the room. The HR person and I go over the details and she notes that this is termination without cause (her verbatim). I get home and look at the papers and see that it is indeed termination without prejudice. I assume these terms are interchangeable? At any rate. I find this odd because it seems that my boss had a problem with my personality and the way I responded to her.

At any rate, how do I handle this in interviews going forward? I don't really know what the exact reason for firing me was as none was given. I can surmise that my response on thursday, or meeting my director before she left on vacation were the determining factors.


Thanks for reading.

A bit about me.  I have been using drugs since age 13.  I got good grades in high school and went to a normal college majoring in CS (I was already big into development during my teen years).  I got addicted to heroin my sophomore year.  It took me about 7 years to get my bachelors in CS because I kept relapsing, going to rehab, etc.  I did a software dev internship which I didn't do well at (drugs), but still have good reference.  Then I got clean and worked as a sysadmin for a year.  Relapsed, went to rehab for a year, now I've been working as a Java dev for a legitimate company (20+ developers for about a year, I'm on suboxone).

I was wondering if anyone else has a story like mine?  It seems like all the devs I meet either 1) dont do drugs, or 2) use recreationally.  Don't know if I've met a dev in ""recovery"".  How has it effected your career?  Are you open about it to co workers?  How do you explain gaps in employment?

4ccreu,0,2016-03-28,Extra semester for Computer Engineering over CS?,aychtooessohfore,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ccreu/extra_semester_for_computer_engineering_over_cs/,"Hi everyone,


I'm currently a computer science student at a state university. I have 4 semesters left and started talking with an adviser and looking into embedded programming since I've started playing with arduinos in my free time and love it. Since then, I've really started to regret studying CS and wish I would have studied Computer Engineering. Also, the few companies I've interned at have talked to me about how they think it would be good to switch given my interests. 


I was lucky enough to win a full scholarship for 8 semesters when I started which will cover 4 more semesters, but I will need 5 semesters in order to complete the Computer Engineering major (If I don't want to take 18 hours of EE/CS classes every semester. It is technically doable in 4 though..). Making it 5 semesters would allow me to take only 12-14 hours per semester. 


Because I'm an out of state student, this last semester would probably cost about 15-18k for everything. Luckily my school offers automatic scholarships that would knock off 2k and I have about 5k in a college savings plan which means I'll probably only owe about 10k out of pocket. I'll make $23/hr at my internship this summer and imagine I'll be able to get similar pay for the next 2 summers, so that 10k really shouldn't be an issue. I also plan on applying to competitive scholarships since I have a 4.0 GPA, work, research and volunteer experience. If I graduated with the CS degree I'd be able to have a lot more money in the bank though at graduation it seems. 


I am very interested in software, but primarily in the embedded domain (although I also enjoy web development). Some other people I've talked to have said that it isn't worth it to do the extra semester since whatever job I get in embedded I could have gotten with a CS degree anyway. And if I do end up in web, it will be kind of worthless. But honestly I feel like this would be missing out on a lot of the hardware side of things that I'm also very interested in!


So, what do you think? Any advice? Is it worth doing that last semester to get the engineering degree? And yes, I understand this sub is probably biased... maybe that's why I decided to ask here and not at /r/cscareerquestions :)



TLDR: 15k or so for one semester to get Computer Engineering vs Computer Science degree worth it? Would have enough money from internships and savings so I wouldn't need any loans. Had a full scholarship cover every other semester."

Normally I would be comfortable waiting something like this out but I've heard talk in a few different places that it may last quite a long time.

Basically my question is how long should I reasonably wait? I'll be done with my AAS in Network Administration this May and it isn't looking like a position would be open until the Fall

My boss is a good enough guy that he would never expect or request that I work at minimum wage until that point, and he has said he will see what he can do by talking to his boss.

The only reasons I would consider waiting is because I like the environment, but also because there aren't many other options for work where I live and I can only think of one other place that may be hiring, let alone a guaranteed job.

You're a champ for reading this, champ ;).

How can I get research or work experience?

I went to school for Philosophy with psychology minor. I tried to get involved with some psychology research, but all the psychology professors I had retired. The remaining professors will not let me get involved with their research. Other local universities had told me they will not take any outsiders either.

Is it possible to get an internship even though I'm not currently going to college or seeking a degree in Human Factors psychology?

I've looked online at some internships and their requirements  were to be in college or grad school.

I could become a better writer so my letter of intent stands out more. Do you have any suggestions as to where and how to become a better writer?

First, I want to tell how the interview went. I was the first person to interview for the position. I actually live 3 hours away from the location, so I drove Monday morning for the interview. Because I lived far away, they had me do three back-to-back interviews in one day. The questions were situational behavior-based so I was well-prepared to answer drawing from experiences. The only challenge I thought was my experience. I'm currently working as an associate in retail but I do have administrative experience through my internship. Most of the answers from the questions asked came from my retail and internship experience. Despite my lack of experience, I felt I was qualified for the job. On reflection, I stumbled on only two questions but I answered them to the best I can. I also asked questions about the position. 

My recruiter told me he would keep in touch. He had other interviews last week, so he wanted to go through all the candidates and meet with the other recruiters to decide. I also asked my references to put in good word for me. About 4 out of the 5 I sent out replied back. 

It's been one week later and I sent out a follow-up email to express that I am still interested. He replied back just thanking me for my patience. He told me that this week a candidate will be picked.

4cdlwu,95,2016-03-28,For those who haven't had much luck finding internships,radicalnegative1,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4cdlwu/for_those_who_havent_had_much_luck_finding/,"***Don't give up!***

I have posted this twice before in this sub, and again, it has worked for me this year.


Most of the big companies that use external hiring websites (indeed.com, monster, etc.) at this point probably have their interns / co-op positions filled. Continue applying, but broaden your search. I suggest trying this ***one weird trick that companies don't want you to know about*** or whatever... you get the idea.

So basically, go to this website and look at past awardees: http://www.sbir.gov/

These are companies that you want to target at this point. They're small, they have money, and they're often off the radar of other potential interns.
Identify a few (or a lot) of companies that interest you and research them. The company for which I am interning this summer was publishing technical papers on really cool stuff, so I took the time to read the papers and then reached out to the company to ask informed questions about their research. Whatever the company does, ask about their research, products, services, or whatever they do. Make the connection first. Be genuinely interested in what they do, then bring up a possible internship. By demonstrating interest, you have already presented yourself as a great potential intern.

Just for some perspective, ***a day after I made contact with the company I'm interning with they offered me a job***.

Don't give up!"

Should I pursue a bachelor's in CS or a master's in CS?,NoirBlanc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cdm92/ba_in_anthropology_should_i_pursue_a_bachelors_in/,"I've been programming all my life, and I really regret not choosing to major in CS. I was premed so I have taken many science and math classes, which have helped me think quantitatively. Currently in my job search many employers naturally prefer a BS in CS, which makes me wonder if I should pursue a master's in CS since I just graduated with a BA in anthropology a few months ago. Or if I should start over with a BS in CS. I don't mind going back to school if the field might become more competitive in the future and have better chances down the line. But of course I would like to start working soon in the field. Doing an internship now and might be starting new work next week as a programmer after a recent interview. I am still anxious about my lack of proper credentials."

- Firstly, I want to ask, regarding the co-op schedule, DO I have to stick with it? I have heard a lot of good things about the Co-op here, saying it's one of the best, maybe the best in Canada.
- Are internships that easily accessible to the people studying at Waterloo? Can i get an internship/job the 2nd semester right after? 
- If so,Can i risk going to Canada with only 20-30k CAD(aside from the tuition fees for the semester), and pay that off along with the future income that i get from internships/jobs? 
-Is it really hard to work and study at the same time? Especially since Waterloo's course contents look heavy.
-Overall, will my salary outweigh the future tuition fees? 
- In total : How much do you realistically say (an average spender)
will need to study and live in Canada? (Rent:1 bedroom apt)
- If all else fails, What co-op program (while having good course contents and cheaper) in other universities do you recommend?
Thank you."

I understand that the below listings are varied in specialization, but does anyone have tips for getting into government contracted internships?


As for my current credentials:

- 6 months of independent contract work
- 6 months unpaid Sysadmin internship
- Current paid InfoSys internship for City Government

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*Note: This is a position I work part-time and can hold indefinitely for the next 4 years should I choose.*

- Freshman attending Community College for transfer to Cal Long Beach for IS

I understand that many of these positions want juniors, so I do not mind waiting to apply, but in the mean time **how can I make myself more appealable?**

 Do they expect these interns to already have certifications?

I study at least an hour every day for IT outside of classes and am working through the following (*Note: I haven't chosen a specialization):*

- CCNA Udemy Course
- CBT Nuggets MCSA 2012 R2 
- Python Automation Course
- [VA_Network_List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/472ncz/advice_for_a_future_in_it/d09occ8)
- Homelab project consists of a ESXI 6.0 running VMs of 2012, and Win8. 

My biggest concerns:

- Information Systems is a business major

- My interview skills need practice. Scared of my employer finding me practicing with other companies.

[What is the absolute worst experience you have had with a guest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hbkpo?context=5)|I've been thrown up on before, but that wasn't really the guests fault. One of the worst ones was when we had a party of about 45 people come through the single riders line. When we asked them to split up, they flat out refused and started cursing at us and calling us really offensive slurs. We knew for a fact they had been told they'd have to split up at the entrance of the attraction and it didn't help that most of them only spoke Portuguese and the ones that spoke both english and Portuguese chose to selectively understand us. We ended up having to get supervisors involved to split them up.
 |Just remember, theme park team members are people too. We have compassion for people who are having a rough time. We can make your day if you are nice to us (i.e. letting you skip a 2+ hour line, get your whole party to the front of our most popular rides, free merch, food and beverages), but if you insult us or treat us badly, we are much less likely to help you. I'm 1000x more likely to help the guest that comes up to me and explains their problem(s) calmly than the one that comes up screaming.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! I have only been to the Wizarding World in Orlando once a few years ago, but, when I was there, I was awestruck by the sheer number of people packed into such a small space. At the time I couldn't help but feel that, if there was some sort of need to quickly evacuate all those people due to emergency, we would almost certainly be screwed. Do you feel the same way? Or does Universal have emergency procedures that would effectively deal with that many people all at once?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h6wc7?context=5)|As far as the original Harry Potter Land (Hogsmeade) they have plenty of ways guests can leave the land quickly (i.e. by leaving through Jurassic Park or the Lost Continent). But Diagon Alley is very different, due to the fact that, as you said, the land is a large area but only has 2 very small exits. By law Universal has to include Fire Lanes in all of its lands to allow for emergency crews to get into the area if needed. Universal has cleverly hidden 2 GIANT fire lane access doors in Diagon that can be opened quickly if an evacuation is needed or a fire truck/ambulance needs to get into the land. These doors also allow us to move food carts/set pieces in and out of the land. The doors are closed right before we open in the morning and opened after the land is cleared for the night.  Here is a picture of one of the doors: [Link to img.buzzfeed.com](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-06/23/13/enhanced/webdr05/enhanced-buzz-wide-21958-1403545852-14.jpg?no-aut) (It's on the left hand side, right behind the black director chairs) The other is under the Incendio spell windows to the left of Gringotts.
 |Tl;dr Hogsmeade has large entrance pathways on purpose, Diagon Alley has large Fire Lane doors built into the facades.
 |Hope that answers your question!
[Favorite foods at Universal? Favorite foods in the Wizarding World area? Is it worth the price?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|1) Definitely the Mythos restaurant in Islands of Adventure. The restaurant is consistently ranked one of the best theme park restaurants in the world. Wait times can reach 2+ hours on busy days and it's on the pricier side, but quite good. In the WW the Bangers and Mash at the Leaky Cauldron is my personal favorite.
[Favorite Wizarding World ride? Least favorite ride?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|2) Favorite is Escape from Gringotts. I like the story better and I love the beginning of the ride (hint hint). Least favorite is Dragon Challenge, because it can make me quite nauseous haha.
[Butter beer--is it better slushy or room temp?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|3) I prefer it frozen/slushy, don't forget to ask for extra cream on top!
[Highlight of your experience working there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|4) The incredible people I meet while working. I see people from all over the world, from Russia to Nairobi and its awesome to talk to them learn a little bit about them. I have met some guests I'll never forget in my life.
[Do you own any wands?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|5) Lol, yeah, like 10. I have my birthday wand, harry's, hermione's, 2 of dumbledore's (one broke), Sirius', voldy's, ron's, snape's and Lucius Malfoy's.
[Favorite Harry Potter character? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7alj?context=5)|6) Snape without a doubt 
[I'm fascinated by the technology behind the Forbidden Journey ride. Have you ever gotten to walk around the building where it's housed after hours/check it out with the lights on? If so, what was the experience like? (And how many times have you ridden it? :D\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7ybh?context=5)|I have seen it with the lights on just a few times, but it's incredible to see how everything works and how they hide areas of the ride they don't want you to see by tilting you away from that area at just the right time. FUN FACT: Each ride vehicle costs over $1 million!  If you really want to see what it looks like with the lights on, here is a video (WARNING: This video will ruin the magic behind the ride so SPOILER WARNING) [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbYvrxhbZ-o)
 |[Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Forbidden-Journey-Unofficial-Attraction-ebook/dp/B00KH0G2I2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459221635&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Secrets+of+the+Forbidden+Journey%3A+Unofficial+Guide+to+the+Ultimate+Theme+Park+Attraction+Kindle+Edition)
[That's not really how the ride works, it's in some sort of safety-mode where it just parks in a neutral position.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hb61q?context=5)|You are correct, Forbidden Journey has 3 different ride profile modes that it can operate in. The 1st is the normal ride profile that it runs through during normal operation.
[The actual ride leans forward, focuses on a prop element as the cart moves under it, then moves quickly forward to the next.  It's a wildly different experience than the video shows.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hb61q?context=5)|The 2nd is a ride reset profile. In this video the ride must have stopped for a long enough period of time for the managers to determine that everyone on the ride needs to get a re-ride, so you can see that the ride is not moving like it normally does and is keeping the riders facing straight ahead.
[Still neat to see how weird the lift-arm looks though.  And it's so freaking tall!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hb61q?context=5)|The last profile is the Evacuation profile. This will turn the riders so they are facing the nearest evac platform, once all ride vehicles reach their designated evac spot, the ride will stop and evac procedures will begin. Gringotts ride vehicles operate in a similar fashion.
[I'll be there this Saturday! Are there generally times of the day when wait times are shortest?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hay4a?context=5)|First thing in the morning and right before the park closes. The rides wth the longest waits include Despicable Me, Rip Ride Rocket, Gringotts, Forbidden Journey and Spiderman. I'd recommend getting to Gringotts first thing, then going to Despicable me and Rip Ride, then do the rest of Universal Studios. After that get on the train, do the other park and save FJ and Spiderman until the end of the night. If you have time, don't forget about the Cinematic Spectacular at the end of your day!
[How do the rides work?  How good does your butter beer taste?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7b9a?context=5)|Both are marvels of engineering, so many moving parts moving in perfect harmony is amazing to see. Both flagship rides (forbidden journey and Gringotts) are incredibly complex machines with hundreds of motors and hundreds of thousands of moving parts. I try to learn as much about the rides from our Technicians that work on them, but even after 2 year, I've barely scratched the surface of how they work.
 |And butter beer tastes like liquid gold.
[My SO and I went a few years ago before the Diagon Alley expansion, and our main goal out of the whole park was to buy our own wands at the wand shop. We were disappointed at the quality of the wands; they seemed to be just press board that had been spray painted.  (Not to be a negative Nancy here; we *loved* the park otherwise\), but has the wand quality gotten any better?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hbpih?context=5)|They are about the same as before, except that we now have interactive wands that look a bit different. When I first got my wand I felt similar, but I remembered that this was something that I bought at a theme park. They wands are quite detailed in my opinion and each one has a complex back story to them. I know Universal wanted to go with more authentic wands (i.e. real wood with metal details, some hand carved), but they were worried they would break too easily in a typical day at the parks, especially in the hands of an excited kid.
[Have you heard anything about the Ministry of Magic expansion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h6ohs?context=5)|Nothing official yet, but we have definitely heard it's in the pipeline for 2019-2020. There are already support roads/future guest pathways paved towards what is currently the Fear Factor Live stage. Also, we are pretty sure it's just going to be a Diagon alley expansion, not a whole new land like Hogsmeade/Diagon Alley is.
[Hey! As a Florida resident I frequently visit universal and Disney parks. What exactly do you do in your job? Do you work in one of the shops, sell butter beer, or are you a ride attendant? Also does universal have anything similar to the Disney college program that you know of?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hagfc?context=5)|I've been both a shop attendant and a ride attendant in the past. Can't say what I currently do because there aren't a lot of people doing my job. Universal doesn't really have anything like the college program, the closest we have are the internships for college students (i.e. universal creative internships, food and beverage internships, hospitality internships, etc...)
[What's your favourite ride? Also what is the most overpriced thing? and most undervalued thing there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1h7w8i?context=5)|1) Escape from Gringotts because of the tech and the story 2) The house robes are cool, but I'd never pay $130+ for it, thank god for our employee discount lol. 3) For just under $50 the interactive wands can make a child truly believe in magic, it's an amazing thing to watch.
[Can you expand on the interactive wands? Like can I do magic with one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cdg0p/iaman_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/d1hc4ek?context=5)|Yep! We have ~20 spells through out Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. They are marked with a medallion embedded in the ground. The medallion tells you what motion to make and what to say. Then you stand on the medallion, do the motion and say the spell. If you do it correctly, magic will happen in front of you, like making a quill levitate, assembling a suit of armor, making a bird sing or turning on this beautiful window of glass chandeliers.

4ce60c,0,2016-03-29,Went Really Far Down a PhD Prep Track and Want to Turn Around,VideotapeReturn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ce60c/went_really_far_down_a_phd_prep_track_and_want_to/,"I'm a junior studying CS right now at a top research university and basically went through school wanting to go to grad school. I started having doubts and my plan now is to do my senior year and then a fifth year here for a terminal masters (it's one of those early masters programs). The problem is that I'm already signed up to work with a professor here over summer and do robotics research. I have housing set up already and generally feel uncomfortable flaking out at this point to do an internship. I had my change of heart after I already accepted. 

 ... but last summer I also did research and the summer before that I didn't do anything. I want to do something cool the summer after this one (between senior year and my fifth year but i don't know what).

My interests are pretty undeveloped so my tentative plan is to set a project for myself alongside the research that I can show employers. The prof I'm working with over summer is pretty confident we can publish something and I'd be head author but I doubt that's worth much to industry. I've been a teaching assistant for two semesters but ditto on the ""no one cares.""

A) Am I boned?
B) What are internship prospects like for an advanced undergrad with no prior internship experience?
C) What else do I need to start doing to set myself up to succeed?

I'm going to career services for advice on Wednesday to ask basically the same questions. My advisor said I'd be okay but she didn't know I wasn't interning this summer ._.

4ceg6f,2,2016-03-29,Fashion Internship for Your Dream Job: 10 Ways to Get That Summer Gig,PursueAsia1,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/4ceg6f/fashion_internship_for_your_dream_job_10_ways_to/,"Has it been your dream job to work in fashion? Then you should know that the best way to get ahead is to land an internship. Internships give you invaluable experience. That same experience gives you the edge. However, fashion internships are not easy to land and they're quite competitive. Ask anyone who's ever interned in a fashion company and they'll tell you that it's one of the most competitive industries, and everyone is gunning for the same spot. You don't want to just send off your resume into the ether and hope for the best. Which is why the tips below can give you a head start at landing a summer fashion internship?

Summer fashion internships can be exhausting, work-intensive and demanding but if this will land your dream job, then it should be worth the experience.

1. Start Early - Don't start right before summer. Start searching several months in advance. Make sure to pay attention to deadlines.

2. Nail Your Cover Letter - Approach your campus career office to help you perfect and proof your cover letter. Make sure it's not generic and it should be unique. It should have something that isn't on your resume. The guide suggests that you should include specific details about the company and why you'd like to work for them.

3. Perfect your Resume - If you're looking for an intern job then you don't have enough experience. Avoid lengthy resumes. Keep it to one page and break it down by category like ""Fashion Experience"" which is an extreme must but don't forget to add another category like ""Journalism Experience"" if you're looking at a magazine company. Flying Saucer suggests that if you haven't had any relevant experience, you can always indicate extracurricular activities that you've taken to prepare for such an internship.

4. Subscribe To The Right Sources - Most internships are acquired through school or personal connections but there are many postings online as well. Check out Pursueasia Pvt Ltd and see if you'd like to subscribe there. Don't forget to follow companies through Twitter and keep up to date with trends and announcements.

5. Reach Out - When an online internship opens up, you can be sure that the company will be flooded with applications. According to Bustle, if there's a certain company that interests, don't wait for them to post. Instead, send your resume and cover letter off to the appropriate person. Specify you're interested in a summer internship.

6. Pay Attention To Requirements - Make sure you follow the guidelines and requirements. If they need three copies, send only three. Not following instructions can foil your chances. Companies like to be organized and these guidelines are a must-to follow.

7. Apply to More than One - It's good to be hopeful but it's better to have a second choice. Or a third. Or even a fourth.

8. Censor Your Social Media Presence - Companies do their research well and that includes checking social media networks. Make sure nothing inappropriate can get out there or just not post anything inappropriate at all.

9. Consider The Brand's Aesthetic - Paste Magazine says you should consider the brand when dressing up. Understanding the brand is important.

10. Stay In Touch - If you didn't get that internship, it's important to stay in touch. They might remember you for the following year. Don't send an email every week but maybe every few months instead. Even if you've already accepted an internship, don't turn this one down and cross it off the list. Keep your options open because networking is essential in the fashion industry.

So anyways, I've put together a build to bring them up to windows 7 (not completely relevant, but its running an ASUS P8H61 mobo, i5, 8gb RAM).  I need to to be able to connect an old hard drive that has all his data on it, yes, I told him to back up everything before I took apart his old one but apparently there is some stuff that's missing.  Can I just simply plug in this hard drive or is there another step to it, I have the OS installed on a different drive but I'm somewhat nervous because in the past when I've tried to hook up old drives to pull data from them I've always been told by the computer I have to reformat them, any way around the reformatting?"
4cfu5t,1,2016-03-29,Making friends in a new city?,thewileyside,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4cfu5t/making_friends_in_a_new_city/,"Hey all, I've been thinking about this for a long time and would really like some outside opinions. I graduate in May, and am moving across the country (NJ/NY to CA) in June to start working my dream job. I'm extremely excited about it, but I'm also pretty nervous. See, all my friends are pretty much going to Boston at this point, or at least staying on the east coast. And they're not the best at reaching out or anything. But even regardless of that, I need to make friends in Cali also.

When you first go to college, everybody's looking for friends. Then after that, there are clubs and friends of friends and you hang out with your friends and do homework and whatnot all the time. It's easy. But going to a new city where plenty of people are already settled and happy? Of course, I can make work friends. I know many people already, since I was an intern last year. But at 22, I'm much younger than many of the people I work with. There are the other new grads, a few of whom I know already, and of course I have my roommate whom I'm friends with. I don't think I see a problem with making friends at work, but what about beyond that? All your friends can't be work friends, right? I guess I can make more friends through them, but even so. I just can't figure out the concept of how to make new friends. 

I'm shy at first with people I don't know when there aren't lots of people I'm comfortable around, but I can work through it. I could go out and try to like... go to things that go on?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Aside from what they're accused of, what are the defendants like as people?  What do they think about the trial - do they participate, do they think there's a chance they could win and get released?  What do they think about you and military members representing them, given that you all work for the US government?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hqvzw?context=5)|Because they are people, they all have different opinions and different personalities.  Al Baluchi would not meet with me at all for two years, until I got an order from the military judge to meet him in [Camp 7](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23771851).  I am still the only lawyer to ever meet a prisoner in Camp 7.  After that time, he has become a full partner in his defense, which he sees as important even if the USG will not release him if acquitted.
 |Al Baluchi, who I know best, speaks excellent English, understands American legal and pop culture, and is humorous.  In the arraignment, when the judge asked if al Baluchi understood that the trial could go on without him if he escaped, he said that he would be sure to leave a note.  But he also suffers a great deal from the effects of his torture, and his #1 goal is to get torture rehabilitation.
[If you were to direct a journalist to a good, undiscovered discussion about Gitmo, what would it be?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hqgqa?context=5)|One item that has received no real attention is the classification of the memories of detainees.  The USG maintains that the prisoners' own memories of where they were and who interrogated them is classified.  How can the USG classify the thoughts of a person who has not signed an NDA?  I would love to see a journalist ask relevant players to explain that one.
 |As a starting place, this issue came up at the Committee Against Torture review of the United States in November 2014, but the US dodged the question.  That says to me that some international torture experts are thinking about the problem.
[What advice would have for a high school student who wants to go into law (specifically International Law\)? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hsukr?context=5)|Right now, go check out your school's debate team.  Among other things, my eight years of debate gave me ""argument sense,"" a deep understanding of how arguments work and don't work.
 |Also right now, take French.  French and English are the languages of international law.
 |Longer term, look for internships that involve international law.  The international NGOs depend on interns for a lot of their work, and offer a lot of opportunities.  To eventually get a job in the field, you will need to demonstrate a commitment to international law, and internships are a great way to do that.
[How did you wind up practicing law at Gueneonomo Bay? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hsplj?context=5)|I was a death penalty attorney based in Virginia.  In 2008, I had a minor involvement in the first iteration of the military commissions, all in the background.  But when the law changed in 2009 to require death penalty attorneys for a death penalty case, they remembered and asked me to take the case.  I refused at first, but was eventually swayed by the promise of spending full time on one case, which I had always wanted to do.  I have worked full-time on the one Guantanamo case since 2011.
[Why exactly is the case taking so long, and is there anything you think could be done to fix that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hpgir?context=5)|Main factor on time so far has been government intrusions into the defense camp in such a way that the judge has to respond.  We have spent a lot of time, and cancelled hearings, dealing with FBI investigations of the defense counsel, listening devices, etc.
[Are military commissions just fundamentally unfair to the defendants in your view, or is there anything you think could be done to fix that?  For that matter, is there any reason to have them at all in your opinion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hpgir?context=5)|I don't think there is much of a reason to have military commissions.  The US has a perfectly good court-martial system which can try war crimes if federal courts are not available for some reason.  The military commissions are a hybrid of federal courts and courts-martial specially designed to convict in this trial.
[What do you think the best way to rehabilitate ex-Guantanamo bay detainees is?  How do you think countries around the globe should go about preventing radicalisation?  How long do you think it will be before Guantanamo closes?  Thank you for doing this AMA, it's incredibly interesting!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hp3t4?context=5)|For rehabilitation, you need a multipronged approach, including trauma treatment, family reunification, medical treatment, language skills, and some initial financial support.  I was lucky enough to visit the Kuwait rehabilitation facility, and though it was a good effort. Radicalization is such a huge question I barely feel qualified.  One overlooked aspect however is the idea of engrenage, in which countries play into terrorists hands by adopting repressive/militaristic solutions which radicalize additional population. No idea on GTMO closure.
[What happened to the other released detainees? Where were they sent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hnjlw?context=5)|There are 91 men still held at Guantanamo; most have been released by either the Bush or Obama Administrations.  Most were sent to their home countries, but some were sent to third countries, including Bermuda, Uruguay, and Bosnia.
 |The Miami Herald has a [map](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article54641060.html) of third countries which have accepted detainees.
[You are working at Guantanamo Bay, it was a fairly heavy day: what do you do for the night to relax?  What is the personal life like while working there?  Ever have people see you as the opposition?  Does that make it hard to socialize?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hoor9?context=5)|The traditional military/diplomatic choices are hunk, chunk, and drunk.  There is not much to do, so you can work out, eat, or drink. They do have free outdoor movies (not for prisoners) at Guantanamo.  I like to run to the movie, watch it, then run back.
 |There is one bar at Guantanamo, and in my experience, people don't tend to discuss their jobs with strangers.  My office, which consists mostly of military, but some civilians, socializes a lot together at Guantanamo.
[Thank you for the AMA. What's the hardest part about representing such a highly known and despised person? What's it like having a client portrayed through such a known movie?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hs9cr?context=5)|The hardest part, full stop, is being away from my family with all the constant travel.  I can't say that my client is highly known or despised, as most people have never heard of him.  Like I did in the title, I usually try to introduce him through the connection to ZD30, which is well-known at least in the US.  So I find the movie connection generally helpful to give people some sense of who he is.
[In your opinion should the trials be transferred to a civilian court in the United States?  While highly unlikely that the detention facility at Guantanamo closes during the remainder of Obamas Presidency, do you think it will close under the next administration? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1ho8gi?context=5)|There is currently no plan to try anyone from Guantanamo in a civilian trial.  The President's current proposal is to transfer them to the US for trial in a military commission.  As you say, this seems politically unlikely.
 |What will happen under the next Administration is anyone's guess.  I have sometimes entertained a theory that only a Republican can closed Guantanamo, sort of like only Nixon could go to China.  But we will see.
[How did you wind up on this case ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hntnu?context=5)|From 2003 on, I was a death penalty attorney in Virginia.  In 2008, NGOs were looking for civilian attorneys to work in President Bush's military commissions, and I had a minor, behind-the-scenes role.  In 2011, after President Obama restarted the military commissions, they were looking for full-time attorneys and remembered me from Round 1.
[What are the risks associated with processing people in a civilian or military system? I could see secret evidence being a problem in the civilian context, as the military would need to protect its sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hs1d1?context=5)|Both civilian and military systems have protections for classified evidence: the Classified Information Procedure Act for federal court, Military Rule of Evidence 505 in courts-martial, and Military Commission Rule of Evidence 505 in the military commissions.  It is a balancing between national security and the right to defend oneself.  It is easier for my office than some others because we all have security clearances.
[Hi, what were you given to eat for a daily base? Were you able to cook your own meals? Any grocery stores?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hpmmp?context=5)|Guantanamo has a Navy Exchange, which is a combination of a grocery store and a department store.  I am usually lucky enough to be in a room with a kitchenette, so I can cook.  People who are not so lucky go to one of the galleys (Navy for cafeteria) or fast food/restaurant.  They have McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Subway.
[How did the change in administrations between Bush and Obama changed the process? Did the aftermath of Snowden's disclosures change anything for your work (I know it is not directly on point, but the reputation of the US intelligence agencies have taken a hit thanks to Snowden et al\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hrhgm?context=5)|President Obama championed the [Military Commissions Act of 2009](www.mc.mil/portals/0/mca20pub20law200920.pdf), which made some changes to the prior MCA of 2006.  The new law required appointment of ""learned"" (that is, death penalty-qualified) counsel, which is why I have this job.  It also expanded the prohibition on use of torture-derived evidence to some extent.
 |The Snowden disclosures did not change anything major for my work directly.
[What sort of program is given to prisoners before they are released?  How is best to make peace with them at that point?  Is that a priority?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1ho0sc?context=5)|That is a major issue.  There is no deradicalization or rehabilitation program before prisoners are released.  Some prisoners are released to countries where they know no one and don't speak the language.  Recently, one prisoner refused to get on the plane. Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have their own rehabilitation program.
[How long after capture do detainees have usable intelligence? Do we actually keep people only for incapacitation and retribution?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4cfixn/i_am_james_connell_defense_attorney_in_the/d1hrd4m?context=5)|It depends on what kind of intelligence.  I can imagine that the shelf life of tactical intelligence (who is about to do what) is fairly short.  These men were all arrested in 2002-2003.  But there is the possibility of strategic intelligence (""what is your perspective on this?""), which can only come from rapport-building and trust.

However, I feel that I'm not ready to go out and work in my field anytime soon. I've taken C, C++, Java, plus a web programming course, but I feel that my knowledge is not good enough. I'm starting to worry that I might not be good enough to work as a programmer of any kind, especially when other students in my class seem to worry very little about the CS classes I take. At the same time, I don't want to abandon the career because it interests me very much. There's a few things I'd like to know, both for reassurance and to better gear myself towards knowing exactly whether I am prepared or not.

1. For your first job on the field, how did you manage to get it? 
2. Was there a learning curve you needed to follow, and did your work environment help you go through that learning process?
3. What kind of education did you have when you started working on the field? Did you have to go back to school later on?
4. Today, what does a regular work day sound like? Is the workload constant, or is it more of a thing where work drifts in occasionally?
5. What skills should I be refining as I continue studying languages? Should I adopt a main language while practicing my other languages?
6. If i were to apply for your position, what kind of projects should I work on my free time to work on a portfolio?
7. What kind of entry level work or internships do you suggest to do that'll make me shine on paper despite being young without experience in the field?
8. Did you ever feel like you didn't belong as a programmer among other programmers? How did you overcome that feeling?

I appreciate any and all feedback. If you can answer just one of these questions it'd be a great help. 

EDIT: Just read through these responses, thanks a lot to everyone who answered my questions. I will definitely be taking each person's input into account."
4ci36r,2,2016-03-29,Something inside me is blocking me from achieving my potential. How can I figure out what it is?,soulsearchme,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4ci36r/something_inside_me_is_blocking_me_from_achieving/,"TL:DR - I've always been told I have a lot of potential, but can't seem to make anything of it. I'm looking for an effective way to soul-search and overcome the internal obstacles that are preventing me from progressing with my life.

Long story: I'm typing this out in the hopes that knowing my history will give clarity on who I am and what the issues may be. I'm the son of parents who have lived the American dream - immigrated to the US from a third world country in the 80s, attended Northwestern University and worked their way up. The standard, 2/3 jobs to pay through college/masters type situation. My first clothes were handmade and my first toys a cardboard box and packaging, not for convenience, but because they couldn't afford anything else. 

I have lived in 4 states, moved because of my parents' jobs. I moved to Socal 12 years ago when I was 14 - I am now 26. I don't have any friends remaining from before SoCal. I skipped 3rd grade when I moved from Missouri to Maryland, because I was able to test out of it. From that point forward, I went from a straight A student to a mix of As, Bs, and Cs. 

I attended 2 middle schools and 3 high schools. I moved in the middle of my freshman year to SoCal, and to another school again at the beginning of my junior year. I attended private middle schools and 1 private high schools. In my senior year, I failed AP Chem, and had a smattering of As, mostly Bs, some Cs. I test well and did well on my SATs, but was rejected to all 14 schools I applied to.

Side note; during high school, I was really into remote control cars and discovered that I could sell them on Youtube and on forums  as well. I started doing some custom builds and had a small business running. This was what started the entrepreneurial vibe in me, which runs until today. I never incorporated it or anything, it was just a way to make money off of my favorite hobby. I was feeling good about this, so good that I told some of my parent's friends in the community that I would have my dream car by the time I was 21 (Audi R8). Of course, this was an unrealistic goal but I had no idea at the time.

Anyway, being rejected to all schools affected me greatly, and I attended a number of different JCs to be able to transfer to UCLA within 1 year. My mom was planning on the same thing, as her overseas degree didn't transfer. In fact, we took some classes together. She always pushed me through high school and college as well - the fact that I didn't get into a University was hidden from everyone, and I lived a lie by saying that I attended a local university when in reality, I just took some extension courses there in conjunction with my JC courses. I was admired within my religious community, and often used as a model child. Everyone thought I was smart and hardworking. I had 2 paid internships that came through my parents' connections and networking in general. 

With her pushing and my efforts, I was accepted into UCLA as a transfer student in a highly impacted major. I had a contract that I had to maintain a certain GPA and everything was done. I didn't maintain that GPA and can think back to one assignment in one music course that I didn't want to do that made me get a C instead of a B in that course. If I had done that assignment, maybe my GPA would have stayed where it needed to. However, it didn't and as a result, my admission into my dream school was rescinded. 

This was possibly the biggest disappointment of my life. I was fairly religious then, and that all went out the window as well. I had no idea what to do, and my mom pushed me to attend UCI, which I ended up graduating from. I was accepted there as a spring transfer. Looking back, I don't regret not going to UCLA, as if I had gone, me and my younger sister wouldn't be as close. She's my best friend and I wouldn't trade our relationship for the world. That being said, it still hurt like hell and still stings looking back on it. It ranks among my biggest failures. 

If you've come this far, I'd just like to take a minute to thank you sincerely for reading and caring enough to read. It does mean a lot to me that random strangers on the internet are giving and selfless enough to take interest in something that may never benefit them. 

I never really liked UCI as I felt it was settling, and it was only 3 miles from my house so I commuted there. I had a hard time making friends and broke down one night and cried because I felt so alone. My parents suggested transferring to UCLA in the next year but I said no - I believe out of a mix of anger and frustration. Looking back, I could have done so, but I didn't want to fall behind my peers either (friends from the religious community). 

I bounced around a few majors at UCI before settling into Psychology. My first summer there, I did a study abroad program, which still ranks as one of my life highlights. I made friends, I was able to get away from my ex who I had been dating for 9 months, I started dating this girl I met there after the program ended. Things started looking up. I had an apartment on the beach that I told my parents I would pay for, but I got let go from my job halfway through the year and they had to cover the rest of the year for me. I still owe them from that. 

The rest of my college career was decent - I graduated with a 3.4, degree in Psychology, and a minor in Business. This made sense to me as I have always been the person people come to for advice, for a shoulder to lean on and for someone to listen to. However, I never really considered it as a profession as I thought the business world had much more to offer me. 

Out of college, I got my dream job working for Ferrari (as a huge car guy, this was mega for me). I was hoping to do marketing for them, but ended up just being a paper-pusher - I didn't do well with pushing papers, and was let go within 3 months. 

I found another job a few months later at another automotive firm, where I was going to be doing sales and marketing. However, I wasn't comfortable driving the cars - driving a 550 horsepower car that weighs 2400 pounds is daunting, especially if you don't know how to drive stick, which I didn't at the time. I also don't like being a pushy salesman, I prefer the more chill vibe. I lasted 3 months there as well. 

I found another job a few months later at another automotive firm. I was part-time there, and lasted a bit longer - 6-7 months, but they ran out of need/use for me and were short on $ so I was first on the chopping block. 

I had a few other small jobs as well, but nothing worked out. All but 1 of my jobs have been through networking or cold-calling my way into places, so I know the power of networking. My next job was a very well-paid job at my dads company in his department. He wasn't my direct boss, but further up the food chain. I had that job for awhile, then they ran out of use for me as well. After that, I worked at another automotive firm doing 100% commission sales - I made $1k in 3 months there. 

My last job was 100% commission as well, I worked for a really good friend of mine at a marketing agency. I was there for about a year and made $3500. I did some small jobs here and there and was able to support myself, but ended the year around $8k. I live at home still, but I have $14k in debt and these 100% commission things have drained my savings so currently I'm at about $25 to my name, with $650 in bills coming up this month. I recently quit my last job because I wasn't making enough and it was emotionally draining. 

Over the past 2-3 years, I've tried to work on a few different business here and there and listened to a few audiobooks and business books and get a burst of motivation, but it always fades. Nothing has quite stuck no matter how hard I try. I've read pretty much every single motivational quote, written my goals daily, planned things out to the week for business ideas and nothing moves forward. I journal and meditate weekly, if not a few times a week, and there's just a mental block. I also lament my past mistakes sometimes, like saying I'd get an R8 by 21 and I'm nowhere close to that at 26.

My gf (not the one from the study abroad, another one - been together for 3 years now) and her very traditional family need me to have a stable income to be able to support her. My family, while asset-rich, is cash poor and supporting me isn't really an option for them right now. Also, my mom has pushed me enough and I want to do something on my own. 

I've got 2 business ideas I would love to pursue and was hoping to go on unempoyment for a few weeks and do so, but I'm not eligible for unemployment because all my jobs in the past 2 years have been 1099. 

I know the tone of this has been a little somber, but I am (or at least, I try to be) grateful of who I am. I know I have marketing skills, a creative and inventive mind, bounds of potential. I have had the opportunity (or made the opportunity) to travel every year, and have had the fortune of visiting 30+ countries. I've had some incredible life experiences that make pretty much everyone who meets me say something positive. I don't really talk about them, because I don't want/need to brag. 

To put it simply, I'm very happy with who I am, but not happy with **where** I am in my life. 

If you've made it to the end, thanks again for taking the time - I know this was an essay. 

So, does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom they can share? "
4ci8r0,1,2016-03-29,"Botched technical interviews – Should I work on coding, on interviewing, or on finding the right jobs?",butyeahso,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ci8r0/botched_technical_interviews_should_i_work_on/,"Hi reddit,

I could use your collective experience now. I’ve just screwed up two technical interviews, and I’m trying to figure out how I can get better. Assuming time is limited, and my goal is finding a job, what do you think is the best approach?

As I see it  there are a few explanations for my screw-ups (I’m open to other interpretations, and would appreciate your help diagnosing my problem).

a. ) I am a terrible programmer. Not against this idea, but where to begin? I’ve only got four months until graduation. My degree is more in data analysis, and I’ve done well in my classes, but I realized (at my interview), I’ve never actually gotten much feedback on my code per se. I love coding, but I don’t know if I’m any good.

b.) I suck at technical interviews: My first interview involved some O-notation problems. The other one I had to explain my own code sample (which apparently, was pretty bad). This is the most obvious place to begin, but I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed with the sample questions, and wondering if I’m even pursuing the right career right now.

c.) I’m applying to the wrong jobs: I had a technical job last spring that I found easy but boring, and I did a summer internship where I was pleasantly engaged, but not overwhelmed by the work. I might have lucked into those, and I’m not sure how to find that sweet spot again. 

Thanks in advance for any advice."
4cidtg,3,2016-03-29,Double major in CS and Psychology? (Cognitive Science?),The_Real_Tupac,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/4cidtg/double_major_in_cs_and_psychology_cognitive/,"-Is it worth majoring in Psych and CS?

-Grad school a good option?

-Any advice for the cognitive science path

I am a sophomore who started as a psychology major but switched into CS. If I keep my psych major I can still graduate at the same time. I really enjoy psychology and would like to purse something that involves both that and CS. I have read that cognitive science is a good route to take for that. My school does not have a cognitive science major but we do have a few classes relating specifically to that which I plan on taking. I would be open to suggestions for good grad schools for cognitive science too. 

I am really just looking for advice on if I am setting myself up to do well. My school has a very good and well known CS program so I know there will be opportunities with that, but I really do enjoy psychology and I want to incorporate that if possible.

I have heard that getting lab experience is important. I am working on that but I also have 2 jobs and a computer science internship so its hard to find time for anything at this point.

4cj0vq,2,2016-03-29,What should I expect from this junior android developer internship interview?,TH3BUDDHA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cj0vq/what_should_i_expect_from_this_junior_android/,"I passed the phone interview and am going to be scheduled to come in for a tech interview.  It is for a startup company and is offering $20/hr.  The posting on my engineering career page listed the qualifications as:


*Must have a good understanding of core object-oriented programming principles

*Some experience with Android, iOS, .NET, or Javascript/HTML/CSS


The interviewer emailed me back and said that they will be giving me a little programming challenge using the Android SDK.  I was wondering if there is any advice I could get.  How in depth would something like this get for an internship?  Do you think they would just give me a simple app to make?"
4cj7tz,10,2016-03-30,Afraid of Applying for Internships,LumiChronicles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cj7tz/afraid_of_applying_for_internships/,"I am a Computer Science major, about to finish my 2nd year. My GPA is a 2.95(Around there, very close to 3.0). I would say I am above average when it comes down to coding for assignments compared to my classmates. They come to me for help and bounce off ideas for assignments. Some of my class mates are getting internships at local companies at my college. So I have been looking at these internship opportunities for a few weeks now and I am just discouraged for a few things.

1. I am just generally a shy person when I just meet you for the first couple times. I was required to go to the career fair at my college and talk to a couple companies. I just did not feel comfortable at all.
2. If and when I get an interview, I feel like I will be ill prepared. I don't want to be asked a question I cannot answer correctly. I don't want myself to look stupid in front of this company.
3. My GPA. All of my CS required classes that involve something to do with computer science I haven't got anything lower than a B. Generals is what really lowers that down because I just don't have any interest in them whatsoever. I just hope that companies will look mainly at my CS classes compared to my general classes.
4. Some of these companies use different languages than what I am taught. I look at the requirements at the internship, and I try to learn on my own the language that the company uses and just get discouraged because I don't know how to complete something. When I get the job, I feel like I will be thrown in the deep-end and get no help.
5. My portfolio. My portfolio is non-existent. I don't have any ideas for side projects that I am interested in. I like to make desktop applications, because I am taught C++ at my college so naturally it seems desktop applications would be nice to know. In my final year as a CS student I will be working with a team of my classmates and we will work with a company and make something for them. Would that be a good thing to put in a resume even though its required course work?

That's what I have for now, I just feel discouraged mainly."
4cjbpa,0,2016-03-30,[Profile Review] show me what you got,ageramp,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4cjbpa/profile_review_show_me_what_you_got/,"Shoutout to Rick&amp;Morty. 

I graduated from the highest ranked state college late 2014, have been working at Big 4 as tech advisory since then. Interested to hear whether I am a dime a dozen candidate, and what I can to do differentiate myself. I probably will apply in 3-4 years

•**Work experience**: 2nd year associate at Big 4 , Management/Tech Consulting (not an accountant). Also did an internship with same company at same position.

•Extra curriculars: Involved in campus recruiting, and volunteer at local church in free time. I definitely think this could be improved.

•**Undergrad school/major**: Top Ranked State College Bs in Business Admin (Concentrated Information Systems)

•**Other education/coursework**: Taking a coding class in my free time and have done a lot of training with ERP systems since starting at Big 4.

•Race/nationality: Indian

•Sex: Male

Stats

•**GMAT Score**: I took the GMAT 2 years ago and scored a 630 with the verbal score being much higher than the quant. Very unbalanced. I recently took the GRE however (thinking about doing a masters in data analytics), and scored a 165 Q (90 percentile) 165 V (95 percentile) and Essay was a 5/6 (93 percentile). Do I need to take the GMAT again or will my very balanced/not low GRE score be sufficient?

•Undergrad GPA: 3.81(honors, magna cum laude)

**MBA Info**

•Goal of MBA: With my tech consulting background, I work primarily with tech teams and the higher ups on the business side. In my short time working, I've seen how the tech side almost always gets the short end of the stick and has to try to always please the business side. I think getting an MBA would help me transition to the business side and allow me to gain a better focus of how business and tech can better collaborate to achieve a company's vision.

•Target schools:
Top 15 b-schools, also wouldn't say no to USC.

I think I'm doing decent, but I feel like I may not be considered an ""exciting"" candidate at the moment. I also don't know how the GMAT/GRE situation affects me, will schools be able to tell I took the GMAT if I only report my GRE? Is the fact I got my Bs in Business and did the GRE a red flag?

Let me know what you think, how I can improve, or really feel free to tear me a new one. Any different perspective is welcome, thanks.

4cjoh3,1,2016-03-30,Question about what classes to take to prepare to go into CS program,EZALE,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cjoh3/question_about_what_classes_to_take_to_prepare_to/,"So I am going for applying 2nd BS and will apply this upcoming fall. Given my grades so far I think I have a good shot at getting in. By this summer I will be done with everything I can that will transfer so I am thinking of how to spend the rest of the year.

&amp;nbsp;

My two goals after getting accepted are to get an internship at a Big 4 and eventually get employed at a Big 4 and I know it is early, but I am wondering what classes I can take to help me on my path that goal since I have free time.

&amp;nbsp;

I work full time and basically will have time for 1 class per quarter at CC [fall, winter spring]

My intro series was in java. I am looking at taking 3 of the following :

-linux/unix intro class

-python class [used in lower divs where I hope to go]

-c++ class [used in a lot of upper divs where I am trying to go and their intro c++ is supposed to be hard]

-sedgewick algorithims 1 coursera class

-sedgewick algorithims 2 coursera class

-DS and Algorithims class

&amp;nbsp;

I am thinking DS and algorithims so the two sedgewick classes and the one DS and algo class but I am not sure.  What would be best to focus on given my eventual Big 4 goals?

4ck0y3,7,2016-03-30,How can I make learning Computer Science less overwhelming?,321gogo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ck0y3/how_can_i_make_learning_computer_science_less/,"I'm a first year cs student and really like a lot of what I have learned so far, and am very excited to earn my degree and enter this exciting field. At this early stage I feel this one thing holding me back. There seems like so many different languages, concepts,  things you need to do to get the internships, things to do to get the right jobs, and so many people that are so far ahead(although I know that it isn't a race, but still adds on to it) and although I don't like to admit it, it get's fairly discouraging at times. I feel very confident when I'm actually learning material(have a fairly high average in my cs course, and just learning stuff on my own), and I feel like i'm putting in a lot of hard work. So it's kinda back and forth of feeling very confident to feeling very behind. 

I really want to be able to get a paid internship in january and will have all summer to learn on my own... There are just so many different pathways I could take it's hard to dive into 1. However, I know that when I am on a path I will be able to work as hard as I need to to get to the end of it.

Sorry for the half rant half question it helps writing all this stuff down though, and hopefully get some insight as well. "

:--|:--
[What is your overall opinion of valve as a company after all of this? What inspired you to do this in the first place?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i5hkv?context=5)|Inspiration was the social engineering attempt for the steamworks account working.
 |My opinion of Valve has gone down but given how they handle stuff like this it's not unexpected. They did not offer a bounty, did not initially respond and have let me keep my Steamworks account and told me their ""hall of fame"" (acknowledgements) is for people who consistently submit bug reports. Now I don't want to sound salty but I kinda take that as ""Thanks for the bug, but you're gonna have to work harder than that if you want an actual acknowledgement. Keep your Steamworks account and keep doing our security teams purpose for free.""
 |To be fair it worked though, I have found more since and reported them (unrelated and sort of less severe?)
[I'm sure that if this big of an issue was looked over in the Web page source, there has to be a lot of other potential risks elsewhere that could enable someone to do some pretty nasty stuff. I wonder if some of this is being done and we just don't know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i6bum?context=5)|Based on the social engineering attempt, I believe apart from Valve employees I'm the only person with a Steamworks account that doesn't have plans to legitimately release a game. I'm not trying to big myself up or anything, but a lot of it was timing, there were a lot of factors in to play here. I always find security holes look way more obvious when they're explained anyway. I doubt this is being done and Valve don't know about it.
[Why didn't you name your fake game ""Half Life 3?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i3zpr?context=5)|I was very tempted to and it would've definitely gotten a much bigger response but I wanted to remain responsible and not piss Valve off too much. I think Watch paint dry was so close to being a real Steam game in line with some of the other joke Greenlight games that a lot of people thought it was genuine! :p.
[Reading your bio, you left school at 14 to go to uni - why? and how?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i75fo?context=5)|Didn't like school. Been going to online college since I was like 10, thought I'd step up to the real thing. Sort of cheaper too. I had to sell a lot of my stuff as my family couldn't afford to pay for my tuition fees. With ""real"" university, I get my tuition paid by the government on a loan.
[ your parents were fine with this / encouraged this. And your teachers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i7umz?context=5)|Parents encouraged it yes. I was ahead in school but my high school was reluctant to let me sit my GCSEs early so I just did them privately. I integrated really well into my university with the people here and I'm 101% sure I'm having a much better time that I would be in high school! I've met a lot of cool people, travelled to Croatia for a summer school and got myself an internship with a major games studio doing InfoSec :)
[CroTeam](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1ifblu?context=5)|I traveled to Croatia for the summer school but my internship is in Ireland. I'll be keeping it quiet as I don't want anything to reflect on them as a company.
[How was Valve's response to your vulnerability report (once you finally got through to them\). I don't believe they have a bug bounty program, so was it hard to get ahold of someone who would actually take you seriously?  In your blog post it sounds like you didn't get through to them until after you published the game. Once you got ahold of someone, were they actually good about following up with you, finding out what you did and fixing it and such?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i4qqo?context=5)|They fixed it same day. Didn't acknowledge me on the hall of fame as that's ""reserved for reporters that provide several high quality reports over time"". No bug bounty was offered. A bit disappointed to be honest, for a company of Valve's size. I don't expect one now and never did, money isn't the biggest motivating factor for me, but if this was Google, Facebook, or another big internet company, they'd be paying out. Even smaller ones thanks to HackerOne!
[Do you develop any ""real"" games? Not hating on WPD, but do you have any other projects going on?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1imcf1?context=5)|For some reason a lot of media outpoints have referred to me as a ""game developer"".
 |I am **not** a game developer!!! I'm an infosec (information security) person :p.
 |In terms of infosec projects, yes I do have a few projects I'm working on and am always looking for bug bounties!
[How did it take Steam so long to realize that their integrated platform is -- pretty much by definition -- subject to code injection?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i5cvt?context=5)|I tried notifying them several times before I did it but didn't get a response. Whether they didn't receive the emails or not I don't know, they don't have an autoresponder confirming they received it. I sent another email shortly after releasing the game and they replied to that and sorted it the same day.
[So, how did you go about getting :smol: as an emoticon?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i6etc?context=5)|I'm mates with Triple Q (the guy that drew it) and asked him if I was welcome to use it and he said sure and even made me a sprite version! I used the same trading card release exploit detailed in the guide to do it technically, if that's what you're asking!
[How did the idea of an AmA occur to you? ;\)  Seriously though,what's your favourite RPG game?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i4e6l?context=5)|Undertale by far. Pokemon used to be a favorite of mine but it felt like every new release was getting more and more dull. Undertale is a small, but powerful game that was incredibly well made and is just $10. Mine was gonna be $2 for fk sake!
[More plans for cheap blockbusters like ""Watch the paint dry""?  Maybe ""Watch Undertale sales go up""?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i4lod?context=5)|""Watch confidence in Valve's security go down""?
[You should try Lisa:The Painful RPG if can handle some pretty dark themes for a game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i51jt?context=5)|Thanks dude, I'm super busy at the moment with all this and other projects but it's on my 'must play' list now!
[I'll give you a CS:GO and 2 TF2 crates for that !](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i4yvd?context=5)|Making the Kickstarter video as we speak!
[Have you/did you look at other pages with the user id as 1? If so, what did you find? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1ipdac?context=5)|The Steamworks website is really patched together, of everything I tested (I only test manually), this was the only form I saw that had an editor_accountid field unless I've made an oversight.
[What will your next game be?  *Fingers crossed for grass growing*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i3gs2?context=5)|Was thinking of doing ice defrosting. I'd start it by getting it until moisture shows up, then do 2 more episodic parts where it melts a little more, then never make a game like it again.
[*This is going to be a technical guide further down but getting access to Steamworks for me was also what started my investigation into this. I’m not going to comment on how/why I have access to Steamworks but I will confirm it was not exploiting any web forms, not Greenlight and not through direct contact with someone from Valve. Despite it no longer working, I’m not going to give any details on how this was done so please don’t ask! I have good reasons not to.*  So, c'mon, how did ya do it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i61l8?context=5)|All I'm going to say is I've got very good personal and business based reasons behind why I'm not releasing this, but I will elaborate and say it was social engineering performed over a few days. No false details about myself were given however (i.e. I did not make out to be D.I.C.E, they knew who I was). They also did not know I wanted the account for security research (nor did I!)
[What was your reaction upon discovering the vulnerability? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i5qta?context=5)|Honestly, I was surprised. Like I don't think I'm a top-tier hacker, and a mix between the fact this worked and someone else hadn't already discovered it shocked me.
[According to your Twitter it says you're a high school drop out? If you had a choice would you go back, and how has that affected your current profession?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i5nvu?context=5)|If you read my other AMA (linked in the top) and my website, I dropped out of school when I was 14 to pursue a degree full-time and I'm still studying for it. Nearly finished Year 2!
[Do you think Steam would have accepted your game if they looked at it? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1if8no?context=5)|No. I think greenlight is a demand based thing but they do have some quality control and a 45-second game is not something they'd allow on the store.
[What do you think of RPG maker?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i4g6m?context=5)|Very powerful tool and there have been some amazing games made with it! Very good for making paint drying simulators.
[Were you ever curious/scared if there was going to be repercussions from valve once the game hit the store and everything brought to light?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1ivbur?context=5)|Emotes are gone for good unless I find **another** way around their security but they did ask I don't do anything public facing again.
[Bonus: So are the emotes are gone forever? Am I never going to see and own smol nozomi and ethan bradberry?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1ivbur?context=5)|For the first question, I didn't know honestly. 
[Have you ever considered making an actual game to submit to steam?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1ig4gg?context=5)|I'm not a game dev. I have an idea of how to release this now, and will be doing so hopefully on Friday.
[Will you make a prequel that involves proper wall prep prior to painting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1i3jv4?context=5)|Nah I'll pay some other company to make a game that show's the paint drying from another perspective.
[Dang, at first I read that as ""Nah, I'll **play** some other company **and** make make a game that show's the paint drying from another perspective.""  I'm kinda disappointed, but I guess that's not bad either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ch42q/i_am_the_guy_that_uploaded_watch_paint_dry_to/d1ie7wi?context=5)|I'm referencing Half Life : Blue Shift, if you missed the reference. :p.

4ckd2z,5,2016-03-30,"22, UK, coming out of charity sector feeling unfulfilled by an office job",Kaael,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4ckd2z/22_uk_coming_out_of_charity_sector_feeling/,"Bit of background on myself - graduated just over a year ago now with a 2:1 Politics degree from a pretty well regarded university in the UK. 

My interests are politics, particularly international. I've done a fair amount of internships and voluntary work with NGOs, specifically in regards to North Korean Human Rights - this is the 'path' I'd ultimately like to go down, but there's simply no long term paid work in this very specific field in the UK, and even internationally opportunities are rare.

Did a bit of bar work straight out of uni which was okay to be fair, but it was very local and I live in the middle of nowhere so wanted out - very much want to work in a city.

For approx the past year I've been working for a pretty big national charity in an office role as an 'Assistant Programme Manager' - my role is to set up and deliver a summer programme for youths. 

The actual delivery (2-3 months of the year) and running of the programme is quite fun and rewarding, but the setup (9-10 months of the year) is a very gruelling and corporate, target-based environment. I'm leaving in the next week or so due to no longer having faith in their direction and the office environment really getting me down. 

On paper, this job looks amazing with all sorts of logistical knowhow, communication/relationship building, management, events/programme planning, and has developed all sorts of skills which looks great on my CV and I interview quite well so I'm not particularly worried about finding work so to speak.

What I AM worried about is finding work I find fulfilling. I've had a couple of office jobs now and they just drain me, I find the thought of spending 8+ hours a day for the next 40-50 years of my life in an office absolutely abhorrent. My work ethic goes to absolute shit when I stop caring about the purpose or cause of the work, and in an office environment I just find my motivation goes out the window unless something absolutely NEEDS to get done.

So I'm exploring my options and seeing whats on the table for me at this stage. I recognise I'm young, have a good education and employment background so stand in fairly good stead but I simply don't know what I want to do.

A few ideas/options to explore, in no particular order:

- I'm an amateur DJ, I absolutely *adore* DJing, been doing it just over a year now and racked up a few gigs. I've been toying with the idea of branching out and seeing if I can get small bar/club gigs around London and go from there. Me and my friend would love to host our own club night, but we have no idea where to start. It's a hugely saturated market, and is starting to become a little gentrified (particularly in London) but i'm sure there's ways of getting started and making a name for myself. Huge follower of the electronic music scene in the UK and would love to participate more actively in this culture.

- I'd love to go back to my roots of North Korean Human Rights advocacy, but it's damn hard to make a career out of it. Plus I don't speak Korean (or any languages) which is a HUGE barrier to entry in any sort of of international refugee work. I've tried self-teaching via the internet but lacked the discipline to stick at it.

- I'd like to go into some sort of international politics/international development/NGO work. In a previous job I ended up going to the UNHQ in Geneva for the UN Human Rights Council, which was an incredible experience and something I'd love to do more of, but so much international political work requires a Masters, which I've also considered. 

- I really want to work abroad in some capacity - I'm really not too fussy on the where or how. Obviously working in a bar on the beach in some tropical paradise is the stereotypical dream and I definitely wouldn't be opposed to that. Also looked into TEFL which could be interesting but I'm not too interested in teaching, at least kids. I really, really regret not spending a year abroad while at Uni - instead I did a month long exchange programme to China which I totally loved and really wish I'd done more non-holiday trips abroad. 

- I'd like to get into some sort of political journalism but don't really have any writing background other than uni essays and the like. I'm sure I could start some sort of blog and send out opinion pieces to various publications (already working on a few assorted articles) but everyone and their dog has a blog these days, and I'm not sure if it's something I'd want a career in. Plus I hear journalism is very cutthroat and extremely hard to break into without contacts/large doses of luck.

Just a few points on my expectations/requirements:

- I'm not really looking to make huge amounts of money - I realise in my areas of interest - particularly the NGO/political side of things - there isn't much money to be made. I don't have hugely expensive hobbies so as long as I can get by, I'm happy. I value job satisfaction over money any day.

- I don't really have anything tying me down to one place, other than family and friends so upping sticks completely is very much doable, and becoming an increasingly more persuading option. 

- Obviously every job has office/admin elements to it so I'm aware that with my particular background and goals, avoiding an office entirely is impractical and counter-productive, so I'm happy to settle for an office job in one of the fields i'm interested in, as long as it is varied enough so that I'm not there day in day out. 

Any perspective, advice or help would be very much appreciated. I know it's a lot to get through - it was pretty therapeutic to type out where I'm at in life and examining my options. 

tl;dr - Bored of office environments, feeling unfulfilled in charity sector that doesn't interest me, where to go from here? Ideal career path isn't 'career-worthy'.

4ckmub,2,2016-03-30,College Grad - I want to know how to ask for a signing bonus/salary increase.,SEthrowawway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ckmub/college_grad_i_want_to_know_how_to_ask_for_a/,"I'm going to be graduating soon from a top 10 uni, with a major in Computer Engineering. I have gotten an offer letter for 65k/benefits in the DC area to be a software engineer. I am very happy with the offer. I still want to negotiate the offer, but as I haven't worked yet, I have no experience with this, and I'm worried about turning them off or making them change their minds.

How can I ask for a signing bonus and/or salary increase, if I've only gotten an offer letter, and haven't gotten to the actual contract yet? When asked about salary before the offer was made, I said simply that I wanted something competitive for the SE field in the DC area. This makes me think that they already have an impression that I take an active interest in my compensation, so asking might not be bad.

However, my GPA is about 3.0, I have zero work or internship experience, and most of my project experience has been for my classes. I know I will be able to be a good employee, but I don't want to give the impression that I am pushing it given that on paper I am not that oustanding, especially since I actually want the job. 

Huge thanks for anybody willing to help me out with this. I'd be more than happy to take the offer as is, so I just want to not lose it.

UPDATE: This was difficult because I felt very hesitant to miss out on the opportunity for more money, but I really want this to be my first job and to do well at it. After much thinking (today was the last of several), I have decided to not negotiate based on the following reasons:

1. Banjoplayer said I need something to negotiate with. I have no job, no other offers, and a set of skills that is specific but not well demonstrated yet (since I only have school experience so far)
2. yuki_zawa said if I ""gave some sort of acceptance...that might make it unfeasible."" Although I didn't flat out say ""That is more than enough,"" I did basically say the amount was sufficient, and [further reading online](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-times-to-negotiate-your-salary-and-3-times-not-to) suggests that changing my mind will give a bad impression. I actually am very excited for the job, and with graduation looming, don't want to risk having a job that wouldn't be as great of an opportunity as this one, let alone not be able to find a job at all.
3. The amount actually is more than enough lol. My initial goal was 60k, which I raised to 65k when I saw my friends getting jobs for that much, and this offer has surpassed even that (I have not given the exact amount for privacy). I want to start off my career with a great start to my first job, and do not feel comfortable taking the risk of tarnishing the great impression I have managed to make so far.

I will learn from this experience to be more reserved and contain my excitement when receiving information. I had the presence of mind to say only ""I'm looking at something competitive for the field and the area"" and that ""I've been continuing the process of looking for a good opportunity"" when asked about desired salary, but I was so excited to get a job offer that I just couldn't stay cool. Huge thanks to /u/Banjoplayer and /u/yuki_zawa for giving unbiased advice that helped me come to a conclusion I feel comfortable with on my own."

I am currently in their BSIS/MSIS program for Information Science. I also have computer science as a minor which gives me a relatively strong coding background (2 classes in Java, 2 classes in C++/Objective C, and 2 more classes in electives: mine will be Algorithm analysis and Networks and Server Protocols). I currently do IT at one of the graduate schools and had a couple questions regarding my potential careers. Note that most of these questions I've asked both my career counselor and my academic advisors and haven't really been able to get straight answers - so I figured I'd come straight to the professionals.

1.) Do I need a degree in Computer Science? For a career I want to be in a technical position but I don't want to just be blasting away at code as a career - I don't enjoy coding that much. (Note that I do have a minor.)

2.) Should I be going after certifications during summers and such? I wasn't able to land an internship this summer but should I take some time this summer and go after some certifications that would make me more competitive for internships next summer? I've been teaching myself Python using books I've checked out from the library and resources on the internet.

Any other helpful information would be great, I am naturally really nervous about the future and want to make sure I'm going to be able to land a job - the Information Science program has a 94% job placement rate but I just want to be double-sure.

4cl359,3,2016-03-30,BA Computer &amp; information Science + Math minor? Or BS CIS + math minor..but...,Pianofeathre,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cl359/ba_computer_information_science_math_minor_or_bs/,"Excuse the long post...but there's a decent amt of background and explanations.
my college has a CSE (in the engineering college) and a CIS (arts and sciences) computer science program. The curriculum is practically the same except for linear algebra, a second ECE class, and an intro to engineering sequence for freshmen. otherwise it is the same, and I'm already in the arts and sciences college so I chose the CIS route...

I'm currently a junior in college majoring in microbiology with a minor in computer science. I recently decided to turn the CS minor in to a major and make it a double major because I'm almost done with the microbio major and I endured enough through ochem and biochem that I won't just give that up for a minor. So it will take me an additional year (so 5 total years) to complete the Computer science major. 

I thought I had no choice but to do the Bachelor's in science in CS but I recently learned I could also do the Bachelor of arts. I need to take an intro physics course to apply to the BS CS...but I already qualify for the BA CS because physics is not a prereq for it. Since I'm a junior, and Computer science majors get first priority when it comes to scheduling I applied to get into the BA at least for scheduling since CS courses are all I have left really. 

I do not have much room in my schedule to fit in physics as a class nor do I want to. It's 5 credit hours I just do not want to take or stress out over, and I would be better off taking a math/microbio/CS elective I believe. I could self-study it, and I will try to this summer, but I am already taking two CS courses so physics isn't a #1 priority. if I test out, then I can switch to the BS. If I choose not to, I can still do the BA and graduate on time in the 5 years and all. 

The BA has obviously less math requirements, but I was already planning on taking the same schedule a BS in CompSci would take. The only course I would NOT be able to do is an intro to ECE class b/c physics is the prereq for it. Otherwise the coursework is practically the same, and I can easily add a math class or two that would make the coursework identical

I know when you put BA on a resume it indicates a less...rigorous schedule possibly since less math/science is required for a BA. Again, I was looking at adding a math minor to round everything out because calc 3, linear algebra, diffeq, discrete math, etc are already in my plan to take because I've seen those courses are often required/desired for grad schools at the least and 2 more classes for a minor isn't a bad choice at all. Since I'm also in the honors program, I have to do an honors math minor if I choose to continue with the minor and meet those requirements. I feel like doing a BS CS and the math minor may stress me out a bit more...and there may even be a chance where I cannot pull through with the minor and be a class or two away from it. 

Does having a BA in CS vs a BS in CS limit my options for grad school or work? I haven't decided yet what I really want to do mostly because my gpa atm is ~3.2 and I'm working on boosting it. So I wanted to do a masters in CS...but I need at least a 3.5 or higher prob to be even slightly qualified. And I was worried that if that didn't happen I could maybe look for internships. I know personal projects and other factors are involved, but I'm always worried that just having Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science would just not look good. Am I at a huge disadvantage if I choose the BA CIS route?"

Thank god for my career advisers at school. Seriously, I don't know how helpful they are at every college, but mine pushed me and it paid off big time.   

I am studying informatics with a computer science minor. This basically taught me to be a jack of all trades in the development world, including web dev, software dev, project management, database creation, and design and research.  

I always thought I would go into web development. I like coding and problem solving, and I like the internet; I thought it was a perfect match. However, after learning that most web dev jobs for fresh-outs with no experience are usually just css/Wordpress jobs (at least the ones I was getting contacted for in my city), I was super depressed. I thought I had sold myself short and wouldn't be able to do anything challenging or make a decent wage.  

I also began reconsidering other tech jobs. I've worked in IT for several years, maybe networking would be easy to get into? What about system administration?  

Anyways, long story short- my first career adviser asked me why I was considering networking/ IT/ system administration even though I have been excited about programming this whole time, and asked me to continue looking for web dev internships. The next career adviser I met with told me not to settle on a css/Wordpress (unpaid) internship and to keep looking.  

I got an email from a CS adviser advertising a job at a *software engineering firm* and I applied on a whim, with my new-found confidence and motivation. I was shocked that I got a phone interview, and I honestly thought I bombed it. There was one question about my familiarity with data structures and algorithms and I panicked. At that point I hadn't really studied these things on their own and assumed I was missing out on this knowledge because of my generalized education. I told him they'd been touched on in my classes and I tried to learn them but I wasn't totally familiar with it... The rest of my interview must have went great because I still got called in for on-site!!!  

They took me out to lunch, gave me a tour of the facility, and then had me solve problems on a blackboard. At this point I'd been studying common algorithms and data structures, and I actually did pretty well! And actually, as it turns out, I think I could have done well just with my experience from programming. I think learning algorithms formally helped me identify the problem, but I didn't use any kind of advanced technique to come up with the solution.  

Today I found an offer for an internship from them in my inbox. I've interviewed at several other places, but this software engineering firm was by far my favorite and had the best mentoring environment, it seemed.   

I feel so fortunate that I'm actually able to say I'm going to use my degree to do something I'm excited about. I have so many friends who graduated and didn't really get to do what they wanted. I'm super excited and really want everyone to know that you might be capable of more than you think!!!!!! Go for it!!!!!!!!!"

Back in October there was a huge career fair and I talked to a few companies. One told me to apply online for internship opportunities. I applied and was called in for an interview that went super well and was subsequently offered a summer internship. 

They soon sent me a letter telling me I was accepted as an intern in an IT department position that wrote code for the back end of their website. Cool.

Cut to today I'm sent an email by the recruiter I had been dealing with throughout the process telling me I would now be put in their ""IT document automation team."" I have the suspicion that I'll be doing little coding or really anything having to do with the career path I want to pursue after college. 

Anyone know what ""document automation team"" means, exactly? I don't want to assume anything but it sounds like a team that takes physical documents and types them into a digital medium of some kind. Not the kind of experience I was hoping to gain as an intern.

I'm in my second year currently, so I don't have any in-field experience yet.

My goal is to get an internship next summer at a highly regarded facility that I fortunately have an employee reference to. When I graduate, I want to either: a) Get into a high-skill job such as one at big tech company in California or Seattle (I've had Google on my mind). b) Get a job at a video game company such as Riot Games or Blizzard Entertainment. or c) Go to graduate school, and then I don't know.

I want a job that will allow me to work my ass off, and in return I'll be compensated with quicker promotions. I've had this idea in my head that when I enter the field I want to get ahead of my peers and put myself in a good position for my age. After a few years of working like this I would like to slow down and relax a bit more once I got my career into a good position.

I hear bad things about the video game industry, but I think I would enjoy making them and being in that atmosphere. I have  no idea how the hierarchy would work at a place like that, or if it would allow me to work a normal 40hr week after working there awhile.

The big tech companies seem to have amazing facilities to work in, with better pay than a video game company. They have brilliant people working there and I'd love to be among them.

Going to graduate school sounds like an overall advantage, but I'm honestly not sure how much it would benefit me. There are also other career options than the ones I listed that I don't know as much about.

This is much longer than I expected, but I'll still post this I guess. Thanks for reading!

Back in September I got a big packet in the mail from Cornell's ILR school saying I look like an excellent prospective transfer. I am a sophomore at community college and didn't really do well in High School. My GPA at the time of the letter was about a 3.65. The way they reached out to me is because I am the Vice President of Phi Theta Kappa at my school. Some other extra curriculars include: 

-Vice President of the Business club
-Member of students for global citizenship 
-Volunteer english &amp; public speaking tutor 
-Currently training to be an EMT
-Internship with international stationary sales team for a company called Weveel LLC
-Traveled to places like Hong Kong and Ningbo China with the company to meet with buyers and discuss with the Chinese sales team.

So I spoke to the admissions director Ian at the school and he said that all my stuff looked great and that the international travel was a great thing to have on my resume. I was able to greatly use this in the essay for Cornell that asks what prior work experience makes me interested in the ILR school. After finishing my Essays I spoke with Ian again and he said all the points I touched on were perfect. He said High School and SAT scores aren't going to matter at all, but I am still very nervous. 

Can someone chance me and just give me an idea? This is my biggest goal right now and I can't imagine going to any other school.

Given my grades so far I think I have a good shot at getting in. By this summer I will be done with everything I can that will transfer so I am thinking of how to spend the rest of the year.

 

My two goals after getting accepted are to get an internship at a Big 4 and eventually get employed at a Big 4 and I know it is early, but I am wondering what classes I can take to help me on my path that goal since I have free time.

 

I work full time and basically will have time for 1 class per quarter at CC [fall, winter spring]

My intro series was in java. I am looking at taking 3 of the following :

-linux/unix intro class

-python class [used in lower divs where I hope to go]

-c++ class [used in a lot of upper divs where I am trying to go and their intro c++ is supposed to be hard]

-sedgewick algorithims 1 coursera class

-sedgewick algorithims 2 coursera class

-DS and Algorithims class

 

I am thinking DS and algorithims so the two sedgewick classes and the one DS and algo class but I am not sure. What would be best to focus on given my eventual Big 4 goals?

4cn5xc,43,2016-03-30,Super discouraged by a review one month into my internship.,csthrowaway_sad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cn5xc/super_discouraged_by_a_review_one_month_into_my/,"Hi all. I'm approaching a mid-term review at my current internship. It's at a company that is known for pushing employees, even interns really hard. That being said, the reviews during the first 3 and a half weeks were pretty positive. Now, after a month, I was told that I need to work on a deep understanding of all the technical stuff I'm working on. It's not enough to just slap code together, which I agree with, but they want to see a deeper knowledge of the tech stack I'm working with.

Not only that, but apparently someone on my team (maybe more than one person, not sure) got the impression that the way that I ask questions is sometimes arrogant. That's the complete opposite impression that I want to give, and it made me very sad to think that someone felt that way about my way of asking questions.

Idk, I'm just really down now. I realize an internship is about growing, and that internships at certain companies are very grueling affairs...but I'm discouraged by the fact that there's so much to learn and not enough time, and super discouraged by the fact that a coworker was rubbed the wrong way. I'm discouraged by the idea that I presented myself poorly and gave the wrong impression.

I'm also super discouraged by one of my coworkers who I work closely with - she has a long memory. For example, I made a mistake a few weeks ago and after looking into stuff more closely, I told her that she's right. But she keeps bringing that up whenever my managers and mentors are in earshot or when she meets with them. I'm starting to think she doesn't like me? That's pretty discouraging too, because I have been taking steps to avoid asking her questions that I can figure out on my own but she still brings up the small handful of times when I asked her to explain something that I could've figured out on my own.

I don't know, I just want to throw in the towel and take a fucking vacation. Idk, what should I do? Grow a thick skin and just focus on improving? Not take shit personal? Explain to my coworker that I've been taking steps to avoid repeated aggravations and that I'd appreciate if she stops bringing up past mistakes at the worst time as if they're still being repeated? I love this place and I've learned a lot, but how do you remain motivated when you accidentally give off the wrong impression when you ask questions? How do you fix things if you gave a bad first impression to a coworker who might also just be looking for someone to put down?

:( My strategy so far has been to just accept that I'm wrong and to just focus on learning and growing, and to assume that all my coworkers are good natured and want the best for me, but I'm still saddened by the review and my performance. Idk. "
4cnbmb,2,2016-03-30,Should I get a second degree or an internship this summer?,SmokeLeagueEveryday,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4cnbmb/should_i_get_a_second_degree_or_an_internship/,"
Okay, so sorry if this is in the wrong place, I've never used reddit before but didn't know where else to post this question.

I am currently a junior in college, and am in the computer science engineering program at UConn (fuck 'Cuse, i hope they lose). I came in as Economics and took courses related to that major for my first year, and spend the last two summers taking classes catching up for engineering. I have continued to take courses to complete an economics minor, and after this semester only need one more to finish off the 15 required major credits. I was bored doing homework one day and decided to look into how much extra work getting an econ major would be rather than just a minor, and to my surprise the 24 credits of related courses are all covered by my upper level engineering classes--so basically there's this loophole that by virtue of me being an engineering student, I can get an Economics major just by taking the core classes and the Gen Ed requirements. This works out to be 4 extra classes for me. 

The thing is, I already have a full senior year schedule and an internship semi-lined up. The only way I'd be able to take on a second degree would be to either go more than 4 years, or not work full time this summer. For the sake of simplicity let's just assume that I still intend on graduating in 4 years. This brings me to my question: do you guys think spending my last summer getting a second degree is a smarter choice than getting experience? These are from separate schools by the way, not to be confused with a double major within the same school. Engineering is it’s own school and Economics is in liberal arts and sciences. My friends are trying to scare me into doing an internship with the “in 2016 you NEED experience” argument, but I can’t help to think that after a first job having a second degree would look better on the resume. What do you guys think?

I was also told that I should not expect too much in the way of formal code reviews, either. In addition to the lack of software engineering career support, the pay is also somewhat below average and the position will lock me in for 8 months instead of just 4 months like a usual summer internship.

I am a current freshman at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey studying computer engineering. I'm planning to transfer closer to home next year, and Santa Clara University is my top choice.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure my GPA is high enough to be admitted, and additionally, I am missing one of the recommended classes (I'm not scheduled to take E&amp;M until next semester). 

As such, I am preparing for next year as if I do not get admitted. I think the best course of action is to attend community college for 1 semester to get my GPA up and get my required classes, allowing me a better chance at admittance.

I'm wondering if I would be better off taking retaking a couple classes at community college over the summer, as 2 classes (Calc 2 and Differential Equations) really have brought down my GPA. Alternatively, I may try for an internship. Which would be more beneficial for increasing my chances of admission?

Also, if anyone would be willing to read my essay, let me know and I'll pm you.

I'm currently a computer science student though I plan on transferring into computer engineering sometime during this next semester. 


The last time I was at college was the Spring of 2015. I won't be returning until the Fall of 2016. During this time, I was extremely fortunate and had the awesome opportunity to do research for my university and intern at NASA twice. I will also have another internship this summer at a large company. 


I'm incredibly glad I took the two internships. They changed my life. I was originally a chemical engineering major when I took the first one. The internship was basically entirely programming and I came to find that I really love it. My second internship was even more programming but also had me working on a bunch of electrical hardware like arduinos. 


Altogether it was an amazing experience and I changed my major to CS, although I plan on speaking with an adviser about changing to CompE once I return to school since I think I would like it better.


Anyway, this is the concern I have now... I will have been away from school for 15 months once I go back this Fall. I'm honestly kind of anxious about getting back into courses and everything! Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm really excited about my new major now that I know what kind of things I could be working on, but at the same time I haven't taken exams or used much calculus or physics in a long time! Do you think doing some basic review would be helpful? I'll only be taking a few programming classes, a couple electives and a circuits class this Fall.

Company A is well known in the USA/globally, Company B is well known mostly in East Asia but they have R&amp;D in the USA.

Some backstory: I want to stay in the NYC/Boston area because that's where my friends/family live. It's also where Company B is based. I interned at Company A in their NYC/Boston group but originally, Company A wanted me to move to the Denver area. When I told them I was leaning toward Company B because of location, Company A countered by agreeing to let me work in NYC/Boston and travel to Denver once a month.

The biggest factors in my decision are:

How interesting is the job? &gt; How will the job advance my career goals? &gt; Location, Salary &gt; Culture &gt; Company Brand/Pedigree &gt; Employee Perks/Office

 where my career goals are: (a) get a Ph.D and (b) found a startup (not necessarily in that order).

Anyway, here's a table:

   | Company A | Company B
---|---|----
Company Size | Global brand | Big in East Asia
Experience with Company | Summer internship. Had a good experience, I like everyone and everyone seems to like me. My mentor has been very helpful over the last year (and recommended me for this job) | No experience other than on-site interview.
Company Culture | Everyone is older than me and has kids, but they do play video games at work a lot. | Somewhat younger crowd, people seemed to like each other but it's difficult to gauge culture from an on-site. They seemed nice/sane.
Company Growth | Stable? It's a big, fairly old software company. | They're already big (e-commerce and other areas) but they're trying to expand into the USA with somewhat halting success.
Company Office | Meh. | Cool.
Company Location | Suburban office park. 30 min commute by car. 25% travel between East Coast and Midwest (the Midwest office is very cool though) | Awesome location in the middle of a major city. 30 min commute via subway.
Employee Perks | Free drinks/snacks | Free drinks, catered lunches, I don't remember what else (maybe massages?)
Work Hours | flexible | flexible
Base Salary | &gt;?90k | $90k
Yearly Bonus | ???, but $15k signing bonus | 10%
Health Benefits | Yes | Yes
401k | ??? | Matching up to 3%
Stock | $1000 | $50k
Personal Career Growth | Nice mix of research/product work. The Midwest group is a product group with lots of room for implementing ML/NLP solutions. I have a pretty good idea of what I'd be working on for the first couple years. | Also nice mix of product/research, though I don't know what projects I'd get to work on, precisely. Might be more room for me to explore/do my own thing.
Long-Term | Not sure, most of the people I've met have been with the company for a long time so I'm not sure how much room there is for promotion. | I'd be getting in early on a small but growing team.

There are lots of ""???""'s in the Company A column because they haven't given me an actual offer yet, just promises. Meanwhile, my deadline for Company B's offer is Friday.

In general, I'm very happy with my prospects w.r.t. salary. The actual jobs are quite similar (at least on the surface), in terms of the subject matter and the tech I'd learn. I'm pretty 50/50 on this, which is why I'd appreciate any and all advice.

Their headquarters are in the U.S., but this program will be abroad in their office in a third-world country. I've always wanted to study abroad somewhere where I can truly get a culture shock but since there aren't really good CS universities at these countries and since studying abroad is so expensive, I gave up on those dreams until I came across this program which will pay for flights, housing, and living expenses (albeit this country is a pretty cheap place to go/live at) AND I will get to apply my computer science skills. In the future, my ultimate dream was to work for a couple years as a software engineer and then go back to a different 3rd world country of my heritage and use my CS background to help those there in some way. I always believed that I would do that in the future but I have the chance to do that now, as this company truly values giving those in less fortunate areas the same opportunities we have here in the United States. Now the kicker: this company won't be paying me.

On Monday I got an internship offer from a well-established, large (5000-10000 employees), well-known company I will refer to as Large Company, will be paid hourly, will get relocation bonus, among other perks. But the work I will be doing isn't exactly what would motivate me to wake up in the morning though this company does care about my professional growth as well. Also, it's located in Silicon Valley and I am sorry, I've been there and based on my experiences and my friends' experiences it is somewhere I do not want to live. And yes, it's only for the summer. But since my uncle died at a young age recently, I've developed a philosophy that living in the present moment is just as important as preparing for the future. I just imagine I'd have a boring, uneventful time there and I'm afraid I will fall into a depression as I've seen my other friends who live in Silicon Valley do too even though I would try to make the most of it (seizing the day and all that). To be fair, I may hate the 3rd-world country of the Small Company as well. Who knows. 

I have to give my answer by next Monday. If my onsite with the Small Company doesn't go well tomorrow, then I am definitely going with the Large Company and I honestly think it's a great opportunity and won't be that bad. But if the onsite does go well then I will have a choice to make and I just wanted all of your input if I did have to make that choice. I'm truly afraid I will regret the decision I make, whether it's at the Large Company and during work I daydream of the experiences I could have had in the 3rd-world country or in the future if I have trouble finding work because I worked at this Small Company, especially for no pay. But I've stalked the people who have interned at this Small Company before and they're in places like Google and Apple and Snapchat right now, so even though I don't have much interest working for places like The Big 4, it's nice knowing that they're still doing fine.

I can truly see myself working full-time at this Small Company after I graduate, and I have asked them if they hire past interns full-time and they do, but unless I have an amazing experience at the Large Company I simply cannot see myself working there after graduation though they do want to hire their past interns as full-time as well. Both companies offer great mentorship.

I guess my main question is, would going for the Small Company hurt my chances in the future? Keep in mind, I have no previous internship experience so this will be the biggest thing on my resume. I will be doing CS-related, software stuff though at the Small Company so I can definitely fill up my resume with actual projects I would do. Or should I plan for the future instead and go with the secure, Large Company? I went to a tech talk once and the speaker mentioned how he admired people who took risks. That keeps replaying in my mind. Also, I am afraid of living a linear life, especially the rat race of the U.S., and going into the corporate world of the Large Company feels like a step into that direction, though it's a step I can fake my way in. 

I looked up on google already the title to this post and was overwhelmingly met with ""definitely do what pays"". But since I am graduating from one of the top 10 universities with a CS degree, maybe I will still be okay in the future if I do what I love now. Also, when I tell some of my peers about the Small Company some have looked down on me for wanting something that won't get me paid. Again, my uncle's death also taught me the value of money and how we would trade all the money we have for the person we love to stay alive, and as long as I can live comfortably in the future with extra money so I don't have to worry, being super rich is not an interest of mine. The experiences I have and the people I connect to in life is of greater importance. But maybe I am at a point in my life (junior in university) where I can't say things like that because of how young and inexperienced I am.

Most recent one was QA (python automation) and first one was Software Engineering (backend web but I didn't learn much). I shouldn't of taken the QA role imo, but I had no offers last Spring. This semester I again have no offers. I go to a top ten school so I'm assuming the problem is me and not anything else.

Over time I've been dicking around with Unity, machine learning, and C++. Just things that really interest me. I always hated web and mobile development. Now I realize that my hate for those are what is ruining my job opportunity. So right now I'm trying to learn Django and I guess Javascript is a must too. 

Do you guys have any recommendations on what should I learn or what has good prospects for the future? I was thinking of doing trying to get into backend development, but I have no idea what I should be trying to pick up before Fall recruiting. I decided to stop applying for internship roles, and just use the summer to level up my skills. Is it too late for me to make myself worthy of a decent Software Engineering role? I always get e-mails about QA roles. I just really found QA to be the most boring thing on the planet during my internship, and I can't go back.

TL;DR What should I try to pick up in 6 months that can land me a kush job in backend development if I'm currently learning Django and Javascript. I have used Java, Python, and C++ in the past."

I feel like I am at my wits end when it comes to engineering. I am currently studying industrial engineering (in my fourth semester) which is incredibly interesting to me, but I cannot seem to do well in classes. I really have no idea what is causing this, but every engineering course I have taken I have done poorly in. In high school and early college I found math and science very fun and I did well in those courses. When it came to engineering physics and other specifically engineering courses I did awful. I mean, I passed, but my GPA has suffered. Recently, at an advising appointment, my advisor mentioned that I should try to get my GPA up if I want to be considered for internships. That fucking hurt.

I keep asking friends and family for advice and they say things like ""keep at it"" and ""it will become easier"", but it has not and, at this point, I am only feeling discouraged. 

I guess I am reaching out because I wanted some unbiased feedback based on my situation. 

Or maybe if you all want to tell me what to do with my life, that would be fabulous. I am never opposed to that. 

Jokes aside, have any of you experienced this confusion? How did you all deal with it? "

4cqw30,1,2016-03-31,Studying/Exam frustration [venting],rhharrington,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4cqw30/studyingexam_frustration_venting/,"I had two exams back to back this week, one wednesday night and then one earlier this morning.  To make matters worse, this is the week right after spring break so obviously I was not studying the week before (I know, I know, I should have).

I kept hitting mental blocks while studying for the first exam, ultimately, it didn't go well for most people in the class, myself included.  However, I actually felt extremely confident for my second exam (Calculus III).  I was focused while I was studying, I felt that I understood the material, and woke up this morning ready and eager to take it.

I felt extremely confident in about 70% of the exam, and the other 30% I could not finish in time. The professor gives answer sheets to the problems on the test after you take it, and it crushed me.

I made senseless errors on several parts that is probably going to bring my grade down exponentially. I'm going to fail this class if I don't get at least a 70, and it's the second time I am taking the class already. 

I'm so upset, I truthfully and honestly worked very hard and felt like I understood the material.  The worst part is, this happens on every test I take in that class.  It doesn't matter how long, or how hard I study or how much I feel like I know it, I always end up with poor grades on tests and it's killing my GPA.  I'm struggling to get an internship this summer because I'm on academic probation. 

In high school, I was a very good student.  What happened? I feel like I study all day and all night and it doesn't reflect in my grades.  It's so infuriating. It makes me feel ridiculously unintelligent.  

I'm doing everything right. I have a tutor, I do the homework, I take notes in class, I study... what more can I possibly do? I don't even go out on the weekends because I'm studying or doing homework.

What is the point in working this hard if I'm just going to continuously fail? I feel like my grade would have been exactly the same if I didn't study at all.

**TL;DR**  Working hard and studying hard with no positive effects is killing my motivation "
4cr5vh,2,2016-03-31,Failing last sem of university. Going to talk with professor. What should I say? help,krkc,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4cr5vh/failing_last_sem_of_university_going_to_talk_with/,"**This is the issue in a nutshell: I skipped a lot of class and am mucking up my major-related classes. Finally going to talk with professor but not sure if I should tell him everything because this is a huge messy problem I have been struggling with since the beginning of university. I am especially worried about telling him I have hated my major for four years and it's one of the reasons I just want to give up completely.**

* Some context: I study product design. It's my last semester here. I've started skipping class a lot because I am too afraid to go in on presentation days without real progress or a good presentation. While I'm outside of class I can't put work into my final project. After four years of trudging through a major I actively dislike (and only stayed in at my parent's urging) I feel like I can't do this anymore, even though I am so close to graduating. Have been borderline failing my major-related class every single year now but managed to convince myself things will be different. Every time I think about this major or going to class, it saps my energy. The only times I can get work done outside of class is if I am in a group project because I feel beholden to other people. If it's just me, I don't care. I've even been tempted to deliberately definitively fuck everything up and seal my fate for the worst for good. At least then I'd know what to expect and can start getting used to it. Being anxious about failing my classes every semester for the past four years has taken a toll on me. I've been having nightmares for the past few weeks related to graduation. I don't feel this for any non-studio classes, but at this rate am fucking them up as well because I am paralyzed by fear. 


* Earlier this semester, I was offered to do a make-up project by another professor to try to pass a class I had failed. With such a big responsibility I freaked out in the middle of it and stopped making progress for two weeks. I then felt enormously guilty for disappearing on a professor who was willing to give me one last chance. I had blown it again. Motivation this semester plummeted after that and I started skipping other classes to try to catch up or even just to retreat from everything and stay home because I felt too shameful to go to class anymore. 


* After deciding to skip my major-related class again this morning, I sent my current professor an email letting him know what was going on. I thought I owed him the courtesy of an explanation at the least. I told him I am struggling with keeping things together but will try to show him progress next week. He replied asking me if we could meet before class next week. I'm going to do it. But I don't know what to tell him. Should I be honest about what I've been going through all these four years, culminating in this breakdown? Because this isn't a one time incident of time mismanagement. It's an ongoing four year snowball of stress, depression, upset expectations, and anxiety. The further I fall, the more I want to convince people I can recover. I want them to be proud of me. But the more I want to convince them, the more pressure I feel, and the less I am able to actually act. With internship, post-grad job searching, and this final project on top of everything--I feel like I am juggling too many things at once. I wish I could forget literally everything and just focus on ONE single project with realistic expectations. 


* I am also reluctant to tell my professor how I don't want to work on a project related to my major anymore. I'm already so far behind. There is a ton of work to do. I am drawing a blank. And I do not have the energy to force myself to even begin breaking it down into pieces. I don't think he will be understanding of this or want to hear it, but it's the truth. For my sanity I need to tell the whole truth to someone for once in my college career. But if he knows I've given up on my major, won't he completely give up on me as well? If you were a professor, would you want your student to be honest with you if it meant hearing they have lost all passion in the courses you teach? "

First, I feel like the actual program isn't teaching me as much as it should. It's hard, since I've never been to another university and I don't really have any standard to compare it to, but I'm seven weeks into Harvard's free CS50 course, and I feel like I've learned  more in those seven weeks than in the last three programming classes I've taken here.

And second, I worry that the schools's negative reputation will hurt my chances of getting jobs and internships.

I have already received an offer from a company on the east coast for a iOS position however they would be hiring me as an intern basically. Not the words they use but how it can be interpreted. I would be getting paid very little and it would be for three months. At the end of the training that is when people would be converted to full time developer making a decent amount. However not everyone makes it and from my research its about 60-70% of people. 

The other company I've been interviewing with looks like I'll be getting a job offer from them in the future. I would not have any kind of trial period like with the company but this position is for QA they said that they convert people from QA to Dev a lot of the time. I told them I wouldn't want to be doing QA for more than about a year and that seemed fine to them. So this has me feeling slightly better. Also this company would be paying me slightly less than if I had got the full time gig with the other company but this city is much cheaper to live in so my take home would actually be more than the previous company. 

So basically do I risk doing the trial from the first company because its better for my career? or do I go with the more stable offer and can lead me into a development job down the line? Another thing to consider is I need to pay off my student loans so if the first gig doesnt work out for whatever reason I am suddenly looking for a job again and having to pay my student loans."

I'm wondering how much getting an MBA will really help me, especially without work experience first.

At some point in my career I'd like to go into management, but I want to spend a while being a software engineer first. Would staying an extra year (and paying around $20-30k) be worth it to get an MBA from a top 50ish school? One of my main concerns is that I have to take a full course load over Junior and Senior summers, meaning that getting an internship would be difficult. If anyone here studied C.S. and got an MBA right after undergrad please let me know your experience.

If I don't get the 5th year MBA I may try to get into a top ranking MBA program after 5-7 years of work experience. Should I just stay and get the MBA now or work in the field and maybe go back for an MBA later? Let me know what you think.

I was waiting until April to follow up with my one solid prospect in a QA position, at the recruiter's request. I am in a QA elective right now and it seems like a good fit.

However, I received an unexpected email the other day. A company that had initially responded to let me know that they didn't really have anything that would be a good fit sent over an offer for a software engineering internship. It is out of town and they offered to put me up in an apartment for the duration of the internship.

There are two main reasons that I am hesitant to go for it. The first is that I already have an apartment lined up locally once my current lease ends; the other is that it requires a few languages with which I am not very knowledgable (C++ and some other variants). I know Java fairly well but that's just about it, since I am IT and have not had most of my coding courses yet.

I'm fairly certain I'd choke and gag and fail (and choke and gag) but I wanted to see what you more experienced guys thought.

I know it shouldn't always be a factor, especially for an internship, but it is. There is no pay. It is full time for 6 weeks over summer. Basically, a team of interns at Engico will come up with an idea, design and develop a prototype, market the prototype to attract investors, and use the money raised to actually send it into production. 
I think I'd like to accept, but having no pay will make it pretty rough for me this summer. 

But my counter dilemma is that I am a senior. Graduating in December of this year. I feel as though this is my last opportunity at an internship. I mean, it technically is. Unless I get an internship after graduation, but that really isn't part of anyone's plan, at least not anyone I know.
