The only way I can pay my tuition and other expenses is by working 50hr per week. I am not eligible for financial aid due to some reasons. And I am scared of taking a student loan because I saw everyone are crying about it (however, I don't know much about it and how much it covers). Because I work 50hrs, I have no time for self study and scarcely get time for University assignments.

As you may all know, it's almost impossible to get a internship or a job in a decent company only on the bases of college degree. I really starving to do self study but due to my financial situation I have no other option.

I am looking for some suggestions that makes my life easier. I can take a student loan but that would be my least option. (I can't apply for any scholarship for now due to my ineligibility. I am not a US citizen or green card holder.)"

- basic understanding of statistics (statistics, introductory econometrics)
- basic understanding of calculus 
- taken courses related to risk and finance
- but still feel I'm lack of enough math, statistics, programming skills, which is quite true.

Also, I'd really appreciate if anyone inform me about what I can expect from risk management as a job, and whether master degree(s) in statistics or other related areas are really needed.

I started as a helpdesk intern, then was hired on as a desktop tech. I finished my bachelors after about 2 years of that (CIS networking) and around the same time our network admin quit so the job was given to me. Shortly after that our systems admin quit too and I actually did both jobs for about a year. As my experience grew I found enjoyed systems (Windows/Linux/VMware/storage admin) more than networking (Cisco shop) so we hired on a network admin to go along side myself as the systems engineer. We’re a small shop if you couldn’t already tell. Less than 1000 employees. Our network admin quit after almost exactly a year, and because of my seniority and our CIO wanting to gain another manager in our department he made me “manager of network systems” and we hired another network admin who reports to me. 

What have others done as far as outlining this many different positions on a resume? I started with listing every position using typical formatting but elaboration on skills and duties with each makes my resume too long I feel. I feel It is misleading to just put my highest position and the time worked there. I could leave the helpdesk position out maybe...your thoughts and experiences are appreciated. 

TL;DR:
In the span of 9 years I’ve been helpdesk, network engineer, system engineer, both at the same time, and now for the past 2 years manager of network systems all for the same company. How do I format that on a resume?"

abktl9,4,2019-01-01,Dropped out of college before I got a degree due to personal issues. Have had a few (paid) software development internships since. I have some questions about importance of work experience vs degree when applying for jobs,AnImpromptuFantaisie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/abktl9/dropped_out_of_college_before_i_got_a_degree_due/,"Hello,

Here's a bit of backstory that's probably been said a hundred times before me, but I'll include just for more context. I'll include a TL;DR at the end. I started programming when I was around 12 or 13 because I wanted to make my own Minecraft mods (I'm 20 now, and it's crazy to think about how long ago Minecraft was released). I started by teaching myself Java, and went on to take programming classes at a tech summer camp, then throughout high school (as well as learning things on my own). As of now, I'm comfortable/moderately comfortable with Java, C/C++, Python, Javascript (NodeJS &amp; React included), Web Development, and have dabbled in iOS/Android development. I've taken on miscellaneous passion projects throughout the years and have a ""portfolio"" of documented code in various languages on my Github.

I got accepted to an engineering school, very well known for their CS department. I went there for 2 semesters, taking Data Structures, Computer Organization, and Discrete Mathematics courses. During the second semester I really began to struggle with depression and anxiety, but the worst was probably really bad insomnia. I would stay up all night and be exhausted during the day. Then I would pass out and be unable to wake up for classes. I ended up dropping out after the 2nd semester.


 ***TL;DR:*** *Had a passion for programming from a young age, comfortable with a good amount of languages, went to a well known university for 2 semesters, struggled with mental health/sleep issues and dropped out*

(I realize that turned into basically my entire life story. Sorry, I'll get into the relevant stuff now).

###Start here to skip my ""personal-issues sob story""

Its been 2 years since then, and I've had a few internships. I developed Digital Signage software, as well as a corresponding website for adding events/slideshow images that would be automatically pulled by the software. This was for a surgery department at a state university, and I worked solo on it. I later interned at the same university in the ""Enterprise Application Systems"" department, working with a team on a website testing infrastructure using Selenium (Java), Docker, and Bamboo.

Now onto my actual questions:

* Am I right in assuming that for some jobs, not having a degree will mean that my application is just thrown in the (metaphorical) trashcan?
* When it comes to applying for software development jobs without a degree, does my relevant prior work experience hold any weight?
* Is it at least worth sending in an application for jobs that require a degree?
* I'm still young (only 20). How much of a difference is there between going back to school full time, versus doing an internship while taking classes part time?
* How much does the ""prestige"" of a school actually matter when applying to a job? Like a well known university vs state college vs community college?


Thank you for getting through my rambling. I'd love to hear any thoughts, or whether anybody else has gone through anything similar."
abl5pj,4,2019-01-01,"“New” computer, “old” NVMe: everything works?",torsu,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/abl5pj/new_computer_old_nvme_everything_works/,"Hi! So I have two desktop computers, one for university and one for home.  Now that I’m taking an extended break from uni (internship), I decided to combine the best of both PCs to make a “new” computer for home use. The rest will go in storage until I go back to school.

From reading online, I quickly realized it would be problematic to just throw the NVMe drive into the “new” computer due to hardware licensing, drivers, etc.  First I tried running sysprep to generalize Windows but that threw me an error (user provisions or something). I decided attempting to fix that would be difficult and time consuming so I resigned myself to doing a clean reinstall of Windows 10 and starting afresh.

Right before I did that though, I said “%#€* it. I’ll try to boot without doing anything”.  Lo and behold, after a few minutes of “setting up new devices”, the “new” PC booted with the “old” NVMe, and there appears to be no issues whatsoever. The OS is detecting the motherboard, RAM, CPU, GPU, etc.  Everything seems to be working fine. I didn’t even have to re-enter the Windows license key. 

With anything technology-associated, I get very suspicious when it “just works”.  Therefore my question to you, good community, is: am I setting myself up for failure here? What steps can I take to double check I don’t have a bloated registry, or unused and possibly conflicting drivers? Anything else I may be missing?

I’ll list my specs below.  Anything in parentheses is the “old” hardware from the perspective of the OS on the NVMe:

Windows 10
i7-8700k OC’ed (i5-7600k OC’ed)
Z370 Aorus Gaming K3 (Z270 Aorus Gaming K3)
GTX 1080 Ti
32GB RAM (16GB RAM same brand and type, Vengeance something or other)
EVGA CLC 280 (air cooling)

Samsung 970 EVO 500GB (this is the NVMe drive from the second computer. It should only “know” the hardware in parentheses).

When I boot the computer, all the fans run at or close to 100%, including the water cooler. They continue to you so until I put it to sleep and start it again.  Then they vary with the temps as they should.  BUT this was an issue with this MB/cooler/fans BEFORE I switched the storage disk, so not a new peculiarity.  Interesting that this carries over despite a “new” OS... should also be noted that I never installed the EVGA water cooler software.

Anyway, to bring a longish post to an end, I’d appreciate anyone’s comments on this.  I feel like it should have been more work, and that I’m missing something important.

Thanks in advance, and happy New Year!"

But I have essentially no experience yet in terms of coursework in the area. 

I will be taking a graduate level course in real time embedded systems starting next week and another course in embedded systems in a few months. 

But I ideally would like to try and get an internship in this area this summer. I haven’t had any internships yet and the prevailing wisdom is you should have at least one. I’m involved in a Research lab at the moment on my campus, but it’s not in embedded systems. I’m looking to move into an embedded systems research lab after I conclude my graduate level course. 

What’s the best stuff I could realistically do at this point in my development? I have a great work ethic that’s led to very good grades, but I don’t have much direction outside of my studies. 

Lastly, if I cannot secure an internship before graduation, will I be okay? I’m interested in a masters program, but I’m not discounting an industry type job.

I honestly have no idea where I want to go or where I have a chance. Some schools I'm interested in are UT Austin (most likely getting auto-admit), Carnegie Mellon, Boston University, Rhode Island School of Design, Brown, Reed College, UWash, Wash U in St. Loius, USC, UChicago, Princeton, UPenn (this was my dream school last year), UC Berkely, Columbia, but honestly I feel like I know little about most of these schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a White middle-class female at a big and academically competitive public school in Texas. Not entirely sure what I want to major in, but I’m interested in combining STEM, particularly environmental science, with design. I’m also looking into bio, psych, polsci, and English because I’m indecisive lol.

**GPA:** In my district GPA is on a 7 point scale and weighed kind of weird (I know, it’s dumb). So I’m not entirely sure, but I think my weighted GPA on a 4 point scale is like a \~4.6. I’ve only ever gotten one B before, in AP Chem. I’m not sure my class rank but at the end of sophomore year I was in the top 6% and have most likely gone up.

**Standardized Tests**: I haven’t taken my SAT yet. I got a 1330 with 730 English and 600 Math (rip) on the latest PSAT without any studying, and am doing math practice \~15 minutes a day to prepare for my SAT in March. I think (read: hope) that my math is improving. If I don't do well in March I'll get a tutor.

**APs:**

Sophomore: AP World History- 4 (rip)

Junior: AP Chem, APUSH, AP Comp Sci 2, and AP Lang

Senior: Unsure which ones I’ll take, probably APES, AP gov, AP macro, AP lit, and maybe AP stat, calc, or art.

**EC's:**

Just as a heads up, my ECs, especially up until this year, are pretty weak because freshman year I was going through shit and also tried to kill myself. I am not planning on mentioning that at all in my apps, so I’d appreciate if anyone has some guidance on what I should focus on for the rest of junior year and senior year to make up for this.

* Will have done art all 4 years
* Am currently Historian of Speech and Debate, will probably have a more impressive sounding officer position next year, and will have done LD debate for 3 years and gone to summer camp for it 2 summers.
* Will have been President of Recycling Club 2 years. Backstory: My district canceled the recycling program, so I founded the club in order to bring recycling back.
* Kickboxing 2 years
* Black belt in Tae Kwon Do, included teaching like 2-3 hours a week for about a year (counts as volunteer hours).
* I'm trying to get an internship in conservation or something else relevant to my interests this summer
* Occasionally volunteer at the Houston Food Bank
* Also worked at McDonalds for a while if it means anything lol

**Awards:**

I’m looking to enter some essay writing and art competitions since I'm currently lacking here

* Some smaller art awards, but hopefully something more notable by the end of this school year, as I’ve entered some that results haven’t come out for
* Similarly, I have trophies and awards from local debate tournaments, but nothing very impressive.
* If everything goes to plan I’ll be a national AP scholar

**Essays:**

I honestly know nothing about the essay writing process as of now, but I do generally write pretty good essays. One thing I would like to write an essay about is growing up queer in a conservative area, and how debate helped me ultimately embrace myself and come out. I’m not sure if that’s too cliche, though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc:**

I want to go to school somewhere very urban, preferably in the North East/East coast (but Washington and Oregon are pretty cool, too). I do not have a car and won't be able to/don't want to get a car. I most likely won't consider conservative schools or schools in conservative areas.

I spent the first year out of law school taking care of my mother who became very ill in the last week of my last semester. This last year was spent mostly looking for work and taking the bar in July to see where i stood. I ended up failing, but this was of no concern to me as Illinois was never the state I had planned on practicing law. After a year of applying to jobs ranging from gas station attendant to adjunct faculty at community colleges i have had no success with even securing an interview. So I have decided to move forward with my plans to leave Illinois and move to Colorado. My plan is to find work as a paralegal until I am settled and eventually become a licensed attorney. 

My concern is that my experience is mostly what I learned in school along with summer internships at a state's attorney office. With some retail before i graduated from community college and went to a 4 year university.

I am also was wondering, since I am looking for work roughly 15 hours from where I am currently living, how likely are potential employers willing to conduct phone interviews? What would be a reasonable time frame to give to an employer about when i can start working in order to secure a place to live and get moved in?

So this actually happened a while ago, but the pain has abated enough for me to be able to bring it back in my memory without dying in shame. TL;DR at the end.

Some background: I was at the last year of my uni engineering degree and landed the job of my dreams as an intern at a large tech company. This was about 3-4 weeks into the job, I'm still what you'd consider fresh meat. On the fateful day, I was to meet a manager and his team that was going to help me with a project that I was to work on for the next few months. Naturally, I wanted to look good for the meeting. I bought a new shirt, some professional-snazzy looking pants (aka. *expensive* pants). On that day, I looked awesome, I arrived a few minutes early and was feeling great. Unfortunately, on that day I happened to forget my ID. Things went downhill from there.

At the front gate I realized I didn't have my ID, so I sidestepped out of the stream of employees converging on the turnstiles, and approached one of the security guards and explained to that I don’t have my ID. He told me that to check my credentials we'll have to go to the ‘special’ booth, but it's on the other side of the entrance road and there was a HUGE puddle in between. Not wanting to get my shoes wet, I jumped over the puddle. My intent was to leap over it gracefully, like a gazelle (that was literally the image in my mind). Pffft. What actually happened was really more of an unfortunate lunge, than a jump, to be honest. As I leaped so ungracefully, I heard a terrible, horrible ripping noise. I silently wished it wasn't something important, because….. *of course it* ***would*** *be*. I felt a chilly breeze all over my legs, and... the rest. Oh no. Oh no no no no no. The guard looks at my pants and stifles a laugh. I brace myself, and I looked down at my pants, or at least, I looked down at where my pants were *supposed* to be. These so called *professional* pants were apparently not built for lunging; or jumping; or any movement, really. The damage was so bad that it had ripped from front to back, nearly splitting it in entirely in half. My pants were basically kept in place by the belt and zipper. Only later it actually dawned on me that I was, at the time, mooning every single employee coming in through the main entrance.

Embarrassed, as you guys can imagine, I told the guard: “I think I'll go home now”, in the most dignified way possible, considering I’m half naked. ""Nonsense,"" he said, waving it off with a chuckle, ""we'll give you a sewing kit in the lobby, you’ll fix it right up"". I didn't quite know what to say, and as I was otherwise going to be late for my meeting, I went along with him. Holding my backpack behind me so that I wouldn’t moon the *entire* staff of the company who were probably *already* regretting they hired me, I approached the front desk, explaining my predicament. The lady at the desk smiled at me and handed me a sewing kit. I ignored her silent fit of giggles as I re-positioned my backpack and took the sewing kit to the guest-bathroom, and got to fixing the tear. Only then did I actually realize just how bad it actually was. It was even worse than I thought possible, it was like the pants were made of toilet paper. Who makes pants like these???  Recalling the one time in my life that I sewed a button on my shirt, I started to patch up the tear. It took all 5 spools of thread in the kit to fix the tear with colors ranging from white, yellow, blue, red and black. I gotta say, I didn't look very good but at least it was *colorful*.

But that’s not the worst part. While I was patching up my pants, I hurriedly texted my boss and CC'ed the manager I'd be meeting the following SMS explaining why I'm late: ""Sorry, Going to be late, had accident in pants, fixing in bathroom ASAP"". Only later I thought to clarify, but there was no real coming back after some as badly worded as THAT. My boss just replied ""We'll reschedule, *take your time in the bathroom*"". Walking in to that meeting half an hour later with my head held high, with the 5 people I was supposed to impress sniggering at me on entrance, was one of the hardest things I had to do in my life.

I was known for the following 3 years, albeit somewhat affectionately as ""moon boy"". By everyone in the building (even those that weren't even working there at the time). Oh man... 

PS. As to the SMS, since then I moved up in the company, moved on to another job, a different team, different people. I thought it was over. Nope. The manager that I was to meet at the time actually emailed be with a screenshot of the SMS I had sent him. Apparently he thought it was so funny he's saved it on his computer somewhere. This is going to haunt me, isn't it :(.

**TL;DR Bought new pants for an important meeting as a recent new hire, ended up ripping them REALLY badly and mooned half the employees at the company in the loby. And to top it off, sent a badly worded SMS to by boss that made it sound like I had an 'accident' in my pants. I was known since then as ""moon boy"", by everyone in the building for the next 3 years.**"

He really wanted this job because it's relatively stable and has good benefits. I'm a 20 year old engineering student who has about 2 years left in school and I am trying my best to get a great job after I graduate. I was reading through some documents in his desk when he asked me to find something there and I found documents regarding a compliant he filed against violent customers, and other abusive drivers. He once had a case where he slowed the bus down to get an old woman on the bus who couldn't want and was berated by another driver on the bus for ""being a dumbass"". Other situations, where customers throw coffee and feces. It just underscores the shitty environment he has to face just to put food on the table. My mom works as a cashier at walmart and I'd imagine the environment isn't any better. I haven't talked to them about it. I have a younger brother who's also a freshman engineering major and we talked about this together and it really hurts that our parents have to go through so much nonsense just so we could have a better future. I have a great internship lined up this summer with an engineering firm that'll pay well; last summer I interned in california and made some money which I used to treat everyone to dinner, buy clothes for everyone and get laptops for my brother and younger sister, that they'll need for school. I'm also able to fund my education through loans/internships/grants. It just sucks that I can't really take them out of this situation until I graduate and even if I do, I want both my parents to live with me when I get married, but I dunno how the wife will feel about that. I feel kind of helpless and just need advice on things I can do now to make my parents' condition better. I want to be wealthy one day so that we can live in the same house or even neighborhood and not have to deal with the crap that comes with blue collar jobs. My parents laid out their entire lives for me and my siblings and I think the least I can do is do something about this. I know my parents are people, and they had a life before me, I just want them to feel that I care and I'm doing everything in my power to make their lives comfortable.

I know this is a really lengthy post but i hope you don't mind me pouring out what i feel..

This is my very first post in this Subreddit.

Just a short background of myself.. I had completed and achieved a Diploma in IT earlier in 2018. Right now i'm serving in the military in my country.

In my Diploma, i did projects which involved skillsets such as Java, C#, HTML (CSS, HTML), Android (Java). Also, during my 6 months internship i used languages like JS and Python. I'd be honest that what i know with all these languages that i had touched, it's not much, maybe just the syntax and its bare minimal..

I'll be in the military till the year 2020 and i'll move onto pursue a degree in CS. Having said so, i have actually ample time to pick up as much as possible to enhance my programming knowledge/skills before i get busy with my degree.

I know it's kind of a corny, lengthy and unnecessary background info but if you readers don't mind, i'll dive right into the queries i have.

I'm someone that prefers to watch over reading to learn ironically, programmers ought to read a lot. But it's just an individual preference on how i learn, like everyone has their method of learning. I started reading ""***Automate the boring stuff - Python***"" earlier today, recommended by a friend in the army.

I started off a few days ago with ***codecademy*** in Python. But i just feel it's not right for me, like what i'm doing is not how i really want to learn.

I'm a practical &gt; theoratical person. But i always believe in having the right fundamentals/foundation of a subject before proceeding onto the next level.

There are many many resources out there. I've glanced through some here and there. But i just can't seem to find one that really suits me. It might be a thought at the back of my head that 'oh this resource isn't the full package, or it's outdated, and what nots.'

I saw a post from a fellow Redditor and he/she mentioned ***Udemy***. I went and take a look at it and i was somewhat impressed with how things are in that site. For instance, it's a package of \[something\] and it's a systematic step by step delivery. I considered a day ago to spend maybe less than a hundred bucks to start off. To purchase some courses which interest me considering the fact that ***Udemy*** is having a new year's sale.

Also, I know that there are free resources online why pay to learn. I think some of us may have that mentality of 'you pay for what you get', i feel that there might be a certain edge comparing free and paid learning.

Please feel free to correct me if i'm wrong.

I know all of you subscribers here have different views and opinions on what i written above, against courses (free/paid), etc. But i would love to hear from anyone of you, be blatant, i'm okay with it. It's like accepting criticism to become better.

Treat me like a newborn :') . If there's any advices, recommendations, or perspectives. Please go ahead!

Thank you so much for reading, appreciate it! And Happy New Year!

Edit: This post may seem incomplete, there's a start and end but the body isn't as developed. There's just so much i want to say and express but it'll be too much for a post here.."

OK, so I just came off of one year of self-taught Java (enough to get up to basic class declarations), and a semester of basic C++ (enough to get into 2D arrays, though I also self-taught class creation), and just started learning Python for a potential internship in the summer.

I've been starting to code/learn Python for about two hours now, and already I'm looking at enhanced for-loops and array lists, something covered at about week 9 or 10 in Java, and not at all in C++ (had to learn vectors on my own time).  It just feels wrong.  Like, I've gotten used to coding being an obtuse, unintuitive nightmare that I actively have to duel with in order to get anything done, and this feels like kid gloves.  Like I'm some kid whose father is letting him play with the coding, oh, you don't need to worry about declaring variables, Mr. Compiler here does it automatically.  Curly brackets to mark where loops start and end?  No, just hit tab.

Yesterday my parents found half a pill of ecstasy with my belongings. As the title says, this isn't the first time my parents have found some of my stuff. First time around they had found my pipe and a quad of weed. Second time around they had found my wax pen but they thought it was a nicotine device. Here's the third time rolling around. Yea, I know, I'm terribly stupid and careless. Had I been more careful with my things this would all have never happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't felt more terrible in my life. My parents have sacrificed so much for me and I'll go as far as to say I've been extremely privileged in my life. I've been extremely lucky to have a high degree of freedom and independence, but now that is going to completely change. What really gets me is that they see drug use and success as mutually exclusive things. To them, if you're successful in you're life you must not use drugs, and if you do use drugs you're immediately a failure and a degenerate. My parents are immigrants, and I understand there's a generational gap between my generation and theirs in many regards, especially the attitude towards drugs and drug use. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little more background with myself without revealing too much: I'm a first generation college student and I've excelled in my particular course of study and field. With multiple internships under my belt and a decent GPA, I've done everything that I *thought* they wanted of me. I'm at university, my future is extremely bright and I undoubtedly know I will complete uni in 4 years with a job lined up afterwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

While they were chewing me out, they brought up some points that I already knew and acknowledged, but to them it seemed like I didn't. They do menial work for mediocre pay but it keeps food on the table and me at school. I acknowledge their sacrifices and that's why I put so much effort into excelling at my studies and profession. To them, it's as if I just threw that all away. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father has anger issues and some things he said to me last night really gave me cause for concern. He keeps mentioning how he has a gun and that he won't hesitate to use it to kill me. I'm relatively sure that's just his emotions running high and once he cools off he'll come to the realization that he didn't really mean those things.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is going to be quite different now. That sense of freedom and independence is no longer true. I'm not sure if this is a temporary or permanent thing but regardless I absolutely feel terrible about how things unfolded. I couldn't get any sleep last night and I'm sure my parents couldn't either. As for my drug use, I'm thinking about stopping for a while, if not permanently. Seeing how much pain it caused my parents now made me realize that that pain inflicted is not worth the temporary high.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm trying to gain in posting this. I think I just needed it get it off my chest and maybe hear what other people think. Sorry if my thoughts are incoherent and scrambled, I simply don't feel like myself right now. "

Hi Guys,

I graduated Aug 18 with Bachelors in Technology in Mechatronics from a private university (the university is part of a group of eminent institutions, but relatively younger, therefore not considered a top university) in India. I am planning on going for my masters and I am particularly interested in a year-long MSC program from the University of Surrey, UK. I am interested in pursuing MSc. Computer vision, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence there.

[https://www.surrey.ac.uk/postgraduate/computer-vision-robotics-and-machine-learning-msc-2019](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/postgraduate/computer-vision-robotics-and-machine-learning-msc-2019)

This looks like a perfect course to me considering my interests and future expectations on the kind of field I would like to work in. As far as I researched, this is the only course that combines computer vision, robotics, and machine learning which is what I was hoping to do in my masters.

I have a few queries:

1. **Is it worth it?** I am an international student, who comes from a middle-class family, therefore the program is very expensive for me. I will have to take an education loan. Also, consider the program does not include placement support
2. **Reviews and experiences.** If somebody here studied this program, I would like to know their review and experiences? I googled stuff but student review for this particular program is hard to come by. Also, insight on the university is welcome.
3. **Doctorate.** Will it affect in a good or bad way my chances to obtain a doctorate in the future? Considering I will have a loan to pay.
4. **what are my chances?** The most important question is what are my chances of getting an offer?

Consider my educational background;

CGPA 6.67 (on a scale of 10)

Last 4 semester average 7.42

my pitch here is, that I have consistently been improving my grades every semester, culminating with achieving a 9 GPA in the last semester that included practical work.

Industrial Internship (last semester) GPA 9. Worked for 4 months (duration of the semester) as a system integration intern, in the embedded systems department for a startup focused on a self-driving vehicle. Got offered a conversion from the internship to a job, which still holds if I don't go for masters. I hope I will be able to obtain a referral or LOR from my supervisor if needed. I successfully defended the independent work that I have done there in front of an external panel from the industry, who graded it. ( work was closely related to embedded systems, computer vision, python programming, machine learning etc, which relates me to the course I wish to take admission in )

semester 6, course industrial robotics, secured 9/10 on a class project ( internal marking for the course) by implementing 2 axis Pick and place robot based on Arduino and Matlab. I hope I will also be able to get LOR or referral from the professor who taught this course.

certificates: 1. Control of mobile robots. Platform: Coursera; provided by: Georgia Institute of Technology.

(Course was taught online, the examination was conducted within university based on the course and completion of course certificate carried credit, got graded A )

2. Hands-on computer Vision with OpenCV and python (Udemy)

Did no of minor projects like building a battle bot, an RC airplane, Line Follower Bot throughout my Btech. Also attended and organized a no of workshops on topics from raspberry pi, IOT, quadcopters etc.

Was the head of the database department (nothing fancy, no SQL involved ) for institute of engineers (IEI) mechatronics student chapter. Conducted events for IEI in Techfest.

relevant courses I studied in Btech 1) industrial robotics 2) embedded systems 3) CNC programming 4)PLC programming 5) core Java 6) Micro electro mechanical systems 7) Mechatronics system design etc.

I am worried that my lower performance in earlier semesters will not be compensated with average performance in higher semesters and will hurt my chances."

I was wondering if I can get some advice on applying for Fall 2019 enrollment for OMSCS. I graduated last year with a Social Science Major and CS Minor, and I have had 1 CS-related internship and 1 year of software engineering work experience. I've also completed a Udacity nanodegree in programming last year.

However, my grades for my CS and Math classes are not strong. My overall GPA is 3.2, but here's the breakdown for the CS + math classes:

CS: Intro to Computer Science. B-

CS: C Programming. B

CS: Algorithms and Data Structures. B-

CS: Information Search and Discovery. B-

CS: Advanced Programming Techniques (Project-based class). B+

Math: Calculus I. B+

Math: Linear Algebra. B-

I wanted to see if I could increase my chances of being admitted by taking classes at my local community colleges. For the Winter term which ends Feb, I can take one of these: 'Linear Algebra', 'Multivariable and Vector Calculus' and 'Differential Equations'. I am also considering taking online classes at Foothill, specifically 'Introduction to Database Management Systems' and 'Computer Architecture and Organization', especially since I feel like I am severely lacking in database and architecture knowledge and want to get college credit for it. 

I wanted to know if there is anything more I can do between now and March 1 (the deadline) to increase my chances of being admitted. I'd also appreciate any other thoughts or pieces of advice. Thanks!"
abzhrz,37,2019-01-02,"Happy new years. I just got an awesome job offer after being out of the corporate world for 7 years, and after taking 10 years to complete my degree!",jsideris,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/abzhrz/happy_new_years_i_just_got_an_awesome_job_offer/,"Sup guys. Just wanted to share this experience. In 2012 I had an internship experience as part of my degree in computer engineering for 16 months, where I picked up a ton of great experience in full stack development focusing on Microsoft technologies. 

In 2013 I used that knowledge to start a business that went through several pivots and ultimately failed. Unfortunately, I had taken a leave of absence from my degree, and owed my university several thousands dollars. Money was tight, but I paid myself a minimal founder salary to get through it and continue working on my dreams until the bitter end. 

During that time I did attempt to apply for a few full-time positions that interested me, and I got a few interviews, but nothing went through.

In summer of 2018 I realized that I wouldn't be able to afford this forever, and that it was time to get some security. I decided to pay the outstanding balance to my university (mostly using my credit card :/) and complete the last course needed to get my degree, and I moved out from my apartment broke, and feeling hopeless. The past couple months were hitting me hardest of all. I don't really want to get into that though.

However, one smart thing I did over the years was continuously building up an incredible portfolio. I released a video game, I worked on open source projects, frameworks, APIs, websites, and all kinds of other things. Kept my skills up to date. It paid off.

At the end of December, after writing my last final exam, I applied for six positions, got one interview, and just today that turned into an offer. It's a competitive salary at a profitable company near where I live (Toronto) using mostly Microsoft stack, which I'm good with.

For anyone who's in my shoes, here are a few factors that I think contributed to me getting the offer.

- Have a good portfolio. I think more comprehensive projects, especially ones that were profitable, are more impressive than a ton of small projects that no one uses.
- Don't wait too long to dip your feet in the corporate world, if that's something you want to do. Every time I got an interview, my case always threw the interviewers off. People were concerned that I'd get bored working at their company and leave to go join a startup or something. While I did have a lot of skills, I wasn't up to date with industry best practices, and for instance working for myself, I can cut whatever corners I want in order to get stuff done faster. A few interviewers were concerned that it would be difficult for me to fit into a corporate structure after being self-employed for so long. I fear that if I'd waited too long I would have made myself unemployable.
- Keep your skills up to date. The employers were specifically drilling down to find out whether I am eager to learn new things and grow. 
- Many employers seem to be looking for someone who will stick around a while and can be invested in.

The job was a full stack dev position on Microsoft stack. The offer was for 65K CAD. it was a bit lower than I'd hoped, but that may have been partly my fault. I had no frame of reference because I'd been out for so long. I tried negotiating a bit with the director by explaining that I don't have a frame of reference to know what the position is worth, but getting paid fairly and competitively is a requirement for me. He explained that the amount I was being offered was just under ""intermediate"". For an extra $5k, expectations would be much higher. I could have asked for $70k, but I realized that this is my first opportunity in a while and I didn't want them on my back during the probationary period. So I'll negotiate that later. Plus I don't even have any certs, so hopefully I made the right move with that. Tbh I'd be happy making anything right now to get out of the shit hole I'm in.

Anyway, I hope that helps someone who is in a similar situation as me. Good luck with your job hunt, people!"

Hi guys

Back in October, I participated in HackGT, and although I did not win, an engineering manager from Lyft asked me to send him my re\_sum. I then asked him if it was fine to send my resum at the end of the year, and he said it was fine.

However, the year has ended and I just realized that I need waaay more time than I had anticipated. I would like to work on projects that involve ML, IOS, and hardware (maybe scalability?), as well as spend some time on competitive programming. Due to the upcoming semester, I won't be able to complete my goals until March (which may be late to apply/or be considered for a summer internship).

1. Should I send my re\_sum now, or ask him for an extension (I like this option, but I'm afraid to bother him any further)?
2. When applying for internships, are you more likely to get an interview if you apply online, or if you have your re\_sum ""passed around""(as he stated) by someone who works in the company?
3. Should I forget about this altogether and apply somewhere else? (or is this a good opportunity that I shouldn't miss out on)

Btw, the stress of meeting the December deadline has given me lots of anxiety. It has also impacted my productivity severely.

Thank you."

ac0dxr,36,2019-01-02,24M / Product Manager (Tech) / 730 GMAT / 3.67 GPA / Career switch from tech to music business,bsimmboi88balla,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/ac0dxr/24m_product_manager_tech_730_gmat_367_gpa_career/,"**Background**

* Work experience:
   * Product Manager at NYC tech startup (June 2017 - present)
      * Startup is semi-well known, and even moreso in NYC due to subway ads - we were acquired late last year after raising multiple venture rounds (series c)
      * Promotions: junior product manager —&gt; product manager (July 2018) —&gt; product manager II (hoping this will happen in late 2019 before b-school app deadlines)
      * Very diverse project experience across the business and tech stack. I’ve led 4 product initiatives so far, each lasting 2-4 months long, with about 3-5 other team members who are product designers and software engineers. My teams have shipped multiple high visibility features that have made significant impact to the business.
      * I highly enjoy working at this company due to its people + culture, and my learning curve still looks steep for the next few years, so I'm aiming to stay until I start b-school in Fall 2020 (which would bring my total work experience before matriculation to 3 years).  
 
* Extra-curriculars (post-college):
   * Electronic music producer/DJ (Jan 2017-present)
      * 200k streams/views across SoundCloud and YouTube (personal goal is get a track on Spotify by end of the year)
      * DJing events in the city
      * Doing my own artist management and marketing/distribution (kinda feels like running a startup, which is cool)
      * Helping organize music events with other local artists
      * Writing my own music blog on music production tutorials and music industry trends  
 
   * Volunteer mentor for high school girls in tech program (July 2017 - present)
      * Mentored 4 girls (high schoolers and college students) about careers in product management, college essays, internship prep
      * One mentee was accepted to Columbia undergrad and another mentee got her Google SWE internship offer  
 
   * Marathon/half-marathon runner:
      * 1x marathons (fall 2017), 2 half-marathons (fall 2018)
      * Marathon PR of 3:17 (\~7:30 min/mile), half-marathons were more for participation
      * Not sure if I’m going to do another marathon lol but running is something I spend a lot of time training for nowadays so I figured I’d mention it  
 
* Extra-curriculars (in-college):
   * Hip hop dance team (4 years)
   * President of largest tech club on campus (senior year, executive board member for other 3 years)
   * Hired by Undergrad Student Services Office to be a peer mentor for students interested in tech (senior year)  
 
* Undergrad school/major: top 5 undergrad b-school (honors program) // BS in Business - double concentration in Statistics and Analytics (took a few computer science courses, too)  
 
* Nationality/Sex: Chinese/Male (US Citizen)  
 

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 730 (Q44, V46)
* Undergrad GPA: 3.67 cumulative (Cum Laude)  
 

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
   * I’ve always had a passion for the arts (danced + played piano my whole life and then started producing electronic music/DJing last semester of my senior year in college). But sometime during my sophomore year, I decided to play it safe and go for a more sustainable career in tech. Now that I’m 1.5 years out of school, it’s become apparent what my real life calling is given that I spend 90% of my free time making music and reading about the music industry. However, I don’t think my tech/product management experience has all been in vain. There’s so much innovation happening in music business via technology right now (e.g. streaming revolution) and I want to be part of it - from the way people listen to/discover/engage with music to how artists promote their music. So in a nutshell, my goal is to switch careers from tech to music business. I’ve been told that breaking into the music industry with my tech background doesn’t seem likely because I haven’t done anything professionally relevant. I’m hoping that an MBA gives me a chance to reposition myself for this new career path - either in artist management or digital strategy - at a big 3 record label.  
 
* Target schools: M7
   * Not looking to go into an MBA program that leans heavily towards entertainment + media fields because I want my education/network to be more generalist and diverse. If I’m going back to school, I’d like take a chance to broaden my horizons, as well  
 

**Questions/Concerns**

1. As an asian male, does my GMAT score need to be higher? Especially since my GPA is right around average for M7 and I'm sure there's many asian males who have much higher GPAs.  
 
2. Does my lack of work experience longevity hurt my application? Will applying R2/R3 boost my chances because it allows me to claim more experience? I will have 3 years of experience by the time I start b-school (Aug 2020) but only at this one company. I’m hoping that the rotational aspect of my role helps in the sense that I’ve led many different types of projects while here (highly technical projects, partnership integrations, and consumer app features).  
 
3. Of the M7, which school has better academic/club environment, reputation, and network in entertainment/music business? I’ve seen some music biz VPs/execs from HBS so I’ve been leaning towards that as my #1 choice. 

Many thanks for reading and leaving feedback, everyone. Happy New Year!"

But the truth of the matter is, making mistakes is necessary rite of passage into adulthood. Anyhow, the consequences of their parenting style manifested when it became clear my siblings and I do not have the life skills to manage adulthood. My internship didn't work out when I was an undergrad. I graduated three years ago and did two more courses to get a job related to my degree. Currently I'm working part time in retail while doing masters but my mother thinks I am ""suffering"" and underestimates my resilience. But I do not actually mind working in retail and I could easily _get over_ the feeling of embarrassments when I see couple of my former classmates in grocery. I understand most people have varying degrees of ego and pride and depending on the person they'll feel ashamed or even depressed over failures which I have witnessed in some people but somehow I never felt giving up. I get the vibe from my mother that she is maybe curious why I haven't been deeply sad and disappointed of our current state when most people would have. I have to work as well since she is the only one working besides me because my useless brothers are too conditioned and helpless by years of being spoon fed to work their asses off and my father is too pussy to do anything after what he had done to get himself fired years ago.

Despite all that however, yeah I am even surprised of myself that I haven't gone into depression or given up. I know many people would as I have seen in my South Asian friend who unfortunately had to defer his studies and instead of throwing the towel, he threw himself to the couch and playing videogames. Nonetheless, my mother thinks I am like most people and still fecking think I am on the brink of collapse and has to be hovered about by her like a helicopter she is to monitor me. Honestly, the only thing I can't stand anymore is living with my parents and putting up with their bullshit overparenting of adults like me. And couple of years ago they wonder why we're not ""independent"". They stopped complaining about it now that they're witnessing the consequences of their parenting style and after witnessing first hand on how my cousins were just as helpless and spoon-fed by their mother as me and my siblings have been."

tl;dr: 
If you're from a different country than the US please share your story in IT and a piece of advice.


I really like this sub because it's always bringing meaningful discussions. Even though there's a lot of negativity as it has been pointed out recently, it is still a great community.


I noticed that almost everyone here talks about careers in the USA, so some discussions are not very relatable to people from other countries.


I'm a developer from Brazil and I wanted to know about people's experiences from other countries different from the US. Feel free to share here your experience, especially how you have conducted your career so far. 


My story in a nutshell + advice:


Got a job at a medium company (5k employees) that are distributed in a few countries over the world. I had almost one year left in college at the time. I was referred by a former colleague from an internship program. 

My main advice: networking is key. And by networking I mean meaningful and sincere relationships that you cultivate during your college time / career. It's more about how you understand your dependence on other people in life than making them into a career ladder. 

Good networking is when you do your best for people when you don't need them, because you actually care about them and not only your own work :)"

I just don't want to mindlessly apply to every single company that comes up, but I want to apply to the ones that I might have better chance of getting over others, if I do get in at all.

In other words, how do I know which companies are more willing to take in much less qualified candidates such as myself?

I am an intern in a company and I have to set a windows to domain on a machine that runs windows server 2012 r2, I have plugged it to a switch, and configured AD DS and DNS server on it and created a domain that I named test.local, I also created a new user in active directory and added. I want to set this user on a computer. I have installed a windows 10 virtual machine on another PC and I plugged it into the switch. I gave the server the following ip address [192.168.50.1](https://192.168.50.1) and the other PC [192.168.50.2](https://192.168.50.2), both computers don't give ping when I do it in cmd,  looked u google and found that I have to activate the following services on the server : 

\-DNS client

\-Function discovery

\-SSDP directory

\-UPnP device host

and I turned network discovery on on both computers but I still can't have ping, is there anything that I'm missing or doing wrong ?

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple of things that worry me.

1. I figured out what I wanted to do my sophomore year at Community College so I feel like I am behind. I took two java classes that sophomore year. This sort of may tie into number 2.
2. I feel like I know nothing to do with actual desktop development. The classes I am taking are teaching me things that I do not consider to be not important, but being that it is my Junior year and I have not even created a simple application of any kind is extremely concerning to me. I just finished my data structures class this last semester which clearly has its values and I am not trying to downplay it, I just feel like since I should be looking for internships for this coming summer I should have some experience to show off to make people want to hire me for the internship position.
3. The only Language I know at the moment is Java. This coming semester I will be Learning C++ as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I am not learning what a really need to learn to get into the field for software development.  My advisor (who is chair of the CS department) says that I am in a typical spot and should not be worried but I can't really not worry when I see all the job requirements I don't meat for internships that I need to be applying for.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or insight would be much appreciated...

Can anyone help me find out which colleges I am suited to apply to? I will write my stats down below

Demographics: Asian male, South Korean, not a U.S resident (international student)

I currently go to a foreign school in Korea and the highest average gpa I can get untill senior is 3.88 uw and 4.05 w (I'm not sure about my class rank but I'm pretty sure that I'm in the top 6 people out of 33 people in my grade) I'm not sure about how prestigious my highschool is in perspective of U.S universities, but we've had people go to good schools last year (Had 2 UPENN and 3 Cornell 1 UC Berkeley not sure about the rest)

​

I've already took my first standardized test, although I used to get around high 1400s on my mock exams, I did so poorly (thanks to the curve :( ) and got a 1330 on it, I have 5+ chances of Sat, or ACT.

​

I took one subject tests which is Mathematics 2 and I got a 780 on it I'm planning on taking subject chemistry and possibly another one (subject world history or korean)

I took 1 ap in my sophomore (AP WH and got a 3)

now, I'm taking AP CHEM AP ECON AP ENV and self studying AP CALC BC

​

My extracurricular is honestly not that impressive because I didn't win any awards

I have a lot of hours of volunteer services (not sure exactly how many hours) I went oversea for volunteering and I honestly regret it. (probably why I got a 3 on my ap WH)

I have been part of Ensemble (school) club for 3 years and played piano there. I studied music theory and got a certificate from Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music for a music theory test that I took.

I was the semi finalist for debate competition held by George Mason University about North Korea diplomacy related topic

I tutored Kids in the local library for a semester

I cofounded finance and investment club to attend mock investment competition held by Wharton school

I founded Pingpong club (that sounds very bad as I read it written down)

I also have group of friends who I regularly hold instrument practice with and we are planning to hold a concert this year

I was part of soccer (our school didn't really have a varsity division) but I quit cause I hurt my ankle

I am part of tennis club

I have been a grade representative in sophomore year and freshmen year. (student council)

And now I sit in an office of a startup doing internship and just till now I translated customer service related stuff for work

​

For LOR I don't worry too much because my grade kept getting better from when I was a freshmen

​

I'm not such a good essay writer and I kept thinking about what I would write about. I have few ideas in my head to how I might connect my extracurricular activities together and not look like I'm begging to get in.

​

I want to major in business or economics whichever I feel like at the end. (FYI I don't have legacy, non of my parents went to college in the U.S, so if I do, I'm the first gen immigrant lol) (also my parents aren't super rich if that helps you understand that I can't money my way through college)

​

Anyhow, which schools should I apply to for safety, target, and reach (incase you don't know safety is schools you'll get in for sure, target being schools you kinda push your self to get in and reach is like your dream maybe I got it wrong)

Honestly, I plan on applying to 20+ schools cause I'm that greedy to get in. I don't need financial aid. Anyways, in the best case scenario possible, (assuming that I can do well on my SAT so I get 1500+) what are my potentials, and which schools should I apply to and why?

Help me out

This internship is through an organization that is part of my state's Public Service Department. The position involves IT operations, specifically, the organization's IT Asset Management (ITAM) and IT Service Management (ITSM) programs. **I need help with writing about ITAM and ITSM.** From my understanding, both programs are more on the business-side of IT, as opposed to the technical-side (that I'm most familiar with). My only business-focused class is IT Project Management, and it didn't cover ITAM or ITSM specifically. Despite my lack of experience, the business aspects of IT do interest me. But, expressing this has been a real challenge. Honestly, the main reason I'm even applying is desperation. Because it's getting so close to graduation, any technology-related internship would be a blessing.

Should I even bother applying? Is it even worth it if recruiters will be able to cut straight through my cover letter and figure out I'm ""bullshitting?"" This organization also has a software development internship that I'm probably more qualified for and interests me more. But, I'm pretty sure the same recruiter is handling both. **Is it possible that submitting a crappy application for the operations internship could hurt my chances with the other one?**

Below is my progress so far and the job posting. My current progress also includes some background about myself. **Bolding** indicates it makes me particularly unsure:

Getting hands-on experience with a system as integral as the power grid is undeniably daunting. However, I have no doubt my completed coursework on web technology, databases, and programming will provide a solid foundation for me to thrive. Additionally, I admire \[ORGANIZATION\] mission to update the \[STATE\] power grid. Planning for future energy needs seems like the most difficult and most intriguing responsibility of \[ORGANIZATION\]. A job like this produces outcomes that reach far beyond \[STATE\] and even America. The chance to put my skills to the test in an effort to benefit generations to come makes this the perfect opportunity for me.

I am confident that I would be a positive addition to \[ORGANIZATION\]. A follow-up email will be sent in two weeks to schedule an interview. Please do not hesitate to contact me via any method listed. Thank you very much for your consideration.

I should hear this week or early next week, and if I get an offer I will almost definitely take it. However, my mind is wandering thinking about what I'm going to do if that doesn't happen.

My current job isn't awful by most people's standards. I just have been here for 1.5 years since I graduated and I really don't like it. I make just under $70,000 working about 40 hours per week. It's in the data analytics consulting field within the pharmaceutical industry, which is something that I thought I might like coming out of school, so I gave it a shot, but it just doesn't interest me any more. I'd much rather be in some sort of software/digital project management role, which is what I did in one of my internships and loved. The position I mentioned above would be doing this, which is why I'm very hopeful about getting it.

On top of just an overall lack of interest in the field, my company isn't the greatest to work for. HR is kind of all over the place, and while they've made a new HR director hire to try to right the ship, I still don't like how it looks. They have constantly made new employee-unfriendly policies over the past year with little explanation and little to no room for discussion. 

The commute is also a 1hr+ drive each way into central NJ, while I live right outside of New York City. I could go on and on about other issues I have, but the fact is just that I'm not happy where I am right now. I feel like I'm wasting away here.

I have over $35,000 in my savings account right now. My expenses are about $2500 per month right now, but those could easily be cut down. I spend almost $100 per week on gas for my car, and eat out way more than I need to. There's no question I could get down below $2000, and even lower if I really try. I would begin the job search pretty much immediately, so I don't see money ever really becoming an issue. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I basically was just typing out everything that came to my mind. Thanks in advance."

I just need help in knowing what to do with a situation in my family. So my brother has been in and out of school since he graduated  HS(high school) and hasn't seemed to find what he wants to do with him self he is now 24 and I dont see it situation improving. He keeps hanging on to trying to play football  and has moved to several states to ""try"" and play football for a school but he dosen't do his work and his grades aren't good and I am constantly telling him to pursue a coaching internship or alternate path to a career in football 
 but all of my attempts to help him have fallen on def ears and I feel like I'm in this constant loop of me giving my valid opinion and my family (mainly my mother, background info to come) ignoring it because it's what my brother wants. 

My mother wants me to  leave it alone and let see for himself that things wont work, but I dont want to waste time money and effort just for someone to see that something wont work out. we don't come from much money and I dont want us to waste time going to nonsense schools and pipe dreams when that time can be better allocated to actually getting an internship and actually working towards something. 

So now some background info about this circumstance, So all through elementary and high school I went to the same school as my brother and every year it was the same thing ""why does he have to go to school with me or I dont want home to go to the same school as me, and my personal favorite  why don't  you go somewhere else and stop following me. this continued ui p until high school where I saw the worst of not wanting your little brother around. which I get is a typical  thing  for some teenagers but the situation was different  because up until high school my brother was sent t on all of the better schools than I was and failed out of every one of them taking all of our  parents money before they split so when it came time for me to go to high school we had to attend the same public. school. and in every  school we had to play football  and my brother doesn't do well school in general  and when he was at these schools he flunked  just about everything  and got in with the wrong people. 

which lead to him not doing what he was supposed  to do and failing more which lead to us having to attend an alternative school for him to graduate. He was one of those people  who peaked in high school  and couldn't get it together for college. so in high school  I was the quiet  one in the back no one paid me any attention I was always  that dude that was the good football players brother that didn't talk to.most people  because I didn't like the school or the people. but Ik would always tell home things he should do for example, when he got involved with some girl she was always a bad influence  and my mother (who low key neglected  us, another topic for another day,always made us fend for ourselves and when it came time to put on the mask like everything was she acted like things weren't  crappy and didn't care much about  anything so long as we were playing  football  didn't like to fix things when they were broken because  as she puts it ""people have to learn things on their own"" really  irritated me.

So in high school  it was pretty much why cant you be like  him or hes better than you at football you might  as well not even  play. so what I did in high school  was  cultivate myself  and bust my ass to where I am now with my schooling as well as being a ln intern for a football  team, something my brother wishes he could do.

I guess what I am.asking is when should I stop caring about what he does, I'm now a college  senior and my older brother is in a lower grade than me and is doing nothing  with his life, has caused me stress for myself at his hard headed and stubborn they are being about the whole situation  and only going to a school.just because he can play football isnt the way to look at college  and he has no endgame it's like he just wants to go to high school 2.0. 

I know this was a long one but if you made it this far honestly I'm tired of stressing over this when people see my  opinion as me being on a high horse when everything I say makes actual sense. 

thanks for the advice

I hope I've added the correct flair and that I'm posting in the proper sub.  I'm sort of looking for advice. 

My husband will be graduating soon with a BA in International Studies, minor in Mandarin Chinese (he still hasn't done his internship yet).  The question is though, that he/we don't really know what to do with his degree.   I've Googled the heck out of it but I keep coming up short, so I was hoping someone here might have some advice for me.

Question 1) Is it worth the cost to internship overseas?  It would require a lot of sacrifice and a bigger loan to do it.  

Question 2)  My husband loves languages and truly has a knack for learning them. His focus at school is Mandarin, but in his spare time he studies french, Korean, Hebrew, Arabic, esperanto,  and whatever else he stumbles into.

Are there any jobs that would pay him to learn about a language/ culture and then apply said skills?  I was thinking the military but I'm not sure he would get through basic as he has ADHD and is on the autism spectrum. 

Question 3) international studies degree holders: Is it imperative to go from a bachelor straight to a master's?

I’m reaching out because I need a little help choosing between two internship offers. There’s a few factors making it hard for me to decide.

I have been really lucky enough to get a junior year internship offer from Cisco and Amazon, both in software engineering. I received my Amazon offer after accepting at Cisco when my exploding deadline was up, so I’d have to renege to take Amazon.

My main dilemma is how much bigger of a name is Amazon than Cisco to help me out in the future? I personally don’t see myself staying long term at either of these places, as I want to move into more medium sized startups (like Robinhood) after college. I really want to stay in the Bay Area for the summer (not a big fan of Seattle) and Amazon can’t guarantee that I’ll be placed in the San Francisco office. 

Would it be completely stupid to turn down Amazon to stick with Cisco? I would really appreciate any input you guys have. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!"

As you can see in the title, I am really having a lot of trouble reconciling all my interests in the computer science field. I am currently a freshman in college and just completed my first semester (in the US). My issue is that I am interested in so many things, and I'm worried that if I don't focus my energy on one subject I will have trouble deciding what to pursue as a career path. For example, I love programming in general, but I also enjoy web design and web development (Angular 2+ / other frameworks). I also am interested in netsec and general pentesting. I'd like to learn about AI and I love comp sci theory too. There's a lot more random stuff I'm interested in and I'm obviously not great at every single one of these things, but I feel some pressure to choose so I can make decisions in classes and internships to accommodate my future career. 

Any advice? Do you guys have one field of comp sci that you've stuck with? Or does having many interests hinder your career?"

Sorry in advance for the long post lol

This past summer I interned for a engineering company. The internship was extremely high paying and for a large company thus why I took it, but there was never enough work (most of the summer I had nothing to work on) and the work environment was very cold and anti-social and there was a lack of mentorship. My mentor barely talked to me the entire summer and ended up leaving the job.

They ended up giving me a full time job offer to start when I graduate this spring, with a very high salary offer (higher than most of my classmates) and I took the offer because I have a massive amount of student loans that I need to pay off and I was worried about not finding a job as high paying.

The thing is I met up with a few of my old coworkers recently (I am still in college and graduate in May) and they told me there is very little work in the office still (many months later) and most days they have no work to do and some people are leaving the company b/c of the lack of work.

 I have already accepted a full time offer with this company and have the pressure to start paying my loans this coming fall.  But I am worried about the lack of work, bad work environment, and the lack of mentorship. Should just continue interviewing and hope to find a better job and just tell this original company that I don't want to work for them anymore... (the offer is at will). 

I don't even know how to go about interviewing for other jobs when this internship is my only engineering experience.  I am worried this company will find out I am interviewing with other companies during the background checks (they will contact HR) and rescind my offer... Also any companies I will interview with will ask why I don't want them to contact my previous employer (the company I accepted the offer with) and I don't know what to tell them... If I tell them the truth they most likely won't hire me b/c I have already accepted an offer.

I just don't really know what to do, and I have 6 months until I am graduating and starting this job. If anyone has any sort of advice that would be helpful. "

I am wondering if you could give me some advice. I want to pursue an international Fintech career. Currently I live in Amsterdam (im Dutch), and I have a BSc degree in Finance. I recently turned 25 years old and previously been working in a family global trading company, but I decided to go in my own direction. For which I find Fintech most interesting (and good to start in a growing industry).

Since 1,5 years I have been very active in the cryptocurrency industry. I know a lot of crypto projects and the overall market very well. Currently I’m doing an internship for a startup that uses blockchain technology to tokenize assets. I learned a lot about regulation, privacy laws (GDPR) and KYC/AML here as well.

Furthermore have I been an active member of the biggest digital currency event in the Netherlands and visited many blockchain events worldwide. Within this event foundation I also did marketing &amp; sales work. Additionally, I have completed an online certificate about blockchain technology and I continue to update my knowledge with the latest developments. I am really excited about what security tokens, atomic swaps and the lightning network can offer the industry in the coming years. Especially applications of blockchain within supply chain, loans and real estate have great potential in my opinion. 

One FinTech app I used a lot myself is Revolut. I think Revolut is a very interesting application of FinTech and that Revolut together with other challenger banks will gain a very big marketshare compared to traditional banks. I applied for Revolut, but got rejected. My motivation letter was very good, but I don’t really got much big company experience yet. And ofcourse Revolut has a lot of candidates to choose from.

If someone knows a job or internship that you recommend or where you could introduce me, would be very much appreciated. I am willing to move pretty much anywhere in the world (currently I am not in a relationship), I am really extrovert and adventurous. As an EU citizen I can start working in EU countries without a visa.

What I can offer:

* Finance (good strategic and analytical view on financial reports, decent in Excel)
* Business Development (Sales is definitely my strongest skill)
* English (fluent), Dutch (native), Spanish (B1 and want to become fluent in 2-3 years)
* Experience with doing business internationally
* Start-up experience as well
* Detailed and driven worker. Willing to make 60 hour work weeks if necessary
* Up to date knowledge of the blockchain market 
* Wide network within blockchain and cryptocurrency (especially in the Netherlands)

I would love to hear some advice please about purchasing courses on Udemy from the better instructors such as Jose Portilla,  Maximilian Schwarzmüller, Brad Traversy, Tim Buchalka, Angela Lu, etc. Reason being Udemy doesnt have a good rep with quite a huge number of people. And I would like to know if it's worth to purchase courses in general or specifically from the instructors above.

Can anyone share your experience if you had bought from these instructors or any other that you might recommend? I appreciate anyone's feedback and views!

I knew it would help me in the future, but it just wasn’t what I wanted. In high school I wanted to be a programmer, and I found a college I was interested in and that kept my parents happy.
My parents are very keen on all their kids going to college. My oldest brother didn’t go to college and they constantly say he’s a failure and will need their help all his life. My older sister is in college, is very good at it, has had decent grades and has internships. She attends a private university a couple hours from home. They pay for almost everything she does and constantly brags about her to their friends and family.
Then there’s me. I attended a public university for my first year. First semester, failed all but one class. I struggled with depression, and I was working a full time job as I commuted to school every day. I still lived with my parents. 
My parents didn’t get mad, but would when I suggested I take a semester off. Told me I wouldn’t go back. So I went back to school, on academic probation. Stopped going half way through after getting into a really bad argument with my father. That was another failed semester and I was kicked out of my university. 
I’ve never been so bad at school. I was a decent student in high school but I hate school so much. I’ve never had good memories. I don’t want to program no more. I hated the class I took over it in college.
The last semester I spent doing two classes that I were paying for in cash at a local community college online. I honestly can’t tell you if I passed. I don’t want to look but I knew I wasn’t doing that good. My parents want me to enroll in more classes that they’ll pay for, but I don’t want to waste their money. 
I’ve been looking at taking a medical coding and billing course to get certified, but my father doesn’t think it’s a good idea. It’s the one thing I feel excited for, but it’s not college, so my parents won’t support it. I don’t know if I can acquire a loan to pay for the courses needed to become certified without my parents help. "

I'm studying CS at RWTH Aachen. So far I always have been told, that studying is a really awesome time. That there you can find the best friends, participate in many different communities, do tons of interesting stuff.
But the last few months of studying were for me quite bad. I learned almost all of the time, neglected all my friends, found not many interesting new people here, had no time for extracurriculars and don't feel like here are a lot of parties.
I somehow feel like I'm missing out on something. Additionally, from my old friends I hear that they on the other hand meet a lot of new people, have a lot of time, go to a lot of parties, protests... Most of them though are studying social sciences, although one also computer science (but at a different University)

Apart from that, I'm not sure anymore, if computer science is the right subject for me. I like the technical and practical and even some of the theoretical aspects, but I miss my social life. I worry how a future job could look. Will I work for hours in front of a desk? I believe I will miss workmates, variety and moving around.
Has someone maybe a good article that explains, how the jobs in CS usually look?

I'm thinking about taking a break, doing some internships and maybe changing University. What do you people here think about my situation? Would a full year break be a waste? Would changing university to one that is less focussed on technology be an option? Then I would miss out on interesting research, right?

Tl;Dr: my study life is boring. I only learn and am unsure, wether I really want to work in cs later. I can't really imagine, how it would be. (To few social contact, variety?) Im thinking about chsnging to a more general university in a bigger, more active city."

I have an internship in march as part of my course for 4 months however it's a networking internship with a small bit of dev ops at a small company, not a software engineering internship. I have been offered a software engineering internship for 12 months at an American cyber security company starting in July however, I would have to take a year out of college to do it, but I would likely be offered a full time role with the company upon completion of the internship providing I do a decent job. It's also quite a good company. They're not huge, they're a relatively new silicon valley company founded in the last 5 years doing some really good research in the cyber security space, have excellent products and are expanding quite rapidly setting up offices here and elsewhere around the world in the past year so I will be handed a decent level of responsibility.

Keep in mind this is in Ireland so approx 90% of graduates would have a 6-8 month internship since its mandatory for almost all CS programs, most of which would be software engineering internship's since there's a huge amount of American companies here with their EMEA HQ's along with a decent start up scene. My GPA is terrible so I'd be worried I may find it a bit difficult going up against other graduates with just a networking internship when the majority of grads will have a 6-8 month software engineering internship.

Would it be worth taking a year out of college to do the 12 month internship at the cyber security company then come back to do my final year just to make my job search upon graduation a lot easier? I know I'd probably get a job without the 12 month internship, it's just I would probably have a lot more of a chance to get interviews for companies I really would like to work for and be a lot more desirable as a candidate with this experience under my belt with my GPA being awful and that. The potential of a job offer at the cyber security company as a safety net would also be nice.

Worth it? or just do your final year and get college over with?

Keep in mind also that since i'm in Ireland, I get college for free so there's absolutely no cost to me deferring a year, only a year off my youth."

Also, I want a job in Machine  Learning; however, I don't have any  credentials toward that career and need to self study / get a Master's. I've built the following saturated schedule:

&amp;#x200B;

Every Week:

1. 30 minutes daily reading published academic papers in Machine Learning and Statistics
2. Seven 30 minute increments over Saturday and Sunday programming (implementing) the research I read
3. 8.5 hours daily minimum of work at my job (including lunch) Monday through Friday
4. 1.5 hours total commute to work Monday through Friday
5. 1 hour of morning prep for job + breakfast Monday through Friday
6. 1.5 hours daily of gym exercise and daily hygiene
7. 8.5 hours of sleep Sunday through Thursday
8. 7.5 hours of sleep Friday and Saturday
9. 0 to 2.5 hours daily of reading textbooks depending on work/breaks
10. 6.5 hours split over Saturday and Sunday for Laundry, Shopping and Cooking
11. Fourteen 30 minute increments over Saturday, Sunday and Work lunch to program personal projects
12. 0 to 1 hours daily of free time + Food Snack depending on work.

Total: 168 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the personal projects I want to do:

1. Finish and Improve my undergraduate research project in Bioinformatics using Machine Learning / Stats
2. Create an AI Library that can be used to perfectly play the game Snake to maximum score
3. Complete a Kaggle project to high accuracy
4. Solve a few Data Science problems at my job to increase profits
5. Greatly reduce/minimize the training data set size needed for a ML algorithm of my interest
6. Work on a big real life problem

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the subjects/books I want to study:

1. Matrix Computations (780 Pages)
2. Intro to Statistical Learning (440 Pages)
3. Applied Predictive Modeling (615 Pages)
4. Statistical Inference (686 Pages)
5. Generalized Linear Models (411 Pages)
6. Bayesian Data Analysis (656 Pages)
7. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Theory (323 Pages)
8. Elements of Statistical Learning (764 Pages) + Skim Pattern Recognition &amp; Machine Learning

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline:

1. Over 5 years: complete as many personal projects, textbooks (full comprehension), and research papers as possible. Get experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, R, Python w/ Scikit-learn, SQL and noSQL. Apply for a Master's degree in Machine Learning Fall 2023.
2. Over 1 year: study the Deep Learning Book and take a free online course (i.e., Andrew Ng's course using the Python/sklearn GitHub repo). Continue work on personal projects.
3. Over 2 years: Start my Master's degree at a great out of state university using my savings and learn everything I can on Measure Theory, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistics, Transfer Learning and a Specialization like Computer Vision. Work a part time job at night, spend 30 to 40 hours a week on studying/homework and spend 20 to 30 hours a week on research with a PI. Do an internship over the summer.
4. Over 1 year: Continue working a part time night job and experiment with freelance/consulting to pay loans. Take six graduate math courses non-degree (Complex  Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Information Theory, Measure Theoretic Probability Theory), and focus on more research with a new PI.
5. Consider Applying for PhD programs in growing, marketable, technologically focused fields with sparse available talent while seriously looking at my value to industry with just a Master's degree in Machine Learning. Get at most 3 years work experience before I make the decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns and Questions 1:

1. First, this idea works on paper (I really like it) and matches the time that I currently use for things like chores, cooking and sleep. However, this is a 70 hour work week for 9 years, and I don't know if I can handle that. The best thing that I can do is try.

Concerns and Questions 2:

1. Second, the 8 books comprise about 4000 readable pages. I have a maximum of 5215 hours to study over five years if I only work 40 hours a week, don't take breaks, study during 14 days PTO, and don't study during my commute. However, I will realistically only have 40 minutes average per page to fully comprehend the material and solve a significant amount of problems. I do not know if that is enough time. 
2. I can probably partially alleviate (1) by creatively using my academic paper time, and by skipping all or parts of a book(s).

What do you think about this schedule and my two concerns? Am I over planning my goals? How do you think I should approach my goals? Is this realistic?"

Hello! I am a sophomore engineering major ( I am not in an engineering major yet but most likely Computer Science or Interdisciplinary Engineering with an emphasis in mechanical and computer science. I aspire to be a product designer.

I am approaching my 300th job applications (yay!) and so far I have only had 3 interviews in my life time. One I begged for, one I was defaulted to, and the other was a present. All three of these interviews didn't involve my resume at all so I think their may be something with my resume that is stopping me from getting jobs.

I like to think think for internships I am somewhat qualified and I normally get recruiters to drop their jaw at first sight, but I can't get any to take me to the interview portion. The jobs I apply for consist of UX / UI design, product design , software development, mechanical design , and engineering consultant summer internships . I add more or less information about certain positions in order to meet the needs of each job, but this is a general average. The only times I get close (like maybe a rejection email) to people are if they go on my website (I can tell by comparing email time and traffic times since no one goes to my website without my link) but judging by the traffic, only 2-3% of people even get to my website.

So . . . I am open to any suggestions you may have. When I ask recuiters they just suggest keep ""doing what you're doing"" and removing my GPA but for most cases neither seems to work.

The subleaser has also since called the landlord 3 times, each time with no reaponse.
Today the subleaser came to look at the house again and shortly after she left, I recieved a call from the landlord.
In this call she interrogated me about the subleaser, asking who she is, where she works, how long shes lived here, if she has a boyfriend, ect. 
I answered these questions as best I could, but told the landlord that it would be best to ask the sublease herself at the meeting. 
The landlord got very upset with this saying it was ""shifty"" that I couldnt answer these questions and that she ""didnt trust the sistuation"" adding that ""I normally only rent to students"". 
This is a two bedroom appartment, but the sublease wants to take both rooms as it's only $630 a month. The landlord stated that she was bothered by this because she ""didnt know where her money is coming from"" and repeatedly insinuating that she didnt think this woman would pay her rent for some reason.
I started that I understood that, as my subleaser, I would be responsible if she skipped out on the lease and that I trusted her to pay the rent. I ended the conversation by again asking her to call the subleaser to set up a meeting, but so far she still hasn't contacted her.
I am worried that the landlord is discriminating against my subleaser, because shes a single mom and an ethnic minority in a town and college that's predominantly white.
I only say this because the man in the downstairs apartment is her son, and she only called back with all these concerns after I had brought my subleaser to the house while he was home. 
Can she deny my subleaser just because shes not a student and she ""doesnt trust them"". "

I am a complete computer noob and this question relates more to my sister so would appreciate any advice. My sister is currently in a high school program where she will get her Bachelors degree in computer science by the time she graduates high school. She is currently a junior and is doing extremely well in her current courses. Because of her early completion, she is in a bit of a bind now. She isn't sure if she should try to find a career in computer science or if she should further her education by applying for a Ph.D. program. She will be 18 by the time of her graduation and my parents are willing to help fund her post-graduate. So my question is, for her age, is it better to put the time and get a Ph.D., she is willing to put in the effort, or should she look for career or internship opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any advice."

aceiec,1,2019-01-03,"As an electronics major student, C is the program to learn given its verstatility and memory management capabilities, however, C is one of the most challenging programming languages and I HATE doing it but I have to endure it. Is there a way I can learn C by doing Python instead?",negativevotes-,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aceiec/as_an_electronics_major_student_c_is_the_program/,"My 2 good friends who are great in programming have told me that when you learn a programming language very well, learning other programming languages is a piece of cake. So I took their advice and started taking Python and Matlab courses on my own in the summer before my semester started. Then things started to go downhill....again. 

You see, I failed introduction to engineering programming with C as many as 3 times (but then passed the supplemental the 3rd time around) with a C+ grade. Not great for the 3rd time doing it. So when last semester started, I had to endure Data Structures and Algorithms in C! I was so bad at it that I passed the course with a narrow margin! It wreaked havok on my total grade and I could not do anything about it because of 2 things:

1. My program is internship-based and if you drop down to a lower course load, they might remove you from the internship path, permanently

2. My program is project-based, meaning we take things at an accelerated pace and usually with a bigger course-load than rival universities. Oh, and not to mention, these courses are selected by the institution for the semester and you cannot pick and drop courses without major ramifications on your 4 year schedule. You just pay and study. No customizing. 

Because of this, last semester, I had to endure 8 courses (yes, 8 for one semester) because the projects involved were specialized. And guess what, we are only in year 2!

Anyways, I talked to my prof about my Python learning in the summer and he told me that it's a waste of time. Why? Because Python does not deal with memory allocation and this particular field of C (pointers and memory allocation) is very helpful in the field that I am studying (embedded systems) even though I did not get into my program for it's software part (I wanted more hardware stuff). Later in the program, I will have to do Embedded Software, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering in either C, ARM, or VHDL.

Now, here's the thing. I do not want to change my program. I want to learn C because it's just what I have to do. There is no way around it. I personally picked Python because it is a great starter to anything else in programming, just not pointers. This is from the advice of my friends. 

**Is learning Python a good way to learn programming so that my transition to C is easier, or should I focus on C from now on instead? If the latter, then how should I go about it?** 

To further explain my dilemma, reading books on C is not my cup of tea. I prefer something more visual and dynamic. I took a course over the winter break from edx that focused only on memory allocation of C and it's memory visuals fitted me much better than a lecture, a book or your typical youtube video. However, it is very clear that the mainstream resources available for C programming is not as versatile and plenty as Python. I much prefer Python over C also because of it's versatility and flexibility in the job market as of now. In a career fair that I went to, 7/10 companies I saw needed python programming, but only 3/10 needed C. On top of that, around 7/10 companies needed Javascript or C++, which is both not needed in my program and also not my interest. Anyway, I am sick of being so bad in C and wanting help all the time. It's wreaking havok on my time management, my confidence and my grades. I open to trying new stuff. 

Thanks "

Ever since I started college 3 years ago I haven't felt the same drive I had in high school. Not just in academics but life overall. I lost 60 pounds, went on 1 date (it sucked but I'm happy it happened), and had good friends and family relationships, and excelled in academics. 

Now in my 3rd year of college of engineering I found out that I might need to do 2 or 3 more years to graduate. My grades are below average 2.8 GPA and I've been doing semesters back to back since college started (summers included). Its not hard material but, it feels like an endless grind and feels like I'm not learning much. I dont even know what i want to do with my degree atm or how to schedule/get research and internships without having to graduate later and later. It feels like a race to do as much as possible and I'm not sure why I'm doing this or if it's worth it.

On top of that I'm away from all my friends and family and get distracted by thinking about them. I've missed so many family events and due to my parents old age, It feels worse and dread the inevitable happening and I wont be there. Because of my bad grades I also feel like I'm letting them down doing poorly. Sometimes, I call them but as I get busier the less time I get to talk to them. 

 I've struggled making new friends and barely have social interactions which feeds my anxiety and worry. My romantic life is non existent.

I've just never felt comfortable and constantly worrying and anxiety ridden about my future and personal relationships whether college is worth it. I even gained 40/60 pounds back and felt that everything is going backwards. 

The only upside is this past semester I got a small job paying minimum, and it was the first semester since freshman year that i havent failed a class despite taking 16 credits, but I got mostly all Cs. I'm confused on how I should react because I feel I am progressing but its still very bad and I feel even more drained than ever and definitely not ready for spring.

 I constantly feel isolated from everyone and unsure what to do with my life. I dont enjoy doing anything anymore because I constantly think about school, work and family. I just feel depressed, lonely, and scared for my future. I've talked to counselors, it helps but only momentarily. I just dont know where to go from here.

TL;DR Feeling lost after high school and constantly worried and stressed about life and school while troubling to maintain relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m having some difficulty in deciding how I want to guide and create my transfer application, and I wanted to reach out to you guys in hopes of getting your advice on my questions and concerns. I understand that many of the users in this subreddit are transfers to the UW from community colleges or otherwise, but even if you aren’t, any advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR before the long version; I’m a freshman CC student with a quarter at WWU trying to get into UW for HCDE/Informatics/General Admission, and I’m not sure what my odds are or how to formulate my application. I have a 3.7, will have all my Informatics prereqs done by the time I apply, and will have all my HCDE prereqs done by the time fall quarter rolls around, but I’ll only have 70 credits if I was admitted and was to start in fall, far below the 90 credit typical transfer student.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY STORY**

Let’s have a little throwback to last winter, when I was a highschool senior and applying for colleges. I put my heart and soul into my UW app; I wanted nothing more than to go to UW, but unfortunately, my high school application was rejected. After reaching out to the admissions board, I was informed that my grades were the source of my rejection; I had a 3.1, and I thought my EC’s and personal statement would carry me. They didn’t, and my appeal was rejected as well.

I still wanted to go to UW, and I decided I would apply to transfer in at a later date. I wanted to transfer in as soon as possible, for fear of missing out on the friendships, connections, and college atmosphere that be tarnished and diminished the later I transferred in. I also wanted to start taking classes that are proprietary to my major and not offered at other colleges.

I decided to go with the next best thing, attending Western Washington University, going with the plan of applying to transfer into UW at a later date. I thrived at a 4 year, getting a 3.7 in my three classes, all of which were chosen because of their standing as either prerequisites for prerequisites, or prerequisites for my intended major when I could transfer to UW; HCDE or Informatics. However, I decided to leave WWU after just one quarter; I couldn’t stand Bellingham, my housing &amp; roommate situation made my personal life a living hell, WWU didn’t have either of the majors I wanted, and attending a community college would drastically boost my chances of getting into the college I wanted to go to anyways.

So now I’m at Seattle Central College. I’m taking three more HCDE/Informatics prerequisites, with plans to take summer quarter to complete the HCDE prereqs in the event my Informatics application is denied when I apply this winter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTIONS**

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW BIG OF A ROLE DOES CREDIT COUNT PLAY?**

I fear that my application will be rejected because of my lack of credits. I’ll have 60 credits from taking classes all three quarters AND taking summer quarter, as well as an additional 10 credits from AP credit and credit gained at Edmonds Community College for the equivalent of M E 123 (an HCDE degree requirement!), putting me at 70 credits, far below the typical 90 credit transfer student.

I’m doing everything in my power to increase my credit count, including taking summer quarter. I’m the most concerned about this because many of the CC transfers have upwards of 90 credits, and that puts pressure on UW to admit them. I already have two of the three “competitive transfer student qualities”, being that I come from a WA CC and will have my prereqs done by the time I would be entering, but I don’t have 90 credits. Is this a legitimate concern? Am I blowing it out of proportion? How many of you transfers out there had less than 90 credits when you were planning on entering and still got in?

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF ADMISSION THIS UPCOMING FALL?**

I’m being completely honest here, I have absolutely no idea what my chances are. I have a 3.7 in my prerequisites, and while I can’t predict what my future grades will be, I can estimate it’ll stay around a 3.7, which to my understanding, isn’t bad as far as UW transfer admissions go. I also have an HCDE/Informatics internship lined up this summer, and have taken numerous online HCDE classes that the HCDE faculty recommended to me. I definitely think those will boost my chances.

I also think that my quarter at WWU may be looked upon favorably, proving that I can succeed in a 4 year environment. However, it could maybe be looked upon unfavorably, although I'm not sure how that can be?

In addition, I’ll have all the HCDE prereqs done by the time fall quarter rolls around (assuming Informatics rejects my app I’ll be submitting in the next few months for fall admission), so if my app passes before the general admissions committee as a result of Informatics major denial, they’ll see that I have the prereqs done for both my target majors, and I may be let into general admission. However, again, I’ll have less than 90 quarter credits when I’ll be entering UW, which is one of the three “competitive transfer student qualities”, and I REALLY think this will hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**GENERAL ADMISSIONS APP QUESTIONS**

I also have some general questions on the actual application itself. After looking at dozens of other transfer threads on this subreddit, a recurring topic seems to be the question “What are the specific reasons you wish to leave your most recent college/university or program of study?”, and I feel as if I have answer(s) to these questions.

Seattle Central doesn’t have a wide variety of classes, and what few classes they do have don’t have many seats available, usually only one or two sections each quarter. For instance, the HCDE degree requires that I have 50 NW credits, 15 which must be from a list of math classes and 15 from a list of science classes. I would love to take more statistics classes to fill the NW requirement, but Seattle Central only offers the equivalent of STAT 220, which I’ve already taken. They don’t have any other statistics classes.

In addition, the social aspect of a 4 year, specifically UW, is incredibly attractive. It's what I miss most about WWU, and that simply isn't a thing at community college. Whenever I came down to Seattle for the weekend from Bellingham, I was blown away at the social atmosphere that was kept by the UW students. I want to transfer from community college so I can experience that again.

Is this a solid answer? How could I further elaborate to explain that a community college is restricting the amount of classes I can take to just beyond prerequisites, and that I can’t truly grow as a student and explore higher level classes that are offered at UW?

Furthermore, I’m completely stumped by tips like “tell us who you are”, and questions about cultural understanding. I have absolutely no clue how to answer, and my white/male/jewishish background doesn’t help.

How have you transfer students approached this? How have you guys decided to start writing your application? I’m completely lost and don’t know where to begin writing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've also come to understand that the transfer app essay is INCREDIBLY important; any general tips or advice?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read out my situation and hopefully give your input. This has all been a humungous stressor in my life, and your thoughts and opinions will be of tremendous help to me.

So feels like I’m coming up to a massive fork in the road of my life. I’m Irish and my girlfriend is from South Korea. We met in Ireland as I was finishing up college a few years ago and have been with each other since (living in Ireland this whole time). 

She has an interest in moving back home for a while and I love traveling. I’ve also always been interested in teaching English abroad for a while. Seems like a perfect coincidence?

So at the time, we made plans for a year in the future, to move to South Korea together. I took a year long internship contract with a large multinational for work experience/money.

This contract resulted in them making me a permanent member of staff after a few months (I said nothing about my plans. Better money and more interesting work, no need to share too much with them now.)

This is where it gets more complicated. The job I’m in is something I’m really interested in. It’s what I imagined/wanted to do as a career and I’ve been given a pretty cool opportunity. I also really like the people I work with and the company culture, everything is smooth.

So as it stands, all I think about all day is this decision in front of me. I seem to have landed in my ideal job at the wrong time in my life and it’s really making me doubt my plans to move abroad. To makes things a bit more dramatic, my girlfriends visa will be finished in September this year so she has to leave Ireland anyway. I’m really not sure if I can handle a long distance relationship (never had one before) especially with no clear reunion in sight. 

I guess I’m worried that I won’t find myself in such a position again and will end up regretting my decision to move away for a while. 

What do you guys think? Am I crazy for thinking about leaving a job I really like to dive into the unknown for the sake of my relationship and traveling? "

Please help!",medley0602,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/achjns/21_father_assaulted_me_mum_passed_away_homeless/,"Let me give some back story. I have been to Loughborough uni for 2 years and have now come back to live at home while I am on a 12 month internship as a data analyst. My mum died in September 2018 after a long and painful battle with cancer. She was 49. My grandad (dads side) passed away in October 2018 from cancer. I decided to live at home to save money and help my mum, brothers (younger) and dog out. My dad now owns the house since mum passed away. However he is not capable to run a household. He is lazy, rude, aggressive, manipulative and a general nasty person. He has had issues with mental health in the past and a history of anger issues. He has beaten me up before. He is poorly paid in a dead end job, he has no friends and suffers from anxiety and depression. He was in the forces for 10 years and was discharged as a 'alcoholic mess'. He has been sober for 4 years since his last relapse. He is very violent and is a bully. 

I have a girlfriend for over a year now. He banned her from coming to the house at all on xmas day. His reason being that I need to learn its his house and I am a guest. On New Years Day, I was washing my car on the drive and he got back from work at 3am. He was beeping his horn and shouting. He gestured me to move my car onto the road which I said no to as I hadn't finished washing my car. He got out and grabbed me by the neck and threw me into a tree. Holding me off the ground. He then lifted me off the floor and slammed me into my car bonnet. Still grabbing me neck he proceeded to punch me with fists in the face, head, neck and back. He then went inside and after 10 mins I entered through a back door. He ran at me and tried to tackle me to the ground. He threw me into walls and punched me in the face and other places 10 plus times. He tackled me to the ground and lay on top of me and proceeded to punch me in the face another 10 or so time. He had me in a headlock and was dragging me around the house. This struggle went on for about 2 minutes until my brothers dragged him off me. I landed the hardest punch I could from behind to the side of his face. He came at me again saying 'don't punch me'.... irony. At this point he was tired and I left the house. 

I haven't been back to the house since as he says he will get an injunction towards me. He's band me from entering the house and it is likely he will assault me if I do. I can't have access to my belongings, and he has since put them into boxes and bags and I will collect them from the road today.

Last night I reported it to the police and went down for questioning. They will be in touch with him shortly. I stayed the night at his mums for 2 nights, she lives alone and has space. She has been very nice to me in the past. However, because she wants to keep her son happy, she has banned me from going there. I am now officially homeless at the age of 21. Four months after my mum passed away. 

He is trained in restraint for his job and he is 21 stone. I am 9.5 stone, but the same height. I am sure that if I wasn't physically in peak condition I would have been knocked unconscious. 

I don't know what my next move needs to be. Any questions just ask. I appreciate the help. Thanks."
acikyw,14,2019-01-04,HELP: why do you study COGS and what do you expect yourself to become?,whos_ur_baba,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/acikyw/help_why_do_you_study_cogs_and_what_do_you_expect/,"hello and happy new year r/UCSD. i’m currently a third year studying design &amp; interaction, recently switching from management science. After my first quarter of being a cogsci major, i’m not too sure if Human Computer Interaction, or even cogsci, is my cup of tea. i’ve been digging through this subreddit and online to find out what kind of doors that HCI major can open up for my career, and i came to a conclusion that UI/UX fields are the most common. Before you say “yo, you only spent a quarter being in that major so you don’t really know,” i want to rest assure you that i have a good general understanding of what cogsci covers. To all former, current, and future students of cogsci, or anyone in different field of studies, i ask for your input, positive or negative, to my current discomfort. Pls first allow me to describe myself briefly so you know a bit about me:

* a tech savvy person
* knows a few programming languages (above basics but not legendary)
* does not really have cogsci related experiences, but has had a summer IT internship and on-campus job (customer service related) before, and has held numerous student org positions, including being a vice president
* isn't so sure if he wants to pursue UI/UX (but who knows?)
* loves technology so much that wonders if cogsci can prepare for an IT career

&amp;#x200B;

now my questions are:

1. if you are former/current D&amp;I or HCI major, what do you see yourself doing after graduating? grad school? job? if grad school, what kind of specific studies are you looking into? if job, what kind of jobs (besides UI/UX)?
2. when i think of HCI, this is how I see it: literally learning/researching how humans use computers/tech now and in the future, and designing frustration-free products. Is this in line with our school's program?
3. the rebranded major of HCI, Design and Interaction, makes me just stare at a wall, because of the word ""design."" I'm the last person you want to ask to draw you a sketch of someone or something because the best I could draw is a stick figure (quite literally). The purpose of this major is to design a product from an idea, or prototype something, by drawing. Now, I understand that not all designs need drawings, but knowing that I don't draw, is this going to be a problem? Pls correct me if I have the concept of design wrong.
4. I've looked into other fields of cogsci that UCSD offers, mainly Cognitive Behavioral Neuroscience. I think that this concentration, based on how the department markets it, is more of a research-focused studies compared to HCI. I'm guessing that with CBN, I def need to go to grad school to make a career out of it, compared to D&amp;I. People who are/were CBN majors, what do you make of this major? future goals?
5. If i go down the route of CBN, I expect myself to become a neuroscientist or a researcher related to psychology, or become a professor after PhD. I honestly can see myself becoming a prof, but not a researcher who sits in labs 24/7 for living (but here and there is fine). Any comments on this?
6. Assuming that I go down as an HCI major, I currently don't have a working portfolio that I can proudly show it to my recruiters. HCI majors, how did you tackle this? Was classwork from courses enough to show something in your interviews? Are portfolios even required/expected for jobs/grad school?

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, I am currently going through a career crisis and trying to figure out what I want to become. Studying human brains do interest me, but i'm not too sure if I will end up enjoying my career related to the brains. I recognize that cogsci in itself is a multidisciplinary major and applications of it are broad, but what are those applications?

&amp;#x200B;

Jesus. This ended up being a longer post than I anticipated, but I would really, really appreciate and cry for any comments. I hope that someone in this subreddit can relate or feels the same way as I do, and sincerely wish that they learn something out of this post. Please do not hesitate to DM me if you want to talk about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: why do you study cogsci, and why should one major in HCI over CBN or vice versa, and HCI majors, how did you prepare your portfolios?"

I'm really happy with the results though, butthe downside is that I literally don't have any extracurriculars or outside ""engineering"" experience. I've only have minor volunteer experiences back from highschool and like a summer job at a store 2 summers ago.

&amp;#x200B;

How bad would i be viewed by internship companies? Would they be able to look past my lack of work/school experience? How would I deal with comments/questions about my work experience? I just feel like when I apply for internships, I'm gonna be embarassed and shamed by doing ""nothing"" but studying for school."

I am wondering if you could give me some advice. I want to pursue an international Fintech career. Currently I live in Amsterdam (im Dutch), and I have a BSc degree in Finance. I recently turned 25 years old and previously been working in a family global trading company, but I decided to go in my own direction. For which I find Fintech most interesting (and good to start in a growing industry).

Since 1,5 years I have been very active in the cryptocurrency industry. I know a lot of crypto projects and the overall market very well. Currently I’m doing an internship for a startup that uses blockchain technology to tokenize assets. I learned a lot about regulation, privacy laws (GDPR) and KYC/AML here as well.

Furthermore have I been an active member of the biggest digital currency event in the Netherlands and visited many blockchain events worldwide. Within this event foundation I also did marketing &amp; sales work. Additionally, I have completed an online certificate about blockchain technology and I continue to update my knowledge with the latest developments. I am really excited about what security tokens, atomic swaps and the lightning network can offer the industry in the coming years. Especially applications of blockchain within supply chain, loans and real estate have great potential in my opinion.

One FinTech app I used a lot myself is Revolut. I think Revolut is a very interesting application of FinTech and that Revolut together with other challenger banks will gain a very big marketshare compared to traditional banks. I applied for Revolut, but got rejected. My motivation letter was very good, but I don’t really got much big company experience yet. And ofcourse Revolut has a lot of candidates to choose from.

If someone knows a job or internship that you recommend or where you could introduce me, would be very much appreciated. I am willing to move pretty much anywhere in the world (currently I am not in a relationship), I am really extrovert and adventurous. As an EU citizen I can start working in EU countries without a visa.

What I can offer:

* Finance (good strategic and analytical view on financial reports, decent in Excel)
* Business Development (Sales is definitely my strongest skill)
* English (fluent), Dutch (native), Spanish (B1 and want to become fluent in 2-3 years)
* Experience with doing business internationally
* Start-up experience as well
* Detailed and driven worker. Willing to make 60 hour work weeks if necessary
* Up to date knowledge of the blockchain market
* Wide network within blockchain and cryptocurrency (especially in the Netherlands)

Thanks in advance!"

My interviewers were all younger and more experienced than me (1 year, but one more year than I have lol).

The 19/20 year old girl in my class that I had a small crush has been interning at the big G for two years straight.

I'm like the only person I know who didn't flunk out of the major that failed to intern.

My entire life so far has been me trying to catch up to people three years younger than me, and I know deep down that I never will.

I'm older than almost everyone I talk to in college and it's been grating at me. Like I'll never really ever catch up and my life up to this point has felt pretty meaningless. I honestly just want to crack into industry already but every day that I'm not working is another day that I'm falling behind. It's just really jarring to know how underperforming I am."
ack9e2,1,2019-01-04,I feel trapped and lost. I don't know what to live for.,MrKraken16,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ack9e2/i_feel_trapped_and_lost_i_dont_know_what_to_live/,"I'm sorry in advance but it's kind of a long story.

I'm 28 and I feel that my life is a series of unforntunate circumstances. I don't feel in control of my life and looking back, my past feels like a string of bad choices that have put me in these metaphorical shackles I now wear. I don't feel like I have a reason to live anymore and I don't know how to go on. I can't live with my mistakes and I feel stuck. I don't feel I've accomplished anything at all. Happiness eludes me...

I've never had a good relationship with my mother. She wasn't there for me growing up so she gave me to my grandmother to be raised. My dad was a jackass that slept with my mom and went away. Mother had to take me back when my grandmother died. We've been strangers ever since. Then, when I was finishing high school, she pressured me into going into college, something that, after thinking back on it, I wasn't ready to choose. I just wasn't mature enough to know what I wanted and my mom kept pressuring me to choose a course at least and she would take care of the rest. With my shitty teenage mind, I choose Law school because my father didn't finish Law school, so I thought I could do it and honour him somehow... even though he was never there for me. I half-assed my country's SAT equivalent and wasn't accepted in any public schools. My mother, then, asked for an aunt of hers to pay a private university for me and so, I went to college. Until I realized that... I hated Law. Actually, I liked it at first, but then my internship came along and I saw how morally disgusting most people that work in the area become and I couldn't stand college anymore. I wanted to quit, to do something else, but my mother said that I couldn't because her aunt has invested so much in me, I just couldn't do that. So I kept going... without wanting to... I spent eight fricking years like this. Eight years of my life, doing something that you don't want to, trying to please the people around you, but feeling stuck with it. One day, when I failed a test yet again, I said enough is enough and quit school. I had a huge fight with my mother and our relationship, which was tricky already, became even worse. The time I've spent with this situation that have led me nowhere makes me feel trapped professionally. I work as an English as a foreign language teacher, but don't have much opportunities nor do I feel I've accomplished anything work-related.

My mother was a devout spiritualist when I was born. Until she converted to Christianity and when my grandma died, mom raised me as a evangelical Christian as well. I grew up being told that that way of living life was the only way. I grew up hearing that somethings were right and others were wrong. While people my age were going out to parties and having fun, I was cloistered at home and I always felt cheated... For a time, I was a devout member of the faith. I worked in church as a member of the youth group, I played the drums, I was the leader of the drama group. But I've never really felt anything, heard anything or seen anything that gave credit to my faith. Until I've started to feel that I was going to church simply as an obligation and that maybe, I haven't done most things I had avoided, for nothing. So, about five years ago, I told everyone I wouldn't be going to church anymore. Another big fight with my mother ensued, of course, and this is another reason why she says I'm her biggest disappointment. But the worst part is living with religion guiding your life for so long that when you say you don't want it anymore, there's this big emptiness because you don't have that north star to guide you anymore. This is how I feel trapped spiritually.

Back when I was going to church, I met a girl. I'll call her Jane. We started dating and we were truly happy together. We did have our issues, but we worked around them. We clicked and when we were together I felt my life had a future. We were planning on getting married - the wedding was supposed to be last year. We started to buy things for the house and all. But then, I screwed up. I was at a moment where I wasn't feeling good with myself, due to what I said in the paragraphs above. I felt I've been cheated all my life. Everyone had their moments when they could go partying and do stupid things. I didn't and I was taking control of my life. Then, stupid me, cheated on Jane. After it had happened, I told her right away because she didn't deserve to be kept in the dark at least. Everything fell apart. This was, by far, the hardest thing that have happened so far. I tried to live on with the guilt, but it hasn't gone away. After she forgave me, we tried getting back together again, but it wasn't healthy. She forgave me, but she didn't forget. She wouldn't trust me anymore and rightfully so, even though I was doing my best to prove that it wouldn't happen again. So, we split up again. Now, I've contacted Jane to check on how she is and... she's been going on a self-destructive path. She started doing things she didn't use to, like smoking, hanging around unsavory people and I can't feel that it's my fault. I took something beautiful and I tore it to pieces. If I could go back in time and stop myself from screwing up, I would, but I can't. We can't simply ignore what has happened, it's turned us into different people. And I'm afraid it was for the worse. This makes me feel trapped emotionally and it's the hardest one to live with. I can't stop but feeling lonely and guilty and it's tearing me apart.

I have only a handful of friends that have their own lives and priorities. Most of them were from church, so they feel like strangers now, having a different outlook in life than I do. I'm living each day on auto-mode, watching the hours fly-by, going to sleep and repeat. I feel empty inside and trapped in my own misery and reaping the seeds I've sown. I confess, I have thought about ending my life, but the only reason I haven't is because I've read Camus and it has helped my to cope with life somewhat. But living feels so bleak to me. I can't see a future ahead of me, I can't say I've accomplished anything and I irreversibly pushed away the most precious thing I had. All I have now is loneliness and regret.

I wish life had a reset button so I could start over. I want to go somewhere else where I could have a fresh start, but I don't have the money... and I don't know if I have the guts. I want to get to know new people, but I'm not a fan of clubs and I don't know where to go in order to do that. I really don't know what to do to get me out of this misery. I need help."

aclhqd,44,2019-01-04,Fired From First Senior Eng Position 2 Months In - How To Recover?,careerplatypus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aclhqd/fired_from_first_senior_eng_position_2_months_in/,"I started a new position in October at one of those 'hip' tech companies with a lot of money and perks and all the flashy biz. This was my first foray into being a Senior Software Engineer in title, and I was kind of thrown into tech I'd never worked with before. I loved it, I learned a lot, but in late December my boss pulls me into a meeting for a performance review and basically goes over a 'review' sheet and gives me a 1 out of 5 in every category saying ""Platypus doesn't communicate"", ""Platypus writes code at an Eng 1 level (their version of intern)"", ""Platypus doesn't write or understand unit tests (Even though I'd written unit tests for every bit of code I'd done)"", ""Platypus seems lost"" and ""Platypus is not at a Senior level"". I was crushed, went on the company holiday break, applied for what jobs I could and came back in expecting to be fired. Finally, today I was.


I'm the type of person who's suffered from a lot of impostor syndrome in the past. This is my first Senior position besides being treated like a senior at my previous role, a 9 month contract that didn't get extended but included a ton of overseas travel, overtime and working under harsh conditions. Before that I worked at a tech company where I received almost zero feedback on my work and worked for 3 years before getting laid off as part of a 20% workforce reduction. I don't think either of those two are really my fault but I do put this one on myself pretty hard. 


I'm playing back the job in my head right now because I was just let go, crying a bit to be honest and trying to figure out what to do. I was put into a tech stack I'd never worked with (Python/AWS/Lambdas/DynamoDB), I consistently put out code nonstop after the first week, none of which I felt like had any defects other than one miscommunication with another coworker I tried to own up to and fix. I tried to set standards for our new code base, I was in the process or getting an AWS cert. I showed up early, I stayed late. I just...whatever I did it just wasn't good enough for my boss and the other senior engineer. I'm trying to reflect honestly without being too confident or down on myself but this really took me for a loop.


I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to come back from this. I now have 3 jobs on my resume in the last 13 months, including a 9 month and now my first senior role being less than 3 months. I have some interviews I'm planning but I'm demoralized and not sure how to get back on the right track both in my confidence and my career.


How bad is this for my resume? What does this say about me as a developer? I'm a bit shocked that I wasn't even put on a PIP plan (which my boss had mentioned would be next step in that meeting) just dropped off like this. I'm scared no one will want to hire someone coming off a 2 month job and termination. I don't quite know how to spin ""I was fired because my boss didn't think I was good enough for the job"".


To make matters worse I bought a house about 16 months ago when I was at my stable previous role, I've got a mortgage, a car payment, student loans, it's not gonna be covered by unemployment so I figure I have about 3-4 months to find a job before that starts becoming an issue. So....I'm melting down, furiously job hunting and desperately trying to figure out WTF just happened to me and if I'm really just an awful dev or the victim of a bad situation or office politics."

I have taken classes in Java, C++ and will soon have some in SQL, HTML and Ruby. I stood out to my freshman year Java professor enough that she ended up recommending me for an internship at my local library for IT (mainly working with people on using their computers, 3D printers and virtual reality devices, occasionally helping with installing equipment in server room). I ended up getting it and have loved the change of pace from my fast food job.

Because of my 3.6 GPA and aggressive push to get into the field, I decided to apply for several more internships. I ended up landing one at a Fortune 500 company that will begin this summer, which I’m super excited for. 

With the fact that I’ll have two internships and 1.5 years of IT (the Fortune 500 one will be a year long Infrastructure IT internship) under my belt, I’m considering the idea of graduating a year early to save money. However, I still feel like I have so much to learn and have no idea what aspect of IT I want to do (I’m using the wiki to explore some ideas). 

Is there anything else I can do to help better myself for employers? I might go for some certifications and try learning some things on the side. I’ve been hyper nervous about never finding a job out of college to pay for student loans (I’m hoping to find something paying at least $50k/year to pay off student debt while I live at home).

I'm not sure how thoroughly I should be testing things and I don't trust my boss expertise in this area because he said he started self-teaching himself to write tests a couple months ago. So far I haven't received criticism but I feel like it's mostly because my code hasn't been reviewed yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not worried about getting a return intern offer for summer(2019) because I have another offer that pays $30/hr. I just really don't want to be criticized or have my inability to write good tests to be something I carry for the rest of my career. I also know that the company offers visa sponsorship and promised 2 friends at my University that I could try to get them an intern offer there. However I won't be able to do that if I receive poor marks.

I have been a private physics/mathematics tutor for years. I have just recently completed Flatiron's full stack web development course over the last few months. As part of pursuing a physics degree, I took a series of java courses, and I have developed a number of c++, react/rails, and python applications independently. But I do not have a CS college degree, and I currently have no formal work experience in development.

Is it reasonable to try and pursue an entry level/internship somewhere in the financial sector based on this background, or would it be almost essential to return to college and complete a CS degree first? I'm willing to take an internship position in order to gain access and work my way into a permanent position, but the internships I'm seeing do not even allow you to submit an application unless you're a recent graduate or currently in your senior year working towards a BS in CS.

I am currently a 3rd year student pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science in California. I could either take a normal class load each semester and apply for an internship this upcoming summer, or take summer courses and earn my degree by the end of December 2019. 


I have not had an internship/job in the field of computer science so I am not experienced on what the actual work entails. However, I am quite eager to finish up school and the extra workload will not be an issue for me.  

Do you guys believe that a summer internship is something necessary to the point where I should not pursue graduating early, or will I be okay with my bachelors with no work experience. I hope to find a job after I graduate in SoCal. 

Obviously I am going to speak with advisors on campus when classes start back up, but I just wanted to get some online input as well :)

I'm in Canada so you apply directly to a specific faculty of the school, not the school itself. I got accepted to CS at the no-name school and I was rejected from CS at the top ranked school but was offered admission to the department of physics there. So my choice is either getting a degree in physics from a top school (physics was my second choice besides CS) or a degree in CS from a 'standard' school. I could probably still do a minor in CS at the top school, but I will ultimately not have a lot of coursework in computer science. My goal is to eventually get a job at a big name company like Google/Amazon.

I've done well in all of my comp sci classes so far (although one or two of the prereqs like physics, etc were roooough), and up until this semester I *thought* I had amassed a decent amount of experience programming my own neopets-esque site in middle school/high school. 

But also, as I've advanced to upper level classes I've started to realize how much I *don't* know + how much my code sucked then/sucks now, and it's mildly terrifying lol. And so the idea of actually working in computer science terrifies me, to the point where I've debated not working in programming despite the fact that it's something I'm obviously interested in :/ I'd like to think a lot of it is because I'm a woman in STEM, but at least 45% of my school's comp sci department is female so eh lol

I'm not sure if this is ultimately about job hunting, design and development, or personal growth, so if it doesn't belong here, please direct me to a more appropriate sub. It's very long, but I appreciate anyone willing to take the time to offer their advice! I was laid off from my first ""real"" job in May and I've just felt kind of lost since then in regards to my career.   


Backstory:  
I went to college and earned my Associate's in Game Art and Animation, and a Bachelor's in Business in Media from the same school. I graduated as valedictorian, got an internship through a teacher as a software engineer, and  then spent 2 more years as a full-time employee at that same company. I got a call my from my boss one morning telling me that I had been laid off. He told me it had nothing to do with my performance, just that the company couldn't afford to keep their most recent hires. And thus began my spiral into a very confusing time!  


I don't really know what I want out of life career-wise. After college, I made a game in Unity with a few friends in which I was the sole programmer (C#). That game was what landed me the internship during the interview. At the job, I did a bit more of C#, creating a few tools for their main software (also powered by Unity), but most of my job was just optimizing a bunch of CAD models for different clients. I was at the job for 3 years, but I only really have about 1 year of professional C# experience collectively. It doesn't feel like substantial experience for another job. I realize now I should've pushed for more programming assignments for the experience and personal growth, but I put myself in a bad spot by being oblivious to the idea of losing my nice job. Currently, I haven't found any other places looking for 3D modelers here in MN.  


I really enjoyed game design, but MN doesn't have much of a market for game design (at least with my current experience). In these last 7 months, I've applied to a ton of different positions. Graphic Design, Software Development, App Development, and Web Design were all the different areas I've tried. I've gone for as many entry and associate level positions as I could, but none of them stuck. Most of these job haven't even sent me an email turning me down, I just get no responses. The closest I've made it was an aptitude test for another software engineer position (which I did decently well on), but they decided to go with someone else.  


I tried picking up different skills as I job hunted. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via SoloLearn and FreeCodeCamp, and explored Android Studio. I started a bunch of personal projects (3 Unity games, 2 Android apps, 2 websites) hoping to get something finished to put into my portfolio, but my perfectionism hits me very hard with each one. I try pushing myself to finish one of them, but I end up getting discouraged and try hopping to the next one thinking it'll be productive break from the first, only to rinse and repeat. I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of discipline (which sucks because I was always a fantastic student), lack of confidence, lack of passion, extreme overthinking, or perfectionism. Tbh, they most likely all play a role.  


I know I REALLY want to be in the creative industry in some way, but I've come to feel like I'm just not a very creative person. My dream lifestyle has always been being able to travel and experience the world as I work remotely. I don't even care to make a ton of money, just enough to get my tuition paid off and then comfortably fund me as I go. I need to overcome this perfectionism because it's been a MAJOR issue for me ever since I started college and I feel like that is my biggest obstacle. If I could just get a job in the industry somewhere, things wouldn't feel so bleak, but after 7 months, it's so discouraging. I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting other than some form of guidance or advice on any of this. I'm hoping that someone on here might have wisdom that'll help me!

I have been reading many posts in this subreddit, after summer I will have my bachelor's as electronics and telecommunications engineer. I want to work as a software developer. Mainly I am experienced in C, C#, Python and learning Java this currently. But I am confused about something.

Firstly I read [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/8n1vbh/uk_stay_away_from_uk_if_you_are_non_eu/) and I understand that there is a treshold that changes every month depending on the amount of applications.

Secondly, I also saw[ this link](https://www.magrath.sg/immigration-articles-list/tier-2-general-restricted-certificates-of-sponsorship-demand-continues-to-exceed-supply-in-january-2018/) posted in this sub. And there is  section that caught my interest and gave me hope.
&gt; &gt; How are RCoS allocated?
&gt; 
&gt; If demand exceeds supply, RCoS are allocated on the basis of a points scoring matrix.  A higher number of points will be awarded to jobs in the following sub-categories:
&gt; 
&gt; shortage occupation jobs;

&gt; PHD level jobs;

&gt; “new graduate” jobs or internships which meet the relevant provisions in the Immigration Rules;

&gt; jobs which are defined as key “public service occupations”.

Q1) In this case, Could I go for a new graduate to job and internship and avoid the treshold because I am a new graduate?

Q2) If I need to be paid more than the treshold regardless of being new graduate, is it possible to be paid above the treshold as a new graduate? 

Q3) Is there anyone who were paid for example around 20-30k and still managed to start working in UK?

Q4) What is a reasonable salary in London for a graduate?

Q5) Does it makes more sense to try other countries, and which ones? (I am from Turkey, not EU)"

Last year, I took a class on this topic and I really liked it. We used Atmega328p with Atmel Studio and covered some topics like UART, I2C, SPI, CAN, A/D. We also used STM32 but not in much deep. Sadly, I have no more classes related.

After that class, I did two projects:

One is a basic drone from scratch, where I read data from MPU6050 with I2C, developed the whole control system, used timers to control motors and the drone was controlled with some RF modules with SPI.

The other project was a solar tracker for a solar panel. It consists of an SD card (SPI) and an RTC (I2C) to save/get data from the sun position and then convert those values in order to move 2 motors (timers). I implemented UART communication just to see and test the data.

For both projects, I used Atmel chips, 328p and 2560 respectively.

With this, do I have a chance to get an internship? What other topics/chips should I focus on?

In preparation, I'm trying to map out roughly what I want to say for a few of the common interview questions. Any feedback/suggestions would be much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduce yourself/tell me a bit about yourself.**

Currently I'm a postbac research fellow at the NIH. I earned my B.S. from \[University\] double majoring in Neuroscience and Molecular Genetics. I'm interested in basic and translational research related to neurodegenerative diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tell me about your previous research experience.**

My Honors Thesis project was a genome-wide association study of axon guidance using a fruit fly model. I screened several hundred fly strains and identified any with naturally-occurring defects in axon guidance. Then I used their sequenced genomes to find variants in 16 genes that were associated with these defects. During the later part of my undergrad, my interests began to shift from basic to biomedical research. I wanted to get some experience in biomedical research and see what it was really like. I took a short break from my thesis research to do a summer research internship in Switzerland, where I studied how seizures can alter blood-brain barrier function in Alzheimer's disease mice. I also approached a postdoc at \[University\] about writing a review together about Alzheimer's. We actually end up writing three reviews together, which focused on the roles that amyloid-beta plays in the innate immune system. The internship and papers really deepened my interest in biomedical research, especially related to neurodegenerative diseases.

After I graduated, I decided to further explore biomedical research by joining the NIH. My institute is called the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, which basically combines assay development and high-throughput screening to move discoveries from bench to bedside. My main project involves developing a new high-throughput assay to \[redacted--not yet published\]. I programmed our robotic liquid handler to perform all the assay steps, and then analyzed the samples using mass spec. I'm also working on another project related to \[disease\], where I'm using CRISPR to attach a nano-luciferase tag to the \[redacted\] gene in some patient-derived cell lines. This will allow us to look for compounds that inhibit mutant \[redacted\] levels.

*\[Note: Should I say this in chronological order or reverse chronological? Is this too much info or not enough? Do I mention PI names?\]*

&amp;#x200B;

**What are your research interests for graduate school?**

I'm interested in researching the molecular mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's is the condition I'm the most experienced with, but I'm also open to exploring others like Huntington's or ALS. Ideally I would like to also be involved with translational research to bring some of these discoveries closer to the clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do you want to go to graduate school?**

My dream is to one day run my own lab and spend my career in scientific research. In order to achieve that level of scientific leadership, a PhD is the next logical step. I'm looking forward to becoming a more independent scientist and enhancing my research skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do you want to join this program specifically?**

\[Using one school as an example here.\] I really like how strong this program is in translational neuroscience. There are a lot of resources here to help researchers translate their discoveries into possible treatments. I also like that it's an umbrella program so I'd have access to a wide variety of different labs and have more options for interdisciplinary research. The clinical certification program for grad students is also really cool and definitely something I would be interested in pursuing.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are your strengths and weaknesses?**  
I have a good amount of experience with thinking independently and managing my own experiments. I was given a lot of autonomy in my thesis lab, and I had to do a lot of self-teaching and figuring out how to solve problems by myself. Currently at the NIH we function similarly to graduate students, as we're in charge of designing and running our own experiments as well as analyzing data. Another strength is that I know how to program in Python and R, and I'm learning Bash. I think this skill could be very useful in my future research. As far as a weakness, I sometimes can take criticism from my PI too personally. I've gotten better about this by communicating very clearly with my PI and also just getting more used to criticism, and it's something I'd like to continue improving during grad school."

and here in Syria we study for 5 years to get BS in SE, Actually my country is so hard to live in so i want to work/study in EU or US i know it's not that easy but i work a lot to accomplish this dream .

I'm not that bad at algorithms and i work hard to improve my self in it , because i always keep hearing that all companies in EU/US even not the big one require work experience and very-good knowledge in DSA .

So the problem here that i want to improve my self at DSA and have a work experience (here in Syria we don't have something like internships :( )  and at the same time i want to escape from this hell (my country) as soon as i can , so i can't escape classes to gain that experience, HOW CAN I HANDLE ALL OF THIS WITHOUT LOSING MY MIND (although i think i lost it already :( ) ?

PLEAS suggest some solutions for me.

FYI: I know C++, PHP , JS and interested in AI

acyybr,7,2019-01-05,I feel bullied at my workplace.,ruy90,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/acyybr/i_feel_bullied_at_my_workplace/,"I work in a big telecom company in a developed country as a Data Scientist.

The office is comprised of around 20 people divided in 4 teams. Each team has a group leader and we all have a main boss.
Since I arrived to the company, half a year ago, a noticed some weird behavior at the office. For instance, people talk a lot about other people at the office behind their backs. We never do share work advances, present our work to the rest of team, have workshops etc. So people don't really know what other people do outside of their teams. A second thing I noticed is how bad is the work culture at the office. We are all 30ish year olds and interns are around 20-22 yrs old. There's music going on at the office sometimes, people laugh out loud, people chat, all the time. It got to a point, I confess, that I was too part of the party. After a while, I started feeling a bit empty sometimes for the lack of challenge and stopped.

Directors of the company don't have technical training in what we do, therefore they think it's normal to build a model in really long periods of time (+1year). The bar is too low, but they don't know. I created the first draft of a model in about 2 months, and after 5 months it is now ready for production. I complained to my group leader, however, that I felt I was doing all the work in the team. He just said that they were letting me do it because I was the best fit for the work. But that counts for 75% of the work we do. I also started complaining about the noise, I couldn't even work without headphones. He (my group leader) never did anything about it. So after a few unproductive complaints I went to talk to the boss and complain about the noise.
Everything went downhill from there. The group leader told the rest of time I complained. They stopped inviting me to have lunch together, and some people even stopped talking to me. I then talked to my group leader and he said people felt I betrayed them for complaining about the work space. That it was something we could figure out ourselves. I had complained about that with him more than a few times as I said, but he didn't seem to recall.

I got fired last Wednesday, I was hired through an outsourcing scheme, so my real boss called me to fire me (I don't even know him). He said that my boss and my group leader wanted me out because I missed worked the 24th and 31th of December. I said those were justified because I asked for those two days to both people. He said I was fired anyways.

I didn't expect that, because even though I know some people there hate me for trying to mess with their status-quo, I felt I was too important for the team work. So I was really taken aback. I then tried to talk to my group leader but he kept saying 'wait 10 min' while chatting on his phone. I then called my boss who's on vacations, and told him I was shocked and asked him if he was aware I was getting fired that day. He said no, that he wasn't. He then talked to my group leader on the phone, and until then, the group leader did talk to me. He said that I kept arriving late (which is true, however I do work when I'm at the office) and that he didn't say yes for those two days (which is false).
I told him I tried to communicate with him several times, that I felt the team wasn't productive because no one works. That I felt that this was not because of arriving late or missing a couple of days to visit the family, but because I complained about the noise to our boss. He said people at the office though I ""made a bad ambience"". I said that I was the only one working, the one who made the model, the one who does the programing and everything that he then goes present to the big guys at the company. He said that there were a lot of productive people at the office, I then asked him ""are you productive?"". He just looked at me but said nothing.

So finally I wasn't fired because I called my boss but he wanted me out. We are all talking to my boss on Monday when he comes back from vacations to clear this out. I thought of resigning right there, but I think I'll stay until I find something else. I think I am going to say everything I think about the work space. Included the tremendous time we have to do our work, the fact people take it as a chilling area, etc.

What do you think about this story? I am somewhat new at an office work so I didn't know this could happen. What kind of advice can you tell me for my meeting with my boss on Monday?

TD;DR: I was fired by my group leader on Wednesday behind my boss' back. I then called my boss who is on vacations and he cancelled me getting fired. I will talk to them both on Monday.

acz45c,0,2019-01-05,ANTRA INC. - I just received an offer for this company and need advice on whether or not I should accept.,GarrulousGoose,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/acz45c/antra_inc_i_just_received_an_offer_for_this/,"Link to the brochure and offer letter: [https://imgur.com/a/mHyYw03](https://imgur.com/a/mHyYw03)

**A few key points:**

* *$1,500 paid internship equates to less than $5 per hour.*   
\- I suppose this isn't bad, as most internships aren't paid. Right? Plus, it's only rewarded to exceptional performers after the first two week evaluation.  

* *""One year"" contract is defined as 2080 billable working hours = 52 forty hour work weeks*  
\- This means that it's *not really* a year long contract.  

* *There is no backing out of any projects whatsoever.*   
If I refuse to take a project, I will be liable to pay $12,000 (the cost of a typical coding bootcamp) to Antra Inc.

**Background on me for context:**

I currently live in Southern California. I've taken a few months off to learn how to code and have a fairly decent grasp on the fundamentals. Beyond CSS/HTML/JavaScript, the majority of my learning has had a *heavy emphasis* on the React ecosystem. I've completed a cybersecurity internship and have an above average grasp on IT fundamentals, as well.

I wouldn't say im desperate, but I have about two months worth of savings left before I'm going to feel the pain of not being employed for 6 months in order to switch careers. The obvious red flags can be clearly seen in the marketing and grammar. But, +$60k/year is *twice the amount* that I've ever made and that definitely has some weight to it.

I don't have anyone to go to for advice. I have immigrant parents who are reaching retirement ages and wouldn't understand all the factors regarding this to help me make a sound decision. My friends aren't tech savvy, and I'm at that stage in life where everyone is having kids and focused on their own families. 

Hopefully you guys could give me some input.

**If I go..**

I'll be leaving my girlfriend and two dogs here in SoCal and will essentially be setting up a life for us in Virginia for the next 12-18 months. This doesn't sound so bad, so long as the company that I'm working with is legitimate. And, if the offer that I have with them is worth it—thus the reason for this post. 

**If I stay..** 

I'll spend the next month working on making projects for my portfolio, mastering common interview questions, attending programming meetups and applying and interviewing like my life depends on it. There is no guarantee of any success. I very well may run out of money, but I could snag a part-time gig to float me until I earn a decent dev job.

**Notable facts**

* I've read the Antra Inc.'s glassdoor reviews. It has given me cause for concern, but I need more feedback.
* I can't find Antra Inc. on the VA Better Business Bureau site, which isn't a good sign to me.
* I requested the companies Employer Identification Number which is: 26-1765515 and their E-Verify number which is 406519, but I don't know how to verify those numbers to any trusted database. Do I call the IRS and ask them personally?
* Signing this initial offer letter doesn't commit me to the $12,000 commitment.   
\- It guarantees me accommodations in provided housing for the two week training/orientation. At the end of those two weeks, if I pass an exam, I will be presented with the actual contact with commits me to the contract details listed in the imgur link at the top of this post. For the entire duration of the training program, housing will be provided.
* This would be my first job as a web developer.
* I have about a week to decide if I should take the dive and fly there. If I do go and hate it, that's two weeks out of the two months that I have left for my savings. 

Thanks in advance for any help, everyone!

Basically he always had a lot of pressure, from sport, our parents or himself and couldn't really relieve that pressure. One day he recognized that and since then he is saying, that he has a permanent pressure in his head. He hoped that it is something physically but the signs are not good I guess. He wants to be alone all the time and thinks by doing nothing and being alone it gets better. I respect that but he is also not trying to fasten up the process and he seems so lost. He is currently doing an internship but he wants to cancel it, because he just can't get things done and although his co-workers are nice to him, it is a very uncomfortable workplace for him. He said, that the only thing why he had not left is the money and the fear of searching for a new job which would be the next huge stress factor for him! I am the only person he speaks to with his problems. He is not capable to tell the doctor these problems, because he just can't, he says!

It would be nice, if you can give me some advice, if you or someone you know has experienced something similar. Where do we have to go, to get a diagnosis and what can we do against it? "

Honestly, I hate my degree, I hate every thing about digital marketing and I especially despise social media which is why I don’t own a Facebook, Instagram nor a twitter. I don’t even know why I picked it honestly. I don’t know enough about anything other than social media marketing and digital marketing.

I spend hundreds on a career counselor and still no job. I do have a professionally edited resume and LinkedIn, a robust portfolio and professional headshots and again—nothing.

I’ve had many internships but honestly i didn’t learn anything at any of them. They wanted me to do all the work they didn’t know how to do for free. As a result I was running around like a headless chicken trying to figure it out and I learned a lot but no one seems to care about that. And honestly, I don’t care much for social media/digital marketing anyways. I hate it honestly. I hate everything about technology, I only did it because I was assured a decent job at the end. 

I really did like proofing and editing in school, but I wasn’t very good at it. My grammar is still bad and I don’t know the AP style very well. I figured I could go back to school, but that doesn’t sound appealing to me. I already have enough debt and I don’t have a job. The last thing I want to do is put myself through more debt and still not get a job in a highly competitive field. 

I’m not sure what else to do. I feel like I’ve done everything I can. I’m really not willing to chuck anymore money at my resume or finding a job. I’ve already spent close to $1000 and I feel as if I were scammed because I’m still unemployed and have been since August of 2018.

I guess I’m wondering is there a such thing as a decent paying job that will take any degree? I’ve looked and all I see are call center jobs that pay peanuts. I’m just desperate at this point. I’m tired of looking for work and I’m tired of living at home and having no privacy. I can’t even go anywhere without being asked 50 questions as to where I’m going. It’s just suffocating and it’s making me very depressed. I’ve had to go back on medication which I haven’t had to do since leaving for college.

Any ideas?"

During the semester I worked in a department at my university.  I was talking about internships  with a professor I work with and I mention I was interested in doing  a summer internship at Fortune 200 Company X in department Y. She said one of their old graduate assistants, let's call him Greg, is now at Company X working in department Y and I should reach out.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I reached out and completed an application.  I was given a phone interview about a week later with Greg. The phone interview went really well -- I was told my application was a ""diamond in the rough"".  At the end of the day, I got an e-mail from Greg telling me he wanted to schedule an interview at the HQ.  Greg called me the next day and asked me if I could come in.. I had a final exam, so there was no way I could swing it. He told me follow up with him after New Years and said he hoped I would still be interested. I told him not to worry because I was very excited about the opportunity and will follow up after New Years.

&amp;#x200B;

ad8y69,42,2019-01-06,"Just decided on grad school? Tips for ""last minute"" applications",nagetony,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/ad8y69/just_decided_on_grad_school_tips_for_last_minute/,"**Background**

There’re no shortage of writings stating that grad school application takes years of planning and interactions with professors in order for an applicant to be competitive. However, the fact is that grad school is a very inclusive place. The students who had their eyes on grad school early on in their undergrad is the minority. Three years ago, I was finishing my 4th year undergrad and decided late in Christmas Break that I would attend grad school. With limited professor interaction in undergrad research, I had no trouble of getting accepted here at U of T. This post tries to provide some practical tips for those who decided on grad school late in their undergrad, but the tips can be applied generally.

**Asking for reference letters**

If your timeline is tight, I recommend go straight for their office and try to hunt them down in person, rather than relying on e-mails. Do e-mail first, but don’t wait if there’s no reply within 48 hours. Find professors who you did well in their class, or you have experience working with, and simply ask. As long as the professor have at least 2-3 weeks before the deadline, it is generally not too late. Ask the reception/secretary who have views into their outlook calendar to help you out to increase your chances of finding them. When meeting the prof, keep the conversation short. Request the letter and offer to provide a document of point forms of all the things that you want the professor to talk in the letter. You are almost writing the letter for them here.

It is an unfortunate fact that professors do not remember the vast majority of students. The different between an okay reference letter and a strong reference letter really comes down to how well the professor can remember – and fortunately, this is where you can take the initiative to help the prof. SPOON-FEED the professor via this point form document. Very rarely professors turn down reference letters when asked, unless they happen to really not have the time. Of course, also attach a copy of your transcript, resume, deadlines, and submission instructions.

**Meeting prospective supervisors**

If you’re applying for a research-based master, you should definitely reach out to them to ask for in-person meetings to discuss possibilities and your interest. If the location is far away, at least do a Skype-call. If you don’t have research experience in undergrad, that’s okay. Focus on why you want to attend grad school and the transferable skills that will allow you to succeed in research. Treat this like a job interview where you’re trying to sell yourself. Tell a good story (e.g. did you find out that you’re really interested in X area after reading something or doing an internship somewhere, and what gaps have you noticed that you want to make a contribution to this field). 

Personally, I disagree with posts that claim you would need a bunch of research experience with profs to be competitive for “good” master programs. The fact that you do not have academic research experience can be presented as a strength. For myself, I came from a co-op program from the University of Waterloo so I focused on my co-op experience working for various government agencies and how specific practical skills I developed can enhance research. Try to start a conversation, and be confident.

**Closing thoughts**

You may notice that all the above tips are also highly transferable to a job search. Even if you do not get into the program/professor you want, going through the application exercise can also help in job search. If you’ve decided on grad school late in undergrad, there’s no reason to close the door on looking for a job concurrently. Personally, I recommend grad school only if you are certain that you want to specialize in an area within a field (e.g. a subfield of AI in Computer Science, specific types of modelling in Engineering, a subfield of Microbiology in Science). Do not attend grad school blindly because you “can’t find a job” as grad school do not help on that at all – though not at all marketed that way by universities. So, keep your options open as the final decision do not have to be made till later on in the semester. It is definitely possible to put together a competitive grad school application in a short time, but that is no reason to rush into grad school and assume that it will lead you to a better job/career. 

**TLDR:** It is NOT TOO LATE if you have just decided. Grad school is far more inclusive than perceived. Spoon-feed your professors on your strengths and why you are attending grad school for strong reference letters. For research stream masters, meet prospective supervisors and make your case in person. Treat this application exercise as a job search and focus transferable skills can help you succeed. The lack of academic research experience can be presented as a strength, when articulated right. "

adaeqp,5,2019-01-06,I hid academic failures from my parents for a year. Now I will be backing out of a 2019 internship with my dad's employer (who I already interned with in 2018). My dad is very nervous about how he'll explain why I'm suddenly backing out to his coworkers.,vanasbry000,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/adaeqp/i_hid_academic_failures_from_my_parents_for_a/,"**TL;DR - My question isn't looking for advice about what an enormous asshole I've been. My dad and I are looking for a plausible, simple, and ironclad reason for why I'm suddenly backing out of a second summer internship with them. One that's a lot less embarassing than the truth, because my dad has to work with these people for another couple years.**

----

My dad is a software engineer for a big international company where he's become an invaluable asset over the years. He planned to retire sometime around now, but he's delayed those plans until my brother and I can get our shit together and graduate.

Last summer he pulled some favors to get me a computer science internship for his company. I didn't go through the typical application channels to get in, but once there I did the work my dad told me to do and I learned a lot about my dad's workplace. I left on good terms at the end of the summer, having already applied for another internship the following year.

I don't want to go too far into the mental health or school stuff, but basically I tanked my GPA while pretending nothing was wrong. I'm absolutely an asshole for doing that to my parents without letting them know something was amiss. This deception lasted two semesters where I failed all my classes without telling a soul. The summer internship was between these two failed semesters.

I came clean mid-December and have since begun seeing a therapist and have made strides towards growing the fuck up, including promising to later pay them back for tuition.

My dad's company doesn't know any of this yet, and they're prepared to accept me as an intern this summer. I lied to them about my GPA and my expected month of graduation, when either factor would've made me ineligible for the 2019 internship.

I know that the school can't reveal that information to companies, but it's a matter of ethics and respect for my dad that I won't go through with the internship. But even though *I'm* able to back out graciously with little explanation, my dad will still be in his cubicle with his coworkers asking why I won't be coming back this year.

So my dad who needs an answer to give them. He gets really nervous whenever the topic comes up of how he'll handle this situation at work. His hands just start to shake and it makes him sick to his stomach. His vacation time ends tomorrow.

1. He could be truthful, but this would be hugely embarrassing and it would prompt follow up questions that he'd be unprepared for.

2. He could claim that I chose to take better internship somewhere else, but then we'd need to build a cover story with exactly what company I chose to work with. We'd also need reasons why I decided against working with them again. Maybe the long drive was too much, or maybe I chose to get a job with a friend rather than with my dad?

3. He could claim that I changed majors away from computer science, but some of his coworkers are family friends who would be very confused when they find out I'm working as a programmer a few years down the line.

4. He could claim that I made the decision to retake two classes over the summer in order to improve my grade in them while working part-time, rather than doing the full-time internship. I think that one would be easiest for him because the dialogue tree is small and kinda ugly. There's no shiny fruit for his coworkers to inquire about further. It would also be closest to the truth.

5. Something else we haven't thought of.

Any help would be extremely appreciated."

We follow the same education and are in the same class. We both have been going to different internships since February 2018. One of the things he struggles a lot with is his planning, motivation and concentration. During the first internship (February till June) we had to make around 8 assignments for school. He already started struggling with that so we sat down and started making 4 of those assignments together. Sadly his laptop crashed and lost a few of them and got bad grades on the other ones. No one likes bad grades and I feel that because of that his motivation for that internship completely disappeared because he never handed them in. Now we are in the last month of our new internships (started in September) and he still has to make all those 8 assignments. I’ve tried to help him plan at the start of his internship. I made a Trello (online planner) page and made a very structured planning. But his boss didn’t quite agree with it and made his own variation for him. We tried to sit down again to work at all those assignments but we both get distracted once we’re together. I can see his mental health is getting worse (also because his job keeps screwing him over and he doesn’t have a lot of free time) and I really want to help him. He also told me he wanted to drop out of college, I’ll support him if he does, but it would be a waste since this is the last year of a 4 year ride. I’ve now made his own little agenda he can carry around and offered to go to the library on Wednesday and work there so we have no distractions around us. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to help him or deal with these kind of situations? (:"

I have been prepping to take my GMAT and have been doing a lot of research on schools I'd like to apply to in the fall. I have learned there is a large distinction between accreditations as I attend a ACBSP accredited school and am looking to attend a AACSB school - I attend a regional private school and was being stupid when selecting where I wanted to go to college. After reading several threads, I am concerned that the accreditation that my school has acquired could affect my admissions into a Masters of Accountancy Program/ MS in Accounting.

Bottom line:

The Good:
My GPA is a 3.9
I have some strong extra curricular activities (in which I would have leadership experience)
I will have some work experience (Internship)

The Bad:
I haven't taken my GMAT yet
My school isn't AACSB Accredited 
My school isn't exactly well-known (outside of my state)

The Question: How demising will an ACBSP accredited school be on an application to a MACC/MS (AACSB) program?

I should also note that the schools I will be applying to would be out of state.

Most of the professors are absolute garbage and I honestly did not learn much in any of my classes. I am thinking of applying to The University of Texas at Austin and going for a Mathematics Major there (I'm already doing a Math minor) since my heart's really always been in Math and UH has basically made CS seem like a shit field to me. I'm not even sure I'll get a job right out of college since I don't have internships or even job experience so it'll be incredibly hard to get companies to hire me. I have a good GPA but I know companies don't really care too much about GPA or even where you went to college as much as they do about side projects and whatnot. The only reason I am hesitant to go to UT Austin is because I have a few loans (not much) and I do not want to start paying them back once I'm going to UT (since I will be jobless and obviously a broke college student). Just wanted advice on the topic and whether or not I will be able to get financial aid to get a second Bachelor's.

Do I take this opportunity? I don’t have a lot of alumni friends, but the company is a startup and is a long commute from where I live. As a Networking grad, should I only look at “Network Engineer/ Systems Engineer” roles? 

Any advice is appreciated! "
adeo1p,1,2019-01-07,"My first job in ny field after college has been the worst, but I'm scared to leave",kireidinosaur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/adeo1p/my_first_job_in_ny_field_after_college_has_been/,"I graduated from college in 2017 with years of internships and work as a supervisor intending to enter non-profit program management. Eight months after graduation, I finally landed a job in my field. At a non-profit. Doing outreach. Sure, the pay was meager, the hours inconsistent, but I saw it as a stepping stone to full time within a year. That was five months ago. 

Within a month, the job turned out to be awful. I went from being told that my raise was imminent to being shunned. The place has been super underfunded for years. The management is wildly underpaid, overqualified, and thus released a lot of frustration on me, the new hire. I ended up being isolated from my coworkers, and when I tried to, you know, do my job, none of my actions were supported. On the other hand, no mistakes corrected. Its just been a bad time (wow, this is disorganized. 😱) 

This non profit had no engagement for years, so it's like starting from scratch. It's a sinking ship with no visibility; its losing tons of money left and right. I had no clue that things were so bad until December. I know I need out (I actually suspect they plan to let me go this week), but it's also my first paid job in a field that is competitive to enter, and I have only worked here for five months.  

I'm at a loss of what to do. My instinct is to quit and continue working part time gigs until I land something full time, but this boss is really well connected in the community and also not a great human so I am scared she will try to ruin my reputation. At the same time, I can make more money working at a grocery store, and the job environment has taken a huge toll on my self-confidence and mental health. 

This was supposed to be an awesome professional opportunity. Should I go ahead and quit now, or be fired and see what happens? How do I explain this to future employers? It's only been five months since I started. I want to stay in a similar non-profit, but I don't have a lot of networks to access. 

I do have other experience in non profits through unpaid internships, but both organizations have different staff now from when I was there....

Note: I have been applying and have interviews scheduled, but only one related to my field."

adevnn,10,2019-01-07,My startup journey and trying to find purpose,conscioused,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/adevnn/my_startup_journey_and_trying_to_find_purpose/," Hey guys, my name's Rob and I thought I'd share my experience as an entrepreneur starting an online coupon site DealsXtra and an email sourcing tool Contactout. Lately, I've been musing on trying to find a greater sense of purpose, so please take the time to read the article below and let me know what you think

&amp;#x200B;

I went to one of those personal development ~~cults~~ seminars once, and I asked a barrage of questions:

*What is the purpose of life? What should I do with my life?*

“Shut the fuck up”, the seminar leader said

“You already know all the answers inside. You’re just asking me for permission to do what you already know is right. You’re looking for validation. Stop. You don’t need anyone’s permission. When you get an internal sense of what’s right, just go do it. Act, and then see what happens. Adjust your actions depending on the results that you get.

When you come across a problem, think for yourself how to solve it, trust in your own judgement. See the world with your own fresh pair of eyes and make your own conclusions from first hand experience. Don’t just listen to everything that other people tell you. Always question and think critically; other people are no smarter than you are. Listen to others, but think for yourself.”

**FOLLOW YOUR HEART**

The best advice I’ve ever gotten in my life is to follow my heart. I think of it like, there’s a guiding compass inside of me, that always knows which direction to go. An inner voice that knows what’s right. I just need to tune into it and trust it.

For example, right after university, I worked in investment banking and hated my life. I hated the lack of freedom, the repetitive tasks, the ass kissing. I knew I wanted to work on my own business. An online business that would let me travel and explore the world. But I didn’t trust myself. I’ve studied so hard to land this job. All my friends where in corporate. How could it possibly be the right move to leave when everyone else was happily working? Wasn’t I living the corporate dream? I kept looking to other people for career advice, when I already knew. It took me 6 months to find the courage. I decided to start my own business – it was the best decision of my life.

Elon Musk also follows his heart. He calls it: “thinking from first principles”. When asked how he came up with the ideas for Tesla, SpaceX and Paypal, Elon looked inside. He asked himself what are the biggest problems that humanity is currently facing? And thought about solutions to those problems. Meanwhile, most people are caught up with the crowd, trying to ride market trends. Let’s do cryptocurrency for dogs!

**SOCIAL CONDITIONING**

There are all these people telling us how we should live our lives. Social conditioning is fucking with us everywhere. Work is telling us that climbing the corporate ladder means success in life. Fashion trends are defining what beautiful is. Our social group is making us conform and act in a socially acceptable way.

*Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables – slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised by television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won’t. We’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.* – *Fight Club*

Humans are tribal creatures; we’re wired to go with the crowd. But just because everyone else believes in something, it does not mean that it’s right. In the past, everyone believed that the earth was flat. We look back and think that’s ridiculous. Now imagine that you’re in the future looking back. Could it be that there are heaps of popular beliefs we hold today that our future selves would think are ridiculous?

We forget to listen to ourselves. Our default state is to listen to others. We spend our lives trying to live up to other people’s expectations. But most people have never sat down and really thought about what they want to do with their lives. And it’s important that we think about it because we only have one life. We only have a limited time on this planet. One day we will be dead.

*You’re time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.* *– Steve Jobs*

*The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose. Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness.* *– Mark Zuckerberg*

**SOCIAL CONDITIONING VS FOLLOWING OUR HEARTS**

Do we listen to social conditioning? Or do we follow our hearts? The book “The Fountainhead” explores this question. The story goes like this:

Once upon a time there were two architects who went to university together – Peter and Howard. Peter was super social; he became the head of the architecture society. He networked his way into a really prestigious firm after he graduated. Worked incredibly hard, sucked up to all the right people and eventually became a director of the firm. Made tonnes of money and retired a rich man. Towards the end of his days, though, he looked back on all the buildings that he designed and thought to himself: “All these buildings are ugly, I don’t like a single one of them. Every building I designed was driven by what the client wanted, or what my firm wanted.” He felt like his vision of the perfect building was still trapped inside him, and that nothing he achieved in life meant anything.

Meanwhile the other architect, Howard, just didn’t give a fuck. He hated the Victorian design classes at university because it was unnecessarily ornate. Howard wanted to do minimalist post modern design. He ended up dropping out of university and going to intern with an architect who he had a lot of respect for. However, the architect wasn’t getting much business because his designs were so radical. Later on, Howard started his own firm. But he would only take on clients if the client gave him complete freedom to design the building however he wanted. His clients would have no say in the design at all. Howard didn’t have many clients and only built a few buildings in his career. However, he felt that every building that he built was a representation of his truest vision of art. The pylons of the building were like Howard’s bones, the windows and wooden finishings were his skin and flesh, each building was a temple to his soul.

Would you rather be Howard? Or would you rather be Peter?

How has social conditioning influenced how you live?

Write down 10 of your core beliefs.

Which of your beliefs did you consciously decide upon, and how many have been dictated by society?

Which of your beliefs are helping you and which beliefs are holding you?

Are you living the life you want to live, or the life society wants you to live?

How do YOU want to live your life?

**LOVE WHAT YOU DO**

*Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle*. *– Steve Jobs*

**WHY BIGGER GOALS ARE BETTER**

Most people set small goals in life. We don’t set ourselves big goals because we’ll fail. But big goals are actually **easier** to achieve than small goals. People are inspired by big goals and will go out of their way to help you. Investors will give you money. Big goals create movements and bring together teams. Small goals may be easier to accomplish, but not as many people will help you do it. Also there’s much less competition with big goals. How many of your friends are trying to cure cancer or solve cold fusion? How many friends work in accounting? Sure curing cancer is a million times harder than working in accounting, but there’s a million times more people that your competing against if you choose accounting.

When I started my coupon site 7 years ago, I just wanted to earn enough money to support myself and travel. This wasn’t going to become a big business, so I had trouble attracting investors. When I pitched at startup conferences, investors would be like, “cool story bro, needs more dragons.” I had no money, and my goal wasn’t very inspiring, so I had trouble hiring great people. I ended up spending 4 years figuring out marketing by myself and building the business to a level where it supports my lifestyle – yay, go me.

Meanwhile, Tim Kently-Klay managed to build Zoox into a 1.5 billion dollar business in the same time frame. Right… So wtf am I doing with my life? Here’s how Tim did it. One day Tim woke up and was like, “I want to build fully autonomous self driving cars”. No, not some half-arsed version like Tesla. Tim explains that by completely removing the steering wheel, driver’s seat and components needed for human driving, you can make a much more efficient self driving robot. A fully autonomous Uber – that was the dream. A slight problem was that Tim knew fuck all about self driving cars. But Tim was a hella smart guy who had started a successful graphics design company in the past, so he set about reading everything he could on self driving cars. After a year of intense study, he drew out some blueprints for his self driving car which he displayed at some conferences.

His plans were given the honorable title of “Vaporware Horseshit” by critics. However, Tim hustled on and met Niki the venture capitalist who gave him a million dollars.

Tim took that million dollars and went to the self driving car team at Apple. He said to them, “hey so you know… you guys are all screwed because Apple is shutting down their self driving car project. So come join me and we shall conquer the world.” And the self-driving car team is like, sure, seems legit, why not? Then Tim went to Lord Draper, the greatest venture capitalist of them all, and was like, “Hey I am building a self driving car and have the best team in the world to do it, you should give me 30 million dollars.” Draper thought for a while and then he’s like, sure why not? Tim took that money and convinced more people to join his jihad. Then he goes and raises 250m at a $1.5bn valuation. Tim does all this in 4 years.

I set a small goal; build a coupon site. In 4 years I accomplished it. Tim set a big goal; make fully autonomous self driving cars. And in 4 years he has built a $1.5bn company.

What would you rather be doing?

If you could achieve anything, what would you be working on?

**WHAT ABOUT MONEY?**

When I was in college choosing my career, all I cared about was: how much money could I make? So I chose investment banking. And I quit after 6 months. But anyway. Most of my peer group chose their careers because of money. It wasn’t always like this. Back in the 60s, we had just landed on the moon. Einstein and Edison were the celebrities of the day. People wanted to be inventors, explorers and scientists – to work on things that would push forward the envelope of human progress. Nowadays people want money – financial security. What happened to changing the world? Most people are not working on meaningful problems. Millions are dying in Africa. Our best and brightest proceed to go work in finance or tech or whatever industry is the most cashed up.

*If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you’ll spend your life completely wasting your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing thing you don’t like doing, which is stupid. – Alan Watts*

*Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to be at night saying we’ve done something wonderful that’s what matters to me. – Steve Jobs*

Here’s the thing: **solving the world’s biggest problems is the best way to make money.** This makes sense from an economics perspective. If you create the most value then the market will reward you with the most money. But wait, how the hell would working to solve poverty in Africa make more money than being an investment banker? Banking appears to be a steadier path to making more money – if we view things from a short term perspective. But what about in 10 years, 20 years and more?

*Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years*– *Bill Gates*

Let’s say you start a social enterprise in Africa. In your first year you make nothing and your banker friend makes $150k. In 10 years, your social enterprise does well enough for you to live comfortably. Meanwhile your friend is making $2m as a director. You wonder if you made the wrong choice. But in 20 years, Africa grows rapidly, income levels rise 20x to western levels. Business is booming because your customers can afford to pay you western prices. Everyone now wants to invest in Africa. Multinationals are in a bidding war to buy your company. The land that you brought for ten thousand dollars per hectare is now worth a one million dollars per hectare. You are now worth over $100m. Meanwhile the world realizes investment bankers are basically glorified real estate agents – annoying and unnecessary. Bankers and real estate agents get replaced by a super efficient AI marketplace and your friend is made redundant.

**BUT IT’S RISKY**

Sure, chasing big goals is risky. People say that 9 out of 10 new ventures fail. Well, what if you tried 30 times? It’ll take about 4 months to see if a venture will work out, so you can try 3 new ventures a year. If you work on it for 10 years, you’ve tried 30 different ventures and you’re basically guaranteed success.

How I got over risk of starting my own business was, I said to myself: even if I tried for the rest of my life and I died trying, would I be happy? Yes, because I enjoy the process of trying to change the world, building a business, and working on something I find meaningful. I can’t control if I will succeed or not. What matters is that I tried.

*It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.* – *Franklin D Roosevelt*

Imagine at the end of your life, you realized that you never gave your dream a try. You just let it slip past. How would you feel?

*When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, “If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me… and since then, for the past 33 years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I’m about to do today.”*

*And whenever the answer has been, “no” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.*

*Because almost everything: all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure… these things just fall away in the face of death… leaving only what is truly important.*

*Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.* – *Steve Jobs*

**LIMITING BELIEFS**

People have all these limiting beliefs about why they can’t achieve their dreams. Like, I am not smart enough, I have a family to support, I am too old, I have a very needy cat.

*All these bullshit excuses. How do you know you can’t do something until you’ve tried? You don’t know. It’s much more useful to believe you can do anything, because then you’ll try. If you don’t try you fail by default.*

*Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world usually do*

– *Steve Jobs*

People seriously underestimate how far willpower can take you. It doesn’t matter where you come from or what your circumstances are. Got a family to support? Keep your day job and work on your dreams at night. Not smart enough? Spend twice as long studying. Too old? KFC was built by a 70 year old. You are not a victim of your circumstances.

What are some things you want to achieve but feel like you can’t?

**YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU SET YOUR MIND TO MAN**

If there’s one story that demonstrates how far willpower will take you despite the hand you’ve been dealt, it’s that of Barrack Obama. No not the president, but his father Barrack Obama Sr.

Obama Sr grew up in one of the poorest families in the world in Sub-Saharan Africa, but his son went on to become the most powerful man in the world. How did this happen?

Obama Sr grew up in a Kenyan village. School was a little shanty hut where all the village children were packed into one class. Education sucked, but Obama Sr showed some spark. He had one thing going for him: he was able to learn English since grandfather Obama was a cook in a white household. One day, some aid workers came to visit their village. Teenage Obama Sr was like, “damn those aid workers looking fine, I think I’ll go chat them up.” The aid workers were impressed by Obama Sr’s drive and encouraged him to apply to the University of Hawaii’s African scholarship program. Barrack Sr studied intensely and with the tutorship of the aid workers managed to get the scholarship. At the University of Hawaii Obama Sr met Ann Dunham who would become Obama Jr’s mother. When he wasn’t chasing skirts, he managed to top his class and get a full scholarship into Harvard Law School. Willpower can get you from growing up in sub-Saharan Africa to going to Harvard Law School, to your son becoming the president of the United States.

Now you may be thinking Obama Sr is smarter and more driven than I’ll ever be. He has better genetics. Just because he has achieved greatness doesn’t mean that I can. But are successful people really smarter than us? So I was in Silicon Valley last year doing a program called 500startups where I got to meet tech billionaires and industry leaders. It was surprisingly underwhelming… The advice these billionaires gave was mostly self indulgent, generic and useless details. “so I cooked lunch for my team everyday, and everyone loved my cooking”. “Ohh marketing, we didn’t do any marketing, the product just grew by itself”. The best advice I got was actually from other startup founders who were still hustling to make it. Then it struck me. These billionaires are not better than the rest of us. They’ve just worked hard and on the right things. But they’re fallible humans. We are all cut from the same cloth. I can do whatever they can do.

Malcolm Gladwell writes about the 10,000 hour rule: how a master in any field has practiced for at least 10,000 hours. If we put in that amount of hours, we can master anything. Take Laszlo Polgar, a Hungarian psychologist who, after studying hundreds of great intellectuals, identified a common theme – early and intensive practice. He hypothesized that with intense practice, he could turn his three daughters into prodigies. He chose chess as the perfect activity to train his children in, because it was creative and analytical and had objectively measurable results. Two of his daughters went on to become grand-masters. No women had ever achieved the title of grand-master before. All three daughters ranked in the top 6 in the world for chess.

Sure, we’re born with certain physical characteristics or elements of our personality that are hard to change. But the moment that we accept ourselves, take the wheel and start steering, that’s when things start happening. Take Lebron James vs Steph Curry. Lebron has the perfect genetic build for a basketball player. Steph doesn’t. He doesn’t have the height, he doesn’t have the bulk. But he doesn’t give a shit. He proceeds to practice the hell out of his shot. And with that, he has achieved a level of success to rival Lebron. You may not be able to change some part of yourself, but you can develop other parts and be just as effective.

Cool, so I believe I can do anything I set my mind to. But…

**HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE?**

*To discover your “why”, ask yourself these questions. Find the common denominators in the answers and you’ll have your first lead to explore in finding your why. The commonalities in your answers may point you towards your purpose, and give you some directions to explore.What do you think is biggest problem in the world right now?If money and time weren’t limiting factors, what would you allow yourself to dream of doing?What makes you feel angry, or rise up at the injustice you see?What gets your emotions going? what brings tears to your eyes?What makes you happy?*– *Daniel Flynn, founder Thankyou Water*

**READ**

Read. Do a shit tonne of reading, and then read some more. There are world leaders and billionaires who have spent years distilling the best of their life’s wisdom and principles of success into books. Books that we can access instantly for $10 on Amazon. It’s the digital age. We are the first generation to have the entire trove of human knowledge available on demand in our pockets.

Yet most of us don’t read. What the fuck? Instead we spend our time watching TV. What did Kim K name her kid? Did North Korea fire another rocket? What happens next on Game of Thrones? All this bullshit that we don’t need to know about. Our newest drug addiction is social media. It gives us a hit of validation, a new like, another viral video. But there’s no substance, no meaning. The short term hit leaves us shallow inside and longing for another, and another. Popular media is fucking up our brains. It’s the information age buffet. Because we’re fat fucks from the first world, we say, give me all the junk food, broccoli can fuck off. We need to treat the information we consume like food and watch we’re putting into our bodies.

**LISTEN TO AUDIO-BOOKS**

The best life hack that anyone has ever told me is to listen to audio-books at 2x speed. You can listen to audio-books whilst you’re at the gym, or driving, or any other mindless task. This way, it’s easy to find 2-3 hours everyday, and if you do, you can finish 2 books every week, and 100 books a year. 100 books will put you miles ahead. Most people don’t even finish 100 books in their lifetime. I started audio-books 3 years ago, and I’ve learnt more in 3 years than I have in the rest of my life combined. School didn’t teach me useful skills, books did. Books written by people who have done it before. You can get most popular titles on Amazon’s Audible book store. Make sure you select the USA Audible store as this has the widest selection.

**WHAT SHOULD I READ?**

**FIND MENTORS**

After reading and researching what I wanted to do. I got in touch with people who’ve done it before. No matter what you’re trying to achieve, there are 7 billion people in the world and there are people out there who have done similar things to what you’re attempting to do. Find these people on Linkedin and ask for their mentorship. Ask people who are not your direct competitors, people in a different geography or who have moved onto something else. You’d be surprised at how many people respond. I got around a 30% response rate. Here’s an email that I sent.

Hi John,

I am Rob, an Australian tech entrepreneur [linkedin.com/in/robliu](http://linkedin.com/in/robliu). We’re building [contactout.com](http://contactout.com/) a recruitment tool similar to Connectifier but targeting the Australian and UK markets.

I would greatly appreciate your mentorship and advice on growth and how to do sales for recruitment tools, and any insights you’ve gained from your experience at Connectifier.

Would you be free for a brief chat on Skype? Happy to send you $500 for your time.

Kind Regards, Rob Liu

John was previously VP Marketing at Connectifier, a competitor whose business model I was trying to copy. John came on board as an adviser and helped me add over one million dollars in value to my business. It all started with an email.

When emailing, bribe people. Offer them $500 to talk to you. This makes it look like you’re serious about your request and respectful of their time. Most mentors are rich already and won’t accept your money. For people who do accept your money, don’t bother talking with them. Because if they need $500, then they’re probably not very successful, and would make a shitty mentor.

After reading, researching, finding mentors, you’ll still have to figure out a lot of the journey by yourself. You’re aiming to do something great and that involves blazing a path into the unknown. It’s like playing soccer. You can read all about soccer tactics, you can practice dribbling, practice kicking. But if you want to get good at soccer, you need to get out onto the field and play the game. Think for yourself, follow your heart, and take action.

You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference. – *Steve Jobs*

I work 5 days a week, 10-11 hours a day. I barely get any breaks. I don’t get any breaks because 1, I don’t have any techs to help out, 2 the owner is never there and when he is “he doesn’t want to be bothered because he’s doing accounting” or some other stupid excuse. Over the weekends my employer expects me to “check my emails” and be “available for emergencies”. I have worked for my employer for about 5 years, the first three were on and off because I was an intern studying full time and working part time for the business . At the time, the business had 5 or so techs but we are down to one (just me).

Over the years, I’ve proven myself to be a good worker and I pushed myself to do a very good job at the stuff I do. For the past 2 years, I have been working as the ONLY tech there , plus the owner. I have been answering phone calls from customers who expect IT support right away. I have also been handling office manager duties and all the stuff an office manager would do. We have customers under contract who expect IT support when they call in. I have to take in all the calls and take care of all of them.

The owner only wants to be bothered if it’s an issue I can’t solve (which he will often get frustrated about and say “I need to get more certifications to learn this kind of stuff”.  

He recently hired an office manager/receptionist who also helps him with accounting. she has NOO prior experience and I just found out she started making the same amount of money I was making before I got a raise. 

The owner travels a LOT and is constantly taking in new customers which means more work for me. People often get angry at the stuff the OWNER sells them (I.e, they want faster internet so the owner sells them a better service)  and I have to be the one to end up “supporting” the services.

I am in a difficult situation and I feel overworked and under appreciated. I work more than 40 hours a week, I get paid salary and the receptionist with no experience is making close to the same amount I make. 

I would leave the job in a heart beat but the only thing stopping me from doing so is the fact that the owner is my “mentor” from college. He has been really helpful with a lot of personal things in the past. I feel like I “owe” him something and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I can be doing better at another job, way less stressed...

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

And then, it's like in order to get some internship, you need to have interned before! I haven't, so idk what to do. 

Also, I don't have THAT much experience other than some college intro to cs classes. Does anyone have any tips at this point in the game? Thanks so much!!"

&gt;Me: So do you need all these emails?

The sales employee I was talking to was distracted by the headphone that dangled from my ear. 

&gt;Distracted: Are you on a call?

&gt;Me: I've been on hold for a while. Long distance support is...

I listened down the line to the hold music, the same 30 seconds of song on a loop.

&gt;Me: ... so **calming**. How did this mailbox even get this big?

&gt;Distracted: Where's RedCheer?

... ?! 

&gt;Me: RedCheer?

&gt;Distracted: She always looks after me.

&gt;Me: She's ill. A few technicians are, I'm the only one in the office today.

&gt;Distracted: Sick? Do you think I should call her, see if she's okay?

I turned back to the task at hand. The mailbox had taken up a huge swath of the hard drive. 

&gt;Me: Do you want to delete some of these?

I'd sorted the email by size. Every day his email received the 6 huge spreadsheets. Each taking up precious space. Years of them.  

&gt;Me: These all look like they can be deleted.

&gt;Distacted: No!!! Hey how long is this gonna take? If its more then an hour, I'll just go home. 

The shout had drawn the ire of the SalesManager. Recent sales results had given him a huge boost in ego. He practically swaggered round the office.

&gt;SaleManager: Airz! Are you on a phone call, whilst wandering round my Sales area?

The same loop of 30 second song continued through one ear. So **Calming**

&gt;Me: I am.

&gt;SalesManager: How disrespectful! Walking around my sales floor on the phone while we're all trying to work. Do you not kno....

I stuck my finger up in the air, held my hand up over the microphone as if shielding it from my voice. 

&gt;Me: Sorry, could I just cut you off. I am actually on a call right now. 

I turned back away from SalesManager and sat back down and smiled to myself. F&amp;*% that guy. Distracted smiled down at me.

&gt;Distracted: I still can hear the hold music... So this computer fix its going to take at **least** an hour, right?

&gt;Me: You'll need to stay here. 

Distracted was upset with having to stay and sort through his emails. 

&gt;Distracted: I don't want to delete anything. Last time I had space issues, Redcheer just sorted it. Registry or something. Do that again. 

Huh. So thats why. 

&gt;Me: That wont work. You need to delete some these. This is years of ... 

It was at this point I realised the entire sales department ran almost exclusively off Excel spread sheets. Sales, forms, entire workflows in excel. I worked though with Distracted to delete duplicates and get his mailbox down to a reasonable size.

&gt;Me: Finally. Okay we have resized your OST, just try to keep it a managed. What do you have to remember again...

&gt;Distracted: A mailbox is not a place to store things.

I smiled. While helping Distracted I had also finished up the call on the phone. Double smile. Sales Manager must have sensed a victory. 

&gt;SalesManager: Airz, a word in my office.

Sales Manager took his seat and seemed to ponder his next move. 

&gt;SalesManager: You may not know this, but we're on a bit of a hot streak here in Sales. Its a Golden month.

A Golden month. The words hovered in the air with reverence.

&gt;SalesManager: ...however it is rude, talking on the phone in our department. Loudly talking. Its distracting my employees. It's putting the Golden month at risk. 

&gt;Me: Okay. I'm now done. I can just leave. 

My instincts kicked in. Leave. Never get into an Inter Department fight. Everyone loses. I got up to leave but Sales Manager stopped me. 

&gt;SalesManager: No, its not just you. Redcheer, always coming up here flirting, And Intern, he's always distracting people with ideas.

&gt;Me: I see.

Say nothing. 

&gt;SalesManager: Our Sales figures have been so good! We need to maintain this momentum. So these unwelcome distractions... they have to stop.

&gt;Me: Right.

Say nothing. 

&gt;SalesManager: Rudeness, distractions. They have to stop. Okay lets make it a rule. IT cannot talk on the phone in the sales department. No personal discussions, strictly work related talk only.

&gt;Me: Right.

Say Nothing.

&gt;SalesManager: Listen, outside of this department, do whatever you want. Inside it though, I want you to respect me and my employees. Okay? Tell your people. 

&gt;Me: Right.

Say Nothing

&gt;SalesManager: Yes, just follow my simple rules.

F*&amp;% it. 

&gt;Me: Better idea. From now on, for any IT problem just bring it down to the IT Department. We can fix it in the IT department so we wont disturb the other employees. Bonus, if it's too hard to solve can give you a spare right way. 

Sales Manager seemed to stutter. I think he liked the compliant IT.

&gt;SalesManager: Errr... No, then we'd have to lug all our gear down to IT, that doesn't...

I cut him off.

&gt;Me: Yes. It will minimise distraction in your office. This is a great idea Sales Manager. Best be off, don't want to distract you. 

I stood up to leave, and dashed to the door before Sales Manager could compose himself. 

&gt;Distracted: Hey Airz, can you look at....

Departmental war. Poor guy, he's about to be the first causality. "

Basically, I try to facilitate the usage of exiting tools for my fellow biologists, but I want to go further.

Here is the reference website of the technique used here if you would like to take a brief look: [https://www.ultraconserved.org/](https://www.ultraconserved.org/). TL;DR, you assemble a genome and align it to a set of probes to identify what is called an ultraconserved element (a sequence that endures through evolution), from which it is possible to generate a phylogenetic tree, among other stuff. So. is it possible to use machine learning techniques to ""predict"" the location of biological markers? If so, what techniques should I explore? Do you have others ideas of applications of machine learning in phylogenomics? I tried to be brief, but I'm eager to know more. Hope we can develop some insights! "

Junior dev looking for insight,tiredjuniordev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/adikw8/should_i_quit_my_job_junior_dev_looking_for/,"I am a ""junior"" developer at an IT company (not development heavy). I was hired straight out of school as a developer. I was promised a role in a newly started, well functioning development team with an ambition to grow to 20+ people over the coming years. The selling point was a bleeding edge application for both our clients and staff. Robust back-end that would interface with a multitude of systems. And a modern front-end in React.

I was immediately given the sole responsibility of an old system we sold to a client many years ago, interfacing with ancient hardware. With that came planning meetings where I was supposed to have the technical knowledge, I managed - barely.

The second week I was also given the task of maintaining a system built by an intern for our economy-department. Needless to say, I was thrilled...

I had some smaller tasks on the new, exciting application, but time didn't allow for much.

4 months after I started, the Senior Developer responsible for the new, flashy project quit. The person I had previously gone to for help and hoped to follow in the footsteps of, had gone.

He was ""replaced"" by a new hire, with approx. 7 years of experience, of a different language. Python vs C#.1 week after the Senior Developer quit - the new Developer had severe occupational burnout, gone for X months...

Everything they had been working on fell onto me. With the old projects still ongoing.

I am the only one with back-end experience on the team, and I feel left to the wolves. So much is expected of me and I have no-one to ask for help. Anxiety dreams are constant and I have no fun, ever. Not even in my personal life. Too tired all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am writing this it is becoming clearer to me that I should quit, and find a better position at a company that values and takes care of its juniors. But I don't want to let my current team down.

That the grass is always greener is something I am scared of as well.

If anyone has some insight I would love to hear it. Thank you in advance."

So I’m internally debating myself about quitting my current internship for another (possibly better) internship. It’s an extended internship (~15 months) that I’m currently 7 months into. There was no end date in the offer, just an understanding that I would leave next summer. However, I now have the opportunity to work at another office, which I would consider a better one. I say this because A) it’s bigger B) it’s a known company through my field C) they do better projects. My office is small, brand new, and I have nothing to do most of the time. To give my internship some pros, I have benefits that I wouldn’t get at the new internship like paid holidays (however, Christmas was the last paid holiday I’d receive working here) and it’s a very laid back environment. Yet again, that’s another reason I’m wanting to leave. I don’t feel as though I’m getting the experience I want. I want to work in an office that is challenging and where I’m constantly busy. I want to work more, hilariously enough. I don’t even get the chance at overtime because there just isn’t enough for me to do. I guess the main reason I don’t want to leave is because I don’t want to burn bridges or seem ungrateful for the job I have. It was really hard getting an internship in the first place. I think I would fit it better at the new place though. My bosses are great but it’s such a small office and I’m the only woman here so I don’t talk a lot because I don’t feel like I fit in. Well, this is my internal debate. Any advice or guidance? 

Just a little extra info: 
They are both paid internship but at the new place I would get paid more. 
I have received two bonuses working at my current job. (End of the year and signing on bonus) 
 

Thank you.

It's a small company and my internship was in software development. I ended up overhauling the information management of a small department and automated a lot of their practices allowing that department to grow and their revenue grow with it. The company contacted me earlier this year and expressed interest in getting my help to continue expanding that program. I told them I ideally wanted full-time work, which they couldn't afford to pay me for for strictly software development. So, we both agreed that I would manage a small team (4 people currently) at a facility that does trucking and manual labor. This means in addition to the multiple software projects I'm working on, I'm also helping to schedule shipments, manage and generate paperwork, maintain morale (lol), etc. Management duties. There are also some other tasks I've been assigned with that I won't go into detail with, but in a nutshell it feels like a million different things. It's not necessarily that it's such a volume of work that I can't get done, but that there are so many different threads to keep track of that it's been extremely overwhelming and even debilitating at times. I have had days where I woke up thinking about suicide and my mind just raced the whole day with thoughts like those concurrent with thoughts about all of the different things I have to get done and think about with work, leading me to feel paralyzed. I would sit there and try to start a task and just stare at my computer screen, and anytime I tried to put my mind to the task I would get overwhelming anxiety and go back to distracting myself and telling myself I'd come back to it in a minute.

At the same time I was starting this job I also was beginning therapy following a sexual assault, dropping out of a semester of college, and spending 6 months in a deep depression and doing essentially nothing all day. Not long into it I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Complex PTSD. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression but things have been incredibly difficult as of late. The break over the holidays helped but these feelings are starting to creep back (and my schedule is about to go from 4 days a week to 5). 

This company is very flexible and I know that they are accommodating of people with mental health issues but I don't know how to approach this issue. Should I write it in an email so I have everything in writing or is it more appropriate to talk over the phone? Should I request specific accommodations and talk about my diagnosis? Should I apologize for and explain why things have been so slow for me in the past two months? I have been keeping things running as much as possible and I haven't made any big fuckups, but I am VERY behind on some things (no hard deadlines have been given to me, just been taking waaaaaaaaay longer on some things than are reasonable). Nobody has really been hard on me about it and I think my boss recognizes that they've given me much more responsibility than is usually given to someone my age/experience (I'm 22) but since I exceeded expectations at my internship (no other software intern had really succeeded at what they were trying to get out of them) he kinda decided to ""throw me in the deep water"". Either way, I do feel pretty guilty about the lack of work I've gotten done in the past two months and what ramifications it might have. I don't want it to sound like I'm groveling or making things up or making excuses, though.

I also just don't know if the accommodations I would request are reasonable as being due to my condition or if I'd just be doing it because I'm being lazy. I have difficulty sleeping, concentrating (was evaluated for ADD a couple years ago but am now in the process of getting a second opinion), anxiety, difficulty regulating my moods, etc. I'd be asking for more options to telecommute and flexible hours (I suck at getting to work on time but nobody there has ever given me shit for it anyway). I just am not even sure myself if that's just me being lazy and irresponsible (though probably nobody on reddit can determine this for me anyway).

Basically I need advice on how much of this I should address with them and how. "

By this I mean, will the professor ask students to shoot scenes and/or shorts outside of class, or will production take place entirely in class and editing outside of class? If none of the above, what is the out of class work/homework like? I’m asking because I’m doing a fairly intense internship next semester and I don’t want to also have to be doing production on my own outside of class. If anyone can direct me to course syllabi, I would be very grateful. Thanks guys."

The classes were dropped years ago due to lack of demand, but we believe that today, with the increased interest in Korea and greater impact Korea is having on the world (technology, music, business), that Korean Language classes can take off again. However, the language department has to see proof of demand, so we are creating an electronic petition to do so. If you are seriously interested in learning Korean, please take a look at the google form below.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://goo.gl/forms/AFZFcDEdJb4eeHF53](https://goo.gl/forms/AFZFcDEdJb4eeHF53)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, **this isn’t a guarantee that classes will start for sure.** But by signing the form, we are now one more person strong! There is no issue with funding these classes or hiring teachers, the only thing that has to be proven is demand. Show the Purdue Language Department that you are indeed interested in learning - and maybe we just might be able to have Korean offered as a language here again.

&amp;#x200B;

Benefits of learning Korean:

\-small class sizes

\-language credit!!!

\-a newfound appreciation for the Korean language and culture

\-the ability to read, write, and speak Korean

\-career and internship opportunities in Korea

\-understand Korean TV, film, and music

&amp;#x200B;

Once a significant amount of responses have been received, we will format the responses into a document and share it with the College of Liberal Arts and the Language department. We hope to be able to offer Korean Language Classes in the fall of this year. Please click the link above and send your information if you are interested!

Update: Thanks for your continued support! We have exceeded the minimum number of signatures, but will keep trying to get more over the next week to give us insurance.

When it comes to public speaking, going in for an interview, and just networking overall, I am the worst. Usually when I try to speak, I would usually ""croak"" and not know what to say. I also get pretty worried about the person/people I'm talking to and how they perceive me overall. Often times, these experiences usually leave me feeling embarrassed, depressed and ashamed of myself for not trying hard enough.

Recently, I've been working with a mentor from SCORE (A non-profit that helps clientele with business advice), and he suggested that I look up social classes with David Carnegie Training. I've looked up this organization, and found that I would benefit from learning from such classes. The only problem that I've found are the steep prices for a course, with one course nearing $2000. 

So my question is this: Is their a better alternative to David Carnegie Training that would be affordable to a millennial intern? And if not, where would be the best thing to do to improve my social networking skills?"

adolil,5,2019-01-07,What to do when something you said gets accused of being racist when you didn't intend to?,Seankala,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/adolil/what_to_do_when_something_you_said_gets_accused/,"Hello. I wanted to ask advice about the situation that happened to me in the title. Let me give some more background info.

Yesterday night, I was out having a bite to eat with some people I used to work with. They have a couple of new interns now and I got to know them over the past couple of week as well (I don't work there anymore, but they have a space for people to host their own events which I happen to be doing). One is a girl from Jamaica and the other a boy from the US. Both are of African descent.

There was a period when we were jokingly giving each other Spanish nicknames. I had joined in on the conversation late after coming back from the bathroom, and people were coming up with a nickname for one of the interns. I just remembered that a friend of mine a long time ago had given me the nickname ""Jorge de la Jungla,"" which literally means ""George of the Jungle"" since I used to be a big fan of that show.

&amp;#x200B;

I just blurted out ""How about Jessica de la Jungla?"" The intern (Jessica) asked me what that means and I said it means ""of the jungle"" parodying George of the Jungle. She immediately got extremely upset and said it's really racist.

At first I was completely clueless and genuinely asked her why it was racist as I had no intention on bringing up racism in any shape or form, but when I thought about it I immediately realized that I should have thought it through.

I apologized to her and explained the context of why I said that, and told her that I didn't mean to offend her and I'll be more careful. She said ""Okay whatever if you say so, but you guys are always making these racist jokes."" (I'm Korean and a few people there are also Korean and we occasionally say things like ""I need my kimchi"" or sth like that).

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first time that I've actually genuinely upset somebody of making racist claims, and honestly I don't know what I should do. Should I treat it like any other situation where someone is offended and apologize and let us both get on with our lives? What would you do?"

&amp;#x200B;

My experiences are fairly limited to a few school projects and one R&amp;D internship. I've been hunting for jobs for around half a year now and I've yet to get any call backs and 0 interviews. It's really making me feel hopeless. I don't think I'm a bad engineer because in the experiences mentioned I have always finished what needed to be done if not more. Granted I recognize I'm not the best but I know from my senior / group projects I've always been the one to pull my folks through regardless of their GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

To add salt to my wound, I recently found out some of my friends are getting tons of interviews / full time jobs; the same friends whom I tutored or gave answers to during college. I 100% support my friends in their jobs, but I cannot for the life of me understand why I'm not even given a chance. For the couple that did, none wanted me back (I asked ""why"" to improve myself for the next interview, one ghosted, the other said I didn't seem passionate enough even though I was 100% passionate for it during the 3 hr interview I had with him).

i've also thought joining the military could be an option if I absolutely cannot find a job. I'm not afraid to work my way up, nor am I afraid to take a 10k salary so long as it helps improve me as a person and an engineer. I'm very lucky to have support from family and friends, my only worry in all this is my skills going to waste or down the rusty drains.

&amp;#x200B;

more information regarding me:

* I have a few connections, but those who did refer me I still didn't hear anything back.
* I have a professor I keep going back to. Might ask for help in regards to resume and or more projects to do
* I live in CA but is willing to go anywhere for a job.
* I have extreme social anxiety, but that never stopped me from trying to fit in in mixers / events for jobs. It could be this factor that led the interviewers think I'm a bad fit, but honestly, me trying to combat this does not make me a bad worker.
* My resume is attached. [https://imgur.com/a/WbdbhrX](https://imgur.com/a/WbdbhrX)

Anybody got tips on how to get out of this nightmare? I appreciate all kinds of help.

Also, for fellow engineers, does doing the FE give me a boost on looks on my resume?"

I've already posted to /r/resumes some time ago and I'll update later my new resume, but there's an issue that bothers me, not just about the internship but job seeking in general.

I'm quite a bad student at college, there are several things I shouldn't have passed but I did, somehow. If I was asked at an interview to write a Java program, I doubt I could. But give me a Java program and I would be able to understand, modify and explain it to someone else. It's not that an IDE made me useless, I started without one, but that was many years ago and I never practiced unless I really had to do something, and sometimes I didn't, affecting my grades but managing to pass anyway.

I know that the solution is to practice, but I'm a bit busy with other school subjects at the moment. Java is just one example, but there are a few other.

I just don't know if it's something I should exclude from the resume or how would I handle it if I'm asked about it in an interview. Say that I don't know shit? Sparkle some glitter on it? "

Not a great day, unfortunately one of our brand new interns kept trying to get my attention for help with something completely unrelated. The first two times i brushed her off and told her to give me awhile, only for her to come back 10 minutes later and tap me on the shoulder again.

The third time she came by, i feel awful but i snapped and told her to ""duck off"" when she tapped me on the shoulder. I think she started to cry, but she didn't come back for the rest of the afternoon. Only after i fixed the problem, did i really realize what i did.

I sent her an email/slack message apologizing but she didn't respond. Now a few hours ago i apparently got an HR complaint about my behavior. I don't know what an HR complaint really is, but i have a formal meeting involving the head of HR, and our CTO now.

Before I get into anything, I’ll state my stats in case anyone was wondering.

School: top 10% of 700 students

GPA: 4.33 W, 3.78 UW

ACT: composite score of 33 (34,33,31,34)

Subject tests: 780 Math II, 710 Chem (did not submit)

EC: counselor for camp, library helper, Kumon tutor, tennis, internship at USC for biochemistry, etc.

Schools applied to: Northeastern (EA), UCI, UCSD, UCSB, UCLA, Georgia Tech, Boston College, UofMichigan, USC

Applied as general Chemistry major for all schools.

Even though I live in California, I refused to do any cal stats because I only applied to schools I would actually go to. Not saying anything is wrong with cal states because I know how great the facilities of CSULB, SDSU, Cal Poly Slo, etc. are. I would just rather go to community college at that point and transfer into a more prestigious school.

I’m already mentally prepared to get rejected by UofMich, UCLA, and USC. My sister is attending her third year at USC for neuroscience with a tuition of  around 9k/year, so if I ever get in, it would be because of legacy. 

I’m mostly concerned about Northeastern because I obviously EAed to it for a reason. I’ve been singing about it for so long because I felt that it was a perfect target school for me. But after reading a lot of reddit posts, I’m beginning to think that I overapplied to reach schools and only applied to one safety school: UCI. At this point, I feel as if my stats are so mediocre and regular compared to everyone else. I do realize that the majority of people who care about colleges and post on reddit seem to have higher stats than the average senior, but I can’t help but feel so upset about myself. I used to dislike UCSD because my sister chose USC over that school, despite the fact that she got in as a biochemistry major. (UCSD is #2 in the nation for biochemistry and the major is highly competitive for admissions) But now I want nothing more than to get into UCSD LOL

I’m posting this more as a reminder to myself that it’s completely okay, regardless of the results. I think I’ve just constantly felt so compared to my sister but we have different dreams and aspirations. My sister wants to open up a clinic and therapeutically help others, while I went to work for the CSI as a forensic chemist. Same branch of STEM but completely different dreams.

I’m a first generation Asian immigrant, which at this point isn’t that big of a deal because we all know many first generation immigrants around us. I realized that I can’t exactly use that as a hook when it comes to my applications, because the immigrant population is actually much more higher than we assume. And both of my parents went to college, as my mom got her bachelor’s degree in pharmacy and my dad got multiple bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science, software programming, etc. I guess you can say that my family is extremely STEM oriented. But besides that, I can’t help but feel so hopeless, having such high bars already set up for me. 

In the end, I just want people to understand that it’s really not a good idea to base off your expectations on college decisions from reddit and everyone’s posts. If you’ve noticed, there’s always a large range of cases, and no 2 students are the same. I guess this post was more for myself to vent than wanting feedback.

I’m sure you guys would be curious about my sister’s stats so feel free to ask and I hope 2019 strikes off amazingly with EA and ED results. Praying for all of you and I simply only want happiness for my peers.

God bless you, happy New Years.

I've heard from many upperclassmen to try to take all the CS classes in my first 2 years, especially overloading on CS in sophomore year so I can gain enough experience to be prepared for internship interviews by my sophomore year. 

Because Physics is not required to as any prerequisites for any CS classes for a CS major, the upperclassmen recommended me to save them for later when I finish many of my core CS classes like CS 180, CS 111, CS 118, and CS 131.

My current schedule for the last two quarters of freshman year are:

winter: CS 32, MATH 32B, MATH 33A

spring: CS 33, M35L, MATH 61

**Sophomore year:**

        fall:   CS 111, CS M152A, MATH 33B

        winter:  CS 180,  CS 118, PHYSICS 1B
           
        spring: CS 131, CS M151B, Probability Elective, PHYSICS 1C

**Junior year:**

     fall:   CS 181, Tech Breadth Course, Tech Breadth Course
     
     winter: CS 130, CS Elective, Science/Tech Elective
     
     spring: Tech Breadth Course, CS Elective, Science/Tech Elective

**Senior year:**
    
    fall:   Probability Elective, CS Elective, CS Elective
    
    winter: HSSEAS Ethics Course, Science/Tech Elective, GE
    
    spring: GE, GE, GE

What are your thoughts/opinions on my 4-year class schedule, especially regarding the planning of my CS related courses? The main reason I'm overloading on CS in the beginning is to prepare myself for technical interviews for internships and jobs.

Do you guys think I should take physics earlier or later? 

Any thoughts/opinions would be greatly appreciated!

adtd0j,1582,2019-01-08,First Salvo,airz23,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/adtd0j/first_salvo/,"The department was in a funk. I listened to the chatter around the office from my desk.

&gt;Intern: They keep coming! 

&gt;Redcheer: Sales is flooding us with tickets. They're all bulls$%t. First its mouse too fast, then its mouse too slow. This is ridiculous. 

Petty Bastard.

&gt;Intern: What should we do? ... Go report them or something?

&gt;Redcheer: Report them? Screw that. Lets just lock them out of the ticket queue.

Other IT staff started noticing similar ticket patterns. The office was getting rowdy. Very little work was being done. 

&gt;Intern: Should I go report the situation to Airz?

&gt;Redcheer: Sorry I think I misheard, did you ask how to accidentally delete users off the network?

I'd been busy typing up a terse email to SalesHead. Choosing between ""deliberately obstructing the work of other departments"" or ""Clearly team members do not have technical capability required to work in a professional office setting"". It was at this point that Head of Marketting burst into the department. 

&gt;MarkettingHead: Airz! I heard Sales and you are having a lovers quarrel. Getting him to send you heaps of requests during Golden month, nicely played.

&gt;Me: Huh... What?? Why are you down here?

As MarkettingHead strode into my office I saw the suspicious face Redcheer was making. MarkettingHead shut the door. 

&gt;MarkettingHead: I need help. Have you heard about the new project thing they're starting?

&gt;Me: No.

Oh god. Not this again. I want no part of new projects.

&gt;MarkettingHead: The VP is looking for a name. He's asked everyone. 

&gt;Me: So?

&gt;MarkettngHead: Well it would be a little embarrassing if the name didn't come from Marketting. We're kinda the name people.

Phew. 

&gt;Me: So you don't want me to suggest a name to VP. No problem. 

&gt;MarkettingHead: Great. What do you think about the name Project Icarus?

The guy who died flying too close to the sun. 

&gt;Me: Who's the head of this project?

&gt;MarkettingHead: VP I think. 

I smiled kindly at MarkettingHead. 

&gt;Me: Yep. Perfect name. Good work. 

She winked at me. 

&gt;Markettinghead: I knew you'd love it

As Markettinghead bounced to the door, I could see the office behind the door had fallen to a state of despair. Redcheer was angrily tearing into someone down the phone. Interns head was on the desk. I think I saw tears. It had gone from very little to almost no work being done. 

&gt;MarkettingHead: Oh IT employees! Hey. 

MarkettingHead shouted out to the department. She waved at everyone for attention.

&gt;MarkettingHead: Airz has let me know that the 2 top IT staff members, with the most tickets answered this month get a free day off each. Only tickets fully professionally documented count. Good luck everyone.

&gt;Me: Wait what..

Markettinghead turned around and smiled at me. She whispered.

&gt;MarkettingHead: You gotta motivate the troops somehow. 

&gt;Me: I don't have any free days to give away.

&gt;MarkettingHead: ... and who reports them missing? Silly.

I had never before seen people fight over the new tickets coming into the system. I have now.   "
adv7t9,3,2019-01-08,Keep My High Intensity And Graduate Early?,caglebagel,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/adv7t9/keep_my_high_intensity_and_graduate_early/,"After this spring, I will have 80 credits. I’ve been taking classes every summer, winter, spring and fall available, accumulating 40 credits a year. I got done doing 17 credits (five 3 credit classes, one 2 credit class) in the fall and will do another 17 come spring. I am a sophomore (but technically junior because of credits) and I’d need 120 credits to graduate.

Question is, should I keep the pace and graduate May 2020? I was originally scheduled to graduate May 2021 but because of the amount of work I’ve been doing, I have the ability to graduate earlier.

The thing that I wanted to add is that I got a well paying internship that I will be doing starting this summer and going until summer 2020. It’d be full time during the summer, about 20-25 hours during the school year. It’s great experience in my field (IT) but has a decently long commute. I thought that doing 12 credits (4 classes) over 15 credits (5 classes) might be a good idea to factor in that work time and not feel like I’m drowning. 

Also, if I keep the pace I need to complete 4 classes in summer and/or winter, as well as 5 or 6 a semester. I don’t think a lot of my final classes have online options so I might need to be on campus more.

I appreciate any input!"

In addition, I also have a thesis (from my 1st masters) in applied mathematics. I have received a rejection from Two Sigma, Jane Street, and Akuna Capital till now.

adx0a9,2,2019-01-08,Should I take this Associate Secretary Position? (Advice Needed),Schrute_Farms_69,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/adx0a9/should_i_take_this_associate_secretary_position/,"**Background**: So a little background about my work/education experience. Im  23 years old; the highest level of education i've completed is high school; I currently have about 2 years of experience as an administrative assistant (1 year at a very small local company and another year on a project team at a major Japanese aerospace company). I haven't had a full-time job since i got let go from my last job in July of 2017. I spent about 6 months on unemployment looking for jobs with no luck. So in Jan. of 2018 i decided to enroll in a 1 year long business development program for young adults to make myself a more marketable candidate. This program is accredited by the ACE so by the end i will receive about 20-30 college credits. It is split into 2 phases consisting of 6 months each. The first phase is the ""learning and development"" phase where you attend basic business and i.t related college level courses. The second phase is the ""internship"" phase, where based on how well you performed in the L&amp;D phase, as well as your personality and skills level, you are matched with an I.T related internship.

&amp;#x200B;

**Currently**: So now I am in the internship phase of the program. I am currently filling to role of Admin. Assistant to one of the VP's of a large gov. contractor that specializes in providing I.T services to gov. and civilian agencies like the IRS, NOAA, and USPTO. Although my official job title is admin, my work more closely is that of a business analyst (according to my manager.) My internship ends in 2 weeks, so i've been applying to some of the openings here at this company. I got a call the other day about scheduling an interview for an ""Associate Secretary"" position. The recruiter i spoke to on the phone didnt have too many details on the job other than that it would be at an office in DC, where i would be working as a secretary on a **contract job** with my company for the USPTO. The contract is scheduled to last a little over a year. Im not sure what would happen to me after the year but I would assume i would be terminated unless i got offered new employement.

My main goal career wise is to work in either the defense or intelligence industry either for a gov. contractor, like Lockheed or Dyncorp, or for one of the gov. agencies themselves as an analyst or systems administrator (or something along those lines). As I mentioned the company I work with is fairly large (about $2 billion in profits a year) and is expected to keep growing and some of their top competitors are the same defense contractors i would like to work for. However my company only does basic ""civilian level"" I.T services for the government, nothing that requires a security clearance or anything like that related to defense or intelligence. So even if I were to get hired for this secretary position, my plan would be to only work there and go to school until I can get a degree in either CS/CSE or international relations or if I somehow get lucky and get a entry level position before my degree. Obviously its no guarantee but based off the info ive provided, should I go for this job so I have an income and decent job experience while i get my degree, or should I look for an entry level position at a company i know i'd want to stay at for the rest of my career."

adxuev,2,2019-01-08,Few Questions Regarding Internships,kazelot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/adxuev/few_questions_regarding_internships/,"Hello fellow Computer Scientists, newbie here!

I am a soon to be sophomore in college, and so far my CS related course work and experience has been a Freshman Design Project which was a website with custom Google Maps functionality (mostly HTML and JS, little bit of AngularJS), and a course on Python 3 and another focused solely on OOP with Python. 

I live in Philadelphia. Currently I am interning at Comcast as a Tech Auditor, but would like to have an internship somewhere else, possibly related to computer engineering as well. I may minor in CE, and would like to get experience in that field, but still will accept an SE internship as it relates more to what I learn in class.

My questions are as follows: 

* Are CE internships worth it? Do they teach a lot? 
* Given my experience, would I benefit a lot and learn more from an SE position?
* Are all positions that would look good on a resume on the west coast? And do employers tend to help securing and paying for housing if I need to move out of Philly?

Thanks in advance!"

In addition to my [mock interviews](https://www.helpwithapps.com/book-online) available for purchase and immediate scheduling on my website, I wanted to share a bunch of advice with you guys for free.

**Why I think another ""how to interview"" post is necessary**
Recently, [AdmissionsMom](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aclutj/up_close_and_personal_the_interview_heres_my/) and [WilliamTheReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/admjvg/williamthereader_interview_tips/) gave some terrific advice about prepping for your upcoming interviews. However, when I was preparing for my own college admissions interviews way back when (hint: you guys were 6), I knew a list of questions interviewers would ask me—but I didn't know how to best answer those questions. That led me to getting tripped up on a few questions, which all could have been avoidable if I just knew how to answer them! So I thought I'd share with you some dos and don'ts about answering interviewers' tricky questions.

**Background on my insight into the college admissions process**

I've conducted somewhere around 25 alumni interviews for the University of Chicago (back when they had interviews). I also evaluated hundreds of interview reports when I read and evaluated over 600 applications for admission to UChicago in 2012 and 2013. For Berkeley's MET program, where I was an admissions reader last year, we also interviewed candidates—so I evaluated dozens of those interview reports, too! As a college admissions consultant, I've used all this insight to help dozens of my students prepare for their own college admissions interviews. Most students, with some preparation and insight into the interview process, can ace their interviews. Without preparation, however, I often see students really struggle to converse articulately with an adult, convey their passions effectively, and make a good impression.

So, without further ado, here's my advice:

**What sort of insights interviewers hope to uncover**

* Who are you and what do you value in life?
* Will you be a presence in the classroom? Are you enthusiastic about learning and intellectually engaged?
* Will you be a good roommate and active participant in various organizations on campus?
* Are you teachable, thoughtful, more collaborative than competitive?
* How interested are you in attending this particular university? How knowledgeable are you about this university’s offerings? How do you believe this university’s curriculum is a good fit for your educational goals?

**Criteria for which your interview will be judged**

* Do you demonstrate intellectual curiosity?
* Are you motivated to learn for learning’s sake (as opposed to being a “grade grubber” [someone who begs a teacher for a higher grade just in search of a perfect GPA] or compelled by parents to succeed)?
* Are you open to exploring new ideas and perspectives different from your own?
* Do you think for yourself and question the world around you?
* Are you open-minded? Do you value being part of a diverse community in college?
* Are you confident in your own abilities and comfortable with yourself? Can you engage in discussion with an interviewer in a mature, self-aware, and poised manner?
* Are you a good “fit” for this university’s community? (NOTE: “Fit” is defined differently by different universities, so glean from a university’s website what characteristics they hold highly.)
* Are you knowledgeable about this particular university’s curriculum, majors, programs, culture, traditions, and extracurricular activities?
* Can you cite specific reasons for wanting to attend this university, as opposed to just saying it’s a “top college” or “highly ranked”?
* Have you demonstrated any leadership?
* Are you deeply involved in one or more extracurricular activities? Do you pursue that activity out of true passion or merely a desire to “look good on college applications”? Will you pursue that activity on this college’s campus?
* Will you be a good roommate and classmate?
* Did you make an overall good impression?

**Questions you might be asked**

Google “questions asked in a college interview” and you’ll find many resources. Since many different people are leading these interviews, questions asked can vary wildly. Some interviewers will steer interviews in one direction, while other interviewers who value different qualities will steer their interviews in a different direction. You could get an interviewer who loves to chat, or one who is solely interested in your answers and provides little feedback about your answers or anecdotes about their specific college experience.

As such, come prepared to answer a variety of questions. Here are some questions you might be asked. I recommend you prepare natural answers (don’t respond as if you have rehearsed) to these questions:

**Question:** Tell me about yourself. **Don’t say:** “Well, um, my name is Rebecca. I go to Stevenson Creek High School, and I’m a rising senior.” Your interviewer knows all of that already! Jump straight into your passions. If possible, mention an accomplishment, strength, character trait, or skill set you’ve honed. **Do say:** Instead of saying, “Well, I started my own cupcake business,” tell them about your greatest accomplishment with your business: “I am incredibly passionate about pursuing business in college, stemming from the business I started freshman year, selling cupcakes. I scaled the business from merely selling at sporting events to now having my cupcakes sold in 15 local grocery stores and 20k revenue each year in online sales.” Instead of saying, “I am captain of the Varsity Cheer team and I volunteer with the organization Amy’s Friends"", say: “As captain of the Varsity Cheer team, I spend a lot of my time helping my teammates reach their full potential in mastering our routines. That desire to help others grow is also what compels me to volunteer with an organization called Amy’s Friends, where I help developmentally disabled kids learn social skills.”

**Question:** What classes do you enjoy and why? **Don’t say:** “Math” or any other one-worded answers. **Do say:** Mention the subject you love, but go into detail about why you love it. If you developed that passion over time, tell the interviewer who or what sparked your interest in the subject (a teacher, a documentary you watched, a club you joined, etc.). If possible, give a 30 second anecdote about a memorable moment from that class, or tell the interviewer about your desire to pursue that subject in college. “I used to really despise math as a child, as I found it incredibly difficult to master. However, my freshman year geometry teacher was phenomenal, and not only taught me how to understand difficult mathematical concepts, but also gave me the confidence to pursue math at the honors level. Now, I’m considering majoring or minoring in math in college.” Or, “I’ve always been a voracious reader, so naturally my favorite subject is English. I particularly loved an assignment my junior year where we got to choose our own book to read and present to our class. While my classmates chose the shortest books possible, I tackled East of Eden, which I found fascinating. Now, John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors.”

**Question:** Which classes do you find to be the most difficult and why? **Don’t say:** “I hate history” or “English sucks” or “Chem, ‘cause I got a C in it.” **Do say:** Pick a subject you actually enjoy but still find challenging. “Although I found AP US History to be incredibly challenging as my first ever AP class, I am really glad I took it. Not only did it make me a better writer, but I am better able to engage with modern-day social issues as a result of knowing groundbreaking court decisions such as Roe v. Wade and Brown v. Board of Education.”

**Question:** Are there any current events that you feel strongly about? **Don’t say:** “Yeah, Trump sucks” or “A few months ago I attended an NRA rally!” Unless you’re president of the Democrats or Republicans club, try to steer clear of politics in your discussions, as it’s hard to gauge your interviewer’s political leanings and you don’t want to get into an argument. If you are incredibly active in a politically affiliated club, try to gauge your interviewer’s reaction before launching into political discussions, and always stay polite no matter their political stance. **Do say:** Brush up on some local news, such as your state’s decision to ban smoking in public places or your town’s decision to put a tax on plastic bags at stores. If possible, connect the issue to your activities, experiences, or desired major. For example, “I am frustrated by our state’s recent defunding of arts education programs. As an artist and musician, I benefitted immensely as a child from free art and music workshops in my community that were offered to low-income kids, such as myself. It really saddens me that other kids in my community won’t have the chance to pursue art, theater, and music, which is why I’ve requested my NHS chapter volunteer to teach arts to low-income kids this year.”

**Question:** What do you dislike and wish to change about high school? How would you go about changing your school (or have you already began to change it)? **Don’t say:** Avoid anything too negative about your school, like “our Spanish teachers suck” or “My classmates will throw anyone under the bus in pursuit of an A.” **Do say:** You can be authentic in your answers, however. If your Spanish teachers are terrible, say: “I wish our Spanish program was a little stronger. If I could change this about my school, I would hire natively speaking teachers who are incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about teaching. One thing that I have done to supplement my own Spanish education is meet every other week with a foreign exchange student from Spain. I help her practice her English while she helps me practice my Spanish.” Or, “I wish my classmates were less obsessed with getting a perfect GPA. I want to be surrounded by students who love to learn and do so not in pursuit of a flawless college application but for the sole appreciation of a well-rounded education. To be honest, I’m not sure how to go about changing my classmates’ approach to learning, but in college I hope to volunteer to tutor kids; doing so will enable me to spark a love for learning in kids from a young age.”

**Question:** What do you want from your college experience? **Don’t say:** Something generic that applies to all universities, such as “I’m eager to live on my own,” or “I can’t wait to join a sorority.” Do say: Tie whatever you’re looking forward to most about college to their university. If you want to major in history, say: “I want to be surrounded by diverse perspectives that challenge my own way of thinking. As an aspiring history major, I especially want to learn about history as it applies to the modern day. In investigating Northwestern’s history department, I found a cool class called ‘Race, Sexuality, and the Politics of Protest.’ I think the course will not only teach me about history, but will introduce me to diverse perspectives applicable to today’s society.”

**Question:** What is your favorite book? **Don’t say:** “Hah, I hate reading”. **Do say:** For some of you who love reading, it will be challenging to pick just one favorite book. For the rest of you who hate reading or never have the time in your busy schedules to read for pleasure, pick a book you’ve read in class, such as The Great Gatsby, The Crucible, etc. Don’t say you don’t enjoy reading, you haven’t read for fun since you were 12, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (or another book from childhood), Harry Potter, or “Does watching Game of Thrones count?” When you reference a book, ask them if they have read it and, if they haven’t, give them a short synopsis. Tell them one or two things you liked about the book, from a particular character to the author’s use of symbols to advance the story, to even the style of narration.

**Question:** What did you learn from participating in/leading [a specific extracurricular]? **Don’t say:** Avoid anything overtly negative about the extracurricular, i.e. that your dad forced you to do it. **Do say:** Talk about the challenges you’ve overcome, such as getting cut from the softball team sophomore year but trying out again junior year after a hard year of training. Talk about the leadership experience you’ve gained, like recruiting 5 kids to join the debate team, or welcoming incoming freshmen to your high school as an orientation leader. Hone in on the skills you’ve gained, your accomplishments, the lessons you’ve learned, and the character traits you’ve forged. If you have concrete details, like how you shaved off time from your 400 meter dash after a summer of intense training, the money you personally raised for a fundraiser, or the number of students who joined your club in its inaugural year, include that information.

**Question:** Of all the highly selective schools out there, why [university]? **Don’t say:** “It’s so highly ranked!” or “I love the prestige of Harvard” or “Well, my mom is an alumni” (the last one’s doubly bad, for it’s also grammatically incorrect. Your mom’s an alumna, your dad’s an alumnus, and your parents are alumni). **Do say:** Be specific into what makes that university special. Do your homework before the interview and research your desired major, the school’s curriculum (like Columbia’s core curriculum or Brown’s open curriculum), unique programs (such as pre-professional, internship, or study abroad programs). Think about what differentiates this university from any others. Perhaps hone in on their mission (Jesuit schools such as Georgetown, for example, focus on service and justice for all, whereas NYU values global experiences). If your parent is an alum, mention something specific about their experience as it relates to your future experience, if accepted. Instead of, “My dad really valued his education at Tufts,” say, “My dad raves about Tufts’ interdisciplinary learning. I’ll take advantage of that opportunity for interdisciplinary learning by exploring the Experimental College. Although I plan on majoring in engineering, I’m also passionate about drama, and I love how Tufts will let me explore drama as a minor and the surprising ways I can apply the discipline to my study of engineering.”

**Question:** What most excites you about [university]? **Don’t say:** “The PoliSci program is really great.” **Do say:** “The opportunity to study under great thought-leaders in the political science department, such as Professor Selma Hershenberger. I’m amazed that I can learn from someone who was the former U.S. ambassador to Egypt.” Include specifics that prove you’ve carefully researched the university and know precisely why that university is a great choice for you.

**Question:** What classes would you be interested in taking at [university]? **Don’t say:** “Well, as a biology major, I’m really looking forward to Yale’s biology classes.” **Do say:** Research a couple classes before your interview. You don’t necessarily need to memorize them, but it would be great if you could memorize some of the topics. Talk excitedly about a class you discovered on the history of pirates or a class where you listen to and analyze rap lyrics through the Race and Ethnic Studies department. Try to pick classes that you won’t easily find at other schools. Thus, skip talking about “Intro to Engineering” and instead focus on one of the courses you’d take as a major in your fourth year. Electives are usually much more fascinating and much more unique from school to school. Question: If you could choose anyone—alive or dead—with whom to have a discussion, who would you choose? Don’t say: Try to avoid cliches, such as Albert Einstein, “my grandma,” Donald Trump, Tupac, etc. Well, maybe Tupac isn’t a cliched answer for this question in a college interview, but it will certainly make your class of ‘59 interviewer choke on his tea. Do say: It could be wise for you to pick someone relatively unknown in history, except for a niche field about which you know a lot. That way, you can inform your interviewer about this person and why a discussion with him or her would be illuminative to you, without facing rapid-fire questions by a die-hard fan of the person. Oh, and speaking of “illuminative to you,” make sure you have a reason for why you want to talk to this person. What would you discuss? How would that discussion fundamentally impact your view of the world? If the person is alive, would you take the opportunity to convince that other person of something (such as your desire to meet with your state Senator to convince her of pursuing more funding for a cause dear to your heart)?

**Question:** Who is your greatest role model? **Don’t say:** “My mom,” “my dad,” “my grandpa,” etc., unless you have an incredibly good reason for saying so (i.e. they overcame a formidable hardship and fundamentally impacted how you think, feel, or view the world). Likewise, it’s best to avoid cliched answers, such as people currently in the public eye, politicians, celebrities, etc. **Do say:** Let’s say your mom really is the most wonderful role model you know. You can choose her as your answer to this question, but you must be clear about how her life’s circumstances and her courageous attitude has forged some quality or dream within you. For example, I have a student whose mother is battling ALS, a disease of the nervous system that is sadly fatal. Her mother’s condition has influenced my student’s passion for medicine; she knows she won’t ever get the opportunity to save her mother’s life, as ALS is too fast-progressing, but she wants to save the lives of other people who, in the future, develop the disease. That’s a pretty powerful thing to say in an interview, so situations like these absolutely trump my “avoid saying a relative” rule. Generally, good choices would be pioneers in your desired industry, people making a difference in your local community, etc. The more personal you can get for why that person is your role model, the better. How did that person influence how you think, feel, or view the world?

**Question:** What do you want to major in? Why? **Don’t say:** “Computer Science, because it’s a practical career choice.” Avoid saying you want to major in something because it is practical, will make you a lot of money, or because your parents want you to be a doctor. Also, don’t say, “Eh, I’m undecided. I really have no clue what I want to study.” **Do say:** Why you’re passionate about the subject, what you’ve done to prepare for/explore the subject inside and outside of the classroom, how you hope to pursue the subject in college (specifically at their university, referencing specific professors or classes), and what you hope to do for a career. It’s okay if you’re undecided in your major. Say you’re undecided, but then talk about what wide-ranging fields you’d like to explore. “While I’m undecided in a major, I am curious about psychology, sociology, and maybe even neuroscience. How the brain works and why people make the decisions they do really intrigues me, so I could see myself majoring in one of those subjects.”

**Question:** How have you prepared for such a major inside and outside of the classroom? **Don’t say:** “Well, I’ve taken Honors Geometry, Honors Algebra 2 Trig, AP Calc BC, and AP Statistics to prepare for a math major.” Well, say that, but then go a step further. **Do say:** “Well, I’ve taken Honors Geometry, Honors Algebra 2 Trig, AP Calc BC, and AP Statistics to prepare for a math major. I also tutor math to freshmen at my high school, and am part of Math Olympiad, where I’ve helped my team win 2nd place at regionals. I’ve also researched how I would explore math at Harvard, and really think I could learn a lot from the Ahlfors Lecture Series.” If you haven’t had the opportunity to explore your desired major outside of the classroom in formal extracurricular activities, cite some of the reading you’ve done on the major, and what you found fascinating about what you learned. “While there are few opportunities in my community to pursue anthropology inside or outside of the classroom, I’ve studied people, culture, and history through many different capacities. For example, my history, foreign language, and literature classes in high school have introduced me to different cultures, perspectives, and modes of thought. And in Debate, I’ve delved into anthropology through debating both sides of various current events.”

**Question:** What are some of the biggest challenges you have faced in life and how have you overcome them? Don’t say: “I’m pretty privileged, so I haven’t really experienced any challenges.” And don’t open a can of worms by saying, “Well, my dad is abusive.” **Do say:** Not every student has overcome a big challenge in life—and that’s great that you’ve been so fortunate. If this applies to you, you can answer the question in one of two ways. 1) Focus on a little challenge you’ve overcome, like not making the play when you auditioned freshman year, so you joined the Speech Team instead. 2) Admit that you’ve been fortunate enough to haven’t experienced many challenges, and describe how you’ve worked to eliminate challenges for others. For example, “I’ve been really fortunate enough to grow up in a supportive family, school, and community. That supportive upbringing has made me want to support others, so I am a mentor in Big Brothers, Big Sisters and am partnered with a very smart little girl who is from an underprivileged background.” Let’s say, in contrast, you’ve experience some significant life challenges, such as abuse, homelessness, coming out, racism, mental health issues, physical health issues, learning disabilities, death in the family, having a child at a young age, difficulty immigrating, parents’ divorce, etc., don’t drop that information on your interviewer as if they are your therapist. That being said, you can absolutely talk about it. For example, “I didn’t have the easiest childhood, but I’m proud of who I’ve become. Because my mother suffered from mental health issues, she wasn’t always a positive presence in my life and I had to take care of my three younger siblings. I started working at 12 years old to put food on the table, doing everything I can to make sure my brother and sisters have every opportunity they would have had if our mother had been more supportive.” This student mentions the biggest challenge she’s faced in a really mature manner—stating the facts (mother suffers from mental health issues, student had to get a job at a very young age) but not dumping private details on the unsuspecting interviewer. Focus on how you’ve become a better person as a result of this experience, even if the experience was incredibly, incredibly hard on you. Explain how you’ve become more empathetic towards others’ struggles, you’re an advocate for those who don’t have a voice, you’ve become more mature, you are independently motivated to achieve your goals, etc.

**Question:** What three qualities best describe you? (Or, “What are your strengths?”) **Don’t say:** “Hardworking, perfectionist, motivated.” Avoid cliches and don’t be repetitive with your adjectives. **Do say:** Find a less common synonym. Instead of “hardworking,” for example, say “methodical,” as it is less commonly used. Instead of three adjectives to describe the same character trait, describe different facets of who you are. If you’re struggling to even find adjectives to describe yourself, Google “100 adjectives to describe yourself in an interview” and write down every single one that applies to you. From there, whittle down the ones that only loosely apply until you have 5-10 adjectives that definitely apply to you. Cross out any cliched answers, and then pick 3-5 adjectives that describe different parts of who you are. Have a top 3 and then 2 more in reserve in case the interviewer asks for 5 adjectives. Don’t just list those adjectives, either, but in a short sentence describe why that adjective applies to you, how that adjective has encouraged you to accomplish something, or how you forged that adjective over time.

**Question:** What are your weaknesses? Don’t say: Anything unfiltered, like “I am addicted to video games” or “I procrastinate a lot.” **Do say:** Admit an actual weakness (no one likes someone who veils a strength in a weakness, such as “Some people say I work so hard”). However, describe how you’re overcoming that weakness. Better yet, pick a weakness you’ve actually overcome. For example, “In junior high, I got good grades with little effort. My freshman year of high school, that posed a problem because I procrastinated, thinking I could easily pull off an A with little effort. I quickly realized that wasn’t the case so worked to overcome my tendency to procrastinate by planning ahead, sticking to my self-imposed deadlines, and studying for exams a few days away. Now, I’m confident that I won’t let this weakness hinder me as I transition to college.”

**Question:** Describe a time when you experienced a setback. How did you respond? **Don’t say:** “Getting a D in English made me realize that I don’t want to study English ever again.” **Do say:** You can admit a setback, but focus on how that setback has made you more determined to achieve than ever. “Struggling to do well in English class really demonstrated to me where my reading and writing skills were lacking. Instead of getting frustrated and shutting down, I approached my English teacher and discussed with him the ways in which I could dig deeper in my analyses of our reading assignments to better understand themes and symbols. I also partnered with the best English student in my class; she helped peer edit my writing assignments, while I tutored her in chemistry so we mutually benefitted. This experience not only taught me the benefit of hard work and perseverance, but also the value of forging strong relationships with my teachers and classmates.”

**Question:** What is your greatest accomplishment? **Don’t say:** Don’t list esoteric award titles that wouldn’t make sense to a layperson. **Do say:** Instead of “I won a Mustang award for Honors English,” say, “I was really proud when my teacher awarded me the top student award from among 60 students in Honors English. It made all my hard work, raising my grade from a B to an A in one semester, worth it.” Even if you don’t have any honors or awards, you certainly have some accomplishments: being brought up to Varsity from the JV swim team sophomore year, being 1 of 15 students out of 50 applicants to be selected to welcome incoming freshmen during orientation, raising your C first semester of AP Chem to a B+ second semester, etc.

**Question:** What career do you wish to pursue? Or, what do you hope to be doing 10 years from now? **Don’t say:** Any one word answer. **Do say:** Your dream career and the insight you have gained into that career path. If you want to be a doctor, for example, tell the interviewer why and how you’ve explored that career both in and out of the classroom. Mention your AP Bio teacher’s influence on your career goals and your volunteer work at the hospital, for example. Prove to the interviewer that you’re not just following a career path your parents picked out for you or something that will earn you top dollar, but something about which you’re both passionate and knowledgeable. “I would love to become an orthopedic surgeon, as I’ve witnessed how much my grandmother’s scoliosis has negatively impacted her life.” You can take things a step further and outline to the interviewer how this particular university will help you reach your dreams: “At [university], I plan to be a human biology major, where I can not only fulfill requirements for medical school but gain a really interdisciplinary education in understanding human beings from many angles—biological, behavioral, sociological, and more. Such an education will be a huge asset to my career in medicine, for I’ll not only be able to address patients’ physiological symptoms but treat them with compassion and understanding.”

**Question:** What do you like to do for fun? **Don’t say:** Don’t say what I said in my Yale interview long ago, when asked this question. I rehashed one of my extracurriculars, and my interviewer said, “No, no, no, what do you do for fun outside of organized activities?” I froze. I was so busy with school and competitive soccer, cross country, speech &amp; debate, plays, and all the other stuff I had going on that I never did anything just for fun outside my activities. When pressed, I said I went bowling a few weeks ago with friends, and she was like, “Oh? Do you like bowling?” “No,” I choked out. “I hate it.” Not my finest moment. **Do say:** Here’s my opportunity to tell you to have some fun your senior year. Yes, I know—you don’t have time for fun. I totally get it. I was you! But make time, not just in the event you’re asked by your interviewer what you do for fun, but also for your mental health. Do something you enjoy (even if that’s bowling). Read, listen to music, paint, garden, cook with your grandma, play board games with friends or family, go hiking with friends… do something that calms you down, refreshes your spirit, and gives you a great talking point in your college admissions interview.

I live in Wisconsin, am a 26 year old white male and a convicted felon. I had a solid job, the opportunity to have a great career, and a wonderful girlfriend and I pissed all of that away about three years ago.

I’ve been trying to better myself by going to school, even found another job that was more than amazing, and I felt like life was finally coming together again. Fast forward to last month (right before the holidays) and I was put on a p.o. hold and then lost my job and almost failed a whole semesters worth of A’s because I was missing my finals.

Freedom is something that is extremely precious to me, and as a man that used to live at his own place with his girlfriend, living back with your parents with no job, and piling bills, is rather overwhelming.

I’ve talked to counselors, I’ve tried meeting new people, but I have this constant sense of overwhelming fear for going bankrupt, or ending back up in jail. I feel like no matter what I do, my life will never be the same or get a second chance.

I love my schooling (I’m going for software development), and know that it will take me places, it’s just I’m already stressing about my last semester which requires an internship. I feel like my charges are more than sure to complicate this, if not make it nearly impossible.

I am sorry for the “poor me” post and I know nobody probably gives two shits, but I just had to vent to somebody, anybody. I literally don’t know who to talk to."
adysvo,28,2019-01-08,"As a junior academically dismissed from a top 10 university, what transfer options do I have?",throwaway2314538,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/adysvo/as_a_junior_academically_dismissed_from_a_top_10/,"I went to a US News top 10 college that is known for its academic rigor and grade deflation. My first three semester weren't good by any means, but were somewhat respectable for a CS student in the engineering school; I managed around a 3.0 my first three semesters. I was on the same pace in my fourth semester, but I had a mental breakdown a week or two before finals and wound up failing every single class. I was taking a larger course-load than usual that semester, so  my GPA plummeted to a 2.12. I was academically dismissed after that semester and made it my goal to be readmitted to the same university. In working to get back in, I got diagnosed/treated for ADHD and other mental health issues I was unaware of, successfully completed two 3-month software engineering internships at a Fortune 100 company, and took two the two highest level math courses offered at my local community college (in which I got an A and B). After doing all this over the course of 15 months and working with the university through the readmission process, I was allowed to come back on probationary status. I was more motivated than ever when I returned to school this fall, but I only lasted two months before I had no choice but to go on medical leave. My insomnia got to the point where I showed up to my first optimization (linear programming) midterm without having slept for 60 hours. Despite knowing the material pretty well, I obviously failed that exam. Once this was happening on nearly every exam or major assignment, I knew I needed to leave school and get my shit together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm trying to get my life and mental health back in order, I'm struggling to sort through my options. I am eligible to return to my original school for the fall semester, but that place has caused me so much misery that I don't know if returning is a good idea. Alternatively, I would be interested in returning to my home state (NY) and finishing my degree at one of the SUNY schools. The only issue is that my GPA is below the cutoff for the schools that have programs I would be interested in. I'd be more than willing to spend a semester or two at a community college, but I can't find any courses that would contribute to my degree that I haven't already taken. At my first university I achieved 56 credits, then 8 credits at community college, and I also have 4s and 5s on 11 AP exams which would probably equate to 30-40 credits at a SUNY school. Is my only option to just choose arbitrary courses at a community college and earn a respectable GPA? Do schools ever make exceptions to GPA cutoffs for things like mental illness? If it's worth noting, I got a 33 on the ACT, 750+ on 3 SAT IIs, and had a high school GPA around 3.9. I doubt any of that matters this far along though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! I'm just really hoping to find some new direction to start working toward. I'm already putting a lot of focus into straightening out my mental health, but not having the structure of school or work can make life quite boring and depressing."
adyueo,3,2019-01-08,Advice on leaving my advisor,throwaway--385u3,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/adyueo/advice_on_leaving_my_advisor/,"Hey all, I'm an undergraduate researcher studying computer science at a top 10 tech school.

My advisor/professor/PI is an absolutely amazing guy: extremely smart, very giving in his time, etc. I absolutely love him. Definitely the best mentor-type person I've had even though I've done multiple great internships and worked in a few different labs on my campus. I have a pretty good rapport with him developed over more a year.

However, the environment of my lab is kinda toxic. After a year of working here, I just can't handle working with a few people in my lab even though I'm a really chill guy. My productivity has gone down quite a bit dealing with this environment. I don't feel comfortable really going into more details.

My advisor is great but the lab environment is too toxic for me. I was wondering what advice you have. I'm considering leaving my lab and seeking out other research opportunities."

How do you hire as well?  

We tend to have people come to our coworking spaces to leverage the gigabit internet that is available as some towns don't have anywhere close to it let alone cell service. Same thing with meetups is we have small groups but usually have all of the same flavors of most large cities. Coming from the NYC metro this was something I was really worried about. 

Hiring wise though we do see a lot of people want to come here and not know about jobs or students leaving because they have not had an internship or co-op near campus.

The field I am most interested in is artificial intelligence, but because of my lack of experience, I may fall in love with something else. The college that I'm leaning towards seems to be located in a good tech area(I've seen it on different top 20 places for computer jobs"" lists), but it isn't one of the big cities. My end goal would be a 6 figure job out of college, but I understand that things like that are pretty rare, especially considering the fact that I'm starting pretty late. The main point of this post is to make sure that I am on the right path to achieve my goal. Any changes or recommendations to help me on my journey would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Right now I'm starting to learn my first coding language, python. It's usually mentioned as the best place to start, and I've seen it as a prerequisite for a number of internships in the college area I'm leaning towards. Ideally, I'd like to have a firm grasp of it by June, or at least the end of summer
* For my freshman year of college, I plan on primarily focusing on learning more languages and beginning to network. It would be great to get an internship year one, but I'd rather make connections, learn more languages, and start building up my GPA. If what I've read is correct, it's better for me to go out to career fairs and do coding challenges than take a bad internship just to stuff my resume. The college I'm leaning towards definitely isn't the most prestigious, but it is inexpensive(for college standards) and is located near some better ones. The idea is that I could check out career fairs near the more prestigious colleges and get a grasp of what I need to work on to get an internship.
* Sophomore year is when I'd really like to start internship hunting. I've seen a couple of smaller AI and programming companies in the area through a quick google search. While I would be applying four internships freshman year, and hoping to land a big 4 one, ideally I'd have a solid enough resume at this point to at least land one with a smaller company. I plan on continuing to network while starting to focus in on the languages needed to get me a FANG internship.
* Junior year would be the FANG year. At this point, I would have 1-2 internships on my resume, and 2-3 years of experience with the languages needed for me to get an internship with one of the big 4. If it doesn't happen this year it would be kinda rough. But I would lock in, see what went wrong, and continue strengthening my resume. If it doesn't happen during senior year, I'd imagine that my chances of getting the 6 figure job out of college would be pretty low. Either way, I still would be in position to get a pretty well paying job out of college (assuming the market for cs jobs continues to grow), that would be at least enough to pay off any student loans.

ae10wx,25,2019-01-08,Should I ask to be taken off a project when I have no idea how to do the given task?,eevee_stormblessed,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ae10wx/should_i_ask_to_be_taken_off_a_project_when_i/,"I'm an intern at a large company.

The project is a legacy project requiring Windows 2000 and the code is all in Visual Basic and Visual C++. The code is total spaghetti code containing 30k+ lines (at least it's spaghetti from what I’ve written/learned in school and read in open source repos). There will be 20+ header files included, and variables from these files will be assigned and updated all over the place in numerous amounts of .cpp files. There is absolutely no documentation nor version control other than the project being backed up on numerous hard drives. The platform is an interactive GUI. There are over 50 buttons for the GUI and in the code each button event is called, “Button1”, “Button2”, …, “Button50” with little to no comments explaining what each button does. There is duplicate code throughout the entire project that can very obviously be taken into a method with certain flags to save hundreds and hundreds of lines of repeated code. On average, function lengths are about 500 lines. The code is littered with commented out code with no message saying why it was commented out. There are empty if statements all over the code and most of the time the if statement structures don’t make sense, such as an if statement being empty followed by an else statement that has code within it. To add delays for message sending, there are multi-nested for loops scattered through the code to delay full seconds. This is what I’ve found over the past week or so.

I explained the project situation so someone can inform me if this is normal or not, as I’m currently in my senior year of my CS degree and have only ever interned at this job doing other smaller programming tasks. For me personally, the state of the project has made it nearly impossible for me to accomplish what was asked as I have difficulties understanding the functionality of the software and how to replace what has been asked to be replaced.

When asked if I would help with the project, I was only told about the languages used for the project and nothing else. Again, I’m an intern, so I’ve tried to be eager to work on whatever was asked of me hoping I would learn lots in the process. I’ve been informed by multiple people that the high up management really wants this project to be finished asap. Unfortunately, there is no expert understanding the system completely, so mentorship/guidance or asking someone for specific help isn’t really an option. In fact, as of right now, I’m probably the most well-versed person who understands the code structure (yikes). However, I am sure that there are tons of people who are much more experienced in dealing with these situations than I am and could have the project updated in no time, but I personally do not know of people like this.

At this point, I’m quite defeated and am tired of trying to unravel this black box. I’m not sure what to tell my manager as I really need this job and don’t want to be looking for a job when school starts up again. I’m also a decent candidate to be hired on once I graduate, but don’t want to be stuck working on these types of systems, unless I was trained extensively.

I was thinking to email my manager, explaining the above situation to him and that I would like to be taken off the project asap. Would this be a good idea, or should I just keep trying to chug along? Is there a certain way I should explain everything to him? I wouldn’t mind these types of situations (bad code) if I was shadowing someone/closely mentored by someone who knew what they were doing and how to untangle these types of mess. This idea of shadowing a Computer Scientist sounds amazing to me, as I’ve received no technical training for the 2 years I’ve interned. Is mentoring/training not popular in SE types of positions?"

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

I'm currently a physics and astronomy major in school but I'm also really interested in computer hardware and would love to get an internship or any sort of insight into the world of computer hardware. 

Im a freshman so it's still possible for me to branch out a bit so I was wondering if there's a way to do both physics and at the same time take some ECE courses specifically for computer hardware? 

I really don't want to double major because I can't take that sort of load and even if i could I would hardly have enough time to breathe let alone enjoy my undergrad.

Any sort of suggestion is highly appreciated."

ae7y6c,32,2019-01-09,Best Path to grad school for a computer science degree with no current background for it?,Aggiegirl2013,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ae7y6c/best_path_to_grad_school_for_a_computer_science/," **Background:** 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated in 2013 from a University of California (one of the top 40 schools in the country) with a really shit Gpa, like under 2.5 shitty, with a degree in Sociology. Well, shocker that degree is pretty useless. My GPA is explained by a health condition I didn’t push hard enough to get treated and some personal trauma’s that happened during my undergrad. I have since addressed these issues and am doing fine now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked temp and part-time for two years before landing a full-time office manager position at a really small local company that pays shit and I have to carry all my own health insurance costs, my only actual benefit is paid vacation.

 

**Today:**  I now want to pursue a computer science career. I got admitted to Oregon State University’s Post-Bachelors Computer Science degree program. I start in Spring 2019. I do want to go for a masters degree as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, at 28yrs old, my parents are pushing me out of living at home with them. So I need to move as well. I have a couple of options, but am struggling to make a decision and figure out which one will put me on the best path. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $9k saved. I have a separate account of $9k to pay for the majority of my car lease which has two years left on the lease. I have about $5k invested in either stocks or a traditional IRA. I have about $5k in debt that I should be able to have down to $4k or below by the end of Feb. I need to move either in Feb or March of this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan, either way, is to work part-time in the area I move to, and possibly even online while studying. And take out student loans for the rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1:** 

Move to the Sacramento, CA area (which is way cheaper than where I currently live and has family close by). 

&amp;#x200B;

I can take some supplemental community college courses and do the OSU program. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then apply for a computer science masters program at in-state schools (and out-of-state, but due to costs I would prefer to stay in-state for this option). With my main choice being Sacramento State University. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cost of living isn’t too bad for the area. I think that there would be some decent internship availability for the city. And it’s got several good schools in the area that have comp science grad degrees. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pros for this is the area expenses. Car insurance would probably be lower than if I went with option 2. Food prices should be lower as well. Most places in the area I’m looking at don’t charge pet rent, just a deposit. Parking is included and not extra. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2:**

&amp;#x200B;

Move to the Bothell, WA area. The Seattle area is ultimately my dream location to live in, and where I would eventually like to end up anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

The University of Washington Bothell has a graduate certificate program in Computer Science that is designed to prepare students who lack formal computer science training to succeed in their master’s program. It says on their website that 50% of people who do that certificate go on to the Grad program. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that given my background going for the grad certificate would be a good way to get my foot in the door for a masters. They get to know me, and I get to prove I can do the work. I should still have time to apply for Fall 2019 admission, and that program is about 9 months, and I can go for the masters after that. I should have two OSU program courses and two community college courses done by the time I apply for the certificate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pros for this one is I get to be in my ideal location, I kind of feel like I wouldn’t put down roots in Sacramento as my thinking is it would be temporary anyway. But the main concern is the cost of living in the Bothell area. Most places seem to charge for parking and pet rent plus deposit. If I’m in Bothell I would need to keep my car. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 3 (Or the in-between option):**

&amp;#x200B;

Move to Portland, OR. It’s kind of in-between cost of living for Sacramento and Seattle. It’s the Pacific Northwest, which I love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Portland State University has their own post-bachelors program and a grad prep program that I could take to help me get into a masters program. University of Washington Vancouver is also close by. I feel that the internship opportunities are about even with Sacramento, but probably not as good as the Seattle area can offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s sort of the middle ground option for me. Not quite the leap Bothell is, but not the “safe-space” California offers. I get the outdoor playground of the Cascades, but I’ve never had to deal with snow before. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to apply to grad schools in Montana, California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona, and Texas as well. I feel like that way I have a good blanket of schools and would hopefully get into one of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I fucked up with my first degree. That I was too young and had no clue what I wanted to do, but was more or less pressured into it by my parents at the time. It was a great source of pride for their kid to go to a UC. But I didn’t appreciate it, and I was just not ok after the first year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel a great deal of pressure not to fuck this up too. And if I do then I’m going to be screwed with debts. "
ae84i8,1,2019-01-09,Are internships worth it to get a foot in the door for immigration?,I_run_Arch_BTW,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ae84i8/are_internships_worth_it_to_get_a_foot_in_the/,"Hi all. So I'm a South African citizen hoping to immigrate to preferably America or possibly Canada. I'm graduating from a software development school soon called WeThinkCode_ (it's a scholarship program. Based on 42.fr which also has a campus in silicon valley). At this point I need to start looking for an internship and the school has given me some flexibility to find my own internship. I have contacts in South Africa already that I know could almost certainly land me an internship/job. At this point I've got 2 potential career plans:

1. Pursue an internship/job in South Africa, work fur a few years to gain experience and directly start looking for an H1-B at an American company while saving/working here. If I go this route, I plan to do a correspondence course for a degree in CS which should be useful.

2. Pursue an internship at an American company on a J-1 visa, hopefully get a foot in the door/prove my worth to the company I intern at, and turn the internship into an H1-B or even directly into a EB-2 or EB-3. Of course this would involve either a no objection waiver from my government or returning to South Africa for 2 years.

Option 2 is a bit less stable but I suspect an international internship at a bigger company would be better for my CV especially for future job prospects in America. I also have no idea how readily the South African government gives out no objection waivers. 

I have already done an internship at Microsoft South Africa and received a great reference. Not to act cocky but all the people I've interacted with in the industry have been impressed with my knowledge and speed of learning so I do think I could effectively impress if given the opportunity.

Is option 2 viable? Do companies hire directly from internships regularly? Are they more likely to hire a foreigner they already have exposure to and have worked with before?"

ae8x0y,20,2019-01-09,I have 9 months to finish my entire PhD dissertation and I haven't written a thing in 4 years ...yet I am optimistic.,artificial_doctor,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ae8x0y/i_have_9_months_to_finish_my_entire_phd/,"*Fair warning, this is a bit of a story. TL;DR will be at the bottom.*

I'm not really asking anything here, just sharing my tale. I'm going to do my best to finish this PhD but just need to share this story so I can figure out for myself what happened over the past 4 years...

&amp;#x200B;

**It begins...**

My PhD is in History and it has been tumultuous to say the least. After 4 years of Life throwing it's little adventures at me I am now in my final year and have yet to write anything down... Though, I have been doing what research I could and feel that if I just put my ass in my seat and knock it out, I'll get it done in time. \*cautiously optimistic\*

(I base that on my track record of always pulling my work out of the fire at the last second and that I've never failed any course before, and in fact usually have pretty decent marks... but, I've also never had to write 80,000+ words before...)

I started my PhD in 2014 and fully intended to complete it in 3 years. I spent my first year working as a tutor whilst putting together my proposal and, thankfully, it was accepted. My second year didn't start off so well as my funding dried up and I had to get a full-time job to cover this. I though that I would still keep my PhD full-time and just work on it in between work... what a fool I was...

&amp;#x200B;

**The Museum**

The job I managed to get was working at a museum. ""Hooray!"" I thought, ""This will be the perfect opportunity to work in the area I want whilst also completing my studies!"" but the museum didn't want me to work in their social sciences or military history sections, as I had applied for, they wanted me to work in their marketing department as an events manager...

Not a problem, I had marketing and eventing experience from a previous job, this should be fine, a job is a job.

It wasn't fine.

What followed was 2 years of torture. The museum group had 11 museums under its auspice and is government owned and managed. Some would think a cushy government job, right? Unfortunately, far from the truth. Understaffed and overworked with remarkably unhelpful coworkers (barring 3 or 4 who kept me sane during my time there) I was expected to manage the weekly events for 11 different museums and regularly started work at 5am and ended at 1am to cater for events. I was ONE MAN managing all these spaces. My request for extra help or even just to borrow the dept intern to answer some of my emails fell on deaf ears. And my boss was an ageing widower who frequently made me drop everything to accommodate her latest crush who just HAD TO have his party in the gallery but first he wants to walk around the space for three hours umm'ing and aww'ing with me in tow.

Needless to say, there is a lot more to this whole story, but bottom line I was unable to work on my PhD at all, barring ONE research trip to some archives I needed to visit, which cost me 2 weeks of backed up event work... I intended to eventually quit so I could go back to my studies, I just wanted to get 2 years of solid work experience on my CV first.

My academic supervisor was supportive but mostly absent during this whole process apart from the occasional emails and meetings.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Wedding**

Half way through 2016 (1 and a half years into working at the museum) my parent's health took a turn for the worst and that required me to visit when I could to help out.

And then, IT happened.

My sister was getting married, so I took a few days off to attend the wedding, a nice welcomed break from work, and to help the family out with prepping and running everything. I was to do one of the toasts and to help with the catering and other organising.

Well, even though my sister was bridezilla, the wedding went really well and the reception was a blast... up until the marriage ended 4 hours after it had begun.

To this day we're not exactly sure what happened, some kind of massive argument behind closed doors that lead to the marriage being dissolved soon after. To be fair, there had been cracks and warning signs for the duration of the relationship, but we didn't expect it to explode the way it did not even a few hours after the actual ceremony.

So, I had to request an extra few days from work to handle the fallout, and eventually this would lead to me quitting my job at the museum so I could focus on keeping my family together and getting them through this.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rehab**

I spent another month at the museum finishing up a variety of projects before heading overseas to help my family out in the least few months of 2016. My sister had gone catatonic, due to what would later be diagnosed as PTSD from the events at the wedding, and was quite literally killing my folks (who were still suffering from ill health) so I had to take charge. (I should mention that they were overseas as my folks were in the process of immigrating when all this happened so they took my sister for some R&amp;R but couldn't handle her fallout. I had some psychology training so I could help a bit.)

This is called the rehab phase not just because I would spend almost all of 2017 helping my sister and parents recover, but also myself. You see, I had some bad injuries from a car accident back in 2006 in my hip, spine and shoulder that I had done well to recover from over the years, but the sheer stress from the job I had taken had ruined all of that progress.

The sitting at the desk 9+ hours a day, the 2-4 hour daily commute, and the overall stress had caused my body to seize in places and I had gained a ton of weight. All of that just wrecked my health and I spent most of 2017 going to rehab and helping my parents recover from health issues and my sister come out of her shell again.

My academic supervisor was aware of most of this, but for the most part I was a ghost in the department. Three years into the PhD and people at the department had no clue who I was when I would pop by for meetings.

And to top 2017 off, I ended up having to take my brother in for rehab because he had fallen into a bad cocaine habit and had lost his business as a result. My father's health also took a sharp dip and all around it was a very dark time for my family...

&amp;#x200B;

**A New Dawn**

If I sound bitter through any of this, I must admit that I was for a long while. I was very angry and I STILL had not done any real work on my PhD by this point.

Luckily, things began to look up at the start of 2018.

All this while, I had used up most of my meagre savings from my museum job, but luckily I managed to find a semi-decent ESL job which I could do online and from home. I also got a part-time gig submitting articles to a magazine so money wasn't really an issue for a while, but it also meant less time for studies.

I had also managed to get a small bursary grant for my studies which were enough to cover my tuition fees and a research trip (which I took last September and did some magnificent research if I do say so myself!).

My brother got out of rehab in January and the family rallied to get him back on his feet. He had a set back or two, but he's been clean 5 months now.

My sister is out of her shell as well and I got her a job teaching English at the same company I work at, so she's doing much better for herself.

And, I'm happy to say, my parent's health is vastly improved, though they have had to sell their home overseas and move back due to work commitments but at least they have their health!

For my part, I started losing weight (23kgs so far, only 7 away from my ideal weight!) and I'm also back to running and boxing, which I love and haven't done for years.

As for research, last year I managed to do a lot more research than I ever had before, and I made a name for myself in my department (though for work unrelated to my PhD) by being hardworking and dependable. I started spending time in the post-grad room often, making friends and re-introducing myself to the staff there. My supervisor even had me to teach a class of his for a semester (though that ended up taking 2 months of my time as it was a month of teaching and then a month of marking! Sigh...) which turned out to be one of the most popular classes of the year! The students loved it from what they told me, so that made me feel really good.

And to top 2018 off, in a good way, I managed to receive a second iteration of my bursary, so my fees and research trip for 2019 will be covered again.

The documents I found last year will also blow my research wide open, for which I am very excited! Just need the military to declassify some and we're golden.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twenty Nineteen**

And that brings us to now. This year I HAVE to finish my PhD and I have yet to start writing.

I am more than a little nervous, I won't lie, but I also know I'm a prolific writer once I get going and I know this subject well. I have to hand the dissertation in in October and am presenting what I have done so far in a conference in June.

So far, my supervisor has been super supportive but he hasn't seen a single piece of my actual writing, though I have filled him in on what I've uncovered so far. He seems optimistic that my research will be good, but he doesn't know I haven't actually put pen to paper yet... so to speak. But I'll have something good for the conference I'm sure.

(Oh, did I mention my supervisor retired at the start of this year? This is sort of a good thing because it means he'll have more time for me!)

I still have to earn a living, so half my month will be spent teaching ESL so I can have enough money to get by, and the final half will be spent at the dept writing my arse off. I've written out a schedule of what I need to be writing when and how many pages I need to complete per day, week, and month to meet my deadline.

It is going to be brutal, and gruelling, but I think I can do it. I have to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thanks for reading!**

So, yeah, I think I just needed to vent and reading through the threads here, many of you seem very kind and experienced. Not sure if anyone else has ever been in a similar position and managed to pull off any miracles, but if so, I would love to hear about it. Or if anyone has any advice on ways to make my writing go smoother, that will also be appreciated.

I will definitely report back here after all is said and done to put an end, one way or another, to my sordid tale but I think it will be a good ending.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*TL;DR*  
&gt;  
&gt;a variety of things happened over the past 4 years which meant I didn't have any time to do any research or writing. From being overworked at a museum, to my family imploding (including a botched wedding, a sibling in rehab, and the ailing health of myself and my parents), to finding the time between work to write something. Through it all, I'm still optimistic I'll get this done.

However due to the insanely high tuition costs of that path, I’m wanting to focus on a masters in biology. I’m looking into some MA in biology, MS in biomedical science, and MS in bioimaging programs. However, since I’m changing paths a bit I’m worried about my CV and letters of rec. 

The only relevant experience I feel like I have is that I’ve been a research assistant at my school’s COM in a biomedical focus since May. This semester I’m working on a project that may potentially put my name on a paper. 

However, my other experience is shadowing in vet clinics and completing an internship in a zoo/ wildlife sanctuary. In more of an ecology focus, those could be relevant. But I’m not sure if I’d be best going that route or more cell/ molec. 

I am spending a week in Costa Rica doing research for a class over spring break, so I’m not sure if I should mention that either? 

Basically, my question is whether or not these experiences would be relevant to put on a CV and ask for letters of rec from, say my wildlife internship. Thanks for any input!! I’m so lost. "

I am from Southeast Asia and have a CS degree from a reputable university in my country. Even I like coding, the general programmer's salary (\~700$/mo) is extremely low and was not enough for me to take care of my family and run away from poverty. So, I decided to work as an IT consultant at a well-known international company and my works were all about research and presentation.

A year later, I was offered a scholarship to study abroad from the very big local company, but it required me to work first and came with the contract to work for 6 years after graduation. At that time, I was stupid enough to be happy and accept the offer. I was asked to work as an analyst and ended up being a jack of all trade in a small IT team. I never got formal training. I have a psychopath boss (who is the CIO righthand man) who was a narcissist and treated his subordinates like slaves. My works were all about developing software specs, managing team and projects, and developing C-level presentations.

Two years after, I lost my patience and decided to reject the scholarship. I used all my saving and took a loan to come to the US to study. I study 1-year master’s program in Information systems as it is much cheaper than Computer science degree. With hopes that I can get SDE job in the US and somehow have my new life.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I realized that perhaps I made the wrong decision. Even I am comfortable with LeetCode (I cannot crack all problems, but I am happy by just trying to solve and learn new algorithm), I don’t have SDE working experience. In recruiter points of view, I have no idea why the recruiters will select me for the interview instead of fresh CS students who have intern experiences with great companies. I have applied for more than 150+ companies now and I only heard back only 3.

&amp;#x200B;

Fornunately, there will be many big SDE career fairs upcoming. Perhaps it is the best chance to get the interview. However, I still have no idea how to impress the recruiter and make myself stand out. Should I make up the story or just tell the truth? I would like to ask for help and what should I do to impress employers. Thank you very much in advance"

I was recently offered a job as an Embedded Software Engineer at a company that's located about 3hrs from my current location.  I have since accepted the offer and I am now going through all the paper work.  

However my current job seems to have interest in me for a very similar role.  Some background, I am currently not an engineer at this current company I am in a completely different department.  I have been in contact with the engineering directors about potential intern or shadow opportunities and they wanted to talk to me sometime next week about that.  Also I have only worked at this company for 3 months or so.

The main problem I have with company A (the offer company) is that it is located so far away.  And company B (the one I work at currently) is right here and I don't have to move for it.

I would much rather work for my current company it's location is far superior and the stress of moving is eliminated.  I am wondering if I can still use the offer at company A as leverage even though I already accepted the job and talked to my current boss about a two week notice.  I should also bring up that one of the directors of engineering approached a co-worker of mine on this and asked if there was anything they (company B) could do to get me to stay, and my coworker told them that I seemed pretty committed already which put words in my mouth."

aebrb7,2,2019-01-09,I was a “gifted” student who was #1 academically in everything and involved in all sorts of leadership organizations. Now I barely passed college and am a failing balding 20-something wannabe sports announcer deadbeat addicted to weed.,rjfromoverthehedge,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/aebrb7/i_was_a_gifted_student_who_was_1_academically_in/,"I realized my mom seems to be slightly on the spectrum, which my dad must have realized at some point too, because he cheated on her when I was a kid, but then they lied about it until I caught him attempting (not subtly at all) to cheat again, so my mom admitted the first time had happened. But even after they they are still together (I think because my mom knows she would have nothing left without my dad, she has no social skills and very few friends) and my little brother still doesn’t know any of that.

So my neurotypical father and on the spectrum mother also happened to raise us to be outcasts, to march to the best of your own drum, and to explore all your curiosities, fascinations and obsessions to the fullest.

This was a great environment to grow up in as a kid, like a dreamland daycare center, and I was confident and nice and loving, I was a star student early in school and I tried a variety of instruments, represented my elementary school in competitions, played sports, got along with everyone, was a leader in school and selected to play prominent roles representing my class at our many patriotic plays that we would put on for parents in elementary school. This was because both of my outstanding character, and my lack of fear of being in the spotlight, almost craving the spotlight.

The culmination of this was when I was 9 years old. My nickname in baseball was “Mr Mayor” for my diplomatic, glue-like presence. So I was selected by my school and my classmates to play George W Bush in our school’s enactment of inauguration week. I had a “first lady” a beautiful girl in my class and “secret service agents” several other male classmates dressed like secret service; them and I got to skip classes all week to attend events such as a “parade” down the hallway lined with kindergarteners, an “inaugural luncheon” with first graders”, or an “inaugural ball” with second graders in the gym which had been transformed into a function hall, where my “first lady” and I were made to square dance for several local newspaper reporters and pose for ceremonial pictures. 

But the other part about my parents that I didn’t mention is that they saw this potential early on and tried to help me develop talents, figuring I could hopefully master on of them and use the rest of my intelligence to fulfil my potential and become a star in my field.

They did this using the methods prescribed by Tiger Woods’ dad. At first they literally tried to raise me to be tiger woods, as they are both golfers, and so they would bring me to the golf course and have me watch golf on tv, making tiger woods my idol. And I do love golf, I love golf courses, I love the history of golf and I want to broadcast golf. But at the same time despite expressing interest in becoming a professional golfer, I absolutely hated practicing, and had a horrible temperament on the course for a drawn out game like golf (my emotions tend to ride or die on every single shot, which means my momentum can be halted quickly). This makes me perfect for golf broadcasting, as I can inject much needed drama in a mostly lifeless tv event (except when tiger’s playing). 

And that’s where we move the story along because it was clearly not going to be golf, and it wasn’t looking like it was going to be piano either, as I began to struggle because I didn’t want to practice. So at age 9, the quest to make me a prodigy at traditional things seemed to have failed because of my lack of commitment, but at the same time I was having my personal peak with the “Presidential inauguration” week and completing the sweep of finishing first in my class every year of elementary school. So the idea that I could be generationally great at anything I wanted to was still there, I was showing tons of potential, it just wasn’t likely to be in a traditional child prodigy field like golf or piano.

But what I was realizing at this time was that I loved television. I watched the tv coverage of 9/11 as an elementary school student in awe, having just been to New York and learned about manhattan and the street grid and stuff and specifically asked my dad when we were at Ellis island looking back “what are those two huge buildings sticking up that don’t match the others? Why does only one of them have a smokestack (The iconic red and white twin towers antenna of course)?”

After this I began watching Peter Jennings every day on the news, and I began watching golf instead of practicing golf. I started paying closer attention to the broadcasting as I got into baseball and football. By the time of the “presidential inauguration” I had recorded myself announcing for the first time a few months earlier during Super Bowl 39, the first Pats-Eagles Super Bowl after the 2004 season in February 2005. 

After then “inauguration” elementary school was over.  I began mock announcing hundreds of sporting events a year at home, while at school I started realizing that being super diplomatic was not going to fly anymore and that my old nerdy friends were not going to help my get girls. So with my mind now set that my future was secure as a sports announcing prodigy, I set about trying to make myself popular. A growing problem was my mom because she was not letting me grow up and being overprotective, so I began to associate her nice diplomatic ways that she taught me with childlike naïvity, and I sought to counter that by becoming popular by denouncing my old friends and making overtures to a group of potential new friends by first trying to impress them by being “funny” (doing all sorts of weird crazy shit that was not funny), or being “evil” (mock-support for bad guys in any situation) which I saw as a counter to my mom’s influence.

I started a “coolest kid in school” ranking which of course I modestly put myself as tied 2nd, with two of the kids I was trying to become friends with tied for 1st and another one of them tied with me for 2nd.

The result was a disaster, as I basically was so oblivious that I let myself get played for a year before one of those kids let me down easy early the next year by telling me “hey we let you have fun with this last year but you need to leave us alone now, it’s not funny anymore”. So I first did the same cycle on a new group of kids that year, before they just ignored me enough that I cut my losses following a year. I also started realizing that the rest of my family besides my immediate is rich and began to notice little slights against my family by my cousins parents.

After that I tried to run back to my old friends but they wanted no part of it, plus I now had a reputation as a weirdo creep because of the things I had done the prior two years. 

There were only two of my old friends on my bus that would still talk to me, so I formed this gigantic mental crutch complex, a TV network named after myself, that in my imagination replaced Fox and had all its sports rights. I replaced all the daytime programming with “headcam” footage of my various life events. The two or three kids on my bus still nice enough to still talk to me humor my TV network by participating in “shows” at recess and on the bus. I would spend hours a day taking Fox Sports graphics and modifying them to have our names and my network logos, also taking the opportunity to “fix” anything I didn’t like about fox’s graphics package at the given time. I talked about going to Syracuse university and following in the footsteps of bob Costas or mike Tirico or Marv Albert. 

However this sports announcer/tv producer thing was becoming more and more of a mental crutch than an actual realistic career goal. I was something to hold me mentally together while I tried to rebuild my ruined personal life. After three years of the TV network thing, a tumultuous 5 years of middle school were over. When I walked in I was an A+ student who had loving friends, family, and a bright future as maybe a politician or a tv news anchor. When I walked out I was a C student with virtually no friends, an intentional Truman show complex to keep me sane, and a pipe dream to get into Syracuse university (top sports announcer school) which I couldn’t afford to go to. 

So I left the public schools to go to private catholic school and a fresh start. In the first months of high school I suffered another setback when I caught my dad trying to cheat again as I previously mentioned.

My only mission in high school was to first make sure I was the announcer, then to make friends. I did bit of those things quickly, so all of a sudden my personal life was back in order. I was back babyI started focusing on trying to get into Syracuse but my grades weren’t quite enough to get a scholarship. So I went to umass, a large rung down for sure in the sports world, and a not even on the map in the world of sports announcing.

So I was going to the zoo zoomass, woo! I started smoking weed and partying with my high school friends. Suddenly my personality completely changed. It was as if I had “woken up” from a deep sleep of aspbergers. Suddenly everything that had happened I could see from the point of view of a neurotypical person, as if the weed cured me of delusions. I could relate to people, whereas previously in high school I had been a happy tagalong. Now I could only feel my aspy level emotions when smoking weed, I feel neurotypical emotions otherwise unless it’s the morning right after I’ve smoked weed when my head is in a fog.


I was emerging socially as my own person with a real personality but the problem was that this personality began to hate and despise the aspy personality, and therefore forces like my mom and my family. Because being born to a family of outcasts and raised to be different, then having that family turn out to be fake, while my mom’s emotional, on/the-spectrum-level love for me makes my childhood spy personality burst out into tears thinking about how much I love my mom yet also thinking about how much my neurotypical personality despises and somewhat rudely tries to correct and fix my moms aspy sayings or behaviors. 

So I can only “feed” the aspy side of my personality by smoking weed, it’s the only way to feel my old emotions while indulging some of my aspy passions. At the same time, once I switch into that mode it’s very difficult to switch out. So over the last 5 years I’ve skipped work, school, family events, to get high, but then I feel like I’m letting my family down so I don’t even get the fulfillment of my aspy emotions for the day. As I have to fulfill my aspy emotions for about 4 hours a day, this leads me to continue trying by smoking more and more weed. So I wake up the next day in an aspy state which makes me unable to change into my neurotypical personality at work or school as I would automatically if I was sober, severely hurting my ability to network. At school I just didn’t show up for stuff even was the director of sports radio, something I’ve done a couple times at my real job but I don’t want to be fired so I’m careful. But this is some shitty temp job, I want to be a sports announcer but it’s all about connections and at school and at all my internships I was universally hated because I would never travel on team busses, when I had to use them I would be late, my conspiratorial and gallows sense of humor about everything, and my attitude that announcing is performance art like a pianist or a ballet dancer, and my tendency to relate everything to pro sports or politics. Like many artists and performers I can’t wait to drop the facade and get back to my introverted interests and my weed once the performance is over, after I have reviewed my own perforce of course. It’s about hitting all the cadences, making sure your calls are smooth, using creative transitions, not being repetitive, being self deprecating on the air, etc. My attention to all of these things is why I kept getting positions, I am great at the job. But two the other two kinds of people in the field are either stat geeks or ex athletes. The geeks are obsessed with the game and broadcast, the ex athletes are obsessed with music and girls and going out, meanwhile I’m interested in discussing how to exploit drama within the team to increase viewership (since I believe conflict and drama is what draws interest), professing my love for diva athletes and who have exploited the public love for drama to make money, planning future potential political endeavors by discussing ways to use the public’s own emotions to divide and conquer their loyalties, or simply talking about an imaginary future in which our whole broadcast and production team is working for like Fox or something.

So basically I’m scared to get an announcing job because my childhood personality is aspy and it’s so sad that my new personality knows too much about my old one and hates it and my family. This creates a feeling of self hatred and internal deadness that makes me not want to try hard and smoke weed all day to try and feel like it’s 2008 again. And then on top of being essentially a dead person who died 5 years ago in high school, my new personality *still* doesn’t even solve the problem of not being relatable, it did in high school but now it seems to clash with the personalities of other announcers as I just mentioned above. So what should I do? Should I got into politics and cut ties with something with so much personal baggage for me like sports announcing? Or no because my aspy personality is the better and more moral person and the real way to honor my mom would be to fulfill my dream of being a famous sports announcer and my mom’s dream of having me be a passionate and successful person (I used to call announcing my “passion”)? But politics, despite being dirty and ugly, would fulfill my goal of being able to have a voice in the media, and my parents other goal of me being remembered in history. Also my hairs now receding in my mid-20s so that’s another blow for sports announcer. So there’s a lot to consider. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Im now trying on a different field, Programing,  but im starting from scratch since i have no experience on that field whatsoever and dont want to make the same mistake i made with architecture, I would like to start working even for a shitty salary as long as i can get experience and learn more about it. Recently starting a class of introduccion into that and been doing Code Academy and some apps on the phone with the same purpuse.

I'm here just looking for some guidence or a piece of advice on how to start or what to do because i live in a 3rd world country (Dominican Republic) so its not like there's a lot of options for big companies to take me in as intern or something like that.

aebw8s,13,2019-01-09,Dreading my return to college,bloom-ing,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/aebw8s/dreading_my_return_to_college/,"	I am currently a college freshman at a university that I hate. Long story short, I was rejected from my first choice school and wasn’t very happy with any of my backup choices. I ended up committing to a university across the country because I was dissatisfied with where I was in life and thought a new city could be the change in pace I needed. Unfortunately, my first semester at this school was not great. I had a lot of problems with my roommate which inevitably led me to switching dorms. Although moving out has put me in a much healthier environment, many of the friendships I was beginning to form were with people in my old suite, so moving out basically ended those friendships and quickly isolated me. The new suite I am in is a lot less social than my old one, so I have really only developed an acquaintanceship with my new roommate. I am a very shy person so I have a hard time reaching out and making friends in my classes. I joined some clubs in order to meet new people but meetings are constantly cancelled so I haven’t been able to form any friendships within them. On top of this social dilemma, I’ve began to hate the major I am studying. While applying to college, I was not 100% positive of the career path I wanted to pursue, but decided to apply for a generic major that would direct me to a stable career field later on in life. Although this major did not make me feel excited, it felt the most right at the time. After taking a major oriented class, doing an internship in that work field, and interviewing people who work within the area of study, I have concluded that this major is definitely not right for me. Before anyone says to simply just change majors, the college I attend is an incredibly small liberal arts school that does not offer many diverse major choices. I have recently sparked interest in one particular field of study that is not offered at my current school, meaning that I would have to transfer universities in order to study what I want to. Although transferring is a scary and serious decision to make, the idea of being at a different school makes me want to cry with joy. I have really struggled being away from my family and boyfriend, especially given my displeasure with my social and academic life at my college—I’m just really tired of being alone. After meeting with multiple different academic advising and career development counselors, my parents and I have decided that the best option for me would be to transfer to a university closer to home that has a much broader selection of major/minors. While this may sound like I have figured everything out and am working to put myself on a better path in life, I still have one major issue: surviving my last semester at my current university. 

	I unfortunately didn’t decide to transfer until after applications for the Spring 2019 school year we’re past due, meaning that I have to stay enrolled at my current college for the spring semester. Since I am depressed about the idea of returning to my college for the spring, some of my friends and family suggested I take the semester off or attend a local community college instead. Taking a semester off is definitely not an option for me because I am trying to graduate early (for personal reasons) and cannot be delayed. While I could go to community college for the spring, I am afraid that it would hurt my chances of getting into some of the colleges I’m applying to transfer to since they are fairly competitive. My parents, counselors, and I thoroughly analyzed my options and we have concluded that I really need to just stick out this spring semester. But as the end of my winter break is drawing near, I have turned into a complete mess because the idea of returning to this school is devastating to me.

	I am reaching out for some advice on how to survive the next 5 months of my life in an environment that fuels my depression. I do have plans to try and make more friends and whatever, but I am really seeking lifestyle advice on how to get through day-to-day. Everyone in my life has told me that I just have to wait it out, but there has to be more that I can do to improve my circumstances. To anyone who has been in a similar situation, what did you do? What worked? I have 3 days left before I return to college and have fallen into a slump where I am unable to leave my bed and stop worrying about my this next semester. Any and all advice will be sincerely appreciated. Thank you."

aebwsq,13,2019-01-09,I might be getting kicked out of pharmacy school for something that's beyond my control.,a7hr0w4w4y,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aebwsq/i_might_be_getting_kicked_out_of_pharmacy_school/,"I went through my first severe depressive episode when I was a sophomore in college at 19. Over the course of a year, I stopped showing up to work or classes, most of which I ended up either failing or withdrawing from. I lost all of my scholarships. I finally (voluntarily) sought help from therapists/psychiatrists after an unsuccessful suicide attempt.

My GPA had gone to shit, and I had to work very hard to get it back up to a 3.0 by the time I graduated. I applied and interviewed at a couple of pharmacy schools. I was accepted to one right away, but it was more expensive and further away from home. After my interview at the other, I was asked to meet with one of the deans.

The dean wanted to give me a chance to explain myself. She noted that my interviewers loved me and I had glowing letters of recommendation, but she was very concerned by the year in which I nearly failed out of college. I decided to be open and honest with her about what happened. She explained to me that I would be accepted to the school on one condition. Our state has an organization that deals with mentally ill/drug addicted professionals by monitoring them for a number of years to make sure that they are taking their medications/staying clean. She said that in order to receive my pharmacy intern license, the state’s board of pharmacy would likely make me do this anyway no matter what school I went to (I later found this to be false, as the license application only asks if you have been involuntarily committed). She required me to self-report to this organization and follow through with whatever contract they made me sign.

My first semester of pharmacy school went great. I ended with a nearly perfect GPA and I was very active in student organizations. However, there was an issue with the board of pharmacy. We are required to have our pharmacist intern license by the end of our first semester so that we can start our rotations in the next one. They put a hold on issuing my license, and their website stated that I needed to submit a document explaining my health history. I got one from my psychiatrist and gave it to them in mid-October. I was told it would take up to a month to process.

The 30 days passed, and nothing happened. I started calling the board, but they never picked up their phone. I kept calling more and more until I was leaving voicemails multiple times a day. Finally, in mid-December, someone told me that even though the website said they needed a health history document, what they actually needed was a copy of the contract I had signed with the outside organization. I had this sent to them immediately. I called to ask how long it would take and was given no straight answer when I finally got through to someone again. I have yet to hear back from them.

I started my second semester last week. Two days ago, I was e-mailed saying I needed to meet with the administration immediately after class. I was told that I should not have been allowed to even start this semester. They said that one of two things would happen; either I don’t start my rotations until I get my license and have to make up the missed hours over the summer, or I will be removed from classes entirely for a year. I explained to the administrator as best as I could that I had done everything in my power to get my license, and he seemed to empathize with me, but told me that all he could do was relay that to the deans and they would decide which option I would be given. He told me they were meeting yesterday to discuss it, and I have not been contacted by them again since.

I feel completely and utterly defeated. I worked so hard to get my shit together after starting therapy, and just when I thought I had worked things out something new popped up to completely fuck me over. I am employed by the university, and my therapist/psychiatrist are part of Student Health Services. If I am kicked out, I will also lose both my job and my access to mental healthcare. I’m not even sure what will happen with my student loans as far as whether or not I’ll have to start making payments on them. Looking at it from here, I don’t see any way out if I get booted from school; it would literally be signing my death warrant. Every time my phone vibrates I freak the fuck out because I’m worried it’s an e-mail or phone call telling me that I’m being dismissed. I don’t know what the fuck to do."

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to enter the cyber security field but I am a little baffled at the qualifications and experience needed to fill a entry-level / junior role. I will admit that I do not have a lot of credentials or experience to my name but it makes me a bit discouraged to see what shoes I have to fill to even apply. Here's some background info:

*  I'm currently in school for Cyber security (when I say currently I mean starting general education classes Jan 14 - lame)
* Worked as a PC Technician for 6 months
* Currently working on a Help Desk for about 7 months (Sony and Allegis)
* Did an internship in a SOC at Exelon
* Was part of a cybersecurity program which required me to do six months of college classes in cyber and the 6 month internship at Exelon
* Currently studying for my Security+ (as a start)
* Has a security clearance (from my time in the marine corps but that expires 11/17/19 so time is of the essence if I wanna keep it)

I know that this are not a lot for me to go off of nor is it the best foundation for my future career; however, what I don't know is what else do I need to know? What do I have to do to get myself into an entry level role so I can expand from there. And for anyone asking why I want to land a role with such minimal skills, I want to put myself in a better position in life as well as I learn better by doing so being in the role would be better for me to be honest.

aeca5u,2,2019-01-09,Senior Project,throwaway4014011848,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aeca5u/senior_project/,"Hi hope everyone is doing all well and good today; I’m in this predicament where at the moment I am completing my undergraduate senior thesis project. The project is supposed to be a capstone of my Computer Science degree. 

Well I decided to choose a project which I applied for against others in a prominent tech city. I choose the project because the description described “ai/ml” related research at company. I had many options of other projects to choose from but because of the description and location I chose this one. There were many cons associated with this decision, some being; requiring to pay ~15k in tuition, work in the summer and save 3k to pay for food and airfare for the project, give up my opportunity to take graduate courses related to the grad degree I plan on obtaining next year. 

We were told we were continuing last years project, thus this past semester we’ve been doing research and writing a report to the solve the solution. 

Long story short we go to the company the other day and they were not prepared for us. They restructured the company and many engineers who were supposed to manage us, quit before we came. The manager asked an employee to come up with a project off the top of their head. As our senior project we are creating a dashboard.  Everything we did was thrown out the window and they basically gave us this freshman intern work. 

All of my team members are pissed because we had to make certain decisions and sacrifices in order to come here and work. My question is how would you go about this situation if you were in our shoes? This clearly isn’t the employees fault as it looks like they are quite busy and work in a department very different then our work. I just don’t know I’m going to continue googling good UI designs for a dashboard this next semester with the ambition that is required; as I watch my bank account and pocket enjoy for living costs and tuition.

aed4yj,2,2019-01-09,What's wrong with my common app essay?,Hironenjarkpress,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aed4yj/whats_wrong_with_my_common_app_essay/,"Hey r/a2c,

I finished the last of my apps last week, but I'm still super anxious about them. Yesterday, I asked my teachers and counselor to read over my essays hoping that they could make me feel more hopeful, but instead they basically told me my essays sucked. I realize that my essay might not be perfect, but it kinda hurt a still, so I was hoping you guys could help me break it down and understand why it's so bad.

I'm not including my whole essay, obviously, because that would have too much personal detail (and would break the rules), but here are the major paragraphs of my personal statement. I chose prompt 2 (the one about learning from obstacles and explaining what I learned from it).

(The context is that I play for my school's golf team and a I sprained it really badly sophomore year.)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It was a calm Saturday afternoon. The sun was shining bright but then suddenly a sudden yelp erupted among the peace of the lush, green park I was in. It wasn’t the wild crows which loitered my second home that was the golf course… it was me.

So for my intro paragraph, I heard that it's good to use a lot of detail so I tried to use a lot of imagery and suspense to create a literary ""hook.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I stared at my wrist in pain and disbelief. It was contorted and bent in many different ways. My wrist was sprained.  
&gt;  
&gt;Any elite golf player will tell you, the wrist is possibly the most important part of the body, even more important than the heart!). Without the wrist, you wouldn’t be able to achieve those precise and focused flicks into the hole, like I so often did even under the pressures of competition.

I really like the last sentence because I think it subtly establishes my cool, calm, and collected personality. I tried using parenthetical commentary to make the story more relatable, like a stream of consciousness, you know? I used more parenthesis later in the essay, too.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But this time, it was different. I did not keep my cool. I was absolutely devastated .  
&gt;  
&gt;“Three months...” my doctor said staring intently at my x-rays.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Three months?!” I responded, shocked. This was much longer than the few days the internet had promised to me in my research beforehand.

I though the last sentence is a really good ""show don't tell"" of how much much initiative and curiosity I have by researching things before hand.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*This is going to be hard*, I told myself. Three months was basically my entire season! But I told myself that I couldn’t just let this setback keep me complacent and unproductive. Using the intense and thorough research skills I had developed interning for my parents’ law firm, I decided to go back to the internet and scour all the articles and papers it had all about wrist sprain.

I think I incorporated my major EC really well into the story. I heard that it's kind of a big deal to have an internship in high school, so I think that's a big plus.

&amp;#x200B;

The next couple paragraphs are about me committing to what I learned through my research (R.I.C.E) and sticking with it (showing my dedication and perseverance)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In just two and a half months, I recovered and was back in the game. During my recovery, I learned a new kind of patience that I even brought with me into the green. With patience, I was an even better athlete than before. With patience I was able to think my every move carefully in order to achieve the perfect swing. By the end of my sophomore season, my epic recovery was so impressive that my coach even decided to make me to team captain.

The 'overcoming obstacles' part.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But beyond my personal growth, I learned an even more valuable thing: inspiration. Becoming the inspiring team captain who recovered epicly from an injury made me realize how much I love to inspire. I wanted to inspire not just my teammates, but also the whole school. So the next year, I joined my school’s freshman transition club. Being a Link Crew leader to a group of freshman was very hard at first because of the generational gap that hindered my ability to understand and communicate with them (sometimes they'd do a lot of cringy stuff). But my passion for inspiration outweighed all my prejudice against them. When I learned to stoop to their intellectual level and communicate to them that way, I became an even greater Link Crew leader to them because I was more able to help them out.

I tried showing how what I learned is really important to me in the long term beyond just sports and in how I get along with my peers, ie I am a more kind and compassionate person now.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/88h1ti/chance_me_for_uc_berkeley_ucla_usc_stanford/) are my stats from a chance me post I did junior year.

(Don't worry, I didn't end up applying to all 10 of those schools. You guys made it clear that I kinda had no chance, but I couldn't resist lol. It's worth a shot you know? In terms of T20s, I only applied to UC Berkeley, UCLA, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, and University of Pennsylvania.)

Based on my essays, am I screwed?"

aedslp,4,2019-01-09,Is either help desk and/or computer repair tech type work essentially a necessary start for all IT careers?,overling,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/aedslp/is_either_help_desk_andor_computer_repair_tech/,"Oh and say you didn't go to school for this field but are transferring into the industry from something else, so internships are kind of off limits (especially if you're older and not a student somewhere). I've heard internships can be a useful foot in the door that avoids some of the rougher entry level starting points.

Say if you wanted to get into networking or even higher up concepts eventually, have relevant certs in that, like CCNA, but without experience. Is it still very important to be doing work that essentially is a computer repair tech at some store? Do most people pass through this phase at some point? I got an A+ simply by looking at online videos and I've upgraded and played around with my desktop and laptops a bit in the past, but was never all that involved in just pure hardware. I've never built a machine from scratch or anything and I can't just recommend parts for whatever issue someone has right off the bat easily. My knowledge in this domain is mostly theoretical though I could get by if I needed, given enough time.

I've had some interviews for hardware based jobs but I don't end passing them since I'm just not as confident (esp messing with other people's machines) or really even interested in this stuff much. But I have learned something from each experience and get better with each one. I just wonder if it's the right path, and if it will even help to spring up to something else that I want; I'm afraid I might get stuck as some lowly technician like on the Geek Squad or something, without other transferable IT skills.

The other route being a mostly phone based help desk job which I heard could be a nightmare depending on where it is. I'm not the best person when it comes to talking on the phone, and I hear its super stressful (I've already started getting grey hair and losing it, and am taking counseling in anxiety). I definitely know I get frustrated at most customer service techs and I don't want to be on the other side of that lol. Is this really necessary as ""entry level experience"" or is there a way to get around it to what you really want to do?

The way I understand it you pretty much have to do these things as an entryway into IT if you didn't get formal schooling in it, or if you're not going into something like programming/coding/app development, which is not my thing."

FYI my major in school isn't CS, so I definitely had difficulty in my initial interviews as my DS/A skills are definitely weaker than those of my CS major peers. My GPA isn't that high either, so I was definitely stressing nonstop.

Got rejected from endless startups and other companies but kept my mental and persisted through an interview cycle at a Big N to be greeted with news that they'd extend me an offer today :)

For those of you still struggling to find employment in this competitive field, it's not over lol. Never think it's over. I thought it was over in October as all of my friends were accepting prestigious internship and full-time offers. Just believe in yourself and don't listen to people who say you'll fail. If you fuck up an interview, take the time to learn what you could have done better and reflect on what you can improve upon. I failed 5 interviews at the 2nd/final rounds before this offer lol. My mental was in the dumps, but I watched endless motivational videos on Instagram, read a bunch of motivational posts on this sub, and stayed on the Leetcode grind (lol cheesy ik) to keep me going. Even if you fuck up, it's never too late to break into this field. Stay on the grind. A lot of the advice/interview tips on this sub have been very helpful, but don't dwell on what's out of your control (post-interview decision). Keep focusing on improvement!

**EDIT:** To prepare for this interview and other tech interviews, I mainly used these resources:

1. Steven S. Skiena's *Algorithm Design Manual*
2. Gayle Laakmann McDowell's *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition*
3. Leetcode

Out of these 3, I would definitely say CTCI and Leetcode are the most important. However, if you feel that your CS background in Data Structures/Algorithms isn't that strong (like I did), I highly highly recommend reading Skiena's *Algorithm Design Manual*. It is a brilliantly written text that gives a high level overview of a lot of important problems in CS and important problem solving concepts and approaches. It really makes you think about how you approach a problem, the importance of stating and clarifying assumptions, and it gives you an arsenal of tools so that you can approach almost any major problem in CS and know what to do with it. It makes you realize the importance of graph and tree problems as well, which came up in around 40% of my interviews. Don't skip the first few War Stories either! They are pretty interesting and give you a good example of how to apply CS to real-world problems. They introduce some pretty common CS problems as well (finding power set, subset sum problem, edit distance problem, etc.)

For practicing questions, do questions in every chapter of CTCI if you have the time, but if you don't have time, then do the questions in the first few chapters (Arrays, Strings, Stacks/Queues, Trees, and DP/Recursion). If you don't have time for even this, then just do Arrays, Strings, and Trees (The problems in the Trees/Graphs chapter are essential and pulled me through the final interviews for this company). Then, spend a lot of time struggling on the questions in the Medium and Hard sections in the back of the book. These questions are very popular and most of them have been ripped to Leetcode as well LOL. Big N will ask a variant of these questions for at least 1-2 of your interviews. I alternated between CTCI and Leetcode on different days based on how I was feeling, but generally started to do more Leetcode closer to the interview date and when I believed my fundamentals were strong enough. Leetcode has all Big N questions sorted by company if you get a premium subscription (which I did, and is very worth). From memory, at least 5 Leetcode questions and their variants have shown up in my interviews. You can sort by question type too (Strings, Arrays, Trees/Graphs, Recursion, DP, Backtracking, etc.), so I think Leetcode is an immensely valuable resource.

Do the top 50 or so questions for the company you are trying to go for and make sure you know the answers well. Focus on medium mostly once you're decent at coming up with easy level solutions in less than 15 mins but make sure to squeeze in the popular hard ones as well (LRU Cache, Serialize Binary Tree, etc.). Know BFS/DFS by heart. Keep doing the popular questions that you've seen before as this pays off a lot in recognizing similar questions in interviews."

&amp;#x200B;

\[Background\]

For some background, I am a 22 year old (male, idk if that matters) studying physics in college at the moment. About 2 years ago I went into a downward spiral and about a year ago I started to get very depressed (not diagnosed). This was caused by myself. What I tend to do is get involved in something and over do it and that ruins the balance in my life. This has happened before in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

This last time I transferred into a new college my sophomore year, I did one semester and got a 3.8 GPA. Knowing that I did well, the next semester I delved into multiple student organizations. My GPA took a hit but I passed all my classes. The start of my Junior year, I did extremely well connecting with people and doing great things for an organization I had created but then failed my classes. The second semester, being scared that I would be kicked out of my orgs due to my GPA, I quit all of them. I felt ashamed to show my face on campus even though no one knew why or what I was going through. Senior year first semester, I could not get out of bed most days and I went to one org meeting a week because of the interesting topics being spoken about. Finally I failed my classes this last semester and have an abysmal GPA. It will likely take more than a semester for me to graduate.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am heading into the second semester of my senior year. Over the break, I started exercising and gave myself one goal: get back into shape. I am well on my way on that journey. I hope to carry this momentum to this next semester with academics. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[Advice Part\]

I love physics but do not want to pursue it as a profession. I have learned through an internship this last summer and my involvement in the student orgs that I love dealing with people but I also love technical things specifically programming (I had a programming internship.). I have had the start up mentality (a few good ideas) but I quite often dismiss that due to my lack of contacts with angel investors and my non expertise in programming. 

What do I do to find out what my career should be?  (get with orgs? get an internship? etc)

How do I develop my skills to get back on track professionally?  (get a certificate for coding or public speaking? etc)

My question is, does anyone have experience with getting a CS based internship as a junior in high school?

I was trying to fully commit to my digital media major after a year of teetering between that major and computer science. [pursuing UX design as a career]. I dropped the two CS classes I took last semester (last semester I took a mixture of comp sci and media classes). Because I didn't take enough media classes, I don't meet the prereqs for many of the classes I want to take this spring. My advisor said I can take the 2 CS classes (programming 2, discrete structures) as they would count as substitutes/ electives for my Digital media degree. Otherwise, I am out of major-specific courses to take. 

So basically I'm in a corner where I have to take CS classes regardless. The same classes I was avoiding by committing to the media major. In that case, it would make sense to just be a comp sci major. 

I'm worried I will burn out and mess up my GPA if I take the comp sci classes. I literally stopped doing the programming assignments and dropped the classes previously; it was too overwhelming. I don't have any drops left.

Would it be smarter to just take a break and come back in Fall when more classes are available? 

Also, I have an internship in summer. Would taking the semester off before I start jeopardize my internship?

I was going to call a hotline but I was afraid of my tracphone minutes depleting and my family hearing me, and that I was going to call the wrong place.

I've always kept my feelings to myself, because my dad would criticize me if I acted in a negative way. He would tell me I have an aura of negativity and that it ruins his day. I make jokes and make people laugh and they think I'm fine but I'm not fine. I'm lonely and worried about my future and my past. There are some simple mistakes that I worry about for months.

I tried to talk to about my dad about my mental health, but then he made it about himself and said he didn't want to pay for therapy and that my anxiety will go away if I get a girlfriend. I obsess over every mistake I make and beat myself up all the time. I'm going to get therapy at college and instead of an intern psychologist and going to get an actual professional therapist to help me. I beat myself up for wasting my time with an intern because I just told her stuff and it didn't help me that much.

I had an experience that I felt that I needed to share with you. I interviewed with a company that had so many red flags that I almost had to stand in awe after the interview.

The company is a storage service company in my local area that provides software to customers that let's them store there data ""securely."" More about that later.

I showed up to the interview about 10 minutes early, ready to go. I walk in, shake some hands and the receptionist walks me to the back. On my way, I scope out the company and can note that it has around 40-50 people in it. It's not huge, but respectable.

There's only one problem though, and this is where I notice red flag number one. There was not a single person in the office that appeared under the age of 50. I'm not an ageist person, but the fact that there isn't even one young person in a software company raises some concerns, mainly because I am 23. I felt very out of place. Either way, I figured it wasn't a big deal and the receptionist led me to an office in the back.

I was introduced to the president of the company who was sitting at his desk, and the manager that I would be working under walks in shortly. They both seem to be friendly enough, and we continue with the interview.

They start asking me basic support questions, and explain to me what the company is about, etc. The second red flag I ran into was continuous throughout the interview. They told me that they were impressed by my answers, but they were disappointed that my answers weren't specific enough to their company. They were generally belligerent, cocky, and acted like they knew everything there was to know about IT. How I was supposed to understand the company's infrastructure without working there is beyond me.

Continuing on, the president received a skype message on his laptop which was closed, and opened it in order to view it. I then proceeded to gaze upon the the desktop background of Windows Vista. I am not particularly averse to Vista, but seeing it in a software company on the President's machine tells me that they are unwilling to progress in their technologies. Red flag number three.

After the president read his message he continued to explain to me what the company is about. The fourth red flag comes from him explaining that he is the SOLE DEVELOPER of the company's software. This instantly made me wonder what the other 40 IT workers are doing here. For a company this small, having 40 support staff for one piece of software is concerning to say the least. Alongside this, he demonstrated the software, and I shit you not it looked like a Visual Basic WinForm app from the early 2000's.

After a bit more discussion I asked them what their server infrastructure is like. They say that they are a Windows shop, and I ask what versions of Windows Server they have running. The president replied verbatim, ""The newest OS we have in this company is Server 2008, and we are going to keep it that way."" Red flag number five. 

Now I explain my two years of internship experience and how I have an interest in automation with Python and other scripting languages. After this, they changed their demeanor and were praising me immensely. They acted as if Python was godlike and that they've wanted to learn it for years. That being said, I love Python and it's an incredibly powerful language, but teachsrs also teach Python to middle schoolers as a beginner language and honestly any IT worker could pick up at least the basics in a few weeks. Red flag number six. 

The final red flag comes in their explanation of their provided services. They discussed that they store client data through FTP. I asked them how they secure it, and if they have things such as SSLVPN tunnels or basic encryption over the internet. They said no, and that it hasn't been necessary. At this point I am questioning how they are still even afloat.

The icing on the cake was that upon my exit, I thanked them for their time and shook the president's hand again. He awkwardly shook mine and then gradually increased his grip strength for about 15 seconds while making eye contact. It was just... strange. 

Anyway, I just felt like sharing this story with you guys in the hopes that you guys could share some similar stories with me as well. The whole interview experience was one of the most concerning and frankly bizarre things I've ever experienced. 


TL;DR: 

I interviewed at a software company that was perfectly happy using ancient technologies, was belligerent during the interview, and gave me several red flags for me not to work there.

Here are the two options.

**JPMorgan&amp;Chase (JPMC):**

**Title:**                  Software Engineering Internship

**Location:**         Columbus, Ohio

**Pay per hour:**       $31.49 per hour

$47.24 per hour for overtime

**Hours per week:** 40 hours

**Duration:**             10 weeks

**Other Benefits:**  $1500 Sign-In Bonus subject to tax (which comes down to $1000 I think)

No Housing so that will come from my paycheck

&amp;#x200B;

**Citrix Systems:**

**Title:**                 Software Engineering Internship

**Location:**         Fort Lauderdale, Florida (I think Florida does not have state income tax, not sure)

**Pay per hour:**       $33.54 per hour

No overtime pay mentioned

**Hours per week:** 40 hours (assuming so, as it is not mentioned in offer letter)

**Duration:**              12 weeks

**Other Benefits:**  $1000 Relocation Bonus (Tax, if any, will be covered by Citrix)

Medical Insurance

Round-Trip Expenses (Airfare/Mileage transportation cost, Reasonable meals and lodging)

(not sure what ""reasonable"" means btw. I am assuming they will cover the cost of housing as theymention they will cover ""lodging"". Did sent them an email for clarification)

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is that although JPMC has brand name and all, Citrix is a tech company and I am a Computer Engineering Major at Ohio State, so I would be more interested in working in the tech industry rather than a bank. Although the pay seems to be more for Citrix (even without assuming they will cover housing) for regular hours, I might earn the same if I work overtime in JPMC. Finally, the location for Citrix (Fort Lauderdale, Florida) seems really appealing.

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate any advice.

Edit1: Oh btw both companies said they are going to consider FT offers based on performance in internship.

Edit2: Alright Citrix will not cover housing/lodging either. The Round-Trip expenses are the ones that are accrued during the travel. This brings in an interesting scenario, as Fort Lauderdale is much more expensive than Columbus.

The two offers may end up being financially the same. :/"

First of all i have to say that i have been reading this subreddit for a while and you guys are a big help! Thank you all for that. Anyways to my point. All my life i was into computers but not that much as others. Some people were coding when they were like 13 years old and i was playing video games at that time. Sure i can't say that i didn't learn anything from them. I had to make them work, solve a lot of errors, learn how to reinstall windows etc etc. It gave me some basic knowledge of computers and I tried to learn more but just for the fun of it I wasn't thinking about career or anything. In school i didn't do very great I was still not sure what to do with my life and after i finished school i still didn't know. I went to study journalism when i even don't like to talk to people so yeah that was a great decision. After about a year i figured that this is not for me and somehow i went to study multimedia and programming and it was great. I really liked it i was and still is interesting but i had problems at university and i dropped out. Now i am again in uni studying the same thing(but in other university because my main reason of dropping out was the university and people in it). Now in uni i feel great everything is going smooth and all but still I wasted about 3 years of my life and i feel like i am in the same place i was those years ago. Many people around me are already working something, doing something and i am still studying without a job. For the last 8 months i've been trying to get a job but so far nothing. I found an internship that i did for 2 months programming with .NET and QA, that was fun and it landed me a lot of interviews just because of that but none of them hired me. I consulted with a lot of people they helped me make a good looking resume and how to talk in interviews but every time i go to an interview i get the same answer: i am sorry you lack job experience. So after 8 or so interviews i am losing my motivation to do anything, to study, to look for more jobs. I just feel like i am standing in one place not moving anywhere. I don't have any connections that could help me get a job i must do this all on my own with no help which is really hard. How could I convince people that i can work without experience? I don't even care about the pay just pay me something(i really need the money but i am considering internship again..) i just want experience. In one interview we talked and i said i cant offer you a lot of experience but what i can offer you is a lot of dedication and motivation to work and learn and he said to: well you know there are people who can offer both. That really hit me hard. Could you guys give some tips what am i doing wrong? How not to lose motivation and push forward? here are some things i studied:

\*\*I finished python course on codecademy

\*\*Some knowledge of C#,.NET,React and QA manual testing from 2 months internship  
\*\*Basic knowledge of C++ from playing around with arduino  
\*\*HTML,PHP,CSS and wordpress because i created couple of websites with wordpress while freelancing with forums,eShops etc.

\*\* Mysql  
\*\* Testing knowledge with soapUI  
I know it's not a lot so i am aiming low to get a job as junior QA or at least customer support but so far i have not been successfull.. i can show you my resume or tell how i talk at interviews if that would help to get a view of how am i doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a lot to read but I would really appreciate for any tips you guys can provide.

First off, thank you in advance to the wonderful people who make such an effort to help others in need of guidance.

Even as I type this post, I realize I am not unique nor am I special. I grew up in the typical Caucasian-American way. Happy little suburban life leads to divorce and identity conflicts in kids. Dad becomes devout Christian in his pursuit of meaning but due to shit circumstances (bullet holes in side of house) he takes a job opportunity in China of all places and tells his kids that ""God called him there."" Naturally this absolutely fucks spirituality for us kids - particularly me as I was his only son of four kids and that whole father-son bond tends to carry some weight.

This subconsciously leads me to adamantly pursue an understanding of the world through the only other avenue I could, knowledge. ""Academia."" Likely just me looking for some sort of approval to fill the void that was my father and I's relationship. I become a straight-A student through later years of high school and deem myself ""proven."" I'm pretty sure I just listened to some motivational YouTube video and decided everyone has to test themselves at least once in their life and mine? Fucking high school. Fueled by great aspirations of being Steve Jobs. So in this process I really develop that ""chip on the shoulder"" mentality while also finding a passion in the hobby of visual effects. What I thought of as real life magic. I pride myself on the fact that my Calculus classmates were all pursuing Math/Science degrees and I had managed to be the middle rung in the class yet I was going to actually pursue my interest instead of being another one of these ""sheep"" who don't think for themselves.

I reach college for Visual Effects in a new city half way across the country and was so proud of myself for being the first kid to leave the nest. That is quickly crushed when I realize the program at the university was quite new so at least in the introductory courses I was taking, I was more or less teaching the professor. Also introduced to serious gaming through CSGO. Not in the least bit helped by the poor habit of all my roommates and I to smoke copious amounts of pot and go to our self-proclaimed ""Chipotle Sundays."" I come back for the summer and meet a girl whom I develop my second ever serious relationship with (started with a one night stand) and decide to pursue. Just before returning to the out-of-state university, I decide that it was never really for me because I hated the subjective nature of an artistic environment and clearly I was too well prepared based on that introductory course alone. In hindsight, I probably wanted to be closer to the girlfriend. Still not a fan of the art students. But also had extreme trust issues and knew i couldn't manage without being able to see her at all. Lo and behold that doesn't last either but now I'm left with a Computer Science major because that was the safe option and I had always been around technology so that will definitely work out (also, Steve Jobs). I'll return to my academic pursuits! - I imagined. Never really became invested in the degree. Rarely coded outside of class. Got decent grades when I really tried but also slipped into one of the lowest points of my life. Dug my way out and just completed the degree by the skin of my teeth (3.2 GPA). Never had an internship so I deemed myself unworthy of a job and barely pursued it. Thought graduation would feel great and was met with extreme lows and a rekindled search for meaning in life.

I have since concluded that life doesn't have any inherent meaning. We as humans create this dimension of ourselves called ""spirituality"" because we are so desperate to ascribe meaning. The only solution I have connected with is to create our own meaning. But that requires a strong sense of identity and the more I examine myself and others - the more I feel as though identity is shallow and formed by the environment. I am frustrated by the capitalistic nature of our society. The ""rat race"" so to speak. And the inundation of information, advertisements, opinions, and ideals suggesting who we should be and what we should purchase.

Due to poor foresight, I am stuck in a living situation that is far beyond my financial means and needing to focus on making money to get by. I got a hosting job which may lead to a serving job which may or may not support me for the remaining 8 months of the lease. I thought I could sublease and was proven wrong. I lack confidence yet need just that to acquire a better job. I worry that my real issue all along has been a complete lack of commitment. I also worry that I never wanted this path to begin with and only followed it because I was pursuing an understanding of the world outside of organized religion.

At this point I see two options - either I accept that our society is one of capitalism so I should once again join the ""rat race"" and actually give a career in Computer Science a chance or I can take the opportunity to explore my own interests and hopefully rekindle a passion for life. The pursuit of my own interests would look like running off to Colorado where I have a friend literally living in a tent in the woods working odd jobs and loving life. A sort of Chris McCandless story (where she survives). She's a great person that I really connected with and almost dated so I trust her. But her perspective always enticed me and I wonder if there's more of a reason that I connected with her. I also recognize that a drastic change can seriously help with one's mental health. And I recognize that I have a strong tendency to make drastic changes. And... I lack commitment. I feel lost, lacking identity, slightly depressed, anxious, and sort of beat down. Escapism through alcohol has been the latest solution. Tossing/turning through the night and waking up with mind racing is the new norm. Very much stuck in my head. Sam Harris' perspective has helped to drown out that noise a bit. Anyhow, any thoughts reddit? Am I just a lazy white kid or is there more to life and I just haven't experienced it yet?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: White boy with daddy issues lacks commitment and struggles to find purpose. Should he settle for the life of financial security while his degree holds merit or explore other options in hope of finding more to life?"

I've also been working a standard retail job for the past six years or so (during gap years as well as studies). The key reason that I've stayed in the same place for all this time was primarily because of the people I work with, which is when I realised that my enjoyment of work is highly dependent on socialising. Being able to meet and befriend people from all sorts of backgrounds is paramount to how happy I am, and I'm definitely fond of my alone time to decompress and just do my own thing as well.

The reason I ask about the social aspect of working in this industry is because of the type of work that is involved. I'm clueless as to what it's actually like to be in these work environments, especially when each one is obviously unique in its own right. I'm working towards some internships while I have free time to try and get a feel for this myself, but until then I'd like to know what a standard workday can be like as a developer.

Hello Reddit,

My Name is Nico (26), currently taking my Master's Degree in Human Resource Management while having my undergrad in Hospitality and Tourism Management. I am currently seeking any type of administrative jobs, internships, HR assistants, and/or anything alike whether it be full-time/part-time, paid/unpaid (prefer paid) just to get my foot in the door of Human Resources. Now, I have been working within the hospitality industry for all my entire career life (10 years), and I enjoyed every part of it. The customer service, different people working towards a common goal - which is guest/customer satisfaction, giving above and beyond type of service. But what got me thinking was even though I was enjoying it, I cared just as much about the team and other employees. I would talk to them about almost everything. Like family and whatnot, help them setup their 401k's, PTO online, and even sometimes their benefit setup (I knew how to do this cause I would do it for myself) but I would help them out. And I was enjoying it, helping the team out. I used to supervise Housekeeping and I would listen to the employees' concerns. Because I believe that as long as the employees are happy, they can give much more to the customers. That being said, I've been on both sides of the coin, the managing team's side and the employees' side. I understand both sides as a matter fact. Like for example how payroll is setup, OTs, not being able hire other employees, raise, etc.

I wanna help both sides. I want to make/save money for the company while employees are enjoying themselves working for us. And I believe that it can be done and I believe I can make it happen although I will need more experience and guidance in doing so.

I have been applying everywhere. Like everywhere. But I can't seem to land anything at all. I am willing to work long hours of work, even if it's unpaid, just to get some experience and see what it's like. It would be perfect for to learn within a hotel and become a training manager since I've worked mostly for hotels but I am willing to do anything and everything to gain some experience.

If any of you reading this might have an idea on how I can land any kind of opportunity, please help me. I am desperate."

I am currently a Junior at my college and I start my spring semester next week. In the past two summers, I did not apply to many internships (any that I did, the company ghosted me) and now I’m honestly stressed/sad if I can’t land any internship for the summer. In terms of side projects I have one in the works, but it is not finished and it is not on the internet because it is a group project and we all agreed we will talk about it when school starts. I obviously have knowledge of coding and I’m thinking about joining a couple hack-a-thons that my school has under their cs orginization. 

The problem is that will it be too late? By the time I get this stuff done (especially my side project), the opportunities for a summer internship will dwindle and I’m hoping the hack-a-thons will come sooner than later. I have a decent GPA but I really regret not doing anything in my 3 years being a college student when it comes to internships. I have work experience, but they don’t relate much to my major. (The most is an IT intern at a big Company). I’m working to get another job as an IT associate at my school under financial aid, but it goes back to the idea of it being too late. 

I’m also trying to learn new languages (swift and Rust) but at this point I want to secure at the very least an internship, and I have already been denied an offer, so I want to see less of that happen. 

I might be overthinking it, but I have seen here that many people have struggled to get anything when they have done more than what was asked for and I honestly feel scared at this point that I’m going the same path (worst case scenario is that I have no job when school ends)

Any advice would be really appreciated and I thank all of those who do share their thoughts :)"

The startup is run primarily by one guy, but I believe there are a few other stakeholders and advisors involved. 

When I first started working the project had already been worked on for about 7 months by two other students, one had the same title (software developer intern), and one who served as the software lead developer/architect and the manager when our boss wasn’t there. The core structure of the application was fleshed out but only some pages/features existed when I got there so the code base wasn’t too large and didn’t take too much time to learn and start making meaningful contributions. Within a month I could tell I was already making the most impact on the team. Then in December the lead went MIA and my boss fired the other developer on my level. 

This brings us to now, I naturally took on more work and responsibility when the other developers left, and my boss naturally asked more of me as well. Recently I talked to my boss about stepping up and taking on more responsibility (including those the old lead used to have), and I would like to be in the lead developer role here. I think its clear I should ask for a raise at this point as my responsibilities have increased greatly, but I don’t know how to go about it or how much I should ask for. For context I make $20/hr now and my future full-time salary breaks down to about $45/hr. 

Also, I feel like should be clear, I really enjoy working for this startup because of the responsibility and freedom I have in the software development process - it’s incredible experience despite everything else around the software, and while I think the idea is intriguing, I don’t see the startup as a business being very successful (why I have no interest in equity or anything else).

Should I tell her truthfully how shitty it was?,shit_talking_throw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aeonzq/prospective_employee_wants_to_know_about_my/,"Spoiler alert: the company is mega shitty.

​

I received an email from a student from my alma mater who's looking for internship opportunities and wanted to talk to me about my experiences and career at the last company I worked at.

​

**For some context:**

​

I left on ""not good"" terms. The company wasn't paying me for a few pay periods, and then proceeded to offer me ""shares,"" in lieu of what I was owed/what they told me. I told them to go pound sand and left the very next day. I'll be filing a wage complaint with the Ministry of Labour once I get my next job (there is a two year statute of limitations in my province for wage complaints) because I am afraid the co-founders will retaliate by not confirming my dates of employment or some other thing. Yes, I was stupid to not quit at the first sign of payment problems, and even stupider to not have a backup ready the moment shit was hitting the fan (I started leetcoding just a little before my first missed paycheque, when there was talk of money problems).

​

The company is effectively a dead company, barely alive and kept afloat by a friends-and-family round, looking for funding. There's been a \*lot\* of talent retention issues. I will not to ask the co-founders for a reference, but may ask a co-worker who's still unfortunately working there for a reference (I have two references already from former co-workers at the company). I am unemployed at the moment.

​

Besides the pay problems, I would not recommend the company to other people (culture, work-life balance, management, career growth opportunities and recognition, etc.), especially for an intern who will have no mentorship and will probably sit on her arse for the entire summer and learn nothing (as what happened the last time we had an intern).

​

**Question:**

​

Given all of that, is it worth warning this student about the company? Or shall I remain silent/neutral while I'm still seeking a job, simply stating it has been a while since I was at the company?"

I’ll try to keep my story as short as possible. I’m a Software Engineer who just came to the US a few months ago on a TN Visa. To be honest I’m having doubts about my current employer and don’t really feel like being here anymore.

In the past I’ve been pretty against working at the big companies. Primarily because I interned at Amazon a few years back and didn’t have that great of an experience. As well I had this belief that I won’t learn as much at a Big 4. To be specific a lot of my current background is working at small consultancies where I can honestly say I’ve learned a lot of different stuff in my career. I have in total about 3 years full-time experience and a year of experience through my internships in college. My experience is all over the place (I’ve worked on a lot of different stacks) but primarily Node.js, React.js, and some iOS development is what I’d say my top 3 skills are. 

I used to say I didn’t care about the money in the beginning of my career however I feel myself starting to change. Seeing some of the salaries people are getting with my experience level is really frustrating me and makes me feel like I’m leaving money on the table. I wouldn’t consider going back to Amazon but I’ve seen some stories where people get sane workweeks at the Big companies and would hope to get on a team like that. Currently I’m making \~130K in NYC with no stock.

How should I go about this since I’ve never left a job this early (\~ 4 months). I’m a little nervous also that I’m on a TN visa and I’d have to apply for another TN visa in such a short period of time. Should I wait for a few months to see if things get better

I would love to hear anyone’s experience from going to consulting to working at FAANG or even working at a startup at going to FAANG. Thank you if you read this far!"

They said they filled all the internship positions, didn't even look at my resume (I have web development/ programming experience so i'm not completely fresh when it comes to somewhat applicable skills) and said it ""wouldn't be advantageous for me to talk to them"", which is ridiculous because it's always an advantage to network and gain insight. I'm a small woman and I look pretty young, some parts of my hair are colorful so I know that can be a strike against me. I'm not feeling completely discouraged, but it's definitely a bummer I couldn't even talk to others within the field i'm pursuing. "

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

You bet!

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

- Windows 10 / Ubuntu Dual Boot
- Multi-Purpose PC to Ideally go the Next 5-6 Years with Minimal Expense Upgrading (Not saying that I won't, just don't want to invest &gt;$150/year)
- VERY Lightweight Gaming, hence I don't need an outstanding GPU. I play stuff like Guild Wars 2, MTG Arena, Black Desert, etc. Not concerned with 4k, or really even 1080. Being able to play games at Mid-High settings would be nice though.
- LOTS of coding. I'm a CS student with an internship and 2 side projects, so I spend a lot of time in Android Studio and various IDEs.
- Really just looking to replace my old PC which was a pre-build with minor upgrades (i5-3330, GT710, 8GB DDR3 Memory)

tldr; My friends and family put it best: I'm looking for a ""Ferrari"" that looks nice, so I can slightly flex on my roommates with it, but will never ""drive""/use it to its fullest potential.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

Of all things, framerate would be most important to me, but gaming doesn't matter *too* much.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Looking for the range of $750-$875. If I'm excessively overkill on my current build, I'd be happy to look for ways to cut back for significant savings. However, $30 for a much better product wont break bank.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

As mentioned above, I'm looking at avoiding having to make significant upgrades for the next handful of years, so I am hoping that my current build is capable of handling some other activities, should my interests change in the next handful of years.

I am curious about how significant of a difference there is between M.2 and 6gb/s Sata connections for the SSD? I read a little about it and it seems worth the extra $20 or so to get the M.2.

Any feedback would be appreciated. 

Thanks!"

aeuuxh,7,2019-01-11,Digital marketing career in the UK - freelance or full-time? 24/f,confuseddigitalgal,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/aeuuxh/digital_marketing_career_in_the_uk_freelance_or/,"Hi guys.

So, I thought I'd post here because I'm feeling mega anxious about the future and whether I'm going in the right direction.

I have a 1st class degree in Marketing. Taught English in Vietnam for a year. Came home, live in a relatively small UK town, so there weren't many job prospects. I managed to get some freelance work for a local marketing agency as a digital copywriter - writing blogs, website content and the like for their clients.

I carried on freelancing for them whilst looking for full-time roles. I didn't manage to find much in the area and couldn't move away at the time due to personal, family reasons. So, I decided that while I was stuck at home, I may as well make the most of my time and so, found more freelance clients. Now I'm pretty much working full-time, but freelance, mostly remote. I do a lot of SEO content writing, keyword research, some social media marketing and blog writing. My clients include agencies and small companies. After a few months of earning around £1000-£1500, I actually managed to get to £2500 in December and I'm matching that this month. I know that's not a lot but I'm pretty happy with it (and yes I'm registered with HRMC, no worries there).

The thing is, I never planned for this to happen. You don't often hear of people working freelance straight out of University, do you? It's kinda strange and for me, unexpected.  I always thought I'd end up working full-time in an entry-level role in marketing or whatever. I'm enjoying the work and it's a little crazy that I have so much flexibility with it, too. I honestly never planned to be a freelance copywriter/digital marketer (or whatever I am?) yet here I am.

Anyways, things have changed at home now and I'm able to move out. I'm thinking of moving to a city in the North West, UK, where there are more opportunities. I'm at a crossroads where I could carry on freelancing and hopefully build my income and portfolio, or get a full-time job. I feel pretty stressed about it. I want to do what's best for me and my career - and I guess most people would say that'd be going full-time somewhere. But I'm enjoying what I'm doing now and feel it's a bit of a shame to give it up.

I also don't know what sort of job I'd go for with my current skills. I know a lot about SEO, have a big portfolio of blogs/articles/website copy, have a social media portfolio and can use PhotoShop, Final Cut Pro, WordPress etc, which I guess could lead me into marketing/digital. I'm just not sure if I'd have to go the intern or apprenticeship route as I only have freelance experience.

If you were me, what would you do? Cheers for reading this long and rambly post. Had to get it out.

TLDR: Accidently became a full-time freelancer and don't know if it's better for my long-term career, to go full-time or continue building a business.

I appreciate you guys spending the time to look over this point. I'm really just looking for some input and perspective.

So without getting too into it, I have to get neurosurgery over the summer. It's not that big of a deal and it's rather low risk, but that's not the point of this post. The recovery time is supposed to be 3-4 weeks and even after that I shouldn't be doing anything strenuous for 8-12 weeks. 

Additionally, no dates have really been set. We'd like to do the surgery in the first week of May and then spend that month recovering so that June-August I'd be, more or less, ""free."" Obviously since nothing is set in stone and there are typically at least minor complications, that's a problem on its own. Everything I've applied for thus far starts at some point in May. I'm still looking around for other opportunities, but at this point I'm wondering if I should just stop looking for the summer. I'm in my third year of my computer science degree so I really wanted to get an internship before I graduated. 

Anyways, any input would be great. Thanks in advance! "

At first, it was a great experience, I learned so much in my classes and even got a software development internship at a great company.


After returning to school from my internship, I was not too interested in my school's upper division electives.  I was taking machine learning, software engineering, and databases: all of those courses were incredibly disorganized and not well taught compared to my more theoretical and systems related courses like algorithms and computer networks.  Most of my semester involved watching Youtube and checking out Coursera/Udacity at the library.



I found myself bored studying computer science for the same reason I was bored in college the first time around, the lack of quality teaching alongside the high cost of education.  I eventually found myself applying for full time roles in my area and eventually obtained a software engineering position whose start date is approaching soon.



Of course, I plan on accepting the job offer.  However, at that point, is it worth finishing my degree?  I already have a BA (in an unrelated field), and will have work experience after I spend a few years at work on this job.  That should get me passed any HR filters in future jobs.  The only thing holding me back is the high cost of obtaining a degree when I am not sure if the tuition is worth it."

&gt;Thank you for your email. That will be fine 3-4 days a week would work we close our office on Friday 's for Admin staff. You will need to fill out our employee packet. Also I would like to know what skills you will be applying in this role?

Thank you,  
Employer's Nickname

In accordance to the hours I worked, my paycheck at the end should have been $594, but because of technical issues that my ""employer"" didn't understand, she found my work dissatisfactory. (Long story short, she doesn't know how the internet works -- struggled to keep track of passwords \[doesn't even know what websites she even has an account in\], hardly understood how the company website functioned, lost control of a Facebook account she used to market the nonprofit's services, didn't know how cloud storage services worked -- I had to clean up all these messes and do random administrative tasks on top of that. I also introduced new websites like Remind that made her job much much easier).

Later, in reply to my emails I sent 6 months after I worked (I just didn't want to deal with it since I was busy with school), she texted me instead (and I know that because they are texts without a signature, that's a legal loophole where she could claim non-liability).

Here's the reason why she said she would only pay me $400.

&gt;I just got an email from you if you recall ""nickname"" you messed up systems inPasswords I asked. You toCome back before you left to fix you did not.we still can’t get intoOne of our main systems. However we will not be giving any funds to anyone until Dec 26 our pay Days is next Monday. I willing to pay you but as I stated iit will be $400 due to many concern I bought to you. It appear you didn’t want to do the things I asked you to do We can mail it to you, since your back home.Please send your full address. Or bank name  to deposit in your Acct. Thank you

Yes, this is what her texts look like.

Later, after much insistence, she agreed to pay me only $300 because:

&gt;You have no files with us ""nickname"" to file anything you were Volunteer no records of you working here. You were volunteer who i agree to give you a donation for your help. As I have in the past. I am pretty busy , but I will get to it this week. We just not happy how you left things and how the system was messed up. Thanks  
since the company is not willing to pay i will pay you but i can only do $300 because it personal . I asked you to help me and you were not an employee  
So to clear this up I will pay you $300 cash. This all I have extra i can give. Thanks

I knew the nonprofit would be okay reimbursing for gas, so I requested $0.14 per mile as dictated by the IRS for nonprofits. Google Maps did the weird thing where the preview is different from the actual, so I actually calculated 2 miles short.

So this morning I went to pick up my money -- it was in cash -- and she made me sign something that confirmed that I received the money today, and that I accepted that it was full payment. (""Paid in full""). I should have taken a picture of it, but I'm just so tired of this fiasco.

The only reason I'm posting this is I want some closure, and perhaps to learn my lesson fully in case I am in this situation again in the future. Please advise on how I should have acted, and if my assumption that this is case closed is correct.

Minor rant: She has complained about all her past employees, and the one employee I worked with when I was a volunteer and ""paid' intern impersonated our employer by using the business phone as her personal phone when interacting with people outside the nonprofit and I would not put it past her to have forged the employer's signature. Also may have used the nonprofit's newly approved credit card for her own purposes without letting the company know that the credit card was approved (because she did the applying). I thought I would have avoided the drama and BS by working hard, but I guess not. I did my best, but I was overwhelmed by the constant messes I kept finding and side tasks I had to work on that took away from my time being able to ""fix the system"" and ""do the things she asked me to."" It didn't help that she is absolutely hopeless at technology (at least she no longer pretends she is good at it like she did back in 2017)."
aexzly,167,2019-01-11,Everyone my daughter loves goes missing,poloniumpoisoning,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/aexzly/everyone_my_daughter_loves_goes_missing/,"When I became a father, my whole world started revolving around Marie. She was the most perfect, most treasured little thing in my world. We are kind of an unconventional family; my wife Taylor is a CEO, while I’m an artist and stay-at-home dad.

Taylor and my parents are people I cherish and am grateful for, but I felt like I never knew what love was until I held my little Marie in my arms for the first time. I know everyone thinks their kids are amazing and special, but believe me, Marie is amazing and special.

I had no problem living almost exclusively in order to take care of her, raise her, help her and please her. Marie is my whole universe. I was grateful for the precious being I was given.

I woke up in the middle of every night to feed her when she was a baby with a smile on my face. I taught her first words. I put her to bed with a princess story every single night as she grew up into a sweet kid. We became the best of friends, watching cartoons and chasing butterflies together.

Taylor was so thankful to be able to be a mother and still focus 100% on her career. She would come home every night to a hot meal, happy baby girl and overjoyed husband. I never knew a family as happy as ours – until the incidents started.

First it was Marie’s cousin, Victoria. They pretty much were born together, and spent the early years of their childhood constantly playing together and being really close. When Victoria and Marie were 5 years-old, Taylor’s sister announced she would move away to another state; being a single mother, she was too tight on money (even with Taylor helping), and was to move back to my in-laws house.  

Marie found out she wouldn’t be able to see Victoria more than thrice a year and cried her eyes out the whole night in my arms. We fell asleep in my rocking chair next to the break of morning. It was heartbreaking.

I hated seeing my perfect little angel cry; she seemed to be in so much pain. I promised her that we would visit Victoria. Marie would soon start going to school, and I assured her she would make a lot of new friends.

A few days after that, Victoria went missing. Everyone in the family was crazy after her, but nobody was able to find a clue. It was like the girl disappeared in thin air.

Taylor’s sister was devastated at first, but she followed up with the plan of moving away. She soon married a nice man and had another child. Taylor doesn’t talk much with her now because she thinks her sister moved on too fast and completely forgot about her first kid. Victoria was never seen again even after all these years, nor her remains were found.

As a family, we did our best to get over this tragedy together. Kids’ brains are amazing to process everything. After a few months, it was like my daughter was past her loss.

When Marie was in second grade, she was crazy about her teacher, Ms. Martinez. She was a fairly old lady, chubby and gentle, and treated all the kids like their own granddaughters (the school was girls-only). 

Her warm smile could make an adult feel tucked in a comfy bed with a teddy bear. She was the greatest and, despite her lovingness, the girls were perfectly disciplined and had amazing grades. It was like they thrived to keep being loved by Ms. Martinez.

Marie was raised without a constant presence of a grandmotherly figure; I moved from England to marry Taylor, while her parents live in another state and don’t visit too frequently. So you might imagine how overjoyed Marie was to finally have an older lady showering her with constant attention and unlimited affection.

But, being an older lady, Ms. Martinez was close to retirement. She clearly loved her job and was postponing this moment but, when she got sick, she had no option other than take a leave.

Marie freaked out, feeling abandoned and depressed. I assured her she would still see Ms. Martinez when she got better, but she didn’t; the school was more incisive about making her retire, and she had to agree.

Marie’s new teacher was way younger, perfectly nice and adequate. But Marie hated her guts because, in her 8-years-old little mind, she was just an intruder. A usurper.

Ms. Martinez went missing from the hospital just a few days after deciding to retire.

After that, little by little, we moved past against yet another traumatic experience. My heart was shattered to a million pieces when Marie asked why everyone she loved had to suddenly disappear. I could do nothing but promise her I wouldn’t.

I took Marie to a great therapist, and we even went to Disneyland, just the two of us. Marie and Taylor loved each other, but they weren’t super close; since my wife couldn’t take a break from her job often, most of our family fun times were just me and Marie, and they were perfect.

Being showered with all my love, Marie started to improve again, but she only got better when she became friends with Bruna; they were both 9 at the time.

Bruna was a classmate and lived nearby. She was a polite and easy-going girl, and I couldn’t be happier than to see my daughter excited to go to school again, and having such a good company.

This time, I thought the peace would last. Our family had amazing 4 years and 10 months, until Bruna, at age 14, announced she would go to an internship in France. It was her childhood dream and she finally got it. She would study abroad during the entire duration of high school.

Bruna called me uncle and I grew to like her like she was my real nice, but I couldn’t find in me to be happy for her accomplishment. I knew what would happen. I just knew it.

Marie, of course, was devastated. She felt abandoned and betrayed. I gently explained that she could still be friends with Bruna overseas, that they would have so much exciting things to share with each other, and that Bruna still loved her and cherished her as a most important friend, but it was an once in a lifetime opportunity to fulfill her lifelong dream. I emphasized how we should be happy and proud for her, and that Marie could spend all her vacations in France if she wanted.

After our constant talks about it, Marie seemed to deal better with this loss. I never felt more relief than when the day of Bruna’s trip came and nothing happened to her. Some hours later, Bruna texted me “uncle, arrived at the airport. Getting a cab now!”

But she never got in the cab. She simply vanished from the airport.

Up to that moment, that was the loss that I grieved the most. Poor little Bruna, just 14 and full of dreams. This hit Taylor and me really hard but, strangely, Marie seemed almost fine with the disappearance and possible death of her best friend.

Bruna’s tragedy brought together Marie and her long time crush, Ian. Ian was a sweet boy, despite being the sports type. His heart and brains were in the right place just like his muscles, so I didn’t freak out when my 15 years old daughter started to date. I felt so happy for her. She had confided me her passion a year ago, but never made a move. 

When he learned what happened to Bruna, Ian immediately took upon himself the task of cheering Marie up and distracting her from her pain. He was such a nice boy. They were a happy couple for precisely 19 months.

“Ian broke up with me”, Marie one day entered the house screaming and crying. “He said I’m too clingy”.

I raised my daughter to be affectionate, and I see no problem with that, but maybe she crossed the line and became possessive. I suggest we see her therapist and deal with this kind of problems, so she can talk again to Ian and try to fix the relationship. I pointed out that romance takes time and work, and that her mother and I are happily married for almost 20 years because we are always up to become better people for each other.

I tried to calm her down, assuring her that anyone can see Ian is head over heels for her, and that they can improve their relationship.

Marie hated the idea. She felt like the breakup was definitive, and wanted the problem solved right in that moment. She wanted to keep feeling loved by him the whole time. Can you blame her? The first one is the worst one when it comes to a broken heart.

That same night, Ian went missing while out of town with a few friends. Like all the others, he was never found – dead or alive.

By this time, my heart was unbearably aching, but my daughter’s existence kept me going. My love for her hasn’t wavered or faded since I first saw her, it just grew. I was grateful and overjoyed to see my baby maturing into a sweet kid, then into a beautiful and capable young lady.

After Ian went missing, everything was a blur to me for weeks. I was depressed, on heavy medication, and my love for my daughter was everything I felt I had, but I didn’t know if I could carry my heavy heart any longer. 

Eventually, during dinner, Taylor suggested that Marie goes to college in another state. She’s smart and in our city we don’t have such great options.

“Do you want me to leave?” Marie asked, unspeakably hurt. “Am I a bother to you, mom?”

“Of course not, sweetheart. You just deserve better”, Taylor calmed her down.

“Why don’t you and dad move with me then? I don’t wanna be without him”.

Taylor explained she can’t just transfer from her job, and Marie, once again, freaked out. They never fought before.

After that, I was afraid I knew what was going to happen, so I had to call Marie to my studio and talk to her.

“Baby, are you aware of your doings?” I softly asked.

“My doings? What do you mean, dad?”

“I mean that”.

I opened a curtain and showed her a small body, completely surrounded by shiny golden thorns. They were like a cage, enveloping a fragile human being. The tiny body was neither alive nor dead, it was something else. It was cold like death, but showed no signs of decay. No blue dead lips, but no breathing. It was like they were asleep otherworldly beings.

Needless to say, the tiny body belonged to Victoria. It showed up in my studio just after her disappearance and, I swear to god, it was floating. The golden thorns were sheer, but it was impossible to get through them and touch the person.

I honestly spent weeks thinking it was a hallucination, but when Marie started to move on, I finally understood. Every time the missing person related to my daughter showed up right here in my studio, where Marie, Taylor and the cleaning lady never step foot in.

Marie’s feelings of loss and despair make a prison of golden thorns around people she loves and believes to have lost, and they vanish from whenever they are. They were never kidnapped by a person, they are just left unconscious and frozen for the eternity – right here in our house’s basement.

“Dad… I didn’t. I swear”.

She didn’t have to say twice. First of all, she’s my special little girl and I believe her. Secondly, it’s obviously she didn’t have the power to kidnap Victoria and Ms. Martinez without a trace as a little child, and never left home when the other two disappeared in another town, in another country even.

“Whenever someone disappeared I felt better than when they said they would leave me, dad” she simply stated. “Knowing they are choosing to leave me makes me broken and empty, but when they are gone this way, I feel whole again”.

Marie has no queasiness about it. As long as the people she’s losing are gone for good, she will feel better. She didn’t take them, but she doesn’t feel bad about what actually happened either. 

No matter how I assured her that Taylor loves her to bits and wants to be by her side, she feels rejected. So you know what happened to my wife a few days after the discussion.

It all makes me sad, but Marie’s my whole world and I’m not only going to let her feel and do as she pleases – I’m turning the people she loves into art. I want her to keep them untouched as they were before they almost left her, so I’m creating a giant mural with their frozen bodies, peacefully and forever preserved inside a cage of golden thorns[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)"
aey1ip,5,2019-01-11,"Non-CS degree at a big school with a decent reputation vs CS at a small, no reputation school",OddCollegeStudent,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/aey1ip/noncs_degree_at_a_big_school_with_a_decent/," 

I am currently studying industrial engineering at San Jose State University. My long term goal since I began college has been to enter into a career in software engineering in the Bay Area. However, I have applied to both the computer science and software engineering majors at my school and have been rejected multiple times. This is due to a combination of just how heavily impacted these majors are at San Jose State and how I struggled with my GPA in my first two years of college. I’ve been on an upward trajectory the past year and a half but at this point, I’ve earned so many units (over 90) that I think trying to get accepted to these majors isn’t going to work anymore. 

After a great deal of introspection, I’m seriously considering transferring to CSU East Bay since it is still in the Bay Area but it’s CS program is not impacted at all. I figure I could finally study what I really want at this school. However, I’m also concerned that by going to this school, I’m losing out on the reputation, connections to alumni and companies, and events such as career fairs that San Jose State has to offer. San Jose State isn’t a super prestigious school but it is one of the schools that tech companies here hire from the most ([Source](https://hiringsolved.com/blog/hiringsolved-identifies-top-skills-backgrounds-make-2017s-wanted-tech-employee/)). Based on LinkedIn statistics, San Jose State’s alumni network in the tech industry is very strong. In contrast, CSU East Bay is a much smaller school with hardly any reputation for CS that I can find after researching online. I’m not even sure what companies in the tech industry, if any, recruit from CSU East Bay.

So now I’m at a crossroads. I can continue at San Jose State and study industrial engineering or possibly change my major to applied math since it has some upper division CS requirements. On the other hand, I can transfer to CSU East Bay and earn a degree in computer science. If I choose to stay at San Jose State, I’m worried that not having a CS degree will significantly hurt my job prospects once I graduate. I’m also worried that by transferring to CSU East Bay, I will struggle to find great internship opportunities and build connections that would be helpful in starting my career. I know that this choice won’t make or break my chances of achieving my long term goal but at this point, I’m just trying to choose the path with the smallest opportunity cost.

One thing to note, I’m still at least a year and a half away from graduating even if I continue with my current major at SJSU. Also if there is some other path that I’m not aware of, I’d be happy to be enlightened. 

TL;DR: What would have the smallest opportunity cost for a career in software engineering: majoring in industrial engineering or applied math at San Jose State University OR transferring to CSU East Bay and majoring in computer science?  "

I put in an application at exactly one engineering firm, interviewed the day before I graduated, and was hired two days after I graduated. As a result, I’ve never really shopped around for an engineering job. 

I accepted a position at a small firm thinking I’d be able to grow a bit and see a variety of types of work. I’m wildly successful with my customers who have started sole sourcing their work to me, but my output is limited and I’m hitting burnout. Requesting help has gotten me interns and untrained personnel for support, who stay long enough to learn something before they’re taken from me by someone with more seniority and absolutely zero oversight of my work.   I’m worried if I voice an intent to leave they won’t sign off on hours towards my professional engineering license when my work isn’t being reviewed. I’ve been told that I will be doing exactly one type of work in the future and the variety of work I was told I’d see when I was hired is in the office.... but we only support specialization.

I love the independence they’ve given me to grow my contracts, but as I’m starting to run out of red bull and granola bars to keep going into late hours, that independence is feeling more like abandonment. I can’t keep up with my workload and it shows no signs of stopping but all the support resources in this company are flowing elsewhere. I may just have not been a squeaky enough wheel early enough. 

My primary client may have a job opening. It’s not uncommon for employees to hop between these companies. The local industry has only a few players in it. 

I have some questions for people with more experience than I have. 

Do I stay for the independence and accept I’ll just be a lone cowgirl out here? Do I leave? Do I wait for 2 years to pass so my resume looks better? 

Is it rude to apply with my client? If not, what advice do you have for jumping ship without hurting feelings in a small industry?

They say the “grass is always greener”, but I don’t know what the grass looks like in other engineering firms. Is it like this everywhere?"
af0p3h,3,2019-01-11,"I hate both my sisters and their spoiled, parasite-like attitudes.",hanhange,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/af0p3h/i_hate_both_my_sisters_and_their_spoiled/,"My older sisters are equally as spoiled as one another but they constantly act like one's more spoiled than the other, and it's driving me nuts.

I'm a 22F, my eldest sister is 31, other sister is either 28 or 29. We live at home with our parents and my \~25yo brother, and my 19yo brother is in college now but comes and lives with us during holidays (like now) and probably is just gonna move back in when he graduated, the same as the rest of us. 

It's fine to live at home. It offers benefits. That's how much of the world has done things; the idea of 'moving out and starting your own life' is something that was established relatively recently in society. So I don't think it's bad any of us haven't moved out, but like... There should be an expectation that you give back, that the family is a collective.

My 28yo sister is unemployed. She hasn't worked a real job in her life, because she can't stand authority. The closest thing she ever had to a real job was a paid internship in college. That was years and years and years ago. Since then she's just been shuffling around between part-time jobs, and the last one was Toys R Us. She knew long before it closed that she  needed to look for a job. The Toys R Us near us offered part-time jobs for some nearby business instead to keep people employed. She denied it. My eldest sister's boyfriend pulled strings at a liquor store chain to get her a part-time job. She didn't show up to the interview. She's been sitting around for over 6 months now, jobless, not really looking. No prospects. She's passive aggressive and has always been a nightmare to me. Even though we share a room, I basically live in the basement because she's taken over most of the room and hates me so much as moving anything. She's a giant, giant pain in the ass, and when I was in high school and stuck with her and felt like there was no out, I developed an eye twitch from constant stress from her bullshit. 

My eldest sister is better than her, but she's nosy, entitled, and obnoxious. She has a job that pays around 55k a year, which is just... A normal job, but she brags about it like it's something special. She and her boyfriend make over 100k a year and are planning on moving out next year to get as big a house as possible. Cool, but she refuses to move out so far to waste money on stuff like new cars, all while not paying rent but eating our food and not giving back. Just like my other sister, she doesn't do any chores, and complains when you expect it of her. She doesn't lend money despite my mom paying for some of her bills, insists she'll never give any of us money if any of us are in financial trouble, and is ultimately a strain on the household. She went to college for 8 years on my parents' dime, and though she's been paying it back now, she doesn't seem to realize how privileged she was for that, and how that's the reason she has the job she has now. Because my parents have been great and giving. 

Instead, both my sisters bitch about my mom behind her back and get offended when I refuse to allow any of us. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of hearing their constant bickering and bitching like they're a couple of 16-year-olds who just think it's SO unfair mommy told them to put the dishes in the dishwasher. They're terrible people. They're obnoxious. My mom works two jobs just to get away from my shitty dad, and then has to come home to them being leeches. The one year both me and my brother were away, for college, my mom would constantly text us about how much she misses us because we're actually decent people who have any amount of filial piety. My elder brother gets a pass because he works a labor-intensive job all day and does help around the house and is nice, but my sisters are just such a fucking drain. But my mom had a mini-stroke a couple years back and shortly before it my eldest sister got all in her feelings because 'WELL OTHER PEOPLE FEEL BAD TOO' whenever my mom complained about how badly she was feeling. And it's like they're trying to push her into a real stroke with how much of parasites they can be.

It feels like I can't even properly enjoy my 20s and have this constant rush of 'GET A GOOD-PAYING JOB LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE GET OUT NOW' because they've sucked away any help I can get from my parents by being absolute parasites. There's no sense of 'staying at home for a while to discover myself.' I hate being inside when either of them are home (which is 24/7 thanks to the 28yo being unemployed with no life) because they're both such a fucking nuisance."
af175p,2,2019-01-11,Stay or Transfer,unseelielucian,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/af175p/stay_or_transfer/,"Background: I'm a junior in apparel design at RISD (rhode island school of design). Long story short, risd sucks. Freshman year was a nightmare (the infamous poop bandit was in my dorm hall on my floor), our bathrooms didn't have heat until March, my professors first semester were raging dicks who taught me absolutely nothing, and I was miserable in general. Halfway through freshman year, I applied and was accepted to FIT (fashion institute of technology, nyc; also applied/was accepted in high school), but then chose not to go for whatever reason. 

Sophomore year was good the first semester but then my depression got awful second semester (I don't know anybody in RI and I had roommate issues so I was miserable) and I got C's in all of my mandatory studios. 

Junior year: I live in a house that's falling apart with two roommates who drive me insane and a partner who lives three hours away (so I rarely get to see him). We got a new professor this semester, and well. he sucks. He refuses to give anybody anything higher than a 79%, excepts a shitton of work for stuff we werent taught (full design, marketing, and promotional portfolios, with manufacturing guidelines) and I failed his class and another studio (both because the workload, and because I got the flu, bronchitis, and stomach flu consecutively in the first 3/4 of the semester which put me hella behind and then my depression/anxiety made it impossible for me to finish my work). The curriculum is not my interest - it's haute couture and mass manufacture design focused, and I'm into costume design, lingerie, and artisinal handcrafting (think bespoke tailors, renaissance faire stuff like catskill mountain boots, son of sandlars, custom fetish wear, etc), and for a career I probably want to go into either patternmaking or machine repair (I'm very good with machines and can repair most standard sewing machines because I did two internships and work as department assistant tech).

So now I'm at a cross roads. My options are: Stay at RISD and tough it out for senior year; take a gap year and apply to FIT; take a gap year and go back to RISD. I can't afford an extra semester at RISD, which would be required if I fail even one more studio. If I applied to FIT I would have to take a gap year since the application deadline for Fall 2019 is already passed, and I would have to do 2-4 years more of school (whether they let me transfer my credits and go straight to bachelors, or if I would have to go into associates first). To be fair, 4 years at FIT is the same price as 1 year at RISD, and renting a studio would be roughly the same cost in either location. My other option would be to take a gap year to save up money so I can afford materials for my senior year without having to work 15 hours a week (which is what I have to do right now if I wanna buy fabric and eat). 

Pros of RISD:
- Very good reputation
- I only have 1.5 years to go
- On paper a good design program
- Good connections
- I like my on campus job

Cons of RISD:
- Location sucks
- I hate it
- No friends
- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
- far from my partner (who makes me happy) and ny ren faire (where I work as a performer every fall)
- Constantly failing classes
- Far-ish from home and any of my support network
- No good fabric or yarn stores (have to either go to NYC or buy stuff online, both not ideal)

Pros of FIT:
- cheap af
- NYC! my favourite city! (I'm from nj)
- lots of friends + much closer to family and partner
- Close to ren faire
- great fabric stores
- 24 hour stores
- not... as cold as ri?
- easy access to jobs, connections, and internships because of location

Cons of FIT:
- Reputation isn't as stellar as risd
- might not accept me since my grades are bad-ish (3.2 gpa, two c's and two f's currently)
- Have to do a gap year
- Don't know the curriculum
- housing in nyc is tricky
- would have to be in college for longer

Any advice? Especially if you know anything about either school's curriculum."

For background I'm a sophomore— I'm not extraordinary or anything but I work as hard as I can to get good grades and succeed academically. My family is poor and that's not the kind of circumstances I want to stay with me when I'm independent. I take honors classes and I am getting all A's pretty easily, I am in debate and theatre, I study critical languages on my own and I just really really want to get into a good college. Right now I am focusing on maximizing my hs years so I don't have to stress about everything last minute. 

The issue I have is that my school and counselor are making this 1000x times harder than it needs to be. I really want to take AP courses because I no longer have a ride to take DE classes, but they're making my schedule so that every AP course I want to take is squeezed into junior and senior year. Not just that, but even though I qualify to be a member of the NHS, they are barring me from joining until next year. I am the ONLY student who qualifies but did not get notified, even students without the GPA requirement got notices telling them to work a bit harder to be eligible.

The only way for me to take AP courses now is to study for one and take the test on my own, get a 3, and have it on my transcript as a P for pass so not even a grade. But they are too expensive for me to even consider, literally NINETY DOLLARS. And I haven't even taken the class so I'm less likely to score well.

I am seriously just so depressed because I feel like if I don't have a solid plan now I might as well dump all these years down the drain. I have nothing else going for me, I'm not an Olympic athlete, a legacy, some nationally recognized musician. I'm literally just a nobody in a cookie cutter suburban town. I don't have much options for extracurriculars, and it kills me that my academics will be subpar just because I haven't been able to take the classes I want, and when I do have the chance, I'll likely need to drop 1 or 2 because the load will be too heavy. And I have mentioned this. But no one listens.

I guess this isn't even a big deal overall but I really feel the need to do at least SOMETHING to make up for this. Internships, travelling to a third world country, and those kinds of things are out of the question. I coded an app last summer, and I'm working on getting an accredited certificates, but other than that every single attempt I have made to get more involved in my community has been turned down. Volunteering at a library? No email back. Volunteering/working at a retirement home? No reply. Local Hospital? Too young to volunteer.

This is literally killing me on the inside and everytime my friend mentions an EC, or if my sibling gets an award for one, I feel so bad but I am happy for them. I'm trying my best but every damn door just gets slammed in my face. It's like I HAVE to be mediocre. And I just don't want to accept that. I want to do more but I feel like my hands are tied.

Some of the stuff I am actually passionate about and not just doing it for brownie points or whatever. I actually really love math and science, but I can't do a single thing to show it because no one let's me and I don't know my options. I don't just want to take AP and DE classes for the benefit of looking good, but I want to actually know the material and I want it to be known on my transcript I'm serious about this. 

Idk I feel so far behind, I need to get Govt, Art, And of FL credits (2) in 2 years all while getting electives in math and science and it's just. not possible anymore because no one is helping me along now. No schedule will make it work. All the dumbass requirements to take these classes are not possible anymore and I'm over it.

No summer classes to make anything up, to get ahead, to do something great. Literally nothing. And now I don't know what to do instead of just flinging myself over the grand canyon. "

Most of the places I apply to either send rejection emails or just flat out don't respond. I am going to need to get a job for this summer so what are other positions that I can look at applying for that aren't specifically internships but can help me get one after my junior year. Any IT type of jobs where I can still work with computers and build other skills outside of programming?
af2ien,7,2019-01-11,Pursuing Two Master's Degrees back to back? Pros and Cons.,Kyak787,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/af2ien/pursuing_two_masters_degrees_back_to_back_pros/,"I don't have a strong Bachelors (it's in Math this past year) nor three strong letters of recommendation. I am 25 years old and have not held a full time or part time job yet. I have one volunteer unpaid internship in Hospital Information Technology (mostly blue collar work). I want to go to a good school in Computer Science to study machine learning. I do not want a C.S. degree from a lesser known school without many faculty in Machine Learning that prevents me from getting into another C.S. program in the future because I already have a degree in CS. I want to learn SOME significant mathematic theory in addition to the courses/electives offered in a C.S. masters.

I live in the U.S. and am considering starting a Master's in Applied Mathematics focused on Finance/Business in a year at an international university with very low or free tuition (a country like Germany, France, Belgium), even if I have to learn the language.

One year into the degree, I would apply for Computer Science programs in the USA and Canada to study Machine Learning with a focus on Data Science after graduating.

Pros I have read about:
I would have the ability to work part time throughout both degrees to pay living expenses. I am currently debt free. I would have multiple opportunities for internships and research. The programming done for my research would be part of my portfolio if I make it test-driven and production quality. I would learn two important and related skills for Industry. I would have the opportunity to travel. I would be more likely to get a fellowship/scholarship or TA/RA position that waives tuition for the second masters.

Cons I have read about:
If I don't plan it right, this could be unbelievably expensive. Employers would view me as over qualified for certain positions. Employers may view me as a professional student. It may look like I failed/dropped out of a PhD program. I would enter the job market significantly later than my peers (30 years old). I can only spend $40,000-60,000 USD total for both degrees, excluding living expenses, over the four years.

What do you think?"
af2k6t,0,2019-01-11,Should I Transfer to a Better School to Improve My Chances of Getting a Big N Internship?,Blagaflaga,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/af2k6t/should_i_transfer_to_a_better_school_to_improve/,"TL;DR; Do you think I have a chance at getting a Big N internship going to a no name school with two internships and a personal project, or would transferring to a more target school drastically improve my chances?

I’m currently a sophomore Electrical Engineering major and minor in CS at an average state school in Florida that you’ve probably never heard of. I didn’t expect to get an internship so early but I applied anyways and here I am with a CS internship this semester! I’ve started applying to summer internships to local/smaller companies as well, and I’m confident I’ll get one, though we’ll see haha. It got me thinking, if I have two internships and do a big personal project before I apply, I would have a shot at getting an internship at a big tech company the summer after my junior year. However, I’m concerned about my chances because I go to a no name school and because my major isn’t CS. 

I’m open to transferring to UF, which is ranked the best CS program in Florida, if it would drastically improve my chances, or any competitive CS program in Florida. What do you guys think? I have a hard time transferring just for a “chance” at something because frankly getting a Big N internship wouldn’t be guaranteed anyways. Also, I would lose a scholarship I have at my current school for $2000 a semester(the last $8000 of it would be lost), but I would still have Bright Futures, which pays for my tuition up to 132 credit hours. However, I think I would save some money transferring to UF because I could major in Computer Engineering, which my school doesn’t offer, instead of having to pay a for the excess hours to finish my minor in CS. Also, it would pay off anyways if I got the kinda money that comes from a Big N internship and the resume booster. 

To anyone wondering why I don’t just major in CS, I like hardware and software almost equally. EE let’s me learn how to make things and a fair bit of programming, but CS just teaches you software and not how to actually make things, which is much harder to learn on your own than programming. Also, I want to have the option of going back to get my Masters or PhD in biomedical engineering.

af2tyb,3,2019-01-11,How can I stop the downward spiral?,L345A,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/af2tyb/how_can_i_stop_the_downward_spiral/,"[22 F] Throwaway account. I feel like I’ve been headed in a downward spiral for a year now and I’m exhausted and don’t know what to do. 

A year ago I got dumped pretty hard. I thought this guy was actually “the one” for me even though we were very young. The breakup was traumatic. One night he just dumped me after 2.5 years together with generic reasons like “I want to date other people while I’m young.” I know now it really wasn’t meant to be and I don’t miss him as much anymore as much as I miss being happy.

Before the breakup I had been doing very very well in school (a very good journalism program at a university, I’m a first generation college student) I was rising fast in the school newspaper, getting promotions every couple of months and writing good stories that I was proud of. I was feeling great.

Then after the break up I stopped doing so well. I continued at the paper, not doing as well I was before but I had an important role as senior news editor. I did my work but I was really fighting to do it. I kind of just floated along, feeing like I was barely making it but hoping I would start to feeI better with time. I wrote another good story, maybe the best thing I’ve ever written. I finished school and even got an internship at one of the best newspapers in my state. I was so self conscious and anxious and down on myself though that I didn’t do very well at the internship. I wrote fairly good stories that I put in my portfolio but I don’t want to list anyone there as a reference because I’m sure I just seemed shy and useless. Definitely not a go-getter like I used to be.

The other big thing that happened was that I went to a festival (a rave) and took some bad drugs that basically put me in a three day panic attack. After that my anxiety got so bad that I have a hard time going out in public and I feel hyper self-aware at all times. My self confidence has plummeted to the point where I don’t believe in myself at all. I can’t get out of bed all day and I moved back in with my parents across the state. I left all my close friends in my college town. I’m freelancing for the newspaper in my home town but I’ve only managed to write one story and I could have written around 10 by now if I was working like I know I can, or at least used to. It seems like guys aren’t as into me as they used to be. I feel like job interviews aren’t going as well. I think people can see how bad I’m doing and it’s not getting better with time, it’s getting worse. I barely leave the house and can’t force myself out of bed before like 10 a.m. on a good day, 2 p.m. on a bad day. 

Besides therapy (which is an obvious answer that I’m trying to make happen despite insurance problems) what should I do? How can I stop being so hard on myself? I just keep thinking about the breakup and the embarrassing bad trip and every other thing I’ve done to be ashamed about and I despise myself. Right now I’m trying to force myself to go to the gym and go out and hang out with people or go on dates, and of course write stories but I just can’t get the motivation to do those things and I can’t stop thinking about all the things I’m disappointed about. Is there anything I can do now that could help? Journalism, especially newspapers are a tough industry to get a job in, and if I don’t do better I might ruin my chance of making a career out of my passion and my degree. "

The second offer is at one of the most impressive companies around, pays more, and the work is in a similar field but would likely be a bit more interesting. To get the job I completed a phone interview and then a really difficult, 2-week long take-home project which apparently impressed my boss...but I know for a fact that I only got the initial phone interview through a reference from my Dad's past coworker who is very high up in the company. My boss didn't know I was selected for a phone interview because of a reference, so the rest of the process was solely merit based, but obviously getting my resume boosted is a huge help.

I am extremely confident that taking the second offer would be much better for my future career and likely make for a better summer, but I really don't want to have to say for the rest of my career that I got where I am because my Dad knew the right person.

af4ft5,3,2019-01-12,Transfer Schools -,cornellshrek,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/af4ft5/transfer_schools/,"Current School: State Flagship, not top 100

Current Standing: First Year Freshmen

Schools that I somewhat plan on applying to: JHU, USC, Cornell and Brown but don't expect those last two. Def Cornell for the Lab of O though. Brown for both their biology and CS programs with open curriculum. I want some suggestions as well for schools if possible. Might throw in uPenn. Looking for a school with some sort of interdisciplinary plan or open curriculum. Adding Rice to the list for financial reasons but also liking the school.

Freshmen GPA: 4.0 First Semester, not sure second. First Year Writing Class, Calculus II (proud of this one, last test average was less than 30 and the grade is only made up of tests), Computer Science II, Honors English

HS GPA: Can't remember, 3.8-4.0

URM Status: If underrepresented state counts, Wyoming. Own a farm that I worked on a lot during high school.

ACT: 32 Comp

AP Scores: Took 11 APs, 4-5 on 7 of em and 3 on 4 of em. One was a self study.

Current Major: Computer Science, may switch to Biology.

College ECs: Pretty early in the year but I think I've gotten some stuff. Might try and learn R by myself.

LaTeX Workshop - Not sure why I did this, somewhat plan on writing articles in the future and thought it would be helpful.

Interning at two labs at once for some reason, doing entry work, plan on starting my own project with one of them. Both bird-related, which is why I chose them.

Doing some bird-lab stuff over break, paid job this time.

Audubon Society Board of Directors - Organize events and outreach. Tech guy for the group.

Cyber Security Club Member - CTFs and basic stuff like that

Piano - Taking Piano Lessons, started over the summer. Once a week.

High School EC's have no direction, just sort of random stuff. National award in something constitution related. Hospital internship.

Have two recommendations lined up. Both will be pretty good. One is an English teacher and the other is a Zoology prof.

I want to combine CS and Zoology and use machine-learning later on to track movement or automated identification, University isn't really helpful for either of those majors and looking for something with more of an open curriculum. My current university only has one machine learning class and that's a senior level class. Some of the obvious stuff like wanting smaller classes as well, only class that had less than 50 people was my english class since it was honors. The computer science program at my school isn't that strong and the community for it is pretty small. 

The only thing I'm worried about are the reasons. These reasons don't feel super strong but it's what I think. I'm mostly looking for a school that has some sort of open curriculum/interdisciplinary with a strong CS community and more machine learning capabilities. The biology part doesn't have to be super strong. 

I feel my application is a bit odd as well, some bird guy who likes computers.

\- GPA is 3.54 currently, but I'm taking seven courses this semester and will likely bring it up to a 3.58-3.6

\-Track record of heavily loaded semesters with advance level courses (at least 5-6 classes per semester) 

\-Lots of leadership experience both on campus and off ( President or Vice President of at least 3 different organizations and an active member of at least 4 others)

\- Two fellowships with the United Nations Foundation and three internships with  state reps. (though I may be getting another one with a Congressperson in the future)

\- Truman Scholarship finalist for my university

And i'm from VN so price for a retail laptop pretty high unlike pc parts. And business laptop grade often overprice too .

# I know the spec gap between these two is HUGE

I have a decent desktop so on my laptop gaming is not a problem . What i need is a decent laptop for long time use ( 5-6 years)  for IT internship and so on . Battery is not my concern since i get used to power outlet most of the time.

I do not expect high quality monitor from both laptops too because i use dell u2414h . Brightness is needed

Both laptops have good design from my point of view

Will the Y530 with only intel graphics enabled have better temp ? I saw many thermal problem with 8th gen intel processors

If so do the Y530 worth it ? or i just get the hp and save more money to upgrade my main rig to zen 2 ?

 I am currently an international (Asian citizenship) second-year student in an Economics programme at a globally Top 50 university in Europe. Our economics programme is three-years long and has a math-intensive approach. My long-term goals are to attain a PhD at an American university (preferably in East Coast) to either enter academia or join an international organization (IMF, World Bank, etc). My current GPA is respectable (equivalent to a 3.7+ in the US scale), and I am planning on signing up to be a research intern at the university this summer as well.

I believe I can maintain my GPA and have decent extracurriculars (volunteering and data-related work), so I am looking at universities where I can get a scholarship for the Master's (financial conditions are okay, but saving money is appreciated). Based on my understanding, terminal MSc.'s in the US are not really meant for people that want to continue in the research-oriented world (and also have a reputation for being cash cows), whereas getting accepted directly into a grad school as an international is quiet rare, and though I think I have a good portfolio overall, I am not a prodigy-type student who will buck the trend.

Because of these reasons, I am more inclined to continue studying in Europe as most top-ranked universities (LSE, Bocconi, Barcelona GSE, etc.) offer scholarships to internationals and have pretty good placement records in both international organizations and universities. However, they differ in terms of the length of the programs they offer; Bocconi, Tinbergen and Stockholm SE have intensive 2-year programmes whereas Barcelona GSE and UvAmsterdam have one-year programs. Based on the program descriptions, the one-year programmes focus more on coursework and educating the students about theories and all while the two-year programmes incorporate an internship and/or research opportunity, which may be helpful as related experience on the resume when applying to PhD programs. With all that in mind, I would like your opinion about which type of education is more suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, if you have any other schools to recommend, please do let me know. Thanks Reddit :) 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -- Undergradute economics student who wants to get a PhD in the United States wanting to know if two-year research intensive MPhil programs in Europe are worth the extra year compared to similar one-year MSc."

Submitting in a few subs, so some of you may see this twice. Throwaway account for identity purposes. 

I am currently 21, and an undergraduate junior in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

At the same time, I also started my first IT job at 16. I managed to skip over helpdesk roles and jump straight into a corporate-esque internship. I'm currently an IT Consultant and a Jr. Sysadmin. I'm on my 3rd year in this position. I recently turned down an 80k offer to finish my degree (they wanted me to drop and work full time). 

I'm coming up on the time where I finally need to pick one- Engineering or Sysadmin, which is difficult for me since I love both fields very much. 

Obviously I can't have you all just tell me what to pick. However, I am still planning to graduate in my current program regardless of what I choose. 

Therefore, my questions are:

1. Does an ECE degree hold any merit for this role? I will also have a HPC minor, as well as a CS minor. 

2. My resume isn't posted on here, so I can't expect exact numbers, but how will salaries compare? Money isn't everything, but also does hold some weight.

3. If you wish to provide input, do you have any pros/cons or opinions on choosing one field over the other?

Thank you!!"
af9c94,1,2019-01-12,Should I reject this internship offer? (Less than 2 days to send decision),jetfire314,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/af9c94/should_i_reject_this_internship_offer_less_than_2/,"I was offered a software engineering internship at an Air Force base in another state. The job description is to ""to gain experience and assist higher graded employees in providing professional and technical software expertise necessary to operate and maintain the avionics integration support facility, and operational flight programs and software support.""

I am interested in what they do/ what I could learn. However, the pay comes to about $16/hr. I rejected a software internship from a clothing brand which payed $23/hr (mostly because I wasn't interested in what they did). Most of my CS peers get paid twice or thrice what's being offered to me. I assume housing/ transportation is covered but I am not sure - it simply says relocation expenses are not reimbursed. I would also have to go through/ acquire security clearance, which may be useful in the future. 

The only other guaranteed plan I have right now is to do neural engineering research (which I'm just as, if not more interested in) at my university, which is funded at $1049/ month regardless of hours worked. That comes to $6.13/hr full time or $12.25/hr part time, and I can most likely get honors graded credit for that too. I can also do this over the school year. I can also do this in conjunction with an ongoing project involving virtual reality that the state has been interested in, but that most most likely will not be paid by the lab or other entities (but will be interesting and beneficial, and innovative). 

I have no other offers, but I have other companies I'd like to check out (albeit it's late to do so, but I do have connections I could use). That isn't guaranteed, but it is a plausibility. I haven't had any previous internships. 

They've only given me less than two days to decide. I've sent an email asking about the housing reimbursement and more details about the job.

Should I reject the internship offer, in the hopes of finding something better, but risking not having an official internship (but having a more interesting backup plan which might pay less). Or should I make the commitment to accept the internship, blocking any other (most likely far better) opportunities?

TLDR: I have a software engineering internship offer which pays more than my backup plan (of doing innovative research in fields I'm interested in), but is a bit less interesting, involves more logistics, and accepting it blocks me from higher-paying opportunities my peers usually get. I have less than two days to decide. Should I accept, or reject?

Update: I've emailed them asking for a decision extension due to an upcoming career fair. I will call them later to get confirmation on what relocation expenses entail, because I'm not going if they aren't providing at least housing. If they don't reply today (since tomorrow's the deadline) or don't provide housing, then I'm definitely declining the offer. "

Specifically, does it seem a bit too flowery at the beginning? I wrote it the same way that I write my fiction pieces, so I think that that shows, especially in the line breaks. 


For a bit of context, I'm a junior in college and the internship is for a book publishing company. I've included it below!


------------------------------------


Dear [Honor Society] Internship Committee,


I have always been fascinated by books. Some of my earliest memories involve scouring the shelves at the local library for a new picture book to read. As I got older, I was known as the girl who always had a book with her, ready to read at a moment’s notice. At some point during my journey through the literary world, I realized that books didn’t just materialize out of nowhere and fall upon a bookshelf. Someone was responsible for taking an author’s manuscript and transforming it into a finished book. 


And thus, my desire to work in the publishing industry was born. 


I didn’t wait long to begin to take the steps toward my dream, even while still in high school. Already an avid blogger, I began to contact publicists and other publishing professionals with questions about the industry. I would read blog posts and articles about the various facets of publishing. I dreamed of finding my place in the publishing industry.


Now, I can say with certainty that my place is at [Job], which is why I am applying for the summer internship position. If selected, I would prefer to work with a young adult imprint, such as Razorbill, Speak, or Putnam. Additionally, I would be interested mainly in interning in the areas of editorial, marketing, or online marketing. 


Having researched [Job] and the publishing industry, I believe that my skills and prior experience make me a great candidate for this internship position. At [Name of College], I declared a major in English and a double minor in publishing and digital media design with the intention of gaining skills that would aid me in my future career. Through my coursework, I not only gained crucial skills such as copyediting and marketing, but I was also given opportunities to practice these skills in a real-world setting. In one of my publishing classes, my fellow students and I were each given 20 manuscript submissions for [College] Press, which we wrote readers reports for and ranked. The best of these submissions were then sent to a group of professors for consideration and later to the judge for that year. I greatly enjoyed playing a role in the selection process and would love the chance to do it for [Job]. 


In addition to the skills gained in my coursework, I’ve learned a lot of relevant skills outside of the classroom. I’ve worked with my school’s newspaper and literary magazines, both of which require editing skills, teamwork, and adhering to strict deadlines in order to ensure a smooth publication. I ran the social media accounts for the literary magazine, while also managing my own book blog and the Instagram page for it. Via these two channels, I discovered what is known as the “Bookstagram” community of Instagram. This community exposed me not only to beautiful photos of books, but also to marketing strategies employed by publishers and small businesses alike. Book blog tours, Book subscription boxes, Advance Reader Copies, and preorder incentive campaigns are just some of the strategies that come to mind. I would draw from this information in the internship position and use it to come up with new ideas for promoting a book. I’ve often come up with mock-up ideas for how a book could be promoted. I would love to share these ideas with [Job] and see them actually used in a marketing campaign.


I believe that my experiences, passion for books and the publishing industry, and my overall drive make me an excellent candidate for the summer internship position. I greatly appreciate this opportunity that [honor society] offers me. I am certain that if selected for this internship, it would act as a springboard for the rest of my publishing career.

af9oxd,1,2019-01-12,House Share Help,bayraycoon,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/af9oxd/house_share_help/,"Greetings, I am in need of some advice. First I will describe our current situation 
1. My husband and I are recent graduates and have relocated to a coastal city. This area in general has a high demand /low supply of housing. On average a studio cost 1,000 with no utilities included. 
2. While we both have decent paying jobs ( combined we make around 70k annually) we recently had to pay an immigration lawyer that set us back around 7k . This drained most of our savings.
3. In August , we moved in with an older couple who had too much house. They are great- regularly cooking for us, helping us out when need be and I have developed a great friendship with the women. The husband is an author and is currently on an extended trip to Europe, not expected back until late March. 
4. We pay 700 a month, which includes full use of a finished basement, a private living room, large bedroom and full bathroom. We pay no utilities.

Now it is time for the dilemma.

1. The homeowner, who is beyond kind, asked us a while back if we would mind another guest moving in “ for a bit” . While I am willing to put up with just about anything in order to save money, my husband was a bit apprehensive in agreeing.
2. The individual has just moved in , and is working 4 days a week at a volunteer based charity. He is quiet and seemingly nice, but his arrival has upset the “flow” of routine.
3. This morning, my husband wakes up for work and freaks out when he discovers the roommate and his girlfriend showering in our now shared bathroom. It just seemed like freak timing, but it set him off completely. Mostly because this kid is paying only 150 in rent ( a distant family friend of the homeowners, making no money)
4. The kid is looking for alternative living, but with no income we cannot seem to figure out how he could do this. Regardless, his internship seems to only last two months at the most. 

My request is for advice. We want to start saving for a house, and know we need a good chunk of cash to do so. Living here allows us to save with very limited stress until recently. I don’t want to move, husband claims if this continues he will be miserable. 

Any advice and comments are greatly appreciated!"

I am currently a University Student with a Software Developer Internship at a very small startup. I do have a summer internship lined up as a Software Developer but for this spring, I received an interview opportunity for a NOC internship position that is paid and runs through the University's training program. I have never heard of these positions and was wondering if anyone had any insight on whether this would be a position worth taking.

My career end goal is to run my own start-up and my current background academically is more geared towards Data Science. In my internship I am already in so far, I have worked on web development in a full-stack team and will also be doing something similar with a different tech stack in a larger company this summer. If I stay with my current internship, I will just be learning more SQL. Is it valuable for me to work in a NOC to diversify my skill-set and gain a better understanding of networking to help run a start-up? Or is it better for me to stay at my current internship and develop my more specific skill-set?

I appreciate any input!"

I've submitted probably \~8 applications as an undergrad to this company over the past 4 years, and was given two chances (I failed the technical both times). Is it possible that the committee is just not interested in interviewing me anymore due to my previous failures in the technical rounds?

History: Family grew up in poverty. Single mom, 3 kids, $15k a year salary.

When I first went to high school, I ended up dropping out a couple years in. Basically, had truancy issues and horrible grades (No Fs though, surprisingly). School threatened to get courts involved, Mom panicked and pulled me out.

Thankfully I was into gaming, saw gaming related source code and attempted to understand what was going on (with little success). Enrolled in FLVS (Florida Virtual School) to attempt to at least get my high school diploma, as my brothers were both drop outs and I really didn't want to end up in the same situation. They offered a programming class, I decided to give it a shot because it's something I've wanted to understand. That really got me going to where I can start expanding my abilities. Once I started succeeding in this programming class, I felt hope and a sense of competence, and started to ace all of my classes afterwards. Had to do a bunch of credit recovery (at one point I was taking 12 class (1 was to focus on my online classes)) and I actually managed to graduate on time! Took a bunch of AP classes at the time as well, and got 4's and 5's on all of the exams. Surprisingly, this struggle actually did well to prep me for college work. Luckily colleges like these sort of obstacle stories, and I got to go to UF, full ride (Not really from scholarships, but an opportunity type 'scholarship' for first gens). I feel like I've been poorly socialized (No friends throughout primary school and college), and as a result (I believe) I have a social anxiety disorder (evident by my bold patch on my chin from trichotillomania). Luckily I do think I am a bit better, but there is still a ton of progress to be made on this front.

Had a 4.0 up until my junior year. This is because I met my first girl friend who lived in PA. I decided to move out and have a life with her. Luckily UF had an online program, so switching over was simple (although I no longer got a free ride). GF has her own story, wanted to start a life in Colorado. I got my first job ($10 / hr) and we saved up a couple ten thousand dollars to move out (Primarily from school money and my GF's Comcast job). Currently I am working at a retail store for about 20 hours a week. I am DESPERATE to finally start a career making a nice wage and starting a real life. I've sent out a bunch of resumes (&gt;100) these past few weeks, and only one phone interview so far for a year old startup. Completely aware that I sounded like a complete amateur, but HR said she would recommend me to move forward and will get back to me later. They have a few junior positions open, so I'm hoping this will be it. That said, this is my first CS interview so I am not realistically expecting an offer. Just looking to gain interview experience at the very least so I can get a feel for what turns them off and what I should be prioritizing moving forward.

I'm in my last semester of school, expecting to graduate in May. I am only taking one class this semester, so I am looking for work asap. I don't regret my decision to leave campus, as I was desperately seeking a more fulfilling balance in my life. That said, working 20 hours a week, school full time, and also trying to not let my gf feel neglected made it hard for me to find impressive side projects to work on (such as a gameboy emulator, which I'm interested in doing but not sure if that's a good priority at this point). I chose a front-end related senior project because front end work is by far what I have the least experience in. How some people can have kids, full time work, full time school, and still find time for side projects I have zero clue.

Sorry for the long post. Wanted to include as much information that could possibly help you guys give me constructive criticism and tips. Mainly wondering what I should be prioritizing at this point. I started reading CTCI, reading advice on behavioral questions and technical questions, what I should be expecting and what not. I'm dreading having to talk about my projects because I really don't think there's much to say. If I get questions like ""Tell me about the hardest bug you've faced,"" I wouldn't really be able to come up with any responses. I mean yes I had plenty of bugs doing my compiler, but I hardly remember what specifically was holding me up. And more likely than not, it's usually fairly simple bugs that held me up for an unreasonable time. What do you guys think? Focus on my interviewing skills while applying for a job? Find a side project and not apply to jobs as obsessively as I've been doing? Or am I just unreasonably impatient as it's only been over a month?

Here's my [resume](https://ibb.co/JxYXKXD).

Some problems I am aware of :

No internship experience

Lack of impressive projects

And as a result, no real programming experience.

When the startup asked me for my salary range, I low balled and asked for 40k-70k. Is this a bad move? Or is this reasonable considering my lack of practical skills? I didn't actually intend to say 40k initially, but with the anxiety and feeling of how I was coming across I made a last minute decision to go lower than I planned to. But I also hear people working for little all the time. On one hand, I want them to realize I understand my lack of experience (I'm not arrogant), but on the other hand I don't want to make it sound like I have no confidence in my value. In reality once I'm given a shot I'm positive I can be an awesome team member. What do you guys think is a reasonable salary range to request? Living in Colorado is pretty expensive, especially now that I wont have any school money to depend on.

Any help and advice is greatly appreciated!"
afapln,2,2019-01-12,What a wonderful break,adhditude,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/afapln/what_a_wonderful_break/,"Hello all! This is a throwaway because it might get kind of personal. 

Tldr: I was medicated, then not, realized I needed them, and I'm slowly getting on the right path. It does get better!

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed when I was 7. My parents had me try a couple of medications and eventually we settled on Strattera. I think they noticed a difference and all was well. Sometime in middle school, I was taken off of it and still did fine in school and everything so it was not really a problem. I would always find ways to entertain myself on the computer. During high school, I joined my high school robotics team and learned to code and took a passion in that. I elected to take the easy way out of high school and take regular classes and spend the time I had free to play with computers and figure out how they work. I started to learn more and more about computers to where video games did not stimulate me because I knew how they worked. I had a pretty decent social life, I was not popular but most people knew of me at least. I got a 33 on my act math and 18 and 22 on the English portion. I took about 16 college credits during my time in high school while maintaining a head programming position on the robotics team. Graduated with a solid 3.4. It was not until college the problems started to get worse. 

I was studying software engineering and in the honors college at my state university. I challenged myself by getting ahead and being around kids who were more driven then I was. I quickly realized that there are different kinds of being intelligent. There generally are the people who work hard, study for hours, and dedicate themselves, and there are the people (me, and many of us I'm sure) who do minimum work, don't study and get the same good grades as others. Freshman year was easy for me as it was all lower division classes that require minimum work. Sure I had a 6 page paper 3 times a semester for the honors class, but once I got the first one done, I knew I could do it!!! That paper was a milestone for me as I was always thought I was bad at English. Sure I had work to do on it, but I finished it! The second semester of that year I got a prescription for 10mg Ritalin to make the times I had to sit down and write a little more tolerable. I went to summer camp that summer as a counselor and had some fun hanging out. I came back to school and classes were a little harder, I found myself getting good grades still but still struggling to focus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where I slide:

my fourth semester I took the hardest class of my major, my last math class, physics, intro to soc, and the class in my major with everybody else. It seemed to be easy at first but then I started working for my internship putting in a couple hours a week. I think I bit off more then I could chew because I got the lowest grades. I spent the summer living with my aunt and uncle in California and working. I would sometimes work 17 hours a day or 3, just depended on the day. I felt myself getting depressed because I had no way to meet people and socialize as most of my friends were at least 45 minutes away and most of them were out of the state. I finally started school and moved off campus to live with some of my friends. I was unmotivated (or distracted) for the first month and my grades started sliding. I knew I needed something to help me so I went back to my doctor because my Ritalin was not working anymore, I just got anxious and could not focus. I was prescribed 10mg of Focalin. I could focus now, but I also could not sleep at night. I got pretty good grades but I was playing catch up the entire semester. I did well on my finals and my grades were all right. Winter break started and I went to San Diego with friends and had some fun. One night I was bored and decided to do an adventure into my mind. On this adventure, I realized my ADHD was the reason I do a lot of things. I always wanted attention from my ex during my first year. I could never seem to get enough of whatever was in front of me. It seemed like nothing satisfied my interests. I had a panic attack and ended up in the hospital on suicide watch. I was not suicidal or anything just the policy of the hospital. Somebody in the hospital next to me died while I was waiting for everything to pass. Just not any of the sounds you want to hear while there ya know? 

&amp;#x200B;

On the rise:

Anyways, I realized I needed to change my meds and get something more stable in my life. I made some doctors appointments and explained everything to my loving and accepting parents. I got prescribed Vyvanse 10mg because I was super sensitive to the Focalin. It has been better but the honeymoon phase of it is over it seems and now I can not focus again. I started seeing a therapist who deals with ADHD and anxiety and some other things. I wanted to see them because I still have a couple years before my brain is fully done developing so I want to try and outgrow it while I still can. The second meeting came around and I started talking about my chronically messy room of laundry. They walked me through putting my laundry away and explained how to minimize the steps and reduce the stress about everything. It took me some time to actually put away my laundry but I DID IT!!! I go to the doc Wednesday for another med check. I am actually excited to tell the doc everything and the roller coaster I have gone through. I am excited about the future and what it holds.

&amp;#x200B;

If anybody has questions about studying or wants details just pm me. I just wanted to share my story and maybe inspire others. It gets better, sometimes it is important to take a step back and reevaluate what you know about yourself. "

afcy8d,2,2019-01-12,I [20M] got a girl pregnant from a one night stand,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/afcy8d/i_20m_got_a_girl_pregnant_from_a_one_night_stand/,"I'm a 20 year old college student. The girl is 19 and goes to the same school that I do. I got her pregnant from a one night stand. She told me she was on birth control at the time, which is the only reason we had sex without protection. She thinks that the antibiotic she was on at the time counteracted the birth control (side note: is that a thing? I've always taken her word for this). The baby is definitely mine (we took a prenatal paternity test) and she has decided to keep it (she is in the second trimester now, so it isn't on the table anymore anyways).

The mother had no intention of telling me. I found out because her mother saw that my Facebook profile picture had my ex girlfriend in it and thought we were still dating. She thought I had cheated on my girlfriend, so she created a fake Facebook account to message my ex and tell her about the situation. My ex then sent screenshots of the messages to me...hell of a way to find out you're going to be a father.

I have been in touch with the soon-to-be-mother since, and we are on good terms. I have let her know that I am here to support her in any way that she needs. She has brought me to multiple doctors appointments, sends me videos of the baby kicking, and all around has been really good about involving me.

As supportive as I'm trying to be, I had no desire to have a kid at this stage in my life. I would have chosen abortion, and I   kindly let her know this back in the first trimester, but she said that wasn't an option. (No, she isn't Catholic)

**I have a couple things I want to get some advice on:**

**First, should I pursue a relationship with this girl at all?** I know we shouldn't force anything, and if we weren't a good fit I wouldn't push it further. But I'd like to at least try, because it would be best for the kid and would allow me to be more involved with its life. I honestly feel like me and this girl have pretty good chemistry. We slept together for a second time the day after I found out about the pregnancy, but since then she has been friendly but withdrawn and I feel as if she has closed the door to any type of relationship between us. Her mom got pregnant at 19 and her biological dad has been pretty removed from her life, so I have no doubt that has impacted her view on the situation and of me. Obliviously a forced relationship could just lead to more emotional struggle, but do you guys think it's at least worth the attempt? 

If not, how do I be the best father I can when the two of us aren't together?

**Second, I'm not really sure what to do about my career.** I am fortunate to have an internship for next summer at a company I really want to work for, and if I don't mess up this internship should convert to a full time offer. The thing is, the hours are famously terrible in this industry, especially at the junior level. I'm talking 80-100 hour work weeks, weekend work, little vacation time, etc. for at least the first two years. After that, it gets slightly better but is still highly demanding. For that reason, most people don't start a family in this industry until their 30s - which is exactly what I intended to do before this happened. I will also be working in a different city from where the girl and my child are for at least 2 years, so I won't really be able to see the child at all. I don't want to be a shitty dad, but I also don't want to sacrifice my career at this stage of my life either. If I don't follow a certain path in my early 20s, opportunities that I really want to have later in life will be closed off forever. That's just the nature of this industry. 

And it's not like she is making any career sacrifices. She still plans to graduate college, and then at some point she still wants to go to law school. Her parents are supporting her in this plan. There's obviously a lot that can change and there's a good chance this might not ever happen, but the point is that she chose to have this kid, and right now she isn't planning to sacrifice anything. It's hard for me to feel like I should sacrifice my dream career when she doesn't intend to.

I'll also only see the kid a fraction of the year anyways unless me and the mother live together, so giving up the job I want to still only be a part time father is a hard pill to swallow. 

I know that if I did start a relationship with this girl, this career wouldn't really be conducive to maintaining it. But my kid would be in my own home so I could play a much bigger role in their life. I'd also put more consideration to switching careers if it meant seeing my kid every day instead of just every other weekend. 

The upside of my career is that it's pretty lucrative. I should be able to fund my child's education and give them whatever they want - which I fully intend to do. But I feel like money is no substitute for being a father. 

Should I switch jobs to something with less hours? If not, how do I make the most of being a non-custodial parent working a highly demanding job?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a million other questions, but this post is already long. I'll accept any advice relative to this situation even if it doesn't have to do with the two above points. I really, really want to get this right, but it also doesn't feel fair for me to sacrifice my dreams for a kid I had no say in having, and one that I still wouldn't even know about if not for the girl I got pregnant's mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I am having a child at 20 with a girl I barely know, and I'm looking for any advice for how to handle this situation.** "

So first, some background. I'm 25. I have a bachelor's in political science and legal studies. I originally planned on going to law school before having some intern experience and deciding it wasn't for me. 

 I've been in and out of learning programming my entire life. When I was a teenager I did level design on some game mod teams and had to learn some very basic scripting for that.  That was my first real experience in something software development related. In college I did some codecademy courses and enjoyed them. I made some simple choose your own adventure games that I shared with friends from those courses.

 Last year, after dropping out of my first semester of grad school I considered taking programming more seriously and started FreeCodeCamp. I finished most of the basic HTML CSS stuff before I got a job as an educator at a local library and then I stopped and focused on my new job. My new job had me doing STEM education programs for middle schools. I ended up disliking it and quit in early September. Since then I've been focusing on teaching myself to program. 

I've finished Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy and am making my way through FreeCodeCamp as well as doing some codecademy courses for extra practice. I've been practicing for at a minimum of 2 hours a day, usually a lot longer. 

My concern is that this won't be enough for me to land a job. I've looked into attending a bootcamp but they all seem too expensive and a little scammy. Does it sound like I'm on a solid path?"

Here's the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

*TLDR at the bottom!!*

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my first semester of junior year in a city college. It's relatively low-cost compared to other colleges and I have no debt thus far because my mother is able to pay for it plus scholarship money I receive. I still rely on my family and live at home. I've been pretty aimless for my entire college experience. I have no clue about what I want to do with my life nor how to proceed other than drudging through the four years to my bachelors. I also have a history of depression and it's gotten a lot worst since I entered college. I developed full-blown social anxiety and I haven't been able to make any friends. I was incredibly lonely until I started volunteering/interning at a non-prof in the school for the past year, and it's the only reason my anxiety is better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a decent GPA but I'm a generally horrible student. I'm such a severe procrastinator that I'm in a constant state of stress and sleeplessness during the semester because of my lack of motivation. I'll just stay up all night not writing papers, then writing them or studying hours before their due date. This in itself is a problem I'm ashamed of because I should have grown out of it, but that's a different issue. It's both caused by and contributes to my depression (I assume).

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, this semester was especially bad. I overloaded myself with difficult classes and an internship and I completely burned out. I had to drop a major class I needed, and I gave in all my final papers late. I was so depressed over my personal performance, that my mom or my therapist first suggested that I could take a gap semester and work. As time went on, I decided that a break would be beneficial to my mental help, and my therapist thought so too. My mother was very supportive.

&amp;#x200B;

 For the past three semesters, I've been receiving a scholarship that pays for my tuition. It's conditional, so if I don't meet 30 credits a year, I lose it. It was my main reason for not wanting to take a gap semester. How do you just take a break knowing it will cost you thousands of unnecessary dollars? I think my mom saw how distraught I was and ensured me over and over that she wouldn't mind if I lost the money if it would be good for me. The only reason I started to seriously consider taking off was because she was so supportive. It's her money she's spending on my education. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was a few months ago. Since I've gone on break (3 weeks ago), I've been forced to seriously consider what I want to do and find work for the break. I don't want to defend myself, but I literally haven't thought much about it because once I got out of school, I went completely into rest mode. I'm extremely avoidant and procrastinate, so I put it off. Everyone is telling me to do different things (get a job/go back to school/ go part time and get an internship/ get a full-time internship) and I have no idea what to do. I feel like every choice I make will be a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this past week, I finally settled on taking 2 classes and finding an internship or work on the side, but even that is an undertaking. The thought of going back is scary. I hate school so much, and because of the way I am, it's made me miserable and isolated. I feel like I can barely function in class, and I can't do well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So today, I finally tell my mom what I think I'm going to do during my gap, and she asks me (again, I've told her multiple times) what happens if I take a gap. I reiterated that I'd lose the scholarship and couldn't reapply. I think this made her nervous combined with my previous aimlessness. Against what she previously told me, she gently asks me if I want to just go back to class and take a gap later so I'll get another semester of paid tuition. She told me again that it was my choice, but asked me again if I really didn't want to go back. I didn't say anything, and she said that it felt like a waste to  lose free money and I'd sit at home depressed and jobless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Obviously, my mom is justified in doing this. It's free money and she has to pay for tuition. But I did consider this. Actually, the only reason I didn't want to take a gap was *because* of the money, and I only decided to because of how many times she told me it was okay. It's been at least 2+ months. Now, 2 weeks before class, she's suddenly asking me if I want to go back and stick it out. It changes everything. I can't justify taking a gap knowing that she prefers I go back to class. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's just that I spent a long time thinking about this. I don't even have my classes prepared for full-time because I wasn't going back. And while she still says it's my choice, she has to know that it no longer is. Obviously her rationale is valid (and a little faithless). Why would she tell me so many times that it was fine if it wasn't, and wait until I'm ready to leave to tell me otherwise? Thinking of going back full time is freaking me out. I feel so sick. I will if I have to but I don't want to. I don't know what to do. I don't think my mental health is important enough to make her pay thousands of dollars if I can manage, but all the same, my head is really spinning now that my plans might be in the trash. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her idea of delaying taking a gap is also useless to me. After the upcoming semester, I would only need to stay for 1-2 more semesters to finish my degree, so I wouldn't even bother taking a break at that point. I wanted to leave after this semester because of my poor performance and depression. So if I go back, I'd be in it for the long haul.

&amp;#x200B;

It could be I'm not thinking rationally. I don't even know if anyone will read this. I would just like someone to tell me what they think, and any advice they may have. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Tldr; I get a scholarship that pays for my tuition. I'm supported by my mom. Because of worsening mental health and confusion over career path, my mom encouraged me to take a gap year 2+ months ago. I would lose the scholarship and can't reapply, but she reassured me mult. times that she supports my choice b/c the tuition is low cost. I started planning for my gap and was set on it. Today, 2 weeks before class, mom asks me to go back full time. Stressed and don't know what to do. It's her money, but my head.*"
afhaam,5,2019-01-13,Just started my professional career for the first time in CS and already had a breakdown.,disbelivehomosapiens,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/afhaam/just_started_my_professional_career_for_the_first/,"Backstory: I'm not new to working in CS, I've worked as an intern twice in my college and quite enjoyed it. I've also worked with a team and took on some hackathon's and open source projects.

Now, I've just joined (as an intern) a fairly new startup (following scrum process) and didn't realize that there exist only two full-time employees (one of which is founder other is a bright dev). So, The company has 4 other interns and only one other who joined with me will work on the same framework as mine.  This framework is very new to the industry and requires very deep insight into it for its proper use. Also, It lack's sufficient documentation and guides at certain area's.

Here comes the problem, I've never worked on this before (briefly learned how to use it just before joining) and on the first day, I was assigned to a solo sprint with targets I had no idea how to achieve. I admit I did receive much help from the senior dev along the path till today but almost every two days I'm questioning myself and my decision to join this field especially after reading [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aeiz06/after\_6\_years\_in\_the\_fieldim\_guessing\_being/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aeiz06/after_6_years_in_the_fieldim_guessing_being/) I realized I feel exactly the same every day.

I just wanted to vent my feelings and today I finally feel okay to talk about it.  


Along with this I had a moment of existential crisis and was questioning if what I do is sustainable in long term, Like do people still code at 50? because I've read many stories of experienced people being let go for cheaper fresh blood."
afhlqy,1,2019-01-13,Should I graduate a semester early(next Jan) with a CS major or wait?,shiverborne,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/afhlqy/should_i_graduate_a_semester_earlynext_jan_with_a/,"I am currently a junior with a CS and Data Science double major - after this semester I will only need another semester to graduate. I run an applied research lab (and have been since the end of my freshman year)that does some quality work along with collaborating with high-profile external clients, and overall satisfied with my college experience, but I am beginning to burn out from coursework and kind of want to start applying my skills more thoroughly in real-world application like some of the work with my lab does.

I’ve done individual research(may turn into thesis), have a internship at a top 20 tech company this summer, and have previously done another research internship at a hospital(data analytics).  

I originally wanted to extend my remaining required  4 classes into my last 2 semesters and then do some filler/fun-learning classes for the rest of my semester load, however, it is beginning to seem to me like a waste of a semester’s tuition if it can be done in one semester.

afhsa8,0,2019-01-13,What should a cultural exchange student expect for a summer internship in the US ?,UCantHandleTheTruth8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/afhsa8/what_should_a_cultural_exchange_student_expect/,"I am a third year Engineering student on my way for the Exchange program 2019 to the host uni in San Francisco, CA.

To be honest, as an Electrical &amp; Electronics major, the program at my home uni teach many courses that are software related and as such I have a decent background on algorithm and programming. I also kept my GPA  3.6/4.0, I screwed up a bit at the beginning and have been keeping highest grade straight from then.

&amp;#x200B;

I submitted for a couple of tech company (mostly programming intern) in the region with the hope for a summer internship offer. I understand that a software background candidate is more likely in the eyes of an interviewer.

*As an E&amp;E student, what are the chances of me being accepted for a software dev summer internship ?*

&amp;#x200B;

My VISA is on Exchange Visitor, but the duration is only 6 months (for my exchange study) out of a total one year for this kind of VISA, i.e. I can ask for an extension for another 6 months if I got recommendation from the company.

*How willing are the recruiters for such matter ?*

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the competition is tight here in the industry, especially for someone **new, need sponsorship** like me and thus **I really want you to give me a reality check**.

One more thing, I understand I could have just apply for E&amp;E internship which I did, but I also want to gain the most experiences on what I love doing and  SF seems like a great place to start (I am from a small country in SEA).

afhtw2,69,2019-01-13,do no harm.,parsley_liketheplant,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/afhtw2/do_no_harm/,"I’ve been a doctor for thirty years, and I’ve had this office for fifteen. It took me a while to decide that I would probably stay here permanently, because I still had this young fantasy in my head that I would open a private practice in Australia, but I’ve realized what financially makes sense and have decided to settle down here. I can’t complain. This institute is beautiful. Floor to ceiling windows, hardwood birch paneling, touchscreen 64 inch plasma television wall inserts for “teaching”. My office is bigger than my living room, and I live in a 175000 square foot house. What else could I possibly want?

I used to ask myself that a lot, years ago, when I was still an intern. What else could I possibly want? What do you want, \[REDACTED\]? I was the most gifted student the hospital had seen in over four decades. I had only ever lost one patient within my first seven months of being there. Everyone I saw, even the most mangled, decrepit, beyond-the-point-of-no-return patients would somehow survive. If there was the slightest chance that they could pull through, I gave it to them. I pulled them up and away from almost certain deaths. At first, it was enough. I felt transcendent. These people would come to me, tears streaming down their face, clinging to their last shreds of hope, desperate for any time of redemption, help. And I was able to give it to them, watch the edges of their mouth strain against the bones of their face as they flashed the most impossible smiles, listen to them stutter, at a loss for words, at what I had given them. It was enough, it was everything. Until that seventh month.

I remember that day specifically, it was the middle of winter, but for some reason it was around seventy degrees out. I was doing my rounds at seven in the morning when I got called to the front to examine a new patient, a seventeen year old girl with intense abdominal pain upon consumption of any and all food or drink. It was noted in her file that it had been two weeks since she’d last had a bowel movement. Sounded like a textbook bowel obstruction. So I walked into her room and informed her calmly that she most likely just had a simple and easily treatable obstructed bowel, and would have to undergo an x-ray for official diagnosis. I watched the calm spread across her face at my words. I had done it again. I called the tech in and told him to take her up to the x-ray, and went to tend to my other patients. 

The wait for the x-ray was long that day, as a result her images finally got back to me around 2 pm. Upon first glance, the obstruction was obvious and large, as well as easily removable. As predicted. I told a nurse to bring her the news and let her know she would be fine. I scheduled the obstruction removal surgery for that night. It just so happened that in that moment I had nothing else to attend to, so, out of boredom, I decided to just glance over her x-rays in a more detailed manner, somewhat absentmindedly, just to pass the time. 

I was counting her cervical vertebrae (sometimes patients are missing one, it’s harmless and congenital) when I noticed that her cervical spine had an unusual sharp curve at c3. It was subtle, but there. I decided to order an MRI just to be safe. Best case scenario, I get to look at more interesting photos of anatomy. Worst case, I get to save her life twice. 

But neither of those things happened. The MRI wait time was significantly shorter than for the x-ray, and within minutes of noticing the defect in her neck I had in my hands an image of a tumour so intertwined with her spine and brain stem that it was most definitely 100% impossible to remove. The structure and placement of the tumour along with the fact that it was not present in an MRI taken 6 months prior for other reasons made it impossible for it to be anything other than a glioblastoma. Seeing as this one had a volume of approximately 100 square centimeters, and was already integrated into her brain stem, chemotherapy and radiation were not an option. This thing was too big, too enmeshed, and too aggressive. She would last maybe 4 more months, tops. 

This was the first time in my life that I knew that I was unable to save someone. There was nothing I could do. 

At first, I was nervous to tell her. What should you say in a circumstance like this? What should you feel? What do you feel? How will this affect my reputation? It isn’t my fault. It can’t be my fault. Why should I feel anything? With that realization I was no longer nervous. 

I walked to her room to tell her, opening the door to laughter between her and her mother over some joke made seconds prior. They both looked up at me with complete trust and ease. My face betrayed nothing. And it was in that moment, in that split second, that I realized I was just about to shatter their world. 

I felt a rush of the most hot, saturated excitement. It was like a concentrated release of adrenaline, filling my vision with orange and yellow, a bubble of something almost like laughter rising up in my throat, threatening to jump out of my mouth. 

I was the end. I was the beginning. I had a complete ability to change their lives entirely. I knew something they didn’t. And I was the only one who could tell them. 

I cannot explain the twisted, electric flood of pleasure that I got out of watching the smiles melt off their faces as I bestowed the news upon them. The burst of energy. My heart rate soared as they crumpled in on themselves, unable to scream as a result of the hasty compartmentalist thought that comes to most people in shock that if you stay frozen, whatever is going on around you isn’t actually happening. I explained to them exactly what was wrong, and they hung onto my every word as if I was the sole source of intelligence on the planet. I was god in that room. 

And that’s the moment when enough suddenly wasn’t enough anymore. 

I lived for that high. I envied my lesser gifted friends. The ones who had patients die inexplicably in surgeries and had to break the news to hopeful families. *I’m sorry, there was nothing we could do…* It wasn’t their fault. They got to feel the guiltless high so often, the dizzying power of utterly owning several lives for a couple of minutes in time. But my patients kept living. I kept saving lives. I was too good. Everyone is human, right? And humans make mistakes. So no one would bat an eye if I made reasonable mistakes on several extremely difficult cases every so often. Especially if there didn’t appear to be any mistake. Just unfortunate circumstance. *I’m sorry, there was nothing I could do…*

And so here I am, thirty years later, in an office the size of an olympic swimming pool,  one of the best general surgeons in America, and arguably in the world. My patients come from all over the globe, travelling thousands of miles just to see me, begging me to save their lives, usually as a last resort at the end of a long line of failed attempts. And I do, I bring them their second chance, I watch the smiles erupt and I feel the mellow calm, the small spark of generousness, the lack of something more. The letdown and subsequent boredom. But every once in a while, completely unexpectedly and improbably, an unfortunate regular patient with a treatable case finds out that they have an incredibly advanced form of glioblastoma. Only once in a while, of course. I can’t have them finding me out. Do no harm, right? I need them to need me. 

And they still do. I’ll never reveal how I do it. But I will tell you this. It is completely, entirely worth it. Every single one. I’ll do anything for that high. We all make mistakes. After all, isn’t it a doctor’s right?"

This is a throwaway because it’s gonna have some personal stuff, but meh...

I’m a sophomore and I signed FB in the middle of October. It was going great all along, but I flashed back to some of my experiences in CS in the past, and I don’t feel ready at all.

Parents both have masters degrees from India and are both well-paid business devs here. Mom makes $170Kish as the highest ranking dev at a consulting firm, and dad is bouncing back from his first unsuccessful startup with another unsuccessful startup - still making decent money, but it’s tied up in litigation fees that he accumulated with his last company. Ever since I decided I wanted to be a dev, they’ve been pretty toxic about the whole thing.... 

Mom made me take an unpaid internship at her firm before college writing C# - while I got my project done, she made me report directly to her and basically belittled me for asking questions about a 10K LOC codebase that I had no idea about. Employees loved me, but they don’t have the money to hire me again.

Second summer, dad told me he’d get me an internship and that I didn’t have to waste time applying to anything, but basically did nothing for me until May when I had no luck anyway. Interned (again unpaid) at an unsuccessful startup with dad’s friend, and he was a toxic asshole. The whole crux of the internship there was that I’m 19 y/o and don’t know shit, so I should sit back and build an app that isn’t going to add any value to the company (basically just fuck around with their graphic MVC tool - it’s like FBU or EP typa program, except it was unpaid and he was doing it as a “favor” to my dad.) Through this whole time, I was teaching his full-time devs to run SQL queries and shit because they were all incompetent, but that didn’t stop him from neglecting me and once even yelling at me in front of the whole (10 person) office for showing up at 11 one day due to a train breakdown. During this incident, one of the employees who had talked to me and knew that I was capable tried to back me up by saying I was knowledgeable with Linux, but the boss’ response was “ha! I wrote a kernel module for Linux - did this guy do anything like that ever?”

The guy thought he was helping me through some typa trial by fire shit, but basically made me sit in a corner and code whatever the fuck I wanted (in python on my own dual-booted arch laptop) the whole time. Basically, the project that he had me do was a generic webapp, except he didn’t think I knew a DB query language or a backend language, even though I sent him a resume and showed him that through club projects and shit, I knew more than his full-time employees did. The others all recognized this too - I had most of them asking me for career advice on how to move out of their .NET roles towards the end, to that effect. All in all, it was a terrible experience and I came out feeling like shit.

Basically after this, I decided not to work at anymore shitty companies that wouldn’t pay me for valuable work and didn’t value me. I grinded leetcode day and night, and got one of my friends to throw me a referral for FB. It was a bit more downhill from there, but I was mostly just glad that I didn’t have to deal with the deteriorating mental health of being surrounded by all this toxicity.

Ironically, my dad was an even bigger source of my feelings of no self-worth through the internship. He kept telling me that python and MongoDB and the stack I was trying to do my project with had no future and that I wasn’t going to accomplish anything because I had my head in the clouds the whole time. He kept telling me again and again that I know nothing and that I’ll never be successful because of it. Now, when I got FB, the first thing he did was call his friends in America and India and brag to them all that I got FB, as if it was his accomplishment for being such a good father.

I’ll end by justifying this rant’s place in CSCQ amid actual career questions. IDK if a lot of you guys can relate to toxic parents, but I can guess that a lot of you can relate to having toxic past bosses that undervalued you, and also can understand why something like this may make you feel like an impostor. 

Mind you, I don’t consider myself a bad engineer - I’ve done open-source stuff for clubs at college and am in charge of several full-stack open-source projects for nonprofits. I really like OS internals and low-level processing and networking too; I spent the last semester becoming as good as I can at C++, Rust, Haskell, and OCaml so I can pursue things like that. What I worry about is that I can’t measure up to people who’ve had Google and Amazon internships before coming to FB and are therefore worlds more experienced than me, despite working at the same place.

For those of you who interned at FB (or really any big N) in the past, and managed to convert it to an FTO or another internship: what is required to do this? This has been my first big win in a series of losses that’s been going for years, and I really REALLY don’t wanna fuck this up.

TL;DR: went from 0 with unpaid internships in .NET for small companies to 100 with a sophomore year FB internship, and am feeling the impostor syndrome setting in. What are some things I can do ahead of time to maximize my potential for another internship?"

Everyone calls her lazy and she believes it, hates herself, keeps failing. After much searching, she talks to actual experts who say her ""giftedness"" (a double edged sword lined with fresh dog sh\*te) masked her ADHD, finally sees options and answers, probably ascends to Nirvana

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** This is LONG I am so sorry I just need to vent and be understood I am so relieved

feel free to interact just reading the TL;DR I wouldn't read the whole thing either lol

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 24yo woman from Spain who did very well in school until I was around 15, doing absolutely no work at all. It was always assumed by my parents (they are actually the most patient angels and were already caring for my younger brother with LOADS of brain-damage related learning disabilities and a heart-condition) and teachers that I was lazy, uninterested and irresponsible when I started failing.

I had been recognised as having high intelligence at 7 when they made me take my first IQ test (because my teacher said I may have learning disabilities, given that I never turned in any homework, was a daydreamer, kept interrupting her -to correct her, which she hated, obviously-, and doodled all over everything and anything). 

No one bothered with me again as I had excellent grades in everything and I said myself my lack of friends and bad temper were just how I am. Over the years, when I started failing, I developed anxiety, depression and bulimia. I thought it was all my fault for having no self-control, that I was a failure and just wrong.

Somehow (thanks to private tutors that made me pay attention and a crippling fear of failure, as being academically brilliant was all I had) I get to college, fail terribly after a glorious first term. I turn to partying to take my mind of it all, never attend lectures, I even failed some classes because I got late to the final. I had to drop out after 3 years out of my 4y degree, because I had a nervous breakdown, I was redoing a ton of classes and had lost all my friends in the process. 

At 21 I go back home to my parents and work for a year and recompose myself with their and my psychotherapist's help and meds for anxiety and depression. That got better, and I decided to go back to study a sort of vocational training programme in computer programming. I loved it a lot more than college (it was Philosophy, and although I loved some of it, most of the curriculum required me to SIT DOWN AND JUST READ uninteresting things for too long and yeah... nope), but I ended up redoing a year anyway because I had to turn in homework and WHAT HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT. 

One year ago this month, I asked my psychiatrist if I could have an attention disorder, and she said it was impossible because I used a Bullet Journal (yeah... I had been applying ADHD-friendly organisational methods and coping mechanisms to get by for around 2 years), and she wanted to screen me for a personality disorder if I wanted to have an ADHD assessment. I agreed and the results were negative for both a PD and ADHD. They told me I had anxiety. I was quite devastated, as I know my anxiety is a symptom, so I just left there with no answers and believing, more than ever, that all my failures are just a result of me being a bad, spoiled, lazy person.

Fast forward to today, I am on my second year now, about to go on an Erasmus programme for my internship, and I am hecking thrilled, but I still can't turn in my work or concentrate at will, so I may fail and lose my Erasmus scholarship, I am anxious again, and my parents are at their wit's end. 

Thanks to this subreddit and r/adhdwomen I realised that women and people with high intelligence are hugely under-diagnosed and that I wasn't alone, and I could ask for a second opinion. THANK YOU SO MUCH for your posts talking about your process and your thoughts, I couldn't have stood up for myself a second time without them.

Yesterday I had an appointment with an amazing organisation for ADHD investigation that also helps affected people where I live to ask for a second opinion, and they talked to me about my previous diagnostic process and had an interview. They asked me just the right questions, I felt so seen for the first time. They told me **they had previously only passed an IQ test on me (WAIS-III) and discarded my case because I have an above average global IQ, even though I my Working Memory is well below average.** The women who interviewed me were actually quite outraged that this is how they test people in the public sector and they told me they were almost 100% certain my ""high intelligence"" has masked my ADHD all along. 

For the first time I felt truly understood and seen in this, not a spark of doubt in their eyes about what I was telling them, I could tell they weren't just thinking 'oh you big undisciplined baby looking for excuses for being a lazy lil sh\*t', and it felt amazing, I almost cried. 

This week I'll get a list of psychiatrists from this organisation to get a diagnosis and proper treatment asap (they could do this in the future but their waiting list is too long because it is a non-profit). I am so excited and relieved. I feel like I can finally see the day where I will grab my brain by the reins and **do what I know.** Executive function deficit get ready to be challenged!!!!!!"

Am I the only one that is thinking about my A level results day 2019 now? hehe

Well to start off, my life in jc was really hell, but it was interesting and it was really something that I should really be proud of. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression issues when I was much younger, after O Levels, I decided to take on the path of A Levels despite foreseeing the amount of hardships I have to gone through. Whenever I was feeling stress or anxious, my body will feel unwell physically, just like a sick person. Well, I was correct, due to my issues, I behave in certain ways that my classmates don't understand at all, as a result, my classmates started to ostracise me in class and bitch about me behind my back, they excluded me in a lot of things, such as during birthdays everyone in the class will have present that is purchased using class funds except for me. Well, it was painful at that period as I have my own reason but I could not disclose to them as I'm afraid they may spread. During recess, I'm always alone, studying alone actually. During lectures, my classmates will not want to sit with me and I'm the only one sitting myself at the whole row in lectures. Due to all these false rumours my classmates spread, my closest secondary school friend that have been with me for 6 years have decided to end the friendship right before A levels!! I was a Physical Education Representative in my class, and my classmates sometimes do not treat me as one as they are unwilling to pass my their valuables for safekeeping. During PE lessons, I am supposed to lead them, however, they did not really heed my instructions too... :(

Well, going to school was hell for me as well, sometimes, when the MRT was too crowded, I will feel unwell and have to alight to rest at the MRT station bench for a few minutes before hopping on to the MRT Train to continue my journey to school. No matter how unwell I felt, I make sure I came to school and attend lessons! There was never a day I took MC during my jc life! At most when i felt unwell, i will excuse myself and go to the toilet to calm down. I have had a lot of family issues these 2 years too! (I am really glad that all this have come to an end)

I'm really grateful for the support given to me by my school leaders, school counsellors and discipline mistress. I took the initiative to make new friends and overcome my issues through activities such as being an Orientation Group Leader. Through these platforms, I have achieved a lot despite my psychological issues, I have attained awards on the school platform and even on the international platform which was awarded by President Halimah Yaccob during my short 2 years in Junior College. :D

Despite knowing that I have anxiety issues, I did not see that as an excuse in telling myself to stop progressing. Instead, I worked extremely hard in JC1 and got into my school's scholars programme for JC2. There was never a time where I failed any subjects for examinations during these whole 2 years, I passed every subject and remain top 20 percentile throughout my 2 years in JC. However, I don't know if I should feel sad for myself, I have worked hard everyday since February for my A levels. I am 100% confident that there was never a day that I slacked off till the end of my last papers. During Exams, I have 6 access arrangements to help me for my A levels, some of my classmates saw my access arrangement and they laughed at me. ( I felt really hurt) During my last paper which was H2 Physics Paper 1, I was well aware of my health condition, as A level period was 1.5 months, my mental strength and my mental health were on the verge of collapsing. I have did what I could by requesting for a separate room, but I felt really unwell during the paper. (I hope I did well though) But even if I do not get my 3 H2 As, should I blamed myself? I'm not too sure and have been pondering on this question for quite a long time. Somehow I blamed myself for not being mentally strong enough even though its the last paper, somehow I dont blame myself as I felt that I cannot really control what my health status is? But there's one thing for sure, I'm proud that I have finished A levels! :D

Really thankful for my vice principal especially, he told me if I have any issues in school, just go straight to his office and find him, he will help me. Which I did all the time and felt bad for disturbing him 😅 

To everyone reading this, i just have to say, no matter how shit your jc life is, just press on and you will see the rainbow at the end! :D!

As for me, I have completed one month internship with a government agency (security sector) and I’m temporarily covering for my tuition teacher as a cashier as she do not have enough workers. My national service is in February, after Chinese New Year and I predicted another hardship as I am being graded as a combat-fit soldier despite the army knowing about my issue. I will persist in the army and hope that I can find a cure to my issue in the army 🤗😁

:) Look forward to all your replies. Thank You!

I will start my internship in the next month and go on until the end of to July. After that I hope to get my diploma and finish my web app development course. The degree is not the same as in a regular graduation system (it's one level below it in my country).

I want to start putting together a portfolio with my best projets (from uni and Udemy). Also I will start my own projects in the near future I hope.

I assume questions like this are often asked in this sub but I want to have advice on the best resources out there for building an effective portfolio (the things that could make me stand out). The way I would show my skills to potential employers, how to write effective text, social media interaction, contact forms or even how to show my projects to the world (I'm thinking of adding a demo of them).

Thanks in advance, best regards programmers!"
afjqt7,2,2019-01-13,How do I choose between two jobs?,A1roller,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/afjqt7/how_do_i_choose_between_two_jobs/,"Okay, so here is the situation. I'm currently studying a Computing conversion (Masters) course at university, due to end soon. My goal at the beginning of my course was to escape the customer service job that I hated by becoming a software engineer.

I was lucky enough to apply for and be offered a role with the company I had been doing customer service with; a data analyst role which I've just started this week. The job is decently paid and they have kindly allowed me to work part time until I've finished my studies.

I've also been applying for other jobs over the past few months and have been offered another job; a software engineering role. Although this role seems like it would be much more interesting and related to what I studied on my course, the pay is significantly worse (to the tune of £10k over the year) as it is an 'internship'. For this reason, money is the critical factor holding me back from taking this other job (as well as a number of other minor factors such as the fact that it is a further commute, and only a 12 month contract - although I've been informed I would be taken on afterwards if the internship was a success).

I'm scared of leaving my current role to pursue this new role and am not sure it is the right thing to do for a number of reasons. Firstly, I am applying for other grad schemes which are significantly better paid (closer to the wage that I'm on with my analyst role). There is a chance I may get onto a different, better paid grad scheme which would alleviate my salary concerns. My assessment of the UK software engineering scene is that it's possible that it may take a number of years to get back to a stage of earning my data analyst salary if I'm particularly unfortunate.

Looking to the long term makes me even more confused about what to do. My long term goal is to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. This year, I plan on beginning a property development and investment company. I have been saving for a number of years to get into a position to do this, but think I may struggle to sustain the growth I have planned for in the first few years of the company on a significantly lower salary.

Becoming a skilled software engineer has its entrepreneurial benefits; I would hope to acquire the skills necessary to launch my own SaaS apps and web apps, as well as potentially freelancing. I'll likely need to work for quite a while before going full time with my property business and I'd rather make good use of that time learning software development as opposed to data analysis where the scope of entrepreneurial opportunities is likely to be much smaller.

Overall, just really confused about what to do. I know that whichever path I take, it doesn't mean I need to stick with it long term (e.g. I may be able to move on from the internship sooner than 12 months onto a better paid SWE job), but I'm still struggling to make a concrete decision."

I am an undergraduate CS student in Canada, and I'm trying to apply for summer research spots in the US to hopefully land myself more experience and a rec letter. I sent out a bunch of emails to professors directly thinking I might hear back from just one, but now I've heard back from 3 different universities and I'm not sure how I should go  about it. Should I keep going through with the application for all 3? My worry is is that at the end I'll have to reject 2 of them, and those 2 professors might be offended. But if I just shoot for one and it doesn't work out I'd screw myself over. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL:DR Since summer internships are more personalized than grad school application, would professors be offended if I turned them down after months of talking to them?"

I am a Junior Pursuing CE at a Decent college/Univ. Lost three years of my life to drug addiction. Dropped out of college for 2 years. 

Was a complete bum until early 2018 when I applied to GSOC and did not get selected which shattered my image.

Realized a lot of devs of my age were way ahead of me in terms of their skills/knowledge. Worked hard, read a lot. Did an intern at a startup. 

Recently i joined a developer mentorship program of a really large software org and noticed that many of my colleagues already had at least 3 interns at orgs like redhat and 3-4k lines of code in the form of open source contributions.  

Right now i feel as if i will never be able to cope up to that level given how fast the industry changes, with languages popping in and out and tech stacks evolving/replacing each other. I feel lost, i do agree this is the result of my own actions. I used to be good back in HighSchool, won a hackathon in my freshman year of college.I imagined being at that level back when i was in Highschool,at a fortune 500 / Big N Software org. Torvalds had written Linux at the age of 21, meanwhile, I am not even remotely close to that kind of achievement.

I feel as if I have no other option but to switch to Product Management get an MBA etc,my sister does it and I know I can easily do that.

afmcvl,3,2019-01-13,Looking for some advice/help,-Irish-Day-Man-,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/afmcvl/looking_for_some_advicehelp/,"This is a bit of a wall of text but the first two paragraphs are just an intro to my situation, everything else before TL:DR is covered in the TL:DR and the last part is what I'm looking for help/advice with

So I've been working in a company for about 6 months now. It's the same company I did my internship with back in Third Year of college (Which lasted for about 8 months). I decided to go back there after I graduated because I really liked doing the work, I liked the team and there was decent perks to working there with the only downside being that there were a few systems in work that I didn't really like using. 

In the past 6 months though since I've been back I've (naturally) been given more complicated work from when I was an intern which I'm really happy about because I genuinely love programming. The problem is that in this company, there is so much red-tape that it makes doing most jobs a complete and utter pain. I know that regardless of where I work, there's always going to be some sort of red tape whereever I work but the stuff I'm running into is honestly making me miserable and stressed out to as much as I can take. 

To give you an idea of what I've run into (I primarily deal with Microsoft and .NET based tech)...

A number of very commonly used Dev sites such as parts of Stack Overflow, MSDN Documentation pages and most other Microsoft and Google owned Dev sites are all blocked, Most Github download pages (It seems to be very selective about what it will and won't download). 

Leading on from that point I once had a job where I had to make a script that would take a copy of our main data-warehouse and miniaturize it so that each person on the team could have a local dev enivornment on their own respective machines. Obviously, this would need to be easily synchronizable to the main data warehouse so it would be up-to date. I found a C# and PowerShell package that'd work and do everything I needed to perfectly, best part, it was made my MicroSoft themselves. The download however was blocked. I spent the guts of a day trying to find work arounds or any other similar unblocked libraries but I couldn't. I ended up going the way that work would normally want us to go, and it took a little over a month for them to unblock the site, but only for a certain time frame, despite the fact that it was Microsoft that ran the site. Once it was unblocked, I finished the job in no time at all. I've run into a few scenario's like that and it usually takes a similar amount of time to get a site unblocked. All these times it's been for very popular software from well-known companies like Microsoft, Google, Neo4J etc. 

The most annoying thing and the thing that made me want to write about this was in the first place was that just before we went off for Christmas Break we were talking about new projects we could do to put our team in the spotlight for 2019 and one of the guys suggested that I try do some AI/Machine Learning stuff and take the lead on that project as I did some modules in it in college so I was more than happy to do it and take the lead on it. Over Chirstmas I was researching what I'd use for different parts of the data we had access to over Christmas and came back with a few ideas ready to go. Only I ran into another major blocker. I was planning to use Python for it seeing as how there's so much support for Python libraries out there that use Machine Learning only work has blocked access to Pip completely, meaning no libraries. I was just trying to download NumPy but then figured I'd download Anaconda seeing as how that had pretty much every library I'd need however because of various constraints in work, the newest versions of Anaconda didn't work properly. So I had to install different versions of Anaconda blindly until I could find a version that'd work with the different blockers I had already encountered and had the features that I needed. Then it turned out that while Anaconda had support for one of the libraries I was looking for it needed to be installed manually using the command line which again was blocked. So I tried to download it and install it manually based on the GitHub Repo (One of the few that were unlocked) and had to manually install each requirement that the library and that the new packages had. It worked for a while until I hit one that the GitHub download wouldn't work because of, again, the blockers. It took me about 3 days (Tuesday -&gt; Thursday) to get to this point so I decided to bring my laptop in on Friday, use my phone as a hotspot and see if I could get it all set up easily enough on that. It took me literally 3 minutes and two Pip Install commands to get it to exactly where I needed it to be. 3 days vs. 3 minutes. I decided I'd try and upload it onto my own GitHub repo and download it on the work machine, or at least try to (Most other normal methods are blocked). Coincidentally, I had my 6 month probation review on that day with my manager who's always been really nice and understanding and was really happy with the work I've been doing. I brought up how the blockers had been making work a bit of a nightmare and he was in total agreement with me and he despises it also which is great to hear but as much as he would love to change it it's not in his control, nor in his managers control and I'm not even sure if it's in his managers, managers control. Regardless, I left the meeting only to waste the rest of my day trying different methods to download the working version of Anaconda that had everything I needed and using every workaround I had at my disposal only for it to be for nothing.

Those are just two of the main examples I have and as much as I love doing the work when I'm not getting blocked by blockers the constant walls I'm hitting is making me completely miserable. I know I can do the work, I know I can do it well but it seems that the higher ups (who likely have 0 experience at all in any development field) want me to be as slow and inefficient as possible because even if they do give access to something like Pip, it'll likely be blocked again a day or two later.

**TL:DR:** *Work has insane amount of blockers impeding me from working that include various basic things like certain Stack Overflow/Microsoft Dev/Google Dev sites being blocked, Pip being blocked on python and equivalent functions being blocked in C# and PowerShell and it's making me completely miserable.* 

It's gotten to the point where this is making my already shitty mental health even shittier and that I really don't want to even head into work this coming week to face this shit again. I've been told by a few friends and my parents (parents aren't in the industry at all) that if I were to leave and go to another job (I already have an offer from a friend in a company they work in) after 6 months it would look really badly on me and I should wait it out but this is honestly just making me depressed to shit at this point. The main reason that I haven't already left is because I really do like the team I work on (they also deal with this shit and they all hate it too) and I don't want to disappoint them but I'd say a good 75% of the time I've been working here has been me trying to find workarounds to blockers or being delayed because of them.

Submitting in a few subs, so some of you may see this twice. Throwaway account for identity purposes. 

I am currently 21, and an undergraduate junior in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

At the same time, I also started my first IT job at 16. I managed to skip over helpdesk roles and jump straight into a corporate-esque internship. I'm currently an IT Consultant and a Jr. Sysadmin. I'm on my 3rd year in this position. I recently turned down an 80k offer to finish my degree (they wanted me to drop and work full time). 

I'm coming up on the time where I finally need to pick one- Engineering or Sysadmin, which is difficult for me since I love both fields very much. 

Obviously I can't have you all just tell me what to pick. However, I am still planning to graduate in my current program regardless of what I choose. 

Therefore, my questions are:

1. Does an ECE degree hold any merit for this role? I will also have a HPC minor, as well as a CS minor. 

2. My resume isn't posted on here, so I can't expect exact numbers, but how will salaries compare? Money isn't everything, but also does hold some weight.

3. If you wish to provide input, do you have any pros/cons or opinions on choosing one field over the other?

afn50v,6,2019-01-13,Getting Ready for ADHD Testing in a Month: What to Expect and Not Expect,WonderfulBerry3,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/afn50v/getting_ready_for_adhd_testing_in_a_month_what_to/,"Hi Everyone,

I have seen the symptoms of ADHD in me for a long time and due to financial reasons and well, ADHD, I couldn't follow up with a mental health professional. I've finally been able to set up an appointment. I have been reading a lot of posts on this sub regarding how things have changed for a lot of people and how they're a ""different person"" after taking medication etc. I'm trying not to get my hopes up and therefore, sharing the problems/symptoms I face and think is from ADHD and wondering if they will be fixed or get better with the help of medicine

To give you a little background, I have a full time job in digital marketing and I have an MBA degree. I'm 30 years old and have been in a relationship for about 4 years. Although it might sound like a good life in general, I do have certain troubles in life (I'm an immigrant, creating a new life etc.) that often makes me distracted. I don't suffer from depression or anxiety for too long - the most I have is for 24 hours. I never have suicidal thoughts. I'm usually a very cheery person and my coping mechanism includes sarcasm/humor. Some days I feel like I'm the most social person in the world, some days I feel like I need to move very far away from humanity and live in a cabin in the woods. I don't have any addictions for now, but there are times when I start smoking and it's incredibly difficult to give up. I don't want to do that - I want to be the guy who stays smoke-free for years.

The issues I struggle the most with are as follows. I would like your expert opinion on how these are usually managed with medication/other means once diagnosed:

1. **I lack consistency.** I'm inconsistent in every single thing I do. I start learning something (example: coding), I make it through a month, then I slack off for 6 months. I try to build a new habit, I persist for a month at most, and then I'm back to being me again. Some times I'm the best partner in the world, some times I'm the worst. I understand and know most things about my job, how to make it in a good relationship etc. yet I almost always fail because I can't keep that standard up. One example is I was doing an internship for a company - the first month they thought I was the best intern they ever had and were thinking about making me full time. Then the next couple of months I slacked off, got disinterested, barely made through the internship, let alone the job. These things keep happening on my current job as well. I might be my actual productive self 10-15% of time and even that is very inconsistent. If I didn't know what to do and if I didn't meet the minimum requirements, I would not have a job. I meet minimum requirements, but some days I'm also a superstar.
2. **I'm disorganized.** I'm super disorganized. I tried to create a habit of organizing, color coding, etc. then I slack off. My desktop is cluttered, my home is not necessarily a mess, but it's far from organized. That gets reflected in my life as well. I only am organized if my life dependent on it: for example, get a bunch of docs together to submit to immigration otherwise they'll kick me out of the country.
3. **I have the skills - I just don't do.** I don't know if it's an ADHD thing or if it's chronic procrastination. I have the skills to do things - my job, coding, be a good partner. I have beautiful things happening inside my head - their outcomes etc. I have read a bunch of self-help books: I have a lot of them on discipline, time management, organizing, dealing with people etc. - but I don't practice any of them. I'm mostly run on a shitty auto-pilot.
4. **I always feel like I can be better.** I don't think the position I am in today reflects my abilities. For example, for MBA, I had to go through GMAT. I had an 80th percentile score - but i think it could've been much better. For example, when I was studying for GMAT, the first month was perfect. I followed my study routine well, learned well etc. Then as usual, I started to slack off, did not continue to give the same or nearly the same level of effort. If I were able to hold on to the same routine for just another couple of months, my score would've been much higher. I feel like that for everything - if I can just hold on to the same level of effort for just a little longer, it would be much better.
5. **I can't pick things back up.** To continue from point #4, ""breaks"" don't work for me either. If you say I probably got burned out from effort, maybe I need to take a couple of days off. I did and it didn't work. And that's true for everything I do. If I feel burned out, I take a break and I don't pick things back up when started. Yes, the first couple of days I'm supposed to feel rusty, but it just never gets better for me because I stop trying very soon. This happens with everything.
6. **I get distracted way too easily, by anything.** I didn't want to mention this since this is the definition of ADHD, but anything is enough to distract me from anything. It's not the devices or the internet only, but also any emotion or thoughts. If I'm working and then I have a small fight with my girlfriend, it's enough to ruin my productivity for the entire day. As if I'm using the fight as an excuse to not work. A lot of people can work to take their minds of such things, whereas I cannot go back to normal. It also includes certain things that are happening in my life that's making me anxious, but I'm not going back to any decent level of productivity after that.
7. **I want to have a million hobbies whereas I don't even have one.** I want to be the guy who travels, codes, plays with model trains, plays awesome RPG video games, solves puzzles, have healthy lifestyle etc. However, I'm also the guy who gets bored very easily. The reason I bring up RPG is that I have never finished a single game. I own Skyrim, GTA, etc. - yet I always get distracted and bored very easily. The games that doesn't follow a linear path, I can't finish. The only RPG I have finished in the last 2 years was Uncharted 4 and I was able to because it followed a linear path. But I want to play and finish the other games.
8. **I feel like I've always cheated.** I feel like through my studies (and life in general), I tried to game it vs. actually learned. For example, networking and boasting has a better chance of giving you a job, not the learning itself. You learn on the job most of the times. Therefore, I got the degrees, but didn't actually learn. I feel like I'm gaming everything in life vs. actually going through the process. 

These are some of the things that I was able to write down, but I'm sure there are a lot more. If I remember anything else, I'll update this post. (I'm sure I will not follow up with this either lol.)

I have read about ADHD: treatment and medications. There's no cure-all medication. I'm aware in order to fix these issues, I have to have my own system, medication is just there to facilitate. And I'm okay with that. This post is to ask you how can you put these two things together. For example, I want to stick to coding indefinitely - if there are breaks, I'll pick them back up again - and I will not procrastinate on the projects. I want to know how does non-procrastinating techniques, habit building exercises and medication combine together to ease the situation for an ADHD patient. I want to have a healthy lifestyle: how does lifestyle improvement techniques and medication combine together for a sustainable output?

Thank you in advance for reading this and sharing your valuable thoughts and experiences."

I am fairly experienced in CS I would say compared to the target students for this internship and my friend who is similarly skilled actually got an SWE offer from M . I am taking Operating Systems and Algorithms next semester which are both junior level classes. I have taken Data Structures, Computer Systems, and a bunch of other CS classes too. I also have experience with ML techniques like Neural Nets. I feel that due to this they will ask me harder questions than the other candidates for Explore.

I have done my research and read Courtney Thurston's Guide on M's internship programs, and I have looked at glassdoor for the questions they ask. Obviously I have been doing leetcode, and reading CTCI. 

There seems to be a lot of variance with some people getting asked questions like ""reverse a string"", and some people getting asked questions that are actually leetcode medium level. The PM questions seem to be all similar difficulty.

I just wanted to see what type of questions they asked you guys at the final round, how experienced you are in cs, and if you got the offer."

When me and my close friend had an internship at the local grocery store. Everything went well except 2 minor incidents. 

This happened 4 days into the internship. We were on lunch break and went into the locker room to talk. In the locker room there were 2 bathroom doors. We sat down on the benches next to the doors and started talking. As the conversation went on my friend mentioned that he was going to meet a girl later that day. Now at this time we are 15 year old boys and the hormones were crazy. 

We started to talk about what they were going to do. He mentioned that he was gonna spank her, lick her, let her put him in handcuffs and everything you can imagine. The conversation went on for about 5 minutes. Laughing and screaming.

Everything was great until we heard a phone notification, at first we thought it was one of our phones. But then we realised it came from inside one of the doors. We totally freaked out and stopped talking and laughing immediately. We ran out of the locker room and tried to calm ourself.

We stood outside praying it was not someone that worked with us and just a delivery guy or something. A minute passes and out comes our religious boss. He did not look happy. He just gave us a look and walked past us and said. Time for work! 

We did not talk with or even look at our boss for the next 3 weeks. We just shamefully wandered around packing up groceries. 

That was the first incident, and the second thing that happened is that my friend was cutting open a cardboard box and slipped with the knife, stabbing me in the arm. It BLEED, ALOT. I don't think our boss was too happy with us. 

Even to this day he still gives me weird looks when I come into the store. 

TL;DR Me and my friend talked dirty in a locker room at our internship without knowing our boss sat in the bathroom. We had 3 awkward weeks after that. And too add to that my friend stabbed me with a knife so I bleed all through the grocery store.

afp37w,12,2019-01-13,Social Anxiety Is Ruining My Life,Alosar,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/afp37w/social_anxiety_is_ruining_my_life/,"I've always had problems talking to people and forming interpersonal relationships, but it's now at a point where it's safe to say that it is ruining my life. 

I only have two people that I somewhat regularly talk to, because they're friends from all the way back in elementary school. My family life is fucked, I live alone in a small apartment and talk to them only very occasionally. The only person from my family that I have a deeper connection with is my twin sister, who however has moved to the other side of the country, so I only see her very rarely. Even she doesn't know of the full extent of my anxiety and depression, I think she just thinks that's who I am. 

---

I just turned 21 now and I'm about to finish up an internship at an IT company, that I luckily got not because of my social skills, but because I was top of my class and they offered it to me because of that. Just like with every other job/school I've been to before though, I talk to no one unless it's absolutely necessary and I have to do it because of the job. I feel uncomfortable and don't feel like I can relate to anyone there, even though they're not bad people or anything.

Now my supervisor came up to me last Friday and told me that while I do my job well, I won't be able to get a full time position after the internship (which was the mutual plan from the start) because of my lacking social skills and me not talking to anyone. This honestly didn't surprise me that much, but it still hit me like a brick. I was trying to hold back tears and felt completely dumbstruck for the rest of the day, not because I want the job so desperately, but because this is the nail in the coffin in my realization that my social anxiety is absolutely ruining my life. 

I am dealing with depression because of how miserable my life is and because of how terrible it feels to miss out on life. Life is passing me by and I watch every year go by with minimal change. I've never even kissed a girl, I spend most of my time playing computer games or browsing the internet, because I have nothing else to do. The thought of engaging in social activity, let alone go to parties or something, ignites instant panic in me.

The thing is that my supervisor offered to give me one last chance to better my social behavior in the remaining 1.5 months of my internship. He's surprisingly nice considering that most people usually write off my social anxiety as ignorance, and I don't hold a grudge against him for not wanting to employ me, I honestly probably wouldn't employ myself either. He recommended me to join an acting club because he believes that would help, but honestly that just made me panic and I can't even see myself doing something like this. I think I literally couldn't do it. He said I should think about it over the weekend.

So what do I do? I can't see myself joining an acting club, the thought of that alone frightens me and I think I would only leave even more retreated in my shell. But if I say no that would show them that I'm not trying to better myself. The thought of seeing a therapist sounds more promising to me, there would be less pressure and I could try to figure myself out as to why I am like this. I definitely think it has to do with past experiences in my life, I developed trust issues from an abusive mother that might have developed into me not being able to get personal with anybody.

Then again I started questioning if it might be better if I don't even try to stay at that company after the internship. People there, while nice, already have the impression of me being a freak, and the longer I know people the harder it is to be myself around them after all this time. I might need a fresh start or just some time off for myself to really self reflect and get a handle on things. I just want to start living and stop this endless cycle of mundane existence. Regardless, tomorrow I have to tell my supervisor what I have envisioned for the future, and I still don't know.

Any advice is appreciated, especially if you've been or are still going through the same things. Thanks."

TL;DR: My life has been chaos management for years and I’m just tired and venting. 

I just feel absolutely broken and defeated, and then feel guilty for those feelings because there are so many people who have it worse. My life has seemingly been one crisis after another, and I’ve been in damage control mode forever.

- 4.5 years ago I started college (for one of most intensive majors) and my high school sweetheart went to basic training for USMC
- 4 years ago said SO came home (after being stationed stateside but elsewhere) before deploying to literally the other side of the world. He proposed 1.5 days before he left for two years. 
- 3-4 years ago, roomie #1 was very open about having an eating disorder and other self-diagnosed conditions and quite vocal about about her maladaptive coping mechanisms. To the point where I stayed up each night while she symptomed making sure sure was still alive. The fear of waking up to a dead roommate was constant. 
- 3 years ago I had to fight the head of housing to move out of my room. My RA, GRA, academic advisor, and the chaplain had to get involved for a room to magically open up. 
- 3.5 years ago SO calls me belligerently drunk and having a mental breakdown, confiding that he was the sole survivor of a mission and his friend died in his arms. 
- 3.5 years ago we also thought he had cancer among the double knee surgery and weird condition of his spine (because of USMC) 
- 3 years ago I was sent to PEDS (because I was 19) because my PA at my campus thought my heart was going to stop. 
- 3 years ago SO visit for the holiday. He ended up totaling my father’s jeep (while I was a passenger), being arrested for a DWI, and I handled all the legal initial fees and all paperwork. Because he was “too traumatized.” Oh and he threatened me to tell the responding officer I crashed the vehicle because he “couldn’t risk his career” 
- 2-3 years ago roomie #2 also has an eating disorder and relapses while we are living together. Sent to a residential facility because, well, that’s what she’s needed. 
- 1.5 years ago SO moved stateside but 13 hours away. 
- SO continued to grow more verbally manipulative toward me but I didn’t notice. Continuously asking the full time college student working two part time jobs and completely supporting myself independently to send HIM money. 
- This past July I took a road trip down to Florida and drove back. Spent 1 day with family and 4 with him because he “needed” it more. I ended up paying for my whole trip as well as 95% of the time together. The Airbnb, dinners, all the gas (and he insisted on driving 1.5 hours away for dinner), drinks, etc. 
- In August SO suddenly just came home for the fair. Furious with me for working 30 hours on the weekend because I didn’t know he was coming up. It was a surprise. I switched things around and long story short find out he is cheating on me. 
- I confronted him, and he actually A) denied all possibilities that he could ever cheat (despite me having hard evidence) and B) he criticized me and blamed me saying that I drove him to cheat. Also *apparently* I cheated on him so that meant he could. He also asked “How many did you find out about?” 
- In September I broke up with SO after being engaged for four years. He threatened suicide, violence, stalking, etc. 
- GOOD NEWS: I had started falling for a coworker who was letting me crash on his couch while I was living in two different cities. He started falling for me too. We were best friends for the summer too. So in September (after I broke up with the last one), we got together. 
- Ex threatens to find new boyfriend and flat out kill him. Multiple times. 
- I move to another city an hour and 15 minutes away for my internship (last part of my degree!) 
- Still in September, I get into a car accident on my way into work. All my family lives 3 hours away. Turns out my roadside assistance on my insurance was canceled. Also my AAA membership that was apparently a Christmas present was never renewed. So paid for it out of pocket. I missed a full week of my internship where I need a certain amount of hours. 
- Boyfriend is visiting and even commuting to and from his city. 
- Naturally, both of our cars break down within 12 hours. Both of us are new to the city. 
- Boyfriend’s mother was thought to have cancer (found out a week ago that she does NOT - YAY) 
- Boyfriend quit job and moved in with me - yay! 
- Boyfriend got sick right after Thanksgiving and has been basically continuously sick since 
- Boyfriend’s cousin now has bone cancer throughout his body. They’re giving him 5 years AFTER a restorative surgery. The guy is 43. 
- (Also, boyfriend’s family is small. I can count all of them on my hands) 
- Ex suddenly has a girlfriend who just gave birth to his child. (Obviously he cheated. Also, girl #4 I found out about) 
- Ex is threatening to give my address to his friends who “have been itching to beat someone up” 
- ** I had the local police add my apartment as a local checkpoint
- Boyfriend was having severe abdominal pain. Went to ED three times in 2 weeks. 
- Turns out it’s alcohol withdrawal. 
- Thursday he started hallucinating (from the withdrawal and sleep deprivation). Friday morning he thought he saw someone building a bomb in our living room. He called the cops. Cops called him an ambulance 
- Boyfriend is now in the hospital on watch for severe alcohol withdrawal. His family and i are trying to convince him to willingly go to detox.  
- I have $19 in my account and no job. My internship is full time but no pay. He’s been out of work for three weeks. There’s hardly any food in the apartment. 

I’m pretty sure I skipped some other big things too. There’s just been so much going on. 

I am just so tired and broken. 

For anyone who read all that, bless your soul. Thank you. "

I don’t want to go back school. 

I’ve posted a lot here and a few other places. But the more I ask about potential careers the more I’m told I have vague ideas of what I want to do and/or stop being entitled. I’m working  on the second part not because I believe I am but because apparently people keep thinking I’m expecting what I want right now. I’m not, I’m solely looking to break into an industry.

I feel like the more I think about my skills and especially my interest, the more shallow I feel. I don’t feel useless or unskilled, just undefined.

I’ve always of thought of things in terms of what I want to do it because I’m always pretty confident , and been described consistently as doing so, picking up skills. I’m a good learner and very driven.

I like talking to people, working out, women, video games, math, science, technology, computers, and I feel like lot of other things too. I’ve been described as intellectual curious and agree with it. I want to make 6-figures sometime by 30 if possible, but I just can’t figure out what the fuck to do or chase after.

My only experience is in retail, warehouse, and a gym. You don’t have to remind me of the situation I put myself in by not doing internships. I didn’t want to do something in Econ but I know an internship then would’ve still helped now. I’m willing to do an internship now if need be. Ive never thought I was above it, I’ve just really struggled with interest. 

My parents keeps telling me not to be concerned about money from a job(albeit they disagree on things) and to try and just find something I’ll like doing. I agree with mom atm at finding something that pays enough for some independence. Dad keeps encouraging me to find a entry level to a career that’s I’ll enjoy and be passionate about.

I know I don’t want to do sales and I’d like to avoid more college (I didn’t have to pay for my degree/no debt and I hated school). I’m prepared to do a lot of self teaching if need be. I thought about programming but seems like the community on Reddit is pointing out its doesn’t really seem like something I’m particularly interested in(they kept asking me why I want to do programming. I’d done it before off and on).

I’m not trying to lash out at any of the groups I mentioned, I’m just saying a lot of my attempts at figuring something out go nowhere. That’s not their fault, it’s mine. I want to fix that. I want to be able to say more than I want power and money. 

I have an appointment with my career advisor but want to come in with ideas. Some have asked, so I’m an INFP(not saying that matters)

&amp;#x200B;

Some background.  I'm a 23 year old male and recently graduated college with a BSBA in MIS and Marketing and currently work part-time at a DoD contracting company as an ""Intern"". The ""Intern"" position is kind of catch-all in that you don't have many set duties. You are assigned a general area of sorts but you're pretty much free to pursue any area of the company that interests you. I've been working on web development for most of my time at the company. I've been at my current position for just about a year now and I LOVE the company and people I work with.  This is the first company who I feel actually treats their employees like family.  I just passed my IAT Level 2 certification (CompTIA Security+) and have my interim top secret clearance with the DoD.  I've been in the interview portion of the clearance for my Adjudicated Top Secret clearance for about a month or two now so I will likely get my full clearance ideally within the next month or so but this could take longer depending on how long the adjudication takes.

Having all of that clears me to work on contracts as a primary or sub-contractor and my company has put my resume out to a couple of places which I should be hearing back from shortly to schedule an interview.  The position in question is for Java development on a web application of some kind.  They don't go too much into detail but the contract seems to include front and back end development, systems analysis work, UI design and such. Also the contract is for Entry Level to Experienced programmers.  This job pays really well from my understanding even with minor experience so I'm definitely excited for that.  The only problem is I don't know if that's what I want to do.

I don't mind coding but it wasn't my strong suite in college. Additionally, I never actually worked in Java before in my life.  I worked in Visual  Basic and C++ for my college courses so some of the information translates but not all of it.  I'm currently using Hacker Rank for practice in Java before the interview but I'm getting a little stressed since I don't know when the interview will be or if I will ever hear back from that job.

My questions are as follows:

1. What should I be doing to prepare for these interviews?  I've never had experience with a coding interview before and I don't want to be in the dark for these questions.
2. Should I wait for my full clearance to come in to look for jobs that I might be more well suited for?  Almost all of the jobs I would be applying for are in the Northern VA area but I want to start working soon so I can have peace of mind regarding my student loans, bills, etc...

Thanks in advance!  I've been a lurker on here for a while now and I finally have a reason to post here."

To be honest, not really sure if I should apply or that I have a clear reason for doing an MBA yet, so I'm hesitant about applying. I'm concerned that I don't have enough brand name internships or not enough leadership roles in my extra-curriculars. I've also never been through such an intense admissions process (Australian undergrad admissions are a joke compared to this), so this could be a good practice run for when/if I apply again. I definitely want to do a graduate degree, just not sure what/ when/ where.

Do I have a good enough shot that I should actually apply?"

*Warning: Long read ahead*

When I started college I was excited for all the new possibilities it would bring: meeting new people, taking interesting classes, exploring different interests etc., but instead my freshman year was one of the hardest years of my life. I fell into a deep depression, and getting out of bed to go to class was this impossible, daunting task and as a result, I started missing class. Due to me missing class, I started developing anxiety about going to class due to how much I missed , thinking my professor would call me out for it, and knowing how it hard it would be to play catch up. 
By the end of my first semester, I had failed 2 of my 4 classes. I thought ‘Okay. I’ll just retake them in the spring.’ (I was already retaking a course I had gotten a D in over the summer). Well spring came around, my depression/anxiety didn’t get any better, and instead of asking for help, going to a counselor or doing anything (very stupid on my part, I know) I thought it was better to go at it alone. Well I ended up getting academically suspended from my university at the end of the spring. I was really at a loss as to what to do. I graduated high school with all A’s and B’s, and only ever making 2 C’s my entire 4 years. I was so confused. I was a good student and had never been in this position before. My advisor all but told me “Good luck and get lost”,  so I had no idea how to navigate this newfound territory. No one ever told me about grade
forgiveness, withdrawing from courses, academic suspension appeals, nothing. I don’t know if I was supposed to ask about it or already have some knowledge on it but I digress. 
 So that summer, I enrolled in the local community college and I retook all the courses I failed. I took all the pre-requisites required for my major and ended up getting my GPA up from a 1.5 to a 2.9. I know not that is not the best GPA in the world, but it’s a lot better than where I started. After 2 years at the community college, I decided to transfer to another university in my state. Well I’m here now and I can honestly say, it’s not going great. I switched my major so now I’m about a year behind where I should be and due to the crappy advice of an advisor, I spent my first semester at the school taking courses that I didn’t need. 
On top of all that I am back to getting sub par grades. 
After working my ass off to get my GPA back up to better terms, it’s now at a 2.3. I honestly don’t know if I can come back from this. I am supposed to be graduating in the fall and I’m not sure if I can even get a 3.0 at this point. Last semester, due to an extremely hard lecture course, and letting an online course slide, I failed the online course and got a D in the lecture class. So now I am 2 more classes behind and I feel so defeated, I just want to drop out. I’m an almost (hopefully. Who knows at this point) graduate, who hasn’t even completed an internship yet, has a shitty GPA and feeling like a complete failure. I am supposed to go to graduate school (my degree is completely worthless without a Master’s) but I know no grad school will even LOOK at me having seen my full transcript. After graduation, I plan to retake the science courses I didn’t do so great in   (C’s) so that’ll hopefully somewhat boost my GPA. 
I’m not making this post as a pity-party or a ‘woe-is-me’ but honestly just to need to tell someone. I feel like I had so much potential going into college but that it’s been completely wasted through 3.5 years of complete shit grades. I know others have graduated college with honors, with a lot worse of circumstances than mine, and that’s what makes me feel even worse. I have the best parents and family, and knowing that they’re supporting me, I still can’t get my shit together. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I need to go to my advisor to speak with her, but I am honestly too afraid to go to see her in fear of what she’ll tell me (i.e. about graduation being pushed back another semester, my poor grades, not being accepted into graduate schools etc. This whole experience has made me somewhat fearful of advisors and mine wasn’t super kind last time I went.)"

I am 20 years old student from central Europe, currently studying my first year of cyber security bachelor program and I have basic knowledge of programming in Python, databases and about how computers work. 

In the summer, I want to go to London to work there. Do you think it is possible for me to get a paid internship (at least paid enough to afford living there), if I have no working experience in this field? 
If so, would you please recommend me websites where I could search for the IT internships? 

I personally think it wouldn't be possible for me to get the internship paid enough to be able to live in London, so I am planning on working in hospitality this year and whole year and a half working on myself, so I could work next year in the IT field. 
So, I would be very happy if you could give me advice what should I do besides the study to improve my chance of getting internship in the next year. For example I try to write code everyday on site hackerrank.com and I want to collaborate on open-source projects, but I don't know where to find a project that I can participate on. 

Are these activities good enough or would you advise me doing something else? Please let me know. "

I'm a student graduating soon with a bachelors in CS.

I'm having trouble deciding between contracting for a Big N through HCL or staying at my current position (intern) and converting at T-Mobile (was told that I can convert if I wanted to when I graduate)

Through some googling I've heard that HCL is a shit company that pays low (they offered 85k for this position) and I'm sure that I would make more at T-Mobile.

However, this Big N is one of my dream companies and was thinking that vendor to hire would be the easiest way in. This would mean putting up with low pay and HCL for a couple years.

Bottom line: Stick it out with T-Mobile/Search for other companies or accept contractor for Big N through HCL with low pay?"
afty3w,1,2019-01-14,Soon to be graduate looking to get out of Help Desk after college? Internship experience and looking for different role in IT.,VapesfromBible,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/afty3w/soon_to_be_graduate_looking_to_get_out_of_help/,"Hi everyone,
I am currently rounding the corner of graduating and obtaining a degree in Computer Information Systems from a University. This is a Bachelors of Science degree from the college of business at my school.


Throughout school I have done 3 different internships. 1st at a large and well known Wealth Finance group where I learned a lot as it was my first IT gig. 2nd job was at a large Fortune 500 company where I got a lot of experience in a ""big business"" environment. 3rd and current job I am working as an IT Technician for a small MSP that does a lot of hands-on work with servers/desktops/hardware. All in all I have almost 3 years of experience in the ""Help Desk"" and ""IT Support"" roles through internships and experience.


I am about 6 months into my new job, and although I still enjoy it, I am starting to realize I am more of a ""business person"" rather than a ""techie"". At my first 2 internships, I was very involved in the company and went to meetings, was constantly meeting new faces, had to look and act professional, gained lots of friendly relationships and contacts...


I believe I have a gift of interacting with people and building relations rather than just be a ""break/fix"" guy that sits in the office. I really enjoyed my experiences at the business internships rather than my new position where I am kind of in a small office on the phone all day, with occasionally getting out in the field.


Since my degree is going to be technically a ""business"" degree... what types of roles should I be looking for the lean more on the business side of IT rather than the technical side. I believe all the internships with reputable companies in Help Desk related roles will help my resume pairing it with a BS in Computer Information Systems... it's just where to go from there. Sales? Analyst? Administration? Manager?


Anyone have a Computer Information Systems degree... or work more on the business side of IT?


Appreciate all input!"
afu24j,21,2019-01-14,I used to bartend downtown Austin,Jimothy8tx,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/afu24j/i_used_to_bartend_downtown_austin/,"&amp;#x200B;

I love my city. I was born and raised in Austin and I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. We have the best tacos, the best outdoor activities, and don’t get me started on our nightlife. Austin’s downtown scene is historically known and also why so many tourists come to visit.

I was fortunate to get a job as a bar back right out of high school thanks to word of mouth and I was ecstatic at the time. To be 18, employed in the heart of the drinking district on 6th Street was a dream come true for me, so you could believe I hustled my ass off.

Just like that I was being trained as a bartender within a month of being hired and for a minute I was living the dream: invites to parties, numerous girls giving out their numbers, and the tips, oh the tips! It was a lavish life for someone so young and naive but looking back, I would never go back. Nope. Sure it was fun but I am now 22 and own my own construction company, have a beautiful wife and a daughter, who I cherish. The bar scene is behind me. Not because I outgrew it or anything but because this city in general.

You see I had an old neighbor disappear a few months ago and I found out he had been keeping journal entries [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7y2vou/keep_austin_weird/), so I decided to come forward with my own experiences because I want to shed light on something that is not talked about. And that is that something is really, off about the city of Austin. However, I won’t go into extreme detail about my father’s crazy rituals growing up or how my neighborhood had “keep your nose down” policy in place most of my childhood. No I can’t expose my hometown this easily. But what I can do is share what insight I have while I was working in the bar scene, and maybe with each new entry I can work up the courage to talk about what we locals say is, “left up to God.”

There is one story in particular I want to share to begin this ordeal. This story is significant not only because the memory sends a chill down my spine every time but because it is how I met Aliana.

# NOVEMBER 11 2015 - ALIANA

Fresh off a 10-hour and exhausted, I had finally finished wiping down after a very eventful and productive day. I was left to close the bar alone that Wednesday so I always made an effort to go faster on my chores so I could got out as fast as possible. 6th Street was completely dead by this point, which is rare. Aside from the lonely ambiance and myself, the bar was completely empty. I had just killed the music and was about to put up kegs when I saw her.

Out of my peripheral I see a woman running through the street, frantic. I stop what I'm doing and head to the door where I catch her attention. She pants and hauls ass towards my bar, tears in her eyes. “Please, please.” The stranger throws herself into my arms. “Y-you have to help me, I don’t understand! I-I-” she then darts around, scanning the streets for some unknown assailant, trembling to the touch under me. “I almost got in, They almost got me!”

I try to calm as I inform her she is safe and to try to breathe. I get her inside the bar and close the doors behind us. At this point I can tell she had been drinking but not enough to warrant this sporadic behavior. I assume at this point someone was after her so try to get her to explain slowly. She manages to calm down as I hand a fresh glass of water, but her eyes never leave the street, which is still barren.

The woman begins to explain that her name is Aliana and she attends Texas State a few miles south of Austin. She came to town for drinks after she got word that she got the internship of her dreams. I quickly congratulate her as a quick segway to instill some sense of comfort in her. She brushes it off and continues on saying how her friend bailed on giving her a ride due to a urinary tract infection - TMI for me so TMI for you as well - and stuck her having to call a ride-share in the dead of night. I boast about how shitty friends can be and she agrees, going on to say everything was fine up until her Uber arrived.

She then stops the story and begins to tremble again, now keeping her eyes peeled on the window to the street. I try to make some sense of her anecdote by asking if someone was following her or if her driver had done something, stating maybe I could call the police. Aliana just looks at me, a streak of fear I have never seen before in anyone.

She then adds “I know what the police will say.” She then slowly peers back to the street. “That I had too much to drink and that I’m paranoid.” Aliana then shifts closer to me. “But I know what I drank, what was in it, and I swear… I swear-”

I grab her a whole roll of paper towels because she is now quietly sobbing to herself. “You know, my abuela, she told me…” her topic now switched, an indicator she was still a tad drunk. “like, she always said to never go out in the city and the one night, the one night I live my rosary.”

Like that, I understood. I mean I was completely confused by this entire transaction but I understood perfectly what she was saying. “We say keep your nose down in my neighborhood.”

This prompts her to stop crying but only for a moment. I continue. “My mom always said if you can’t explain it, run away, and a run away fast.” I get chills typing this in her voice right now. I stand to my feet now and walk slowly to the window. “That being said, I know you don’t know me but you can trust me.”

Aliana then locks eyes with me.A pair headlights pull up to the bar prompting us both to look up instantly. Aliana slips back into panic mode as I can tell she recognizes the silhouette of the vehicle.

Her uber driver is outside. I begin to make my way for the door when the beautiful stranger before me pounces like a puma.

“No, no, NO! That’s them. They’re outside, do not go out there!” At this point I had enough. I knew all too well how strange this city could be but this instance seemed like a classic case of someone harassing an innocent woman. I was ready to give the driver a piece of my mind. Without giving into her berating as I opened the door, I began to approach the car that had pulled up across the street. A small torn down white Volkswagen sat across from me and for some reason the car itself made me less fearful of the stranger I was about to encounter.

Bright headlights illuminate the eerily empty street as I make my way slowly to the Volkswagen.

That’s when it hit me. 6th Street is never this dead. Like ever. As I approached the car I took in my surroundings once more. Not a cop, beggar or straggler in sight. So many red flags going off.

No one to witness this exchange of me giving a strange man a piece of my mind. No one to witness what I will never forget as I tapped impatiently on the tinted window of the Volkswagen. After a few minutes of waiting, my patience had worn to its thinnest. I hit the window with a hard thud, sending a vibration through the car. Something, in the moment told me I messed up.

Instead of letting down the window, within seconds the door creaks open and I prepare myself to see some burly man confront me about having to wait so long for his rider, that was not the case. The stench hits me first. What smells like rancid seafood and rotting fungus filled my nostrils. That still didn't prepare me.

From behind the door sits Aliana in plain view. I blink, trying to understand this. “How did you-”

I don’t let myself finish because my reflexes have already kicked in. I begin backing up slowly towards my bar. In this moment it made perfect sense. The woman in the car only stares at me.

“Hello there,” the words leave her lips but they sound deep and distorted. “Will you tell the passenger her ride home is here.” I swallow hard. Her lips were moving but the words she spoke did not match up at all.

What this was, whatever this was, was something out of my pay grade. So I did I was taught to do. I ran. Without taking my eyes off this Aliana I make my way back to the bar and close the door behind me in a panic. I scan the Aliana in the bar up and down, who is now quietly shaking at the bar. She can tell I saw it too.

“So…” I begin, trying to feign some sense of bravery. “You don’t have-”

“I’m an only child,” she interjects sharply.

I nod, assuring I had to ask to be sure. We both gather by the window and after ten or so minutes the Aliana in the Volkswagen drives away slowly.

After another hour of staring out the window I finally manage to finish up my closing duties and give Aliana a ride home. We discuss her internship and share a few laughs that ease the mood. I eventually get her number and we have have a date, followed by another, and another.

Queue a few more life events and Aliana and I are happily married coming up two years now and we rarely discuss that night. Like I said, there are a plethora of stories about this city I can tell, this one is just a small tip on the iceberg since it technically is how I met my wife.

Neither of us want to consider what may have happened had she got into the car that night. To date now, six people have gone missing from ride-share related incidents since then. That is neither here nor there or any of our business. There are things about this city that are too strange to explain, just keep your nose your down until my next entry.

I’m currently a junior in high school who is in AP Calculus AB. For the most part, I’ve gotten all A’s except for a few A-‘s here and there (my gpa is a 3.96).  And I’ve done very well in my previous math courses (all A’s in every previous math class). However, this year I’ve been struggling in AP Calc and my current grade is not even in the A/A- range (not very close either). The first semester is ending soon, and there’s only one test left for me in that class. If I end this semester with a not-so good grade in Calculus (as well as lowering my gpa), will that affect my chances in getting into a computer science major?? Especially since I want to go to Univeristy of Washington (I’m a Washington resident) for a computer science major, and I understand that it’s VERY competitive. Any advice on my chances and/or what to do in the future?

Additional info about me:
I’ve taken a few summer camps for computer programming (not science) in the past few years that University of Washington offers. I’ve done Python I, Java I, and Java II (the numbers don’t really mean anything). I am unfortunately unable to take AP Computer Science in my school because we don’t have any comp sci teacher to teach at my school anymore. I am planning to apply for a high school internship for Microsoft this upcoming summer, so hopefully I can get in. I am also planning to take a few college courses in my senior year for computer science so I can get a few credits for that. I am currently just self-teaching myself more Java and refreshing my memory from the past summer (I don’t have any projects tho). My AP classes I have/currently taking right now: AP World History (finished), AP Calculus AB (current), AP Language &amp; Composition (current), and AP Chemistry (current).

Sorry if this was too much to read haha. Please be very considerate with any comments. I’m not saying you need to sugar-coat things for me, but this is my first time having a low grade in a class and it discouraged me greatly :( so any beneficial advice would help me a lot. 

Thank you!!!

edit: Everyone is telling me not to worry since calculus isn’t really used in CS, which is reassuring, but I’m mostly worried about how colleges want people to have taken calculus for a CS major, and they will look at my transcript and see that I did bad in calculus. I just want to know: how bad will it affect my chances of getting into a CS major? especially for University of Washington..

Thanks for the helpful comments tho! :)"

I got accepted for a call center job but the person who interviewed me told me explicitly that they are looking for someone who can commit for a long period of time. But I know I would drop the job the second I get accepted anywhere. 
I know I could still manage to scrape together enough money without accepting the job but I don‘t know how long it will take me to finally get an internship. I actually haven‘t sent out any resume till now (I’ve been sitting on my resume for 3 months now!) because my perfectionism is preventing me from finishing any of my cover letters so I keep missing out on application deadlines! I don’t want to beat myself too much over it because it usually backfires and sends me down a depression rabbit hole but I‘m scared of how much time I‘ve already lost.

I’m inclined to turn the job down and keep focusing on actually sitting down and finally sending out some resumes. But I‘m worried I‘ll make the wrong decision and regret it later on. Especially with how fickle my writing process has been going. 
I could really use some advice because the indecisiveness is overwhelming and I need to give the call center people my final answer today. "

\-Been coding 6+ years and would consider myself one of the more competent programmers in my program (although, that's not saying much). Familiar with basic web stacks, moderate amount of .NET/Java, and just beginning to dive into mobile phone programming

\-Have completed an IT internship (non-coding, however)

\-Very few personal projects to my name

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns/Questions:**

1. The most common piece of advice I see iterated here is that personal projects and open source contributions are your best bet for employer visibility. What should my general approach be in starting these projects this semester? How do I go about choosing what to create or contribute to?
2. With one semester of school remaining, I'm beginning to feel extremely anxious about the coming year. The amount of imposter syndrome I feel is immense, in spite of the fact that I have tutored others in my program and currently hold the highest GPA. I feel quite inadequate in my skills because I have never programmed for work before. All my experience comes from either projects completed in school, Pluralsight, or short demos I build only to abandon later. Is the best approach to attain this experience through personal projects/open source contributions or will I need to balance those out with some other outlet so I can acquire these skills?
3. What do I do to handle burnout and foster a healthier relationship with coding as both a hobby and a career?

I work in the Computer Science department. A man named WelcomeBob introduced himself and he offered to give me a tour around the office.
Our first stop was the panic board.


""This is where people are able to express. Their concerns, its mostly used by our interns and people working here as their first company. I saw all sorts of panicky questions here, such as ""I work in the model design department, I've made 420 models of this one character, is this good enough for Mr. Harvard, the CEO?????"" I also saw. ""I got a 1600 out of 1600 on my basic education test they gave me in my interview,and I save the puplies, play 20 sports, and run a daycare after work, will that impress U.C Hicago, the CFO???? "" ""I figured out what the national budget fornext years up to 2080. Will I get the research grant  that'd allow me to work In China from Noreassir, the head of International Affairs???"" ""I'm an employee from Spain, how can I get funding to come to America and work in the main office? I solved 6 of the company's 3 major problems!!!""  I scratched .y head at these concerns and laughed sheepishly. Ive had the same type of questions myself when I applied for my first job. I decided to try and scribble some words of encouragement for these kids when I saw the board next door completely taken up by a fellow transfer's long encouraging message, with different colors for tips and even a TBDRHM, too busy didnt read, help me. This heart warming moment was cut shorrt when we suddenly heard a bunch of screaming

""Guysssd Florida Tech has agreed to allow us to invest in our game!!"" people yelling ""They liked the Music department's music and accepted it for the game!!"" ""They liked our ship engineerriinngg ahhh all our hard work has payed offff!!!""

Suddenly I smelt burning . I saw smoke, and young adults freaking out

""The oven is on firreeeee""  they said.
""We were baking the bread we acquired but then the beead blew up. "" A slightly older woman is seen walking into the smoke with her arm covering her mouth. Shortly after, she exited the kitchen with blue and orange shreds in her hand. 

""Kids, maybe we should stop spending all our time constructing perfect emails to Stanford Corp and take a home ed workshop or two. Tide pods have no place in making bread. Even acquired bread.""

""This is /u/ admissionsmom"" Bob explained, the mother of this corp, and she wrote that encouraging letter you saw on the board.

""Mandatory bread baking workshop tomorrow. Go or be fired. That includes everyone whos been ignoring this debocle to work on e
Propposals for The Rice Company"". She declared. Surely enough, there were people working

On on their PCs furiously unconcerned about the fire occuring. Those people hopped up to ask mom a bunch of questions about their proposal. I walked off to make room for the line forming and I saw the panic board now had people asking questions about being banned. I sighed.

"" GUYS BILL GATES AGREED TO RECCOMEND US TO AMAZON FOR FUNDING"" someone yelled, impressed I ran over with ten other people to this guys PC, only to see this guy was on tbe Microsoft website with an Amazon pop up recomending us office supply. The guy sat there laughing at our growing disappointment. Suddenly someone had the water cooler bottle filled with red bull threatening to drop it on the person.""

S
""Stop trolling"" he yelled. 

This will be a , lively chapter of my career.

Do you guys think I can get a job programming if I know some basic C++? (And I guess I know JavaScript&amp;HTML&amp;CSS which I used for a year or so, but I don't want to make websites)

Overall, I'm mostly interested in doing business accounting or finance as a degree but highly open to taking economics, psych or a mathematics minor (esp. math in risk management, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

A Basic Rundown of my CommonApp

**Demographics:** Southeast Asian from a relatively middle-income family (on the middle-high end)

**Academics:** IB diploma with roughly 39/40 predicted score out of 45 fluctuating between 37 or 38 without extra points. My other subjects fluctuate between a 5 and 6 but I've always had solid 7s in Economics HL and Math SL.

**Test Scores** (y'all better prepare for this mess): Sadly, SAT reading is far from my strong suit and I took the SAT twice but seeing that I barely improved, my highest final composite score was a 1380 with 640 in English and 740 in Math. I also didn't take any SAT subjects because I was not about to study Math 2 while I was already barely sleeping from my current exams. I did DO TEST OPTIONAL for sure on some schools especially since they allow it for IB candidates.

**ECs:** I do have a good amount of ECs but my major ones listed are hosting and being Head Organizer of a public TEDx conference in the city where I live ( we also got the US Embassy to sponsor us!). Other things include a Big4 advisory / consulting internship over summer break, Student Council Secretary and the Arts and Academic Committee previous years. I'm also involved in two major service organizations, a global issues network club headquartered in our school and public relations director in a non-profit with annual service trips to build libraries and educate children. Also involved in sports like tennis and basketball teams and a bunch of other miscellaneous things such as being a Mandarin Immersion Scholar in a Taiwanese University over summer break to running a lifestyle based IG account with about 28-29k followers and even fun things like videographer for school's dance club's covers.

**Essays:** My common app was fine? It wasn't too generic and I talked about how I came to understand the word integrity not just as literally as in honesty but in learning it and growing from myself. But, the quality of my supplements ranges all over the place. I'm proud (well, not really but it was pretty good) of a analytical/ intellectual curiosity/philosophical-ish poem I wrote for the ""take a risk"" essay for Notre Dame and I talked a lot about business ethics especially since where I'm from, accounting and corruption sort of go hand in hand and how I wanted to change that stigma, blah, blah ( showing how its in line with Emory's and Notre Dame's school values). And for W&amp;M, my most creative essay I think, I wrote about my love of the combination of Chocolate and Cheese and how the rest of the world seems to either dislike or pick between both options but I'm a lover of both flavors together. I put some fun anecdotes with foreign friends who deemed the pairing ""grotesque, etc."" BUT, there were some half-assed essays like my BU for sure but at least I specified what classes I wanna take, etc..

**Rec Letters:**

1. Highly hope that this was one of the highlights to my application. I asked my DP English teacher (who's also part of the external admissions board for Yale-NUS) who I'm super close with and spend tons of time from supervising the exec team for Student Council, being in his HL class and I also did my Extended Essay with him as a supervisor. He told me that my rec was pretty much the easiest to write so that was good.
2. Got a new counselor this year and I think she likes me? Hopefully, she said she talked to some teachers too before writing her statement and definitely saw me grow this past senior year.
3. \*) 3) For some of the schools I applied directly to their business schools, I also attached a rec letter from my supervisor during my Big4 internship. Pretty standard but he nicely commented on my value even early on as a member during a brainstorm session.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you guys took the time to read over this, bless you and **THANK YOU SO MUCH**. If you're in a similar position like me, please remember that I'm hoping for all the best for you too. I know some of these schools are high reaches and even high matches but I do appreciate any feedback, thoughts or predictions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** Recently got into Kelley Direct Admit with a pretty good amount of scholarship money for an international student, so if all else fails I'm highly considering to go to Kelley :)

afzd34,2,2019-01-14,Seeking Advice: Received a Coding Challenge After Signing With Another Company,Renatics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/afzd34/seeking_advice_received_a_coding_challenge_after/,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently accepted and signed an internship offer at the start of the month. The deadline they gave me was pretty short and due to the holidays, I figured that I wasn't going to be hearing back from any companies any time soon. In hindsight I probably should've asked for an extension, but I was reluctant to do so because the company I signed with kept telling me that they wanted to finalize their hiring process ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

So just this weekend, I received a coding challenge from another company. I find this company a little more attractive. 

Both positions are for software engineering intern roles. However, the company I signed with placed me on a team (security) that I don't have any experience in. I know that learning is part of being intern. However, the company that sent me the coding challenge is specifically for a back-end developer position, which attracts me more. Although both roles are basically back-end, I'm leaning a bit more towards the new company.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm guessing that completing the coding challenge would be okay because after all, I would still need to have an interview if I make it that far. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do in this position? For reference, this would be my first internship and going back on the company I signed with is something I wouldn't want to do because I don't want to damage the relationship in case I apply in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."

As of right now, I have 3 options, each with it's pros and cons. I've gotten advice from multible people, each saying something different. So ultimately I decided to just make a post and hope I get some more feedback from people who are actually in my future field!

So to start, I am an incoming 6/7 Computer Science major. I have had 7 summer software positions now, with two of them being research at a university.

So, I have one summer left to do an internship before it's time to start full time in December 2019.

So, to start, my first offer is from Company A, which is a company that I have done 3 internships for over the past year and a half. I didn't want to do another internship with them, so I negotiated a better position to show career movement. The position would be a ""Junior Software Engineer"", and would be 14 weeks, leading a team of full time engineers to build out a new product. I'd have full responsibility of stack and architecture desicions, be scrum master, so lots of responsibility. The pay is 35/hr. The only problem (depends how you look at it) is that I have to sign a full time offer NOW with them to start in January 2020, for around 75-80k. 

Company B:: Hedge fund located in NYC, 42/hr with 1.5x overtime, pays for travel expenses, 10 weeks. Would be working on building out the next generation trading platform. Additionally, would most likely be getting a full time offer of 120k+.

Company C::**Currently in project matching phase** I should know about this offer by end of January. I would either spend 12 weeks in Austin or North Carolina. Pay is about 26/hr, with 1.5x overtime. This is my idea of a ""perfect internship"". You are on a team with 3 other members and are tasked to build out a brand new startup company in 12 weeks, and then present to the C-Suites. This internship is the IBM Extreme blue internship for more context. 

Essentially, I am just trying to weight the pros vs cons, and it's really hard to do so and make my mind up. Below is kinda a TLDR; pros vs cons list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros
A: Live at home (gf, dog, friends, family), love the culture, 35/hr, full time offer secure a year before graduating 

B: 41/hr + 1.5x overtime.. Live at my apartment in school near NYC, Quick and Easy money, get to learn the inner workings of how trading works on wall street (I'm not that interested but it seems cool)

C: 26/hr + 1.5x overtime My favorite internship, live in Austin for 3 months, great for the resume, very selective internship 

CONS
A: full time offer a year before graduating, haven't experienced another company culture in over 2 years 

B: Not that interested in finance, the company culture is pretty trash (think Goldman Sachs.. it's not but similar), offer expires TODAY 1/14 (can't ask for another extension)

C: still don't have the offer, could live in North Carolina, lowest pay

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry this is so long!! I've been trying to figure this out for like 4 weeks now and honestly I'm leaning towards just accepting company B, even though company C would be better for my resume. However Company C is my ideal internship... My brain hurts lol. Feel free to ask me questions and I'd be happy to answer them in the comments!

Thanks for your time :D

ag0bog,645,2019-01-14,Took a while but I finally got a job that I want. Thank you to the people of this sub!,NC2292,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ag0bog/took_a_while_but_i_finally_got_a_job_that_i_want/,"This subreddit has helped me in so many ways. Whether it's resume advice, knowing what to study/learn, knowing I wasn't the only one struggling to find a job or just being told that it'll all end up being okay eventually. 

A little bit about me: I graduated from a state school in California with my BS in Computer Science in June 2017. I didn't have any projects or internships or even a good GPA. I would go to school and do what the classes required and that was it. I was barely getting any call backs from companies and even the ones that I did, I would end up failing the interviews in one way or another. A lot of it definitely has to do with luck because there were countless moments where I thought that I would get an offer for sure only to find out that I wasn't selected. Other interviews I had bad luck where the interviewer seemed to be really rude and dismissive from the start.

The only experience I have had till this new job offer was a contract position that bait and switched me after I agreed to work there. I was told I'd be a developer and learn all these technologies but they ended up having me as help desk. Worst of all, I was getting paid $16 an hour. 

I start my new job next month and I'm extremely excited. I'll be making alright money (~66k + 5k signing) but I'll actually be a software developer this time around. All this wouldn't have been possible from all the people who helped me on this sub. The kindness of strangers is truly remarkable. All the advice and resume help really changed my career outlook.

My advice to people on this sub who are struggling with finding a job is:

* Apply everywhere and anywhere. Even if you don't meet all the qualifications. Keep applying
* Go to career fairs and talk to the recruiters face to face. This is what helped me get this job
* Don't doubt yourself. It's a numbers game. Don't overthink everything.
* Everyone has their own journey. As long as you work towards your goal, it'll happen even if it takes longer than you want it to.

**There's also a downside to this sub that is toxic.**
There's people who act that if you're not working at a Big N, that you're a failure. That if you're not making 150k + 50k in stock entry-level that you're a failure. Those numbers aren't practical outside the Bay area.
Working for the government or defense has a taboo on this sub as well. The job offer I got is actually for the government. 

People will really bash on you for where you work or they'll hate on your resume but when you check their post history, you'll see that they're a sophomore in college still and regurgitate everything they read. 


**TL:DR** Graduated in June 2017. Worked a crappy help desk job that I was bait and switched into.  Finally got a job to actually start my career. Thank you to the people of this sub!"

I am posting here today in the hopes of finding an upcoming available remote work position (~6 months?) with either flexible hours or hours based primarily in the HST / PST timezones as that is the area I wish to live/travel in.

**Interests:** I have a targeted interest in the Information Technology, Administration and/or Management fields as that is the work most in line with my previous life as an officer in the US Army, where I worked as what could most accurately be translated as an IT Manager, or IT Director if we're talking about a smaller organization. I've mostly been exposed to Windows systems and Microsoft software. I would also probably be a good fit if your organization does IT related contracts / business with the US government.

**Compensation:** Looking for *ideally* something to start in the range of $25-35 hourly or a comparable salary depending on the position. I'm potentially also interested in some sort of part-time internship / apprenticeship which I start earlier (paid or not depending on the specifics) type deal that would lead into the job. I would like to pick up a certification (I currently have Security+), but there are a lot out there and I'm not entirely sure what would be the best bet to help me land something remote. If nothing else, more experience is always helpful.

---

**Roles held:** IT Manager, Service Delivery Manager, IT Policy and Planning Specialist, Systems Administrator

**Information Technology:** Probably the part of my jobs that I have enjoyed the most. Through a skills gap, which could only be closed by time, training and certification- I was forced to undertake certain other responsibilities performed by Desktop Support Specialists, Systems Administrators and SharePoint Administrators that were either too junior to yet understand, or lacked the credentials to be authorized to perform that work.

**Administration:** I was responsible to ensure most administrative tasks for my teams were completed. Such tasks included performance reviews, disciplinary actions, work statements, timesheets, leave requests and more. I have also created operating procedures and manuals, inventories / databases and more. I have run a SharePoint site, but we didn't really use custom web parts / apps, and I wouldn't be comfortable saying I could make those. If you mostly need calendars, document libraries, page designs, moderation, etc, I can handle that.

**Management:** I have managed teams of employees ranging from as small as 4 people, to as many as 30. These teams primarily served IT related functions Some of these teams operated 24/7/365 in rotating shifts. I've prepared and delivered briefings for senior staff members and peers in sister departments, covering system statistics such as outages and resolutions, open and closed ticket metrics, identifying users with outstanding training requirements, etc.

If you have questions about these or other areas, I can submit my full resume and/or answer any questions over PM.

If you have something you think I might be a fit for, I would like to talk. Alternatively, if you know recruiters I should be getting in contact with, that would also be appreciated."

I'm going to try and be as concise as possible.



I'm 21 and I just went through a program to get COMPTIA A+ certified since college didn't work for me (stopped going after 2 years) then started interning at TD Ameritrade shortly after. The initial internship was for about a month. After the month was over, I got extended 3 more months due to my performance with a pay raise from $10 to $20 an hour. I am now 3 weeks into my extension. The commute is about 2 hours but I like the area and where I work. I just don't know if I like what I'm doing. I do a lot of data science stuff. Splunk, Excel, API work, vi editor and stuff like that. I learned and will probably learn a lot more tools that seem very marketable but right after I got extended I have received offers to interview for Desktop Associate and Product Support Specialist positions at two different not as acclaimed companies that support underserved communities which sound really cool to me. My biggest fears are that if I leave TD, I will stunt my own growth in my IT journey and the other is that it will be hard to try new things if I get stuck looking like a data scientist guy (no offense). I want to get better at JavaScript, Python and learn even more things outside of coding also. I like working in IT but in truth, I just don't want to get stuck hating my life again. I sincerely just want to just learn and challenge myself.

I am currently a college student in my last semester to receieve a bachelor's in Marketing.

I am currently working as an intern for a State Farm agency as a Sales and Marketing associate for 4 months now, and have had a decent experience thus far. I am somewhat enjoying the position, and am still in the process of getting my insurance license. This is all well and good, and I had not planned on moving on quite yet, until I was contacted by a recruiter.

I was contacted by a local recruiter for Northwestern Mutual to see if I would be interested in their financial advising internship. I know through research and online reviews however, that it would simply be a part-time sales position. However, I have always been interested in the financial advising/services industry. 

Should I pursue this opportunity with Northwestern Mutual and leave my current position at State Farm? Or should I just stick with my current internship until I graduate in 4 months? 

Thanks in advance!"

For ECS 161 (Winter Quarter 2019), I've been told it's more suitable for sophomores and people seeking an internship, and I'm not too sure if I should be seeking an internship following graduation instead of a job. However, ECS 161 would be a lighter workload, which would be of use to me as I am taking ECS 150 and MAT 108 this quarter.

For ECS 193 (Winter and Spring Quarter 2019), I have been planning to take this course for a while, and I think that it would be able to give me some heads-on, practical project experience that would look good on my resume and that ECS 161 probably won't be able to offer. However, it would require a potentially larger workload, and I'm a bit apprehensive and nervous about trying to jump into something completely new and on the spot for a team project like for web or application development (although I do find these fields particularly interesting).

I am planning to drop one or the other so that I can clear up my schedule for Winter and get my graduation planned figured out. While I am leaning a bit towards senior design, I'm just a bit hesitant about starting out, so I'm reaching out to see what other people think. Which of the two courses do you think would be better, personally?"

The two offers I have make the decision really hard, given my end goal. I don't really care about internship pay, so that is not a factor.

My first offer is from a SF bay area start up unicorn (not that well known) company valued at 3.x billion. They would consider me for full time depending on my performance.

My second offer is from rainforest (azmn) vancouver/toronto as an SDE intern. This is literally a dream offer for any CS student, but the only problem is that it is in Vancouver. I am not sure if this aligns with my long term goal of going to the US. Also I previously interned at an azmn subsidairy, so I write azmn on my resume anyway...

I really don't know what would be better for me given this offer and my current status. On one hand azmn is a dream company that I would want to work full time later on but the other offer is in SF.

ag48hx,10,2019-01-14,Looking for advice from those who've done it: Want to end up in IB / HFs one day.,R4D1AT10N,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ag48hx/looking_for_advice_from_those_whove_done_it_want/,"Hi, financial careers Redditors. Putting this out there because I need recommendations from others.

**Background:**

I'm in a bit of a bind thinking about my future. I went to my hometown college because I was scared to death of having debt after college. This is a small campus, roughly 3,000 students and NO big banks or investment banking firms have it on the map. I knew I wanted to enter the investment banking world since middle school, so I'm currently a Junior Finance major with a 4.0. I'm also the president of a large entrepreneurial club (70+ members) on campus. I work 3 part-time jobs during the semester.

**My predicament:**

My family is as straight middle class as it gets; We've never had meaningful connections in the finance world, which has put me way behind because I've not had anyone to guide me along what I need to do to enter the investment banking world, leaving me wholly unprepared. Although I've excelled at college *(again, 4.0)*, my poking around LinkedIn as well as beginning to read a few books about the contemporary finance world, I can't help but feel as though I'm going to be left in the dust.

When I mentioned ""wholly unprepared"" I really mean it: my parents both went to college, but they either didn't understand the mechanics behind its connection to the working world or have just never told me. For example, I didn't understand the importance of landing an internship in the field you're interested in, they were too busy taking pride in my working 3 part-time jobs to pay for college, or the *advantages* of attending a big college despite the high cost. Everyone in my life has been so excited about how driven I am that no one thought to see if I'm actually ""driving"" myself in the right direction (I'm guilty of this too: I didn't do my reconnaissance of the industry early-on.)

**This leaves me...**

I'm just entering my 6th semester, I'll be graduating on-time in May 2020. My major issue:

*I do not have a relevant summer internship and likely will not have one.*

About the time I realized how important landing an internship was (*late* October 2018) most big banks were getting ready to close their applications or already had. I scrambled to get applications in to JPM, Credit Suisse, and Barclays, only. As you can tell by this post, I didn't get the internships LOL.

**The future:**

This is where YOU come in. I need advice on what path I should take based on your own individual experiences. The options as I see it are:

1. Try to get an internship at a regional or smaller bank in some division that might not be relevant *(semi-unlikely, it's getting close to the application deadlines and I've missed big job fairs.)*
2. Try to get a job in IB or at a big bank straight out of college *(with no experience I see this as very very unlikely.)*
3. Try to land a relevant internship for the summer of 2020 after I graduate *(not sure how likely this is, but if I do get it there is a small chance I get hired at the end of the internship.)*
4. Try to land a relevant internship for the summer of 2020 and apply to a high-ranking college such as Colombia or NYU *(I believe I could get into one in this case, not sure if I could finance the tuition/living expenses though)*
5. Apply to a high-ranking master's program such as Colombia or NYU without the relevant internship experience *(I'm guessing with no work experience this is not going to work out well in my favor, LOL)*
6. With or without internship experience, go to a smaller school's master program which would have less opportunities.
7. Work some job I don't care about, build up some principal, become a day-trading gambler *(This isn't a real option, come on.)*

Please offer me some advice from what you all have experienced. 

Am I missing some options?

What is the reality of internships? 

How relevant do they need to be?

How competitive are top-ranking MBA programs?

Are MBAs even necessary?

Are top-ranking colleges necessary to land in big banks?

Have I discovered the reality of the industry too late?

Am I fucked?

&amp;#x200B;

The finance world is both fascinating to me and intimidating. I've been interested in finance for so long because of both the high pay and the nature of the subject itself: finance is like a puzzle that can never truly be solved. I believe I have what it takes to be on Wall Street - maybe I'm wrong. My fear is that I will never be able to break into that world and will never get to actually find out. Lastly, I really do have a passion for education and learning.

Any recommendations, advice, anecdotes, tips, or words of encouragement are helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** 4.0 Junior Finance student graduating in May 2020 at a small college wants to enter the investment banking world. Has no connections, was too late to apply to most Summer 2019 IB internships. Looking for advice on where to go from there. "

I want to go to Grand Canyon University in Arizona, hopefully using grants and scholarships but its very probable for me to go into debt to get my bachelors there. I’ll transfer after 2 years of CC, but still its a lot of money.

I’ve dreamt of living in Australia for as long as I can remember. The climate and the culture and everything is perfect for me.

I’d have to find a female first, and I want to do that in Australia anyway so..

My question is, can I get a internship there even for a few months? 3 months out of the winter in either WA or at GCU would be amazing.

That would be for when I’m like 21 or 22 though, I also want to later in live settle down there before I’m 30. It that even possible?

ag6k0m,270,2019-01-15,How I have overcome ADHD and Laziness,Johnny9708,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ag6k0m/how_i_have_overcome_adhd_and_laziness/,"I was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago at the age of 21. Before I was diagnosed, I was a mess. I thought that getting prescribed to Adderall would solve all of my problems. I was wrong and I had to learn the hard way. Yes, ADHD can be a major issue and medicine can help solve the problem. Here's the thing, your mindset means everything. Once your mind is in the right place, its time to take action immediately. This means setting goals, achieving them, and setting more goals. You can't achieve goals without planing stuff out so start planning immediately. I was literally the laziest you can be with no idea where I was headed in life and zero motivation. I'm not where I want to be yet, nor am I even close, but over the last 6 months I have made major strides in a positive direction and I want to share what I have done to change my life. BTW you don't have to have ADHD to follow my advice. The reality is, if an ADHD riddled person as myself can get his life on track, anyone can.

**1) Don't Be A Victim**

This was one of my biggest problems. Claiming that something is too difficult because of your problems becomes a habit. I had gotten to a point where I was talking about it everyday as if it impacted my life and was the source to all my problems. Using it as an excuse led me to become complacent and stuck. I refused to improve myself because in the back of my head, I felt it would be pointless and wouldn't help me. I realized that I was letting myself be defined by ADHD. I realized I only have one life and that I wasn't living the life I wanted to live. I knew I had potential but that potential was locked by myself. Everyone has potential and the key to unlocking it is understanding that nothing should stand in your way. While its important to be honest with yourself and realize that your potential has limits, (not everyone has the IQ to become a doctor or lawyer), you can't get caught up in the bullshit. I was blaming God which was a terrible thing to do. I would say things like ""Why would you do this to me?"" or ""Whats the point of making me suffer?"" What I ended up realizing in the end is that I was the only one holding myself back. You can be born with and raised with problems that aren't reversible, that effect your day to day life, but the reality is, you have no choice but to deal with it or else you are just simply giving up before even trying.

Have grace. Typically this is something you find in religion but I'm not religious at all. Grace is so powerful and it changed my life. Instead of claiming vicim, claim you are lucky. In fact, all 7 billion of us on Earth are so lucky. Think about this: what is the chance of you existing? Think about the probability of you becoming a professional athlete or even winning the lottery. 1 in millions is your chance of winning the Powerball is something like 1 in 3 million. Well, the reality is, the chance that you as an individual happened to be a conscious mind chosen to live is 1 in 10\^2,685,000. If you didn't know thats 10 following 2,685,000 zeros. To put it in other terms, the probability of all of us being born is almost zero. So if you are taking life for granted or you're claiming you are a vicim of something thats holding you back, you need to take a step back and look around. There is no excuse anymore because the life you live is so valuable and all you are doing is wasting time. You need to suck all the good you can at this life because its literally **YOUR RIGHT** to do so.

**2) Eliminate Negativity**

This is one of those things where you have to take my word for it and try it out in order to understand its effect. Its not even about being positive as much as it is eliminating the negative. When I first started eliminating negativity, I would write it down or type it into the notes app on my phone. At the end of the day I would count the amount of negative things it thought or said. I was surprised to find that just being conscious that those thoughts were there pretty much eliminated them fully. And boy did I have immediate effects. I was less anxious, and astronomically more productive and motivated. Out of nowhere I was more social than I ever though I could be. It made me enjoy meeting new people which was something I always struggled with. I also realized that people enjoyed being around me more. I was now noticing others who were negative and it made me not want to be around them. People really don't like negativity so if your struggling making friends, this is my #1 tip for you.

**3) Start Putting in Effort NOW!!! Set Goals Now!!!**

Starting to put in the effort is the absolute hardest thing to do. If you keep saying ""I'll start tomorrow or Monday or next week"", im willing to bet you won't. If thats you, I know you too well. That was me 100%. You're procrastinating for simple reason that you dread putting in the effort. Its almost painful to put in that effort. Tell yourself right now you are going to try and make a difference, close your eyes and motivate yourself for a second, and put in 5 min of effort.

You need to do something that will have a positive effect for the future like writing up a small goal that is easy to obtain. Make sure its measurable. It can be something like that you are going to do 5 push ups per day, as soon as you wake up, everyday for a week. Have a reward ready for completing the task. It can be anything but try to make it something you want to do like maybe you want to watch a specific movie. Make sure its something that you can resist. For example, don't make your reward going to see Avengers Endgame in theaters (if you are watching this the week that it comes out) because you are going to cave. Everyone would cave unless you're some monk who has discipline that is unmatched. Set yourself up to succeed. Keep something to track your progress like a piece of paper that you keep by your bed and every time you accomplish that goal for the day write it down. This goal should be easy as hell to achieve and once you achieve it, its time to reward yourself. I bet you will feel satisfied and that movie you decided you would watch as a reward will be 100% better than if you watched it before you decided to write up this goal. Trust me you will.

Now you know how it feels so write up another goal but challenge yourself a little, but not too much. Maybe you do 10 pushups per day, every morning, for 2 weeks. Or keep the original goal but add another goal and try to achieve both. Maybe this goal can be everyday for a week, you will wake up at 8am if your someone who goes to bed late and wakes up early. If its hard to do because your body isn't used to it and you are exhausted, start by limiting yourself to a 1 hour nap at noon max. I wake up at 6am everyday but it took me about a 2 months to swap my nocturnal self into that cycle. My first goal was to wake up at noon everyday because I was always sleeping in to 3pm. If I can do it so can you.

**4) Start Planning out Your Days, Weeks, and Years**

This is actually pretty self explanatory as there are tons of tips on this subreddit. Take the advice from someone who experienced the change from never planned anything out not being able to leave my house with a plan. ""If you fail to plan to you are planning to fail"" - Ben Franklin. Is there anything that good ole Ben said that wasn't beneficial to an individual? He so right on this one. Not having a plan is like trying to shoot a target with your eyes closed. And if you have ADHD, forget it. As from my own experience, I had no idea what to do on a daily basis for YEARS.

Planning is a skill of its own and will take time to master but you better get started today because you are wasting time. I'm not a master at it and I have been doing this for 6 months but I will be. You'll find it to become easier to do even a week into giving the effort.

First you need to sit and think big picture low resolution. Where would you like to see yourself in **5 years? 2 years? 1 year?** if your not sure what you want in 5 years or even 1 year, thats okay. Think about where you would like to see yourself in the most distant future possible. If you can only picture what you want in 6 months, that works too. Personally, I did it like this:

**In 5 years** I want to have a college degree and a job because of it. I also want to have the girl that I want to marry by then. Financially, I would like at least 5k $ saved up in the bank. I also want to be strong as fuck and shredded. I want to be a master at planning out my days and setting goals to achieve stuff I've never even thought I could possibly achieve. I want to also be a mentor for those who needed help as I do now because I know thats my mission in life, my purpose.

**In 2 years** I want to have the field that I want a degree in to be decided and an internship. I want to be a pretty social guy by then with a lot of friends. I also want to be much stronger and shredded than I am now. I want to be very good at planning because at this point, I start looking forward to the rest of my life and where I'm headed. I want to dictate my life and understand what defines me as a person.

**In 1 year/6 months** I want to be able to evaluate the difference of how much better I made myself then to where I am today. I want to be habitual at this point. I want to be able to recognize what works and what doesn't for me. I want to be good at recognizing when I fail, why I failed, and what can I learn from failing every time I do.

Once you have the big picture, its easier to look at the near future. Start by making a goal for the end of the month and make that goal something like this: **I want to achieve at least 1 weekly goal per week.** The best way to start planning is by using the same strategy stated in **3).** Set it up as a goal to plan out your day to day for one week. Build once you achieve that 1 month goal, make the monthly goal slightly harder or give yourself an additional goal to try and achieve. Don't forget to give your self a reward because its very important.

You can plan out your day to day by writing down what you will do on a timely basis. Don't start with anything too difficult to follow. In fact, in the beginning, you can use a trick that I used to was the absolute hack to sticking the habit of following a schedule. Instead of scheduling in things you're not looking forward to doing, start by scheduling in things you already do that you enjoy doing. For me, I always had a video game addiction and was playing non stop. Add it into your day to day. Anther thing I did to help it stick is I made every single day the same on a weekly basis. Every week I would alter things to my benefit. When you get good at it, you can it to where each day is different but I don't recommend it at the beginning. Remember, you are building habits so make it easier on yourself before you make it harder.

**8am: wake up**

**10am: gym**

**12pm: school**

**2pm: homework**

**3pm: nap**

**4pm: video games/relax time**

**11pm: bed**

Start with something like that and work towards something better week by week. My current Mondays look like this:

**6am: wake up**

**6:30am: eat breakfast**

**7am: homework**

**8am: gym**

**9:45am: drink protein shake and take adderall**

**10am: class**

**11:30am: leisure time (go on phone and wait for next class)**

**12pm: class**

**1:30pm: eat lunch and take adderall**

**2pm: homework**

**3pm: video games**

**5pm: eat dinner/hangout with family/hangout with friends**

**9pm: read book**

**10pm: sleep**

Quick tip: if you are on adderall, its easy to become dependent and to take too many at once or consecutively. This is not a good thing and a problem I had once. An easy way to combat this is give your pill bottle to someone and have them only give you 2 each day. Once you start building up the habit of taking no more than 2-3 daily and at the same time daily, you can probably take the responsibility of holding onto the pill bottle. Be honest with yourself and with time, you will build discipline. Also, eventually make it a goal to do some work without adderall as you should make it an end goal to someday not use it anymore. There is no reason to take it for the rest of your life because dependency is something you want to eliminate, especially drugs.

**Conclusion**

Anyone who is struggling can find a way to succeed. There isn't anything that will be a quick fix to your problems and if someone tells you there is, they are lying. The hard truth is, its all on you. Stop procrastinating and start right away. I promise the hardest part is only the beginning. Get through that and it seriously will only get easier. I can attest to this as someone who's life was a literal mess with no motivation to do anything. If your depressed, go see a therapist asap. I did therapy for a while and it cleaned up my depression. But you have to act immediately because if you keep pushing it off, you won't get better. Once you get on track, its like you are a train that won't stop and I can promise you won't look back. The satisfaction I have received has literally compounded as time goes on. To those who are in the shoes that I used to be in, I want you to feel the same way I do. You have to give your life your best shot and time is running out. Think about how you want to define yourself and go do it. Nobody is stopping you from moving forward but yourself!"

MS Programs: CMU/Stanford/Berkeley/UW

**Undergrad Institution:** University of California, Berkeley  
Majors: B.S. Mathematics &amp; Statistics  
Minors: Computer Science  
**GPA:** 3.72/4.00

**Type of Student:** Domestic Male

**GRE General Test:**  
**Q:** 170   
**V:** 169

**Awards/Honors/Recognitions:** Some awards/honors related to athletics and my fraternity but nothing relevant.  
**Pertinent Activities or Jobs:** 1 ML internship at a startup, 1 SWE internship at a big tech company (Google/Facebook/Amazon/Microsoft), 1 internship as a quant researcher at a quantitative trading firm. I also have my own sports analytics blog. A couple decently big ML personal projects too

**Letters of Recommendation:** 2 from well-known ML/AI researchers at Berkeley, 1 from the professor who taught my graduate level Deep Learning Class. Also, have the option to get one from Systems professor I did research with. The first two should be really good and the third should be pretty decent too. 

**Relevant Courses:**

CS:  Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Optimization Models and Applications, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (grad-level class taught as an undergrad upper-div at Cal), Deep Learning (Grad-Level Class)

&amp;#x200B;

My main concerns are how much my lack of publications hurt me and also if the fact I wasn't a CS major will hurt me too. I'd appreciate any thoughts about my chances at those top programs, particularly for an MS (not sure about Ph.D. right now). 

Thanks so much!

As a part of my curriculum, I'm required to go on 2 internships (at least 1 has to be security) and this would count as 3 because it will be for a year. A majority of what I'll do will be covered in my training, but I was just wondering if anyone had any experience in this sort of position and had any advice or tips?"
ag9ad6,4,2019-01-15,"Hitting a wall, sometimes literally.",matthewkocanda,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ag9ad6/hitting_a_wall_sometimes_literally/,"Good morning all.

So a few months back, I posted here about how hyped I was to start my internship as a web developer. It's been about 6 months of part time work, and I've learned a lot about Wordpress and Squarespace development, but that's about it. And when I say development, I put heavy quotes around that.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, it's creating websites for clients that want them within a few days, and simply want content dragged from a Google doc into a Wordpress theme. So not a whole lot of room to grow. While I'm thankful that the internship (combined with my evening kitchen job) has allowed me to fully support myself and my son without too much help, I am learning quickly that I still am not even qualified for entry level developer positions.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the answer is to just write more code on my own and build a portfolio that I can show. However, with two jobs and being a single parent, I find myself mentally drained by 10pm when I could actually sit down and work on something that might benefit myself. One thing I recently found was a group of local developers that get together in the mornings for a coding/coffee meetup once a week. I'm going to start going to those since my boy has me awake by 530am anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm essentially wondering how some of you were able to either find the work to grow as a freelancer, or simply finding that seemingly elusive entry level developer job that doesn't require 3 years of professional experience."
ag9ie7,1,2019-01-15,I took a computer from work...,throwawaysmg123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ag9ie7/i_took_a_computer_from_work/,"So I'm using a throwaway, clearly.

I work for an amazing company that's doing really, really well. We just bought a suite of new iMacs to replace some old ones that we've had for awhile. 

Last year we did the same thing. So there are some 2017 iMacs in the office mixed in with 2015s and older. And a handful of 2018 iMacs waiting to replace the old ones. There are more computers than people, but we have interns seasonally who fill the empty spaces. As the old computers are replaced, they wind up in a box somewhere or just left wherever they were last used and never touched again. Perhaps they'll be donated?

So here's my fuck up and why I'm looking for advice.

My mom just took over her own business and needs a new computer. I'd been thinking about taking one of the old computers and gifting it to her for some time. Not trying to be malicious to the company in any way, but they don't use it and she definitely could, so what's the harm?

Well I did take one on Friday. And gave it to her over the weekend. We factory reset it and set it all up for her. She's very excited.

Today I realized that **I took a 2017 computer which was totally fine and would be used for an intern coming in a few months**. At least one other person in the office noticed ""there was a new one that worked fine at this desk"" and kind of questioned it, but ""meh'ed"" it off for now. I've been internally freaking out all morning.

I have some options:

1) Come clean with my mom. Say I shouldn't have taken this computer, it was the wrong one, factory reset it *again* and bring it back some night, hoping nobody notices.

2) Come clean with my bosses. Say I took a newer computer home for my mom thinking it was one that was scheduled to be replaced. Beg for forgiveness.

3) Replace the missing 2017 with another 2017 from the other side of the office that hasn't been used in several months (and who knows what kind of tangent that might cause...)

4) Play dumb and pray it all works out.

5) Other ideas?

I know I'm a fucking stupid idiot. I do love this company and I love my mom and I just took the wrong computer, thinking that it could be replaced and that would be that. Nobody's hurt in the process.

What should I do? What do you think? What would you do?




UPDATE:

I called my mom and let her know what I did. She said it's okay - she actually laughed - and said I can come get the computer and bring it back to the office. I'll be doing that tomorrow. I feel a lot better now that it's resolved, but I do realize that I'm a thief and an idiot, and I'm disappointed in myself. Thank you for your advice."
agb0h9,3,2019-01-15,Need help negotiating entry-level offers,Firemelun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/agb0h9/need_help_negotiating_entrylevel_offers/,"Hi everyone! I currently have some job offers lined up after I graduate from college this spring with a B.S in CS. I've never negotiated before and figured I should ask for some insight on the best way to approach the offers.

Offer 1: 75,000 with 10,000 stock options working with a stack that I really enjoy. It is a tech company and the office/engineering culture looks really good from what I've seen when I visited. The manager and engineers I spoke with are fantastic and they seem like they would be really great to work with and learn from.

Offer 2 (Verbal): At least 85,000 working with a tech stack I'm not really fond of  (currently interning here and I can't say I'm enjoying it enough to sign on full time)

Offer 3: Range is from 89-105k depending on the contract I am placed on. I interned with this defense contractor and will most likely be doing full-stack development although I am not too excited about the culture and will be on a customer site away from the former engineers that I were assigned with during my internship.

All of these offers are within the Washington D.C. Metro area.

As it stands right now I'm heavily considering taking the first offer but I would like to ask for more salary-wise. Something really clicked with my interview with the manager and I feel I could really learn a lot working there. What is the best way to approach and negotiate for more salary with them? Thank you and please feel free to let me know if there is any more information I could provide that would help!

EDIT: 

I will be living and commuting from my parent's home for the time being. Offer 1 also includes unlimited vacation time and includes daily breakfast/lunch. 

UPDATE:

They're unable to negotiate but it's fine. I think I'm going to go ahead and take the offer anyway. Thank you for your input everyone! I appreciate it so much."

I haven't coded in ages and this my last year to secure an internship before I graduate with a CS bachelors. Thankfully I have woken up and realized I have to get my ass in gear, a year before I will be applying to new grad positions and not after I graduated.  

  

I know putting together projects is the only way one can become good at programming but for the short term, do you have any tips/resources that can help me get a decent understanding of the Java language and OOP concepts within a couple weeks? I have to start applying for internships, I am already very late to begin with.  

  

Any advice and criticisms are welcome. Thank you so much."
agbjqf,5,2019-01-15,Could anyone review my academic suspension appeal letter please?,manfromwo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/agbjqf/could_anyone_review_my_academic_suspension_appeal/,"Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to go over my appeal letter. I know sometimes going back isn’t the best option for students who have been suspended but i really feel like returning is best. Anyways, here it is, have at it: 

To the Satisfactory Academic Appeal Committee:

My  name is Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxx and I am a sophomore in Harpur. After the Fall 2018 semester, I was informed of my academic suspension from Binghamton. I understand that my academic performance has been less than adequate and take full responsibility for my shortcomings. I write this hoping to convey how important continuing my education at Binghamton is. With careful contemplation on my mistakes, I created a plan to ensure academic success. 

I have used the last couple of weeks to think about where I went wrong in both my past semesters st Binghamton. Although I did improve from my first to this past semester, I still failed a class. Between last semester and this past semester I made some changes that allowed me to succeed in some classes. Some of these changes included: writing in a notebook rather than typing my notes to help with focus, scheduling an hour a day to finish coursework, having a better routine, and making study guides as the semester went rather than studying only right before big exams. Now, I recognize also that there are some faults in my studying habits and throughout the semester I have adapted them. Rather than one hour a day, I began clocking in two hours every day and not only for coursework but also for studying and planning ahead. I also realized that in some of my classes, the material was distributed faster than I could write, and typing was a must. Where I failed in, was communicating with my professors. In World Religions, I did fairly well on the midterm and final, because I understood all the concepts and knew the material. The issue arose when it came to essays. I found writing about the topics extremely difficult. Instead of going to office hours and seeking help with them, I racked my brain for hours and accomplished nothing, because a failed essay is a 0. That was my biggest problem academically this semester. In Theater 101, I had trouble because I failed two tasks. One was planning ahead; the other was studying correctly for the class. I understand that my challenges arose from a lack of foresight and that they are a result of my own doing.

For context purposes, I would like to explain some of the situations that arose between Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 and affected my life. This is by no means an attempt to excuse myself from my shortcomings but rather an attempt to give a more holistic perspective. As a freshman in the fall of 2017, I entered school excited and full of wonder, ready to feed my starving mind. I was not ready for the personal setbacks. I found it difficult to balance my scholastic responsibilities with my family ones and many times found myself having to choose between important paperwork my family needed or studying for an upcoming test. There was also the homesickness and a lot of traveling back home. On top of this cutting hours from my study time, my family experienced multiple medical hardships to which I could not attend to, causing more worry than normal an affecting my focus. My parents are adults and I know they can handle themselves as such, but they do not speak English and find filling out important paperwork difficult sometimes. They were applying for a change in their citizenship status and this application required many affidavits and personal statements from people who knew them, some who also only speak Spanish, requiring me to write these statements and affidavits not only in Spanish but also in English and getting them notarized. It was a lot of work, but worth it because after their court date, the judge approved their application. Besides this, I left college for a semester to undergo Army basic combat training. I left on January 2nd and fractured four leg bones as well as attaining various muscle lesions in my lower back. I returned home in April and visited school to pay off my remaining balance. I cannot say the experience was bad, but it did require a different mental state, and returning to the civilian world took some readjusting. To the point where a friend’s alarm at 6 made me jump out of bed and stand at attention to avoid an imaginary punishment. Starting school fall of 2018 made me nervous and excited. Learning is my passion and what better place to learn at than a research center with a mixture of people? I chose introductory courses that were varied in subjects I found interesting. Again this semester was a game of balance, but this time between schoolwork, family, and army paperwork. Since August, I have not had medical insurance due to some filing issues and have not received any form of physical therapy or such. This is one issue I have been attempting to fix since. I have also only now been approved for an honorable discharge. This is a result of the paperwork and meetings during the past semester. These balance issues are merely on top of simple struggles with readjusting to college life. Something that improved as the semester went along. Towards the end of the semester, I felt like I had really grown into myself and was excited for what I could accomplish the next semester. 

To ensure my success if given the opportunity to return this semester, I have created a plan. It entails more communication with my SSS counselor,  academic advisor so that I am always aware of all my resources. Also, I plan to create a better schedule for myself and extend my time on schoolwork as well as provide enough room for unexpected changes. I also plan on working this semester to ease my financial stress. To better achieve a balance between my family responsibilities and my academic ones I have spent the break delegating some responsibilities to my sibling as well as asking my parents to relieve some of the responsibilities so that I can achieve a better balance. Towards the end of last semester, I had also planned on becoming more involved with the Thurgood Marshall Pre-Law Society as well as participating in Professor Xxxxxxxxx’x clinic for immigration help this spring. I also planned on becoming more involved with the multicultural resource center so that I could apply to their internship program next fall. Besides this, I had planned on applying for an internship with the Attorney General’s office in NYC this summer. I realize that my goals in the past have been very general, but this semester I have very concrete goals, if a bit unrealistic, goals. First, I strive to return to being a straight A’s student. Second, I strive to become more involved on campus through my volunteering at the multicultural resource center. Third, I plan on stabilizing my economy by getting a job.  

I know that I can succeed at Binghamton and contribute to it as well. I have always fought tooth and nail for my success and I would greatly appreciate another chance to demonstrate what I can do. This break has really served to to rekindle my motivation and drive. I hope you will allow me to bring my enthusiasm to Binghamton. I would greatly appreciate a chance to speak in person if it is possible. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon. 

Sincerely, 
Xxxxxxxxxxx"

aggqqs,3,2019-01-15,My life went from fairly great to absolutely miserable in 2018. Now I don't know what to do...,UnfoundHound,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/aggqqs/my_life_went_from_fairly_great_to_absolutely/,"Tl;dr: My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me last year after finally having moved in with me. My left went from great to miserable in instant. I had to stop working, studying; I can't do anything. Post-breakup, I plunged into a severe depression and have been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, mostly related to my traumatic childhood rather than my ex. She thinks it's all because of her however and I screwed up big time with her. I sent her emotional texts and I attempted suicide 3 times because of her and of which she is aware. She now has me blocked as she thinks she is not good for me and I am not good for her. I don't know what to do with my life. I want to study Psychology but it will cost me 7-10k a year; money I don't have. I don't even have the energy to move forward. Suicide seems more tempting every day... Any advice or help?

&amp;#x200B;

In January 2018 I was in an almost perfect relationship for 2,5 years with this wonderful girl. Those 2,5 years were long distance, but we saw each other every month or so for a weekend, a week or two, or for 2 months in the summer. We both were excited to finally live together. However, I was still living with my dad at age 24 due to financial and practical reasons regarding my study. My GF knew of course and she had no problem with temporarily living at my dad's place. In fact, it was the most practical option as it meant less pressure on her to settle in and get her stuff in order. 

The first few weeks went pretty well, but I was quite busy with studying and she was a bit bored. So besides spending more time with her, I suggested some activities she could do, like volunteering at an animal shelter and going to a music group. She did that and she loved it. Shortly after she got a job. Things were looking good. Though when she started her job, I started an internship. We both got very busy and had different work schedules. With all the stress and little time for each other, our relationship was under a lot of pressure. After 2,5 months we got into a small fight and she blurted out she wanted to break up with me. Despite the difficult time, it came as a total surprise to me. She told me she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to feel more life and in different ways. I had to beg her to give me another chance and she did, but she did not and could not tell me what exactly had to change.

The next weekend, I took her out for dinner and she loved it. She even told me then that she loves me. That was in April and it went pretty well. We were finally able to actively look for a place together. We bought a car together. It was going better. Though in May we got back into the same drag. It didn't help that she worked in another city at different times. She had also made new friends with whom she wanted to spend time with. I had no problem with that. I actually supported her in doing so, because I knew she had struggled with making friends and fitting in. So I was happy she finally found herself in a good place. Nevertheless, we still go into small fights over silly things. Besides that, we had a lot of trouble with finding a place as we weren't financially attractive for landlords. So I wanted to talk to my GF about it and I suggested that maybe we should both get our own place as that would be a lot easier. She hardly responded. I guess at that point she was already set on leaving me. Two weeks later she had packed all her stuff and told me she found a place in the city she works in. She said she wanted to break up because she doesn't love me anymore and does not believe things will change. That was at the beginning of June.

The next day, I helped her move and I managed to convince her to have a break instead of breaking up. It did not last long. I did not take it all well and became far too emotional. She broke up with me for good. However, she still liked me a lot and wanted to stay friends, but she just didn't see me as a lover anymore. Looking back, I understand why and I want to fix it, but I can't. 

After the break-up, I plunged into a severe depression. I was obsessing over getting her back and it only made things worse. About 1,5 months after the break-up, we actually had a friendly meet-up planned, but I called her up emotionally before that. Big mistake. She said it be best to have no contact for a few months. It broke me even more. I did not contact her in those months, but I couldn't do anything else either. I just lay in bed crying all day. I attempted suicide multiple times. I did look for professional help. A psychologist diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and we came to the conclusion that there is more to it than just the break-up and my ex. Most of my issues stem from childhood trauma as I had a really bad childhood.

I got referred to emergency psychological help, but even they had a waiting list. So actual treatment was months away. Eventually, in October I thought it was good to contact my ex again and later we met up. It was supposed to be casual, but it was inevitable to not talk about the relationship. She could see I was having a difficult time, but she told me she would never want me back. She didn't want to give me false hopes. That devastated me. We still had a great day, but I was dead inside.

The next day, I sent her a goodbye text and was close to committing suicide. Luckily, she called me just in time and talked me out of it. She told me she would see me as an option in the future. It was the only thing she could give me, but it was enough for me. However, two weeks later I screwed up by sending her emotional texts. We actually had made plans together, but this was too much for her. She sent me a long last text before blocking me. I panicked and resorted to self-harm and eventually taking a bunch of pills with alcohol. A friend of mine called the emergency services and I was hospitalized. My ex knew. I was released from the hospital the same day as I wasn't in any life danger.

I haven't spoken to her since the end of October. I got some indirect contact with her through friends and I sent her some letters, one of which was a suicide letter. That letter was impulsive and I regretted instantly. Via my brother, I apologized to her and told her I'm okay and not to worry. For Christmas, I sent her a simple card, hoping it would mend things a bit. Not surprisingly, I have not heard from her.

Since the break-up, I had to quit my job, my studies, sports, pretty much everything. As of now, I am diagnosed with MDD as well as Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). According to my psychiatrist, I show symptoms of anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and personality disorder (i.e. avoidant, dependent, OCD). So I am clearly mentally ill and I feel mentally ill. I feel like I have lost almost all control over my life. My life is in ruins.

I hope I can be with my ex again, but I know it's pretty much impossible. I screwed up so badly. I put so much pressure on her and she probably thinks I tried to emotionally blackmail her with suicide threats even though that was genuinely not my intention. I want her to be happy, and she doesn't have to be with me right now as she should do what she wants. I just hope she could give me a chance in the future as I believe we can make it work in the future. I think she gave up too quickly, but I don't blame her. I was her first boyfriend and she feels like she needs to explore now.

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in 'the one'. I know there are other girls for me out there. Heck, I even dated in these past months and I had some great dates, meeting nice girls. Though it is nothing like with my ex. I just have this gut feeling that she and I still have a future or that our relationship at least deserves another chance. However, in my current state and as things are now I'm pretty hopeless.

I don't know what to do with my life. I am 24yo and I am close to finishing my masters, but as of now I do not have the energy to finish it. Actually, I came to the realization that I do not want to work in my field of study. I want to study Psychology as it always interested me and it has become very relevant for me now. I want to directly help people. It's the only thing that gives me satisfaction. Though today I heard that it will cost me at least 7-10k a year to get a bachelor degree in it, because I already have a bachelor degree. I don't really have that money and neither does my father. Though I know deep down that if I give up on it then I will not be happy. So I am willing to give it a shot if I can find some way to pay for it. Though even then, at the moment, I do not have the energy to work towards it. I feel incapable without my ex. She gave me so much motivation, so much happiness, and now it's gone. I know I should not rely on her and I thought I never did. Only now do I realize how dependent I was on her and how mentally ill I am. In fact, my mental illness very likely contributed to the break-up. So I also feel like I got betrayed by myself. The person who I am now is not the person who I actually am nor want to be. That's also why I am so convinced that I can be the person my ex wants. I just feel like I am stuck and suicide seems more tempting every day...

I am desperate for advice and help. Anyone?

I'm a freshman at Harvard. I was wondering if anyone had advice on having a better freshman spring semester than my fall semester, which wasn't the best. Academically it went okay, I guess mostly I'm looking for advice socially, and extracurricularly. I felt really terrible at first, to the point where I have seriously considered transferring, but then started hanging out with a few good friends more and it got a lot better. But I still wish I had more friends and more of a social life, and I mean genuine friends rather than ""connections"" in the snakey way. I would consider myself a pretty sociable and outgoing person who actively tries to go to different events and make new friends, but despite how hard I've tried, it was a lot harder here than at high school. I'm more of an introvert and I'm a little shy, but I try not to let this stop me from meeting new people and I'm always trying to push myself out of my comfort zone to talk to people, but it seems very difficult because the majority of people here seem much more extroverted than me, and by now a lot of them seem to have cliqued up already and I can no longer just walk up to people and say ""wanna be friends?"" I've tried joining clubs and stuff, but it hasn't helped a bunch. If I were a singer (and actually wanted to sing too), I really wish I could join an a capella group or something because they seem like really great and tight-knit communities and I've heard of so many people making their closest friends there. I also wish I could experience more of the social/party scene too, since I consider it a part of the college experience that I just want to try at least, but the good friends I do have are more nerdy like me and aren't super into partying and drinking, which I respect, but I also wish I had some friends I could get lit with once and a while too. I don't hear about or get invited to parties except the ones organized by cultural groups and big clubs that I'm in. Overall, while there are definitely negative aspects of the Harvard culture, I do think there are great people here as well and often people I see or have mutual acquaintances with who make me think ""wow they're so cool, I wish I could be friends with them!"" but there is often not a real reason for me to talk to them without seeming weird because we aren't in any classes/clubs together, and I'm also not sure where to meet more of these cool people.

This semester, I've also made it a goal of mine to try out more EC's I like, but there are so many that seem interesting and cool and I'm not sure how to choose without spreading myself out too thin. The few I did this semester I wasn't completely satisfied with, and I'm just trying to find some that could fit my interests and passions better.

Sorry for the long post. Overall, I'm just trying to have a much better semester than freshman fall. That is my goal. I want to meet new people and make good friends. I also want to be successful (in the snakey way, internships and research and stuff - I admit I am very ambitious but I also think that I am at least a decent/good person.) and try new things and find some clubs I really care about. Also, if anyone is reading this and would be open to talking to a stressed freshman, or anyone else who is in a similar situation to me, I would love to talk and receive advice/mope together and become friends."

Communication problems with superiors,IndependentPassenger,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/agktce/is_this_common_for_other_companies_communication/,"I though about posting this on Moronic Monday but maybe this fits more as a standalone post.

For reference I'm a intern ""sysadmin"", actually called IT guy, but I'm the only sysadmin/it/helpdesk in our company (around 100 people over 3 locations), and get payed 10% more than minimum salary but the company only pays around 20% of my full salary (the rest is subsidized by the gov).

Time as come for renovation of our Antivirus solution. They have used Panda for around 1 year and although it detects and blocks most stuff it also generates some problems with updates and false positives on stuff that's already white listed.

I started looking for some other options and found a couple that were cheaper since the company doesn't want to spend more in IT and found Webroot that seems fine for us and was about 500€ to 1000€ cheaper.
Talked about it with a couple of guys that know something about computers in the company and started to gather info and testing to show them to the Boss (while having talked with her about possible change on AV).

After some consideration I've came to the conclusion that even though our current AV is ok, changing to a new one would have a great toll on my time and probably backlog even more the tasks that I have in the company, not even considering possible differences in AV's. So I went to the Boss and my colleague and explained this.

The response that they gave me was something expected but also unusual.
I was given a talk and asked: ""Consider this change like this, if we took 500-1000€ from your paycheck to maintain the same antivirus, would you keep it or change it?""

At the time I was a bit struck by it and since we were in a not so professional setting I considered it in a joking way, but over time I've been thinking that they might be serious.

As anyone ever experienced this? How do you deal with this? I know it's common for companies to prefer cheaper options but this seems a bit extreme.

And I know I should look for something better but I've been sending curriculum's daily and applying since day one and I've yet to get an interview. Also, Portugal, not US, even though I'd love to move to the US it seems impossible right now due to visas.

TL;DR: After suggested change in AV company ""threatens"" me with decreasing salary to accommodate costs?"

I'm a senior majoring in computer science and minoring in math, and I have had past internships in software development. I have an interview with ComScore for a Data Scientist position. Now, I have no experience with data science. I had some work in machine learning and web-scraping but that was all software creation, I wasn't using any data science concepts (I think). I plan on telling this in my interview, being as open as possible; basically, saying although I do not have any direct experience with data science, I am interested in it and am willing to pick it up. I also am taking a course in data science when this semester starts and my current part-time job may also require some data science principles in the future. So I guess before I graduate I will have a little more data science experience, which I'll tell them, but for this interview next week I'm pretty dry.

I was wondering what a good resource for learning the essentials of data science is. I know what the general process is: recording, cleaning, transformation, processing, and evaluation. I also am comfortable with math concepts like integration and some basic probability/stats. But that's about it. I would like to learn the basics of it pretty quickly, and if there's an equivalent of ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" for Data Science too, that would be great to look at!

Also, anyone here have experience interviewing with ComScore, or know about their process? What sort of questions do they ask? Is it heavily data science/technical focus or more soft-skills focus?

Unemployed but boss was a jerk.,luckyrattail,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/aglmnw/unsure_if_i_should_accept_job_offer_unemployed/,"I went to a job interview on Monday. I quit my last job because there was a toxic work environment. My previous boss recommended me to the owner/boss of this business. I’ll refer to the boss as R. 

I was told about a position being available soon on December 4 from my previous boss, who I’m still friends with and speak to. I was told R was going to let a current employee go soon and that position would be available. My friend recommended me to R. I was informed to email my resume directly to him and not to go the business as the employees did not know anything about the situation. I emailed my resume and then was asked what days I would be available to work and my expected salary. I did not hear anything else until last Friday (January 11). R called me and asked if I’m still interested in the position. 

He apologized for taking so long to contact me, he blamed it on the holidays, and asked if I would drive to his other business for interview with him. The position I’ve been corresponding with him about is in the town I live in, however, this other business is located over an hour away. I said yes, as I thought that it would be a good impression of me to do so. We agreed to do the interview the following Monday (January 14) at 11 am. 

When I arrived to the place Monday, I went in at 10:40. I walked in and when R came to speak to me he asked who I was and where I was interviewing for. He then told me he had forgot I was coming for a interview. R took me upstairs to his office. There was an employee working at a desk outside of his office and the office did not have a door. 

During the interview he would yell to the employee and talk about other employees or customers of his. He mentioned one employee is not smart and there was a discussion about a customer to which he said: “she is the same age as me and we went to school together. I’ve aged better than her but then again she wasn’t anything good to look at back then. But she has been a loyal customer unlike other people.” He asked if I knew any of the employees at the location I was interviewing for and I told him yes and that I previously worked with W when she did her internship at my previous workplace. He responded with “who is W?” And I said her full name and he just changed the subject. W has worked for him for 2 years. 

The entire interview went like that. He would talk about other people and seemed to be not very professional or nice. I got weird vibes from him. He told me he would let me know this week about the job. He went over all the benefits and told me how much I’d be paying for health insurance. 

However, if I am offered the job I’m not too sure if I should accept it. I am currently unemployed but from the interview process I feel like working for him would be hell. I also feel like I may not be offered the job as he had forgot that I was coming for interview, and I’ve been corresponding with him about the job since early December.

agmebc,12,2019-01-16,Seeking Transition Advice: Army Field Artillery Officer to Professional Engineer,Shacknu,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/agmebc/seeking_transition_advice_army_field_artillery/,"Dear r/AskEngineers,

I am currently a field artillery officer in the Army, and I am seeking advice to help me transition towards my goal of becoming a professional engineer.  I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech in May 2015, and have not done any engineering for 3 1/2 years.

Questions
1. What are my options to help me acquire a job? Started the Army’s Soldier-for-Life Transition Assistance Program.  Currently looking at internship opportunities and EIT license.

2. Is internship the best option?

3. What other options are there that I should look into? (certificates, co-ops, R&amp;D etc)

4. What are the best resources to study for the FE exam? I’m looking at multiple options for practice exams, study/reference books, and manuals: NCEES, PPI, Michael Lindeburg manual, 12-part EIT Academy Course on engineerintrainingexam.com, and YouTube.

5. How should I build my network? So far I’ve reached out to the Career Skills Program Manager in Fort Riley, one close friend who is a systems engineer at MITRE, one close friend who is a chief engineer at Amazon, and emailed Virginia Tech graduate and undergraduate advisors.

6. What are good companies to work for in the Aerospace and Defense industry? Currently looking at Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Orbital ATK, United Technologies Corporation, The MITRE Corporation, CACI, and MTSI.

7. What kind of salary range should I expect as an entry level mechanical or systems engineer in the northern VA area?

8. What are the steps to acquire a TS/SCI (top secret clearance)?

9. What other advice can you give that I haven’t thought of?


Long-Term Plan: 5+ Years

My current career plan is to become a professional engineer in five years.  I am mostly interested in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.  My wife and I also plan to live northern VA since that’s where we grew up, where our family and friends are, we love the area, and the home of many VT alumni (she also graduated from VT).  The plan is to:
1. Acquire an internship
2. Pass the FE exam, acquire EIT license
3. Get a job
4. Acquire TS/SCI (top secret clearance)
5. After four years, take PE exam, acquire PE license
6. Keep working (?)
7. Acquire Master’s Degree (?)
8. Keep working or conduct engineering research (?)
9. Acquire Ph.D (?)
10. Become an industry researcher or college professor (?)
I put question marks next to the ones I am interested in, but unsure of or have not put much thought and research into.


Short-Term Plan: 2019-2020

I have an eight (8) year contract with the Army (4 years active, 4 years reserve).  I have been on active duty for three years, with one year left in my contract before I transition to IRR (individual ready reserve).  I plan to ETS (Expiration of Term of Service) January 2020, which is when I am released from active duty.  I am currently in Poland for my brigade’s rotation/deployment.  Current timeline:

1. Now-May2019: Poland rotation.  Study for FE exam.  Return to Fort Riley in mid/late May.

2. June2019: Soldier-for-Life Transition Assistance Program (SFL-TAP) at Riley.  I plan to start early June and capstone in three weeks.

3. July2019-October2019: Internship in Virginia and take the FE exam.  Battalion commander approved of my plan to do an internship back in northern VA for up to 4 months (I can start as early as July 5th, 2019) while still getting paid full time by the Army.

4. November2019: Clear from Fort Riley.  I’ve been told this only takes 10 days.

5. December2019: Terminal leave begins.  Hawaii trip, Christmas and New Years with family.

6. January2020: Move family to northern Virginia

7. February2020: Start engineering job

This is not for a class or internship, just purely something I am interested in doing on my own that will hopefully look good on a resume. 

I want to create a device that measures the current output of my USB phone charger as it is charging my phone. I intend to use it to test various fast chargers to accurately test if they perform as intended. 

I plan on using a coloumb counter to measure the current output of the phone charger. Then using some microcontroller to talk to the counter and record the data. Then I want to be able to connect to the device to retrieve the data using bluetooth. 

By the way I have never programmed in C before and I have never designed an antenna. I have taken very little emag or RF related courses and my programming is limited mostly to some interesting bash scripts. I do have some good first time PCB layout experience. 

Learning objectives: 

1. Design and debug bluetooth antenna 
2. Program microcontroller using C language. 
3. Interface with Coloumb counter IC (such as LTC4150)


Questions: 

1. Would it be better to find a bluetooth transceiver IC and make it work with an Arduino? Or should I attempt to program one of these bluetooth IC's that have the MCU and everything built in?  

2. What types of bus interfaces would be best for my project that would be easiest to understand? I2C ? RS232? UART? 

3. What types of problems should I plan to encounter that I am completely unaware of? 

**Edits**

* I want to show that I can design an antenna from scratch

I have been reaching out to anyone who I respect in the industry and trying to sort out what my next steps should be. I figured I should go to Reddit where I can find a community of such individuals.

I'm fairly comfortable in programming although I have done very little from scratch. But I don't have any reliable areas of interest and I tend to be a generalist in my pursuits so when a friend of a friend working with Amazon Music suggested I put together a website - I figured this would be a good option to get my feet wet in a lot of different areas. Through classes, I have been exposed to C, C++, Java, and Python but wouldn't claim proficiency in any one of those languages. I would say I'm rusty at best. I am open to taking an entry level software position, an internship (if they would take a graduate), learning full stack web dev, or learning app dev. Would anyone have any suggestions for potential next steps?

Much appreciation for your time.

I graduated May 2018 with my MS in mathematics, and in 2016 with my BS in mathematics as well. I mainly studied applied math, but I'm having a shit-ton of trouble finding work that I can do with it. All of my work experience is in education like TAing and tutoring, and leading student organizations as an officer. This is apparently not enough to wow companies in the slightest as I'm getting resume-rejected.

Here's what I'm listing on my resume pretty much:

* BS in Math (GPA 4.0)
* MS in Math (GPA 3.84)
* TA job, Student Org officer positions, Math tutoring job at college tutoring center.
* Programming projects that were my own original work.

I have no internships, no publications. Nothing really relevant except the master's research that I'd done (unpublished).

So why not go into education? Well, I've been thinking about it a lot since I graduated, as I had to teach as a TA at my university during my master's. I worked VERY hard at it and the students that actually came to class loved my teaching, but I just wasn't exactly passionate about it. I was always stressed out and I felt like I wasn't teaching from the heart. Recently, it's come to my attention that the high school that I went to is ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE for teachers right now because they're just quitting left-and-right. Students are being taught by subs who barely know math and are being told to Google everything. The math department chair at the high school heard about me looking for work, and she *immediately* jumped on the opportunity to offer me a job. I filled out all the paperwork, went through the background check, etc., but I'm just feeling apprehensive about taking the job. Sure, I can be the department chair's saving grace, but given that I've tried teaching and I decided that it just wasn't for me, I'm afraid that me teaching these kids maybe just as harmful, if not worse, as them being taught by clueless subs.

I've only had two on-site interviews in the span of 7 months. One was for a business who was DESPERATE to fill an analyst job that was in the next town over. They did a basic phone interview, and I totally blew it, but they called me back a few hours later telling me I passed the phone screen, and that they wanted to interview me in-person the next day. I interviewed for that, and I thought I'd nailed the interview. They told me it would take 3-5 weeks to hear back, because they were ""anxious to get the role filled."" Well, 3-5 weeks go by and I get your run-of-the-mill, canned e-mail that the position was filled. I just chalked it up to having no relevant experience and being over-qualified education-wise with a master's for a position that didn't require more than a two-year degree.

Well, in the interim I still apply places in the event that I might hear something back sooner elsewhere. I get lots of rejections at the resume stage and I employed my university's career center to help me make sure that my resume isn't off-putting. They had no qualms, and I continued to use the one I'd made. I could barely score any phone interviews, but the ones that I did score I was rejected the following week for with no explanation.

Back in December, a national laboratory gave me an all-expenses paid trip to go interview with them: flight, food, rental car. You name it. They spent at least $1,000 on me. But incidentally, they didn't even interview me over the phone or anything. I applied, and they e-mailed me like a week later saying they wanted me on-site. I jumped on the opportunity and they put me up against 3 groups to try and interview. I thought the interviews went fairly well. While I was being escorted from one building to the next, I remember asking the escort what she thought was the most important characteristic the group I'd just interviewed with was looking for. Her answer was, ""Well, I think what's most important is the ability to talk to people. If you can't talk to people, absolutely nothing will save you!"" Given that I thought my interview went well, I thought nothing of her remark. However, in hindsight I realize her desk was immediately outside of the interview room, and interviewers were coming one-by-one, in and out. She probably knew based on what each successive interviewer told her as they left. My recruiter was specifically for new college grads, but I'd been graduated since May. A question that kept popping up through my interviews was ""What have you been doing since May?"" I answered it honestly to say I'd been doing freelance work (which is the truth) while I look for more permanent work. Even the recruiter e-mailed me prior to my interviews saying she didn't realize that I'd already graduated and asked me what I'd been doing all this time.

The recruiter told me that it could take up to 3 months to hear back if I'd receive an offer for employment. Well, they got back to me much sooner than that: they let me know the first week of January. After interviewing with 3 different branches, it was straight ""No""s across the board. I was in shock and couldn't believe that'd happened. Pretend that receiving an offer came down to a coin flip: there's an 87.5% chance I got at least one offer. I somehow landed in the remaining 12.5% of receiving no offers! I was just completely flabbergasted by the whole situation. They spent a whole bunch of money on me and I failed them. (Technically, a lot of blame falls on them for offering me an on-site with no interview beforehand whatsoever, but still.) I suspected something might've been wrong when I e-mailed some of the people I interviewed with, and no one responded; I thought it was just due to Christmas and New Year's. But again in hindsight, I think I know what happened: the way I talk and act is apparently off-putting.

I'm fully aware that I'm a total Aspie: I have a very deep, syrupy voice, and I don't have much variation in my voice which one of my students whined and complained about in my evaluations as ""speaking in a monotone"". But I mean, I've been able to hold down jobs for long periods of time before, so I just dismissed it as angry students. However, all of my fellow TAs when I taught always mentioned that I'm Mr. Dark and Depressing; that I never smile. I'm aware of this, and I chalk it up to being chronically clinically depressed, but still being high-functioning enough to get work done.

I have an idea of what I want to do with my credentials, and that's to work research. I was incredibly interested to be able to work at that national laboratory. I think the recruiter was very interested in me for GPA reasons, given that they work mostly in research. However, I'm just going to flat-out finally admit that my inability to find any work is because there's something wrong with me. I NEED work NOW at this point because it's been 7 months and my parents cannot accept me being jobless anymore. But at the same time, I'm afraid that I've wasted the value of being a new college graduate. If I want to get a job in research, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to pursue a PhD or another master's so that I have another chance at New Grad status. I'd tried applying at some more national laboratories now, but I'm not sure I can find another one willing to take a chance on me like the first one did."

So 3 years ago I was in really bad shape. Stay at home dad is bad for me. REAL bad for my mental state and I had been doing it since my daughter was 6 weeks old. I started talking to my friends that actually like their job and made good money and all of them are in some form of IT or programming.

I decided to go back to school at the local community college. Then I missed the deadline for the first semester....... I almost quit before I started. But I HAD to do something. So to class I went.

The classes that people flunked out of I found easy, and the filler classes made me pull my hair out and almost quit. I had one bad semester that I swore that I was quitting the program at least once a week. That was my worst semester at a 3.0.  I learned what I like and what I was good at.  

Graduating was anti climactic. I still needed a job. If you go back to school, especially in my program, take advantage of internships and WBLs. I learned that one too late. Getting back into the job market after a break is terrifying. I had had a part time gig, but a real career job is intimidating. Did this degree that I had put so much blood sweat and tear into really mean anything?

My first interview was a heart breaker. To get that far and come so close...... Then nothing. No one hires from December till mid January. Then the phone rang. An interview tomorrow. Some uncertainty afterwards as to what they would do. An offer with no start date. But then..........

I am as proud as I can be to say that I start my first Systems Administration job in a primarily Red Hat Linux environment Tuesday. The sooner you start the sooner you finish kids. I have a ton to learn and so much to do, but I made it to the starting line. And I'm ready to go.

I want to say thanks to this subreddit for giving me insight into what a sysadmins daily life is like and helping me feel like I knew what to say in an interview to sound like I  belonged there.  See you out there guys and gals!"

But even if it's unpaid, I'm willing to do it just because I feel it's better than working a minimum wage part time job for 4 months (I mean, the money from that would help, but I'm prioritizing getting as much out of my undergrad years as I can). 

Would you recommend unpaid internships? I don't know how useful they are/how good they look on resumes. Would it be better to just work the summer job and work on projects in my free time?

And do companies even do unpaid internships these days? I don't know a single person who's done one. Assuming they do, where should I look? i.e. Should I be looking at big companies or startups? Is there a specific field I should look into (I think I'm fairly well rounded in terms of coding, networking, IT, web dev, etc.)? Should I email them myself, or only apply to ones that explicitly state they'll take interns? etc. 

**TLDR** Is it common for companies to take unpaid interns? If so, what type of company/department does so more often (big or small, software development or IT, etc.)? And if they don't explicitly say on their website that they're taking interns, should I still send my (sparse) CV and hope? 

I'm in Toronto, Canada if that makes a huge difference. Any advice whatsoever is greatly appreciated."

I realize it's a bit hasty from my end, but I'm already feeling a bit frustrated at my new job two weeks in. I'm currently working in one of the offices of a large financial corp in my area. I won't disclose any further on my background due to privacy reasons; hence why I'm using a throwaway account.

So... Why am I frustrated after 2 weeks? 

Well...


1. During my interview with my supervisor, I mentioned the use of Git and the importance of version control at my previous job (worked for a web dev shop doing some full-stack work during college). He said version control is ideal, clinical-type stuff you only see in classrooms and not in the real world. Could he have forgotten that this was a real job experience? TIL I got paid to go to school, that's nice.
2. Speaking of job experience, my supervisor had mentioned that my internships weren't really job experience and that this job would really be my first. Was kind of a slap in the face, especially since this and the above happened within 5 minutes.
3. Didn't have my badge ready by the first day of the job, meaning getting past security was a hassle, let alone getting into my office.
4. We didn't have useable hardware for a good day and a half, due to the outsourced IT company that manages our hardware (and well, *anything* that isn't in-house tech in general) was disorganized. There's a still a few things we don't have access to this very day. Hell, I got my Windows key activated after a whole 2 weeks of work! Once one of the asshole employees decided to type `slmgr -rearm` remotely (something I could've easily done myself), I decided to call tech support so they'd finish my PC's setup the right way.
5. The codebase is old. **REALLY OLD.** Like ASP Classic old. Not documented, of course.
6. Coding principles are thrown off the window. Supervisor prefers everything in lower caps without any hyphens or underscores in between, which entirely ignores general wisdom and advice.
7. Exhibit #2: Using HUGE database tables that aren't normalized as my supervisor finds using multiple tables as not necessary at all.  At the moment, this leads me to suspect that the correct use of foreign keys and thusly normalization is just a dream.
8. Our programming environment is the **PRODUCTION SERVER!** Really sensitive data (and our productivity) entirely hinges on this aging, unprotected platform. Without any version control, it's quite easy for anyone (don't have to be a newbie to screw up this badly) to just completely annihilate years of information. It doesn't necessarily have to be something as bad as `DROP`. Deleting a few hundred rows or two is bad enough.

I'm already getting all these terrible signs within 2 weeks of being here. What should I do? First thing I'll do by next week is recommend the use of Git, but I'm having a hard time making a good case for them, as we're talking about aging code and sensitive information such as SSNs.

Sorry for the lengthy post, but I'm pretty disappointed; I'm trying to look on the bright side of things, but I just can't. This is technically my first ever full time job so it's not the end of the world. I simply have to find a way to make the best of it."

Should I switch to CS or finish my degree in Information Technology?,Throwaway3543g59,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/agswej/going_back_to_college_next_fall_should_i_switch/,"Hello I'm 23, I've been working since last June from a help desk internship to a full time Help desk contact job. I'll be going back to school next fall and I'm at a crossroads. Long story short I have a visual impairment, I struggled in math growing up. I always loved technology and enjoy programming and networking. When I told my mom I wanted to major in computer science two years ago she said she wouldn't pay for my tuition if I majored in CS due to the math requirements. Now that I'm older and I understand why I struggled with math.

(A) I never studied

(B) I wasn't interested

(C) I realized I lacked the foundational skills required.

(D) Some of the teachers/ Professors treated me like I was a nuisance because of my disability.

I enjoy math more now, Don't find it as boring as I  did when I was younger. I really want this degree,  want to actually become good at math, not be afraid. I'm just unsure of how to go about it. I'm thinking of transferring to Farmingdale with my AAS degree in IT, taking the majority of the CS courses there while still transferring my credits.

Thanks!

*Edit, forget to mention, I got an A in Algebra/Trig and a C+(79.45) in Pre-calc. Like everyone else I realized once I actually put in the work by studying the book, notes practice problems I did fine, I'm willing to put in whatever hours nessicary to become good at math and get a CS degree, my only worry is how much time I'll still be in college. I already started to review my algebra/trig  for next fall.*"
agswvv,14,2019-01-16,Side projects and internships as a CS student,solverson,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/agswvv/side_projects_and_internships_as_a_cs_student/,"Heyo, so I'm majoring in Comp Sci after doing 1.5 years (3 semesters) in a small competitive program in Bio/Life sciences (starts with an N), hating it, taking a 'mental health gap year' after some shit went down, and finally switching into CS for Fall 2018. I'm a U3 set to graduate in 2020 as a U4 (even though I basically skipped over my U2 year lol)

The summer is rolling around, and I would love to apply for internships, but I am struck with a sense of complete uselessness and inadequacy, coupled with some hardcore job anxiety. I've taken some/most of the core CS courses (COMP 251, all the other 200s, COMP 302, COMP 303) but I still don't feel confident to do anything with my skills. I'm really only solid in Java; I've been coding in Java since I was 15. I know some C, Python, and Javascript, but I don't feel super comfortable with them.

I don't really have anything to show for my abilities; I have some Java mini-games I made in high school and some COMP 206 stuff on my GitHub, and my GPA is pretty okay/good, but this way of marketing myself in the tech industry is new to me. I had a killer semester last Fall to make up for the transfer, so I didn't have the time/motivation to do any side projects.

I always feel like I'm not doing enough and I'll just end up graduating with all this theoretical knowledge but not knowing how to do anything someone can pay me for.

Any suggestions/advice on the following would be helpful.

* Have you done any side projects? How do you have the time for them as a full-time student? Is it better to set aside some time to do side projects, even if that means letting my GPA slide a little?
* I struggle with motivation; how do you get the motivation to do side projects? I get bored too easily and I'm always too stressed about midterms/finals to sit down and get anything done.
* Is there any point applying for internships? My CV/GitHub/LinkedIn is kinda crap, having just transferred in -- should I ask my Tim Hortons boss to hire me back this summer?

Sorry for the length; any insight would be helpful. Also I know this comes off as low self-esteem-y but I'm in therapy who isn't at this point

TL;DR Recently transferred CS student with a lot of job anxiety/feelings of inadequacy looking to do an internship; how important are side projects, and should I apply to internships even though my CV is poo?"

&amp;#x200B;

The first option is an internship that would be over the summer and pay $22 an hour. 

The other option is through the school and would offer me two six month internships, I am basically guaranteed both internships but I do not know where they will be yet and once I get the offer I cannot decline. Also if I back out of the first one I cannot do the second. The way it works is I talk to a bunch of companies and then the companies choose interns based on a draft system.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first one, I really liked the person that I would be working under and from what I heard like the things that I would be doing. The biggest downside is that I would have to find housing in a city that I do not live in for three months.

For the second option I could potentially make more money with it than the first option but most likely will make around $20 an hour. Housing would be easier as it is six months instead of 3 and I could, unlikely though, get an internship in the town of my school where I have housing. Also having two internships would look really good when searching for jobs. Downsides would be that it will delay graduation by 9 months and after this term, I would no longer have classes with friends. I did like a few of the companies that I talked to but a lot of them where very hardware support based as opposed to working on software which is what I want to do.

  
So is there a clear cut better option here that will help my career more than the other. I need to make a decision soon and it is stressing me out much more than it should."

It was for tax accounting (even though I am in finance), and I haven't studied it in close to a year now.

I’m getting worried that they are not replying and I’m not sure if I’m annoying them by sending the follow up emails. I’m not sure if the lack of replies is due to the inevitable influx of emails at the start of the year or if they’ve just simply forgotten about what we had discussed.

I will list some details below and I would love to know my chances of getting in so I can continue my plans for the future based on my odds.

&amp;#x200B;

University for undergrad: University of North Carolina at Charlotte

Degree: BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science.

Current GPA: 3.801

GRE: Didnt take yet, not required but recommended.

Relevant Professional Experience: 2 months as Software Engineer Intern

Financial situation: I am still dependent after I graduate I have limited time to work if I get in to Northwestern. My mom is a single mother that has 4 children that only makes \~$24000 a year with no taxes taken out. Because of this I planned on working for a bit (2 years ish) and help my family with financial stability but I feel that just getting into what I intend to 2 anyways as soon as possible wont hurt either if I can afford it with grants, scholarships and loans. 

Some research experience with Artificial Neural Networks, just a tad.

A lot of project experience relevant to Data Science, although for my statement of purpose I only listed one.

Extra Curricular Activities: Very limited in high school due to me working 5 times a week after school, in college I also have limited extra curricular activities as well. However I doubt this is a major thing for graduate programs.

I lived overseas in 2 countries for 3 years during my preteens and speak 3 languages

As a short summary;

* F/22 
* Had a job waitressing, got promoted to manager, got along well with boss &amp; co workers 
* Was good at the job and actively complimented by people higher up, really helped build up self esteem and confidence as well as social interactions 
* Got a job in a professional field through an internship programme as a first step towards getting a career 
* after I got through the initial anxiety of being in a new environment, eventually build up skills and worked my ass off to get noticed, eventually felt well liked and appreciated by team fell like i fit in well came out of my shell and felt comfortable and confident around others 
* A lot of team members left, new people joined and a new manager was introduced 
* manager was a good friend of mine at the time, all of a sudden started treating me like a stranger and speaking down to me referring to me as ""kid"" and just refused to treat me as an equal even in our personal time even though we talked all the time previously (keep in mind i had all the respect for them getting new responsibilities and did not try to take advantage of us being friends previously and spoke to them very politely just like any manager within work) 
* new people joined the team who were more experienced and a lot of my responsibilities were given to them, leaving me with no or very little work
* over time made me feel useless and a bit worthless, reduced all of my opportunities for progression 
* left out of many meetings further made me feel isolated, confidence was dropping now so I was finding it hard to make up the time with anybody else as I was getting nervous and anxious talking to people 
* add another couple of months, at that point my anxiety transferred into personal life, find it hard to talk to people and socialise and constantly criticise myself in my head during a conversations with others for not being funny or engaging enough
* Came back into my demons, fell back into depression started self harming for the first time again since my teens 

Trying to pull myself back together now, with hopefully a new job in the horizon but still confidence levels and self esteem are extremely low. As someone who was previously chatty and enjoyed being social to not be able to do that again because i literally feel as if my speech was taken away from me I can't really get a break even by going out or to bars or clubs. When talking to people the only thing I can think about is how much they are better than me in every way and how much of a piece of shit I am in the comparison. Mental health is very poor and really scared of the new job in case I fuck up or won't fit in.

Thanks for the insightful comments on my last post.  I have a few more questions, but here is a little more information about me.  I’m entering the University of Minnesota next year as a freshman.   I currently attend U of MN as a PSEO student, and I am currently a high school senior of course.  I will have taken Calc I and Calc 2, Chem 1 and Chem 2, and Physics 1 by the end of this school year.  I will be taking Physics 2 this summer.  When I enter as a freshman next year, I will be considered a sophomore, as I will be taking all sophomore-level courses, along with a seminar and perhaps another course.  I will be graduating in three years, if all goes well, with a BME degree (still deciding).  Here are my questions:

1) If I get a BME degree in three years, and want to do computer science for my masters, will it be possible?  How many computer science courses would I have to take during undergrad to make that happen?

2) Likewise, if I wanted to do my masters in EE or ME, would that be possible?

3) I’ve heard of 1-year masters in BME programs in some universities.  Are these good programs?  What are some pros and cons?

4) You’ve probably figured out from my last post, but I am kind of using BME as a fallback if Medical School doesn’t work out.  I plan to volunteer weekly at a hospital throughout college on the weekend, and perhaps get an internship for the summer of 2020.  I am not sure about shadowing experiences, and have yet to find out more about it.  What other experiences are good for a resume for BME?  What experiences do companies look for?

Thanks again for your time and help.  I really appreciate it!"

I'm in my late twenties, but I haven't graduated college yet.  I definitely won't be able to get a degree in any business field.  Do you think that getting an online certificate in financial management will be good enough to get into the financial analysis field? I'll definitely look for internships after getting the certificate and before looking for full time jobs.

Also, can anybody tell me what a typical week is like for financial analysts?  I know that they typically report to controllers, CFOs, or presidents or VPs of finance.  I know that being able to create financial models and use Microsoft Excel is very important.  How much time do you think the average financial analyst spends interacting with others versus doing solitary tasks?  Are teamwork and communication skills important?

What is the career path for a financial analyst?  From what I've read, after about five years of experience, a lot of them try to get promoted to CFO, vice president of finance, etc.  I think I'd rather stay at entry level or mid level roles though.

Lastly, I know that the field is predominantly male.  Have any of you female financial analysts ever faced harassment or discrimination?

One day I got a call, the user wanted to setup a new printer. We don’t setup printers though, we just configure the ports. So I was looking through the ticket and we had mostly everything we needed except the MAC Address. So I got a call from her:

Tech Support (TS): Hi, it seems their is some confusion we don’t set up printer we configure them with the network so all you have to do is plug it in

User: But I already submitted a ticket, I don’t understand 

TS: I know, It can be confusing. Here let’s go to the website where you can submit it yourself 

(15 minutes later)

User: I can’t find it

TS: That’s okay. I just wanted to show it to you because you might need it for the future. How about I submit it.

User: Okay

TS: So were going to need some basic info: Serial Number, Asset Tag, MAC Address, etc...

User: (Gives out info except MAC Address)

TS: Umm, we still need the MAC Address

User: I can’t find it

TS: It should be a series of numbers and letters on the back of the printer

User: Oh but the printer is so heavy 

(Back and fourth of this for 5 mins)

TS: Okay, we’ll I’m going to escalate this to Tier 2, to assist you 

(We have no Tier 2, I just hand the phone over to another tech)

Tier 2: Hi ma’am, so it seems we’re at an impasse here. We’re going to need the MAC Address located on the back of the box to proceed 

User: But it’s so heavy, can you send someone out

Tier 2: Let me check with one of our interns to see if they have any availability 

(Puts user on hold)

Tier 2: Hey intern, are you available to pick up a box? I’m going to say you’re not because this is just ridiculous 

Intern: Oh is this user? She calls up for the most ridiculous stuff. I swear she doesn’t know IT!

Tier 2: Yeah I hear you, I think I know what’s going on

(Gets back on the phone)

Tier 2: Yeah...It looks like our Intern isn’t free right now. But quick question. Is it a brown box that the printer is in?

User: Yeah, it’s just so heavy. Can you send someone out.

Tier 2: So you’re going to need to open that brown box and when you do you’ll see the printer box. The MAC Address is on the back of the box

User: But its so heavy...

Tier 2: Yeah...Unfortunately that’s just not something we do [pauses] but you know what you could call facilities 

User: Thanks [Hangs up]

A week later I see facilities stop by our office to pick up a computer for user that we told her we couldn’t support. She wanted Windows on an iMac...

TLDR: User wanted us to setup printer, we only configure them with the network. So we asked her for the Printer Info but she couldn’t give us the MAC Address because she didn’t take it out of the shipping box."

I have a weird problem with my microphone: 

The microphone records quiter when the sound is louder. So for example when I listen to music with my headset, people on skype/discord/ts cannot understand me at all because I sound a lot quiter. Another example, when I'm in an online game and a fight breaks out, i cannot communicate with my team due to my mic.  

What I think it is: There is a setting that causes this effect and I'm too stupid to find it.

If this is not the case: It is not a problem with the hardware, because it doesn't matter which headset I use. It's also not a problem with the 3.5 port, because it's the same problem with the laptop intern microphon.

What solves this problem for me is when I reinstall the audio driver, but after a few hours or days my problem comes back... 

I have this problem for months now and it starts to drive me crazy, because normally I can help myself with a quick google search or via trying different settings, but I cannot fix this :(

What Do I Need To Learn?,chirvinator,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ah2j91/where_to_begin_my_journey_in_it_what_do_i_need_to/,"I am an 18 year old who has always been interested in computers, and would consider myself fairly tech savvy in general. Though I am unsure what I want to do as a profession, IT has always been fairly interesting topic to me (the whole field--however, I am more interested in the cyber security aspect). About 6 months ago I applied for a paid high school internship with Tyson, in their cyber security department, and not long after, was accepted for the position. I have about 6 months remaining and have so far enjoyed myself, however my time is primarily spent doing menial tasks, and unfortunately, I can't exactly say that I've learned or accomplished anything other than padding my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to my question. Being that I have not actually learned a ton of useful knowledge from this position, I would like to soon start self-teaching various topics, whether that be through research, Udemy courses etc. I have researched these types of topics to a degree in the past, however my primary issue lies in the fact that I'm really not sure where to start. I know from my internship that many companies are beginning to rely on cloud services like Azure and AWS, so learning and getting certified in more specialized systems such as these could be quite helpful, however I lack much fundamental knowledge required to work in IT such as networking etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, I'm not quite sure what career, or IT pathway I want to invest myself in, and would therefore like to start with more general and necessary knowledge for a career in IT. I do enjoy the Cyber Security aspect of this field, but there is just so much to learn in IT, and so many options that it can become incredibly overwhelming. So, long story short, where would you suggest I begin? What are pathways/fields that have become more relevant in recent years (more job opportunities)? "

They expect me to be able to look at a problem and immediately have some idea of how to solve it, which I typically don't. I'm a CS junior looking for an internship, but that will never happen if I can't pass an assessment.

I know how to program, given enough time and space. I'm fully confident that if I have time to research and design a solution, I can solve almost any problem they could throw at me. However, on the assessment I just failed, I only had 30 minutes to solve what I saw as a complicated problem. The first test (which is probable one of the hardest) gave me 20 minutes to solve seven complicated problems.

Every project I've done in school has given me at least one week to complete it, so I'm used to being able to spend a lot of time thinking about it and doing a little at a time, but these tests expect me to do all that simultaneously.

So does anyone have any tips?"

The work is unpaid now but if I pass the one month internship period I will get hired full time (with good pay) and will be able to get a Visa. Social anxiety has made me doubt I'll get the job. If I don't get it, I'll be in extreme financial difficulty and will likely end up homeless.**

I have terrible social anxiety, like most people in this sub. I graduated from college last year in the US and recently was offered an internship role with a small company/startup for a position that's basically a tech consultant. The internship period is unpaid but if they're satisfied with my technical and social skills, then I'll be offered a full time job that pays well.

This is the end of the second week of a five week period as an intern. A couple times a week I have to give a mock presentation to my boss who plays the role of the client. So far it's been a disaster. My voice shakes, my hands shake, and I can barely speak coherently because I'm so nervous (I'm from an English speaking country so it's not like I have to deal with a language barrier). One time my boss literally put his hands over his face as I was done presenting and said something like 'I barely understood anything you said. Speak more clearly next time'. I know I still have three weeks left but I just feel like there's no way I can drastically improve socially (i.e when giving presentation).

What's making me even more nervous is the situation I'll be in if I don't get the job. My apartment lease ends at the end of February and at that point I'll literally have no money unless I get a job. My student visa also expires at the end of the year. I haven't talked to my parents in years and since I have no friends in the US, I'll have no place to go at the end of February. I could conceivably ask a friend from back home to let me stay with them but they are also struggling financially after just graduating from college. I don't even know if any of them would be able to pay the $1k plane ticket for me to fly back home and stay with them.

I've thought about looking for another job right now but I feel like that's pretty much giving up. I already told my friends at home that I was hired and it would be so embarrassing to tell them I didn't get the job (tbh they'd probably also know it's because of my social skills because I told them about the position).

The way I see it, there are 3 possible scenarios:

1. Get this job and be able to get a Visa and pay rent
2. Assume I don't get this job and look for a retail type of job while I'm interning that at least allows me to pay rent from March onward. I'm not sure if I have the time since I work M-F 9-5 and I'd have to be hired almost immediately. Also I'd have to look for another job during my time in retail that can give me a work Visa since it expires at the end of the year 
3. End up homeless at the end of February and just try to find freelance programming work until I get back on my feet

I'd pretty much feel like a failure unless I get the job which seems increasingly unlikely.

ah6z4a,28,2019-01-17,Interview Advice!,IntriguedObserver,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ah6z4a/interview_advice/,"Hey guys! Long time lurker here, but recently finally made my Reddit account so thought I’d post to give back to the community that helped me get through the college process myself! I’ve seen lots of posts recently about interview tips and emails to interviewers, so thought I’d give some advice from my experience!

Not that it should justify any of the advice I’m giving, but I’ve been in 17 college application interviews, and 20+ other interviews for jobs and internships and such. I’m currently a student at a T10 school.

Interviews (in addition to essays and recs) are a chance for the school to get to know you outside of numbers and scores. Use this opportunity to show off the side of yourself that isn’t about grades or SAT/ACT scores. Sure, colleges care about academics but they also want students that will fit in when they come to campus, and will contribute to both the academic and social milieu.

**Clothing**

If you’re interviewing at their professional office, or the university’s club (Like Harvard/Yale/Princeton Club of NYC, etc.), then business casual is a good way to go, perhaps even a notch up. For guys, button down shirt, nice pants, and non-sneaker shoes are classic combo if you have them. With the weather in mind, I normally put a collared shirt on under a sweater or cardigan, matched with some slacks and dress shoes. For girls, my sister has been wearing a skirt/slacks with a nice top, and flats.

If it’s just at a coffee shop or library, you can be more casual. Nothing trashy, just wear something clean and shows you put at least some effort into being prepared! Don’t worry about clothing too much, it only goes so far

**Common Questions**

Here are some common questions you can expect from the interviewer. Not that everyone will ask these, or that these will even be asked, but in my experience, these are the ones that have come up the most

* Tell me about yourself (This one tends to be how they start off)
* Why [University]?
* Outside of school what do you do?
* What’s your favorite class? Why?
* What do you want to study at [University]?
* What are you most excited for at [University]?
* What's something you wanted to say on the application that you didn't have a chance to?
* Why are you going to college at all?
* What current affair/cause most interests you?
* Talk about a time you've failed, and how you've grown from it
* What's one of your biggest successes?
* How did you decide what colleges you're applying to?

At the end, they will give you an opportunity to ask them questions. Take this time to get to know them, and the school better! You should have 2-3 questions prepared to show you are engaged.

**Finding your Interviewer**

Make sure you’re on time for your interview, a minute or two early doesn’t hurt. You’re looking for them, they’re looking for you. If you’re in a public place, scan the room for someone looking for someone else. If it’s a coffee shop or similar venue, they'll be at a table that will be for just 2 (maybe 4 at most, but don't look to a large table or a one person one), and the other seat will be empty.

These are more possibilities than certainties, but they'll probably have some form of laptop or notebook/pen, will look at least like they've graduated (although there are young looking adults!), and won't have a lot of food (unless you guys have made arrangements for that beforehand).

If you still can't find them after a few minutes of walking and looking around, you can either hang around by the entrance, or grab a table for two. Call them 5-10 minutes after the scheduled meeting time, or email if you don't have their number. If they can't find you, they'll be looking to reach out as well so make sure to check your phone. It’s probably a good idea to get their number beforehand just in case

**Follow up Email**

Now that you’ve killed the email, you should follow up with the interviewer at some point. Why? It’s polite! Shows that you put some effort in, and they’ll definitely appreciate it. While there’s no universal format, I generally have used this template:

[Name of interviewer]

It was a pleasure to meet you today, and thank you for taking time to speak with me. I loved hearing about your experiences at and insights into [University] and hope that one day, I can have similarly fond memories of my college experience. [Mention story they told] After our talk, I now feel more strongly about my decision and reasons for applying to [University]

Thank you again!

Best,
[Name]

Above all, just be confident! This won’t make or break your application. Don’t sweat it, and good luck to all!"

19M, I’m a sophomore at a big university with around 50,000 undergrads so there’s a ton of people. I’m a computer engineering major which I think I enjoy but am slowly coming to doubt as classes grow more difficult. I have an internship lined up for the summer which I think will help me decide if I really want to commit to this for my career, but I’m already beginning to have doubts. 

Secondly, I don’t really have many friends. I have a really close small friend group here at school and a few from high school that I still talk to regularly that go to college elsewhere. But I don’t really have a group. A couple of my close friends have rushed fraternities which I really don’t have any interest in doing. I put myself out there at the beginning of my freshman year and tried to join a few social organizations but there’s so many god damn people at my school that it’s so competitive to get into things because orgs only take so many people. I feel like I’m missing out on a ton of the college experience because I haven’t been able to make it into any organizations and meet people that way. My dorm freshman year was not very social, and now I live off campus with my close friends. I’m just not sure what to do from a social standpoint I want to get involved and meet more people but every time I’ve tried I’ve failed to get accepted into organizations that have caught my interest. 

I haven’t been in a relationship since junior year of high school, and have started to feel some pressure from my parents in that department. And maybe that’s where this is all stemming from I don’t know. I want to get out there and meet somebody but I feel like I have no outlet to do so. I know I’ve had a bit of oneitis for a while for a close friend from high school but that never worked out. 

I don’t think I’m depressed, I enjoy the time I spend with the friends I have, I exercise regularly, play intramurals, have a fairly healthy lifestyle besides smoking weed here and there with friends. Don’t really enjoy alcohol that much. Just sometimes when I’m laying in bed at night thinking I wish things have gone differently up to this point in my college career and I belonged to something. 

Sorry if this is very ramble-y I’m just throwing everything out there. Main thing is I want to get involved and meet more people but I’m not sure where to start as I fear going out for an organization and putting all my effort in it just to probably get cut. Anything would be appreciated

Also thank you to this subreddit.,Seankala,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ah7vwr/feeling_lost_and_miserable_after_half_a_year_but/,"Hello all. This post isn't exactly a post asking for advice, but more of just me wanting to share a bit of my story in hopes that anybody out there who is going through similar conditions and finds it helpful, and to just share a bit of my story. This subreddit has also been super helpful for me in many ways, so much thanks and appreciation to everybody out there contributing in different ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year summer, right before the fall semester started, I made a sudden decision that I wanted to go to graduate school and pursue a master's degree. Computer science was the program that I would aim for, and my background is a double major degree in international studies and computer science, in case anyone's curious.

I hadn't thought of doing higher education after my bachelor's degree. I had quite a few friends who wanted to go to graduate school ever since they were freshmen. They were always so stressed and busy making sure they aced their exams and got high GPAs, maintaining good relationships with professors, getting undergraduate research experience, you name it. I remember pompously scoffing at my friend once. ""Just relax life will figure out a way somehow. I'm just gonna make sure I pass this course haha."" ""Haha"" indeed.

My GPA was never top-notch, but after I started studying computer science it really went down a bit due to my lack of background knowledge and decision to just ""jump into it."" Again in case anyone's curious, it used to be a 3.4/4.0 but upon graduation it's a 3.2/4.0.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have always been supportive of whatever I do. However, being PhD holders themselves and teaching at university, I always knew that they wanted me to go for academia or at least to graduate school. But, they never pressured me into it, and wanted me to do what I felt was best. I'm still grateful for having such supportive parents to this day. Plus, they also know that going to graduate school without having a purpose and just for the sake of going is pretty much a waste of time and money. That being said, when I told them that I wanted to go to graduate school they were quite happy. I was also happy because it felt like I had made a decision about my life (I'm sure this sentence could be worded better, but please bear with me).

But after a couple of months, panic and reality started to kick me in the ribs. ""Why hadn't I studied harder,"" ""Why hadn't I done any research internships,"" etc. The only thing I have worth mentioning is that I worked as an advisor at a cryptocurrency/blockchain startup. It's another invaluable experience I had, but it wasn't exactly a paper published through IEEE or having actual research experience. One of the friends who I mentioned earlier actually introduced this subreddit to me. I've made a few posts on this subreddit and the feedback from the community has always been great.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it would be needless to say that letting panic and anxiety get the better of me wouldn't help with anything. There's nothing I can do about my GPA, so I decided to focus on whatever I could. I took the GRE and got a decent score (163V/169Q/5.5AW), I made sure that I got A's in the last two computer science courses that I took (machine learning and probability theory), and I also am trying to work on some projects that I've always been interested in.

My machine learning professor was so impressed with the answers I wrote for the final exam that he actually asked me if I was interested in doing a lab internship. Of course, I said yes. However, he later retracted the offer when he realized I wasn't as proficient with the Python programming language nor with the machine learning libraries as he hoped I'd be, or that I haven't actually worked on any real-life machine learning projects before. I told him that those are small technicalities that can be picked up, and that my motivation to do great things is what I believe would help him and the lab out greatly. I also wanted to tell him that the whole purpose of an internship is to learn, but I held that last part back due to high possibility that it would come off as arrogant. Regardless, he never got back to me.

Despite these efforts, there have been periods where the anxiety and feeling of inadequacy get the better of me. My GRE scores are good, but even I know that a good GRE score wouldn't be able to offset a low GPA. I've emailed numerous professors and labs asking if they were looking for any lab interns, many of them at schools different from mine. Almost none of them got back to me. The few that did get back to me told me they were looking for interns but that they didn't want me. It was sad. Knowing that if I had been in their shoes I would have done the same thing made the feeling worse.

It's really been an emotional roller coaster for the past few months for me, but towards the end of the year it seemed that the roller coaster was flattening towards the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

This year, things are looking a bit better. I feel much calmer and more in control of my life. Reading posts on this subreddit about people getting accepted into schools is actually a really blissful experience even from the reader's perspective, and congratulations to you all. I've also come to terms with reality. I don't have to get into a ""dream school."" If I really want to conduct research, then I should be happy in that of itself. My dad would always tell me that there is no such thing as a ""safety school."" ""Graduate programs aren't like undergraduate programs. The name of the school will matter much less compared to what you're actually doing or want to do. You should be happy with applying to all the programs you apply to.""

One of my friends that I met through the cryptocurrency startup offered me a job at a cybersecurity startup he's working at. I've always wanted to work there and thought it would be a great opportunity, since I'm not only interested in cybersecurity but was thinking of applying to graduate school this year anyway which would mean even if I leave the country (I'm in South Korea) I'd still have some time. And who knows, maybe I'll want to postpone graduate school for a bit or realize that I don't want to go at all? It seemed like a win-win situation for me. Applications can wait, but opportunities can't.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly speaking, I don't know what the point of this post is. I guess I just wanted to share what I've been feeling and going through for the past few months. I know there are people who have it worse, and also people who have it better. Regardless of the circumstances I guess that life isn't always too bad. Good luck to you all!"

Becoming an officer is definitely something I have given some thought to and I certainly would not mind it, especially since my father was in the Navy for 20+ years himself so I do feel some familiarity with the people from that ""world"".

However, my ""concerns"" are if I were to actually pursue this path, would I actually be able to do any related engineering work at all. 

My question to any US military officers who have earned engineering degrees is were you actually able make use of what you've learned from your engineering curriculum/program in your career as an officer and regardless of whether or not you do, do you regret commissioning as an officer, or do you wish you stayed in the civilian sector and actually work as an engineer?

Additionally, what branch(es) do you recommend I give a look? My supervisors recommended that I give the Air Force and the Navy a look given my STEM degrees.

ahctk9,3,2019-01-18,Should I mention it to my boss?,rickjoebobdonalddave,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/ahctk9/should_i_mention_it_to_my_boss/,"ETA:

Just for an update: 

I'M SUPER T.O.'d!
So, first I did talk with my boss and  he was really great about it said he's behind me 100% in my educational and career goals. 

What I'm pissed about is that I CAN'T EVEN APPLY FOR THE POSITION because (and I didn't know this) the boss before my current boss extended our contract to December instead of leaving it open ended.If I do apply, they just forward my resume to our agency rep and she, I dunno, makes a mark saying I tried to leave and throws it away?  So I have to be in that position until at least October (12 months) before I can even submit an application for another position within the temp agency UNLESS they don't need us anymore and release the contract I didn't even know we had. What pisses me off is I never even had a chance at getting the job - I'm a realist and often a pessimist BUT this also means that I can't even get an interview and with that, the experience and takeaway from said interview. So not only am I denied at chance at the EXACT job I want to do, but I'm also denied any sort of learning experience in interviewing for the position. Despite what many people (including my own husband and brother) think, being a woman in IT in my particular area (obvs probably not such a problem in larger cities) is harder than it seems. Out of 75 IT department employees at HQ where I work there are 8 women, 2 are low level managers. It depressing and I feel like I'm never going to get anywhere. It's not going to stop me, of course, but I did some wallowing, had a self pity party, and now I'm angry enough to be more bullheaded than usual. 


I'm currently in a BS program for ""Technical Project Management with a specialty in Information Security"". I've still got about 8 classes left and my internship. So I'm not done, but close. Due to other circumstances, I had to find a full time job. I landed in a part customer service, part technical role at a large, international corporation with their headquarters in town. I've been there 4 months. 

Important facts: I was originally hired by Boss A for 3 months to assist in an audit that happens every 6 months. 4 weeks after I started, Boss A left for another position (he accepted positoin 6 months prior, but they couldn't find a replacement for him). Boss B starts and comes from a completely different department and is still learning how to do stuff, but he's really great. The way they have the ""teams"" separated is sort of strange to me, but technically there are 4 members of my immediate team and 8 on the general team. I do a lot of things that no no else does, but it doesn't require any special training - a lot of Excel and problem solving. I really actually love my job.

BUT my cousin sent me a job listing through my temp company for the company I work at looking for someone for their I/S department with project management skills (main point was to run risk tests and collaborate with with projects to do risk assessments). They are even accepting applications for those still currently in a program. certifications are preferred, but not necessary.

I want to apply for it because these opportunities don't come around often in this area and I'd be a fool not to. My boss is pretty cool and while I don't know exactly who would be in charge of hiring, he probably sits across the open seating plan room from my boss (I sit in a different building - that's a different story). We're a great team, we all get a long really well. I wouldn't be considering this if I thought it would 100% backfire on me.

THE QUESTION: Is is a good idea or even appropriate to approach my boss with my intent to apply for this opportunity? 

Pros: I absolutely think he would support me and possibly even put in a good word. At the least I'd be giving him a heads up in case I do get an interview and they ask him about me.

Cons: He thinks I'm looking to leave and phases me out of the team and my job. 

I really don't want to shoot myself in the foot here, but I'll regret not at least applying for this job. HELP

ETA: I don't know if it makes a difference, though I feel like it does - I'm a 33(f). There would be a slight pay increase in this new position. "

During college, my friends knew me to slack in class and not worry about grades. As long as I was on track for a C or higher, then I didn't seen any reason to worry. My motto had been ""Cs get degrees, am I right?"" and I usually got an eyeroll as a response. I enjoyed college, I had enough down time and would make sure to take time to let loose and party every now and then. Constantly worrying about grades made no sense to me. Finals week was another story, but stressing an entire semester seemed too exhausting. 

I'm entering a fairly niche field (zookeeping) so I knew I could get by with some Cs as long as I compensated with other skills. I think that's where the idea of ""Cs get degrees"" falls flat. Some students don't realize that if they aren't putting as much effort into their studies, then it needs to go into something else. 

I took my ""poor"" grades because I spent time developing myself as a professional and making connections. By December, I had three internships under my belt, an officer role in a club, and eight certifications related to my field completed. I focused on my work ethic instead of my grades, and it paid off for my field. 

I hate school. I cannot sit still listening to someone talk to me, I learn much better through experience. Here are my thoughts I have for students:

- How do you learn?

If you do well in a classroom setting and are good at studying, then having a strong GPA is great for you. You'll have a lot of opportunities getting scholarships or on the Dean's List. Most internships know students don't have much experience so they will look into your course work initially. If you're like me, still get passing grades but look into developing other skills in the mean time. Make yourself well rounded and that'll get you far when applying to internships as well. 

- What type of career are you pursuing?

If you want to go to grad school or stay in academia, then keep your GPA high. Those programs are looking at your grades and they need to be high. If you know your GPA isn't the main thing professionals in your field are looking at, then focus on something else. Get involved in clubs and developing skills. A high GPA will be a nice touch, but a strong skillset will carry you further. If you're not sure what you want to do with your future, now's the time to figure it out. Go to your career office and talk to one of the advisors, find out what would be a good fit for you and move on from there. 

- Be well rounded. Get your priorities straight. 

My overall GPA was a 3.1 and my major GPA was a 2.9, it's fine. I had mainly Bs with a few As and Cs throughout the semesters. In the classes I really cared about (Coral Reef Ecology and Animal Behavior are some examples) I made sure to get good grades and build relationships with the professors as we shared similar interests and they could offer career advice. Both have written me letters of recommendation, and I volunteered in one of their labs and have been SCUBA diving with the other professor. When I took Physics, my goal was to pass and I spent my energy on developing a SCUBA program for the club I'm in. I found more value in the club then establishing a relationship with my Physics professor and it paid off for me. Each semester is different, some semesters are going to be completely focused on grades because the courses are interesting to you or they're difficult to pass. While others you'll have time for yourself whether it be joining a club, getting a job or internship, or focusing on relationships whether they're professional or friendships. Gauge each semester accordingly and shift your energy to make yourself the best you can be  

GPA is important, but college has so many things to offer that you shouldn't get blinded by grades. I wouldn't have my job today if I didn't put so much energy into my professional network. Each major and career field is different, don't get pressured by your peers to act a certain way, do what's best for you and your future. 

Good luck everyone!

TL;DR: If you are fine with getting Cs, then use that extra time and energy towards something useful. Cs will get you that piece of paper, but you need something a little extra to get the job. 

Edit: words and added TL;DR"
ahfgab,1,2019-01-18,"Fresh out of a coding boot-camp, what's next?",WellDamn7,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ahfgab/fresh_out_of_a_coding_bootcamp_whats_next/,"I just finished a 12 week coding boot-camp focusing on C#, JavaScript, and [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET). I have a final project but I don't think it is good enough to present yet.  What are the next steps I should be taking? Should I be contacting businesses asking what they are looking for? Should I be looking for internships? Should I just continue to work on projects in my spare time to build my portfolio? I know a lot of companies are starting to move toward the ability to code rather than the typical Bachelor's degree when looking for new employees, but many of them are looking for experience as well. I'm 19 which makes it hard to put a lot of experience on my resume. I need to get a job soon, but am not sure what to do. Thoughts?"

ahgl4c,2,2019-01-18,[24M] France -&gt; US,InevitableCupcake9,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/ahgl4c/24m_france_us/,"I live in France since I was born there and I really want to experience traveling once again.

I finished my master degree in computer science in France and it's probably not relevant at all in the US. I got 1.5 years of experience as a web developer: 1 year as an intern (fullstack) and 0.5 years as a job (frontend).

I got a few options at the moment and want to know which is my best bet :

- Do an MS in Boston University within 1 year (thanks to the partnership that my university have with BU) I'm not really sure it's worth to pay 40 000$ and lost 1 year of work experience and money as well. I never did a US university and was wondering what is like and if it's worth it (not only courses but university life as well), I could make friends there and networking as well and also have time to prepare for top companies in the US.

- Apply to companies in the US who can sponsorship, there's not a lot and I only got one answer from a startup in SF but I'm not sure I really want to go there because I didn't really like the place that much from when I was there traveling.

- Do a France -&gt; US transfer to my current company after staying for 2 years, they got the place I want to visit/stay (LA) but I don't know if I can wait that long honestly.

I was wondering how hard is it to find a job in a particular city (LA in my case) if I got a job somewhere else in the US first ?

Thanks !"
ahh71e,2,2019-01-18,How to write a self evaluation as an underachiever?,helppleasethissucks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahh71e/how_to_write_a_self_evaluation_as_an_underachiever/,"I’m a chronic underachiever in my first software engineering position out of college (less than a year) in a maintenance position. I can hardly handle the on call tasks, and I frequently am given then subsequently removed from projects for the higher achievers on the team to complete them, so I don’t have a track record of accomplishing long term projects or goals. Reviews are coming up, and I have no idea what to say that won’t tank my career further. I know that across the board everything needs to improve to a large degree, and stating that will only be a detriment, but not stating it will put my and my boss’s reviews at odds with each other. 

As context, I don’t have a software degree (gen studies with a lot of cs coursework) but I do have internships in development under my belt, so I was put on the maintenance team, which does little coding unless it’s a longer term project (can’t make core code changes). The team has high turnover (100% in a year). 

This may be the wrong place to post this, but it’s somewhere to start asking at least. "
ahhpea,15,2019-01-18,Need a second language. Python or Java?,meatdrawer25,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/ahhpea/need_a_second_language_python_or_java/,"I'm a computer science student. I'm looking to pick up a second language. I've learned C++/C at school, and I'm fairly well versed in it (for a student). C/C++ are pretty low level languages so anything I would need to write that has performance/memory concerns I'd manage. 

Python is not only really easy to use, its also flexible and a scripting language. It seems like a win win. However, I feel like everywhere I look people want Java. Every internship I've applied for has wanted Java. I've Java is a dying language, and the demand for python is on the rise, but I almost feel obligated to learn it."
ahi5hq,1,2019-01-18,Senior math major looking for suggestions to get hired ASAP,N0m0red,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahi5hq/senior_math_major_looking_for_suggestions_to_get/,"My goal is to be employed as a software engineer, I graduate this May as a math major. I plan on attending a programming bootcamp as soon as my semester is over, then finish late august/early September. Then apply and hopefully be employed by 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently: Finished intro to Ruby by App academy, will look into their programming challenge soon. This semester I'll be taking another C++ class (2nd course) which focuses on pointers, sequences, recursion, references, functions, classes, inheritance, constructors, trees, maps, algorithms, parallel programming. Is this a data structures course? It's labelled as ""Programming II"" essentially.

I've taken 1 semester courses in Java and Matlab but haven't practiced since, risk management internship this past summer, 3.1 GPA, Math major, east coast.

&amp;#x200B;

What I plan to finish: Hack Reactor/Full Stack/App Academy/ Flat Iron free prep material and programming challenges

&amp;#x200B;

With any free time I can find what else should I learn/do? I read stories of bootcamp grads not being good programmers, so how can I be one of the good ones? I am currently on winter break from college so I have a lot of time on my hands. "

ahirg0,0,2019-01-18,"Student wanting to get PR in Aus, need advice on what is my best option?",Chaavy,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/ahirg0/student_wanting_to_get_pr_in_aus_need_advice_on/,"Right, Ill say sorry in advance as it may be a bit long but its only because I’m laying my points out. My goal is to finish my bachelors degree and get PR as fast as possible without wasting too many years.

My situation is that I currently have 2 offers where one is from Flinders and another is from UoW(University of Wollongong). I am currently turning 22 this month and will be studying computer science for 2 years as I’m transferring from a university in Hong Kong. Which is starting this Feb, I have only a few days to make my decision and am in dire need of help. Im extremely sorry if this ends up being long as I did promise I would try to keep it short.

I was wondering what would be the best approach if I wanted to gain PR?

As of currently, I was thinking that my best way to get PR would be through the 189 skill test. As of currently, I will these points

18-24 years old = 25 points 

English language = 20 ( I am in the proficient section but am confident I should be able to get 79 through PTE) Australian education qualification = 5

Professional year = 5 ( will do professional year if needed)

1 year work experience in Aus through graduate visa = 5 ( I plan to hopefully work a year there and gain the experience )

Bachelors degree qualification = 15

Wollongong route total points = 70 ( if I complete professional year or get 1 year experience I will be 25/26 years old so 75 and if I am able to get state nomination ill be at 80 though I think thats being too optimistic?) would this be sufficient down the line in about 3 years? Im skeptical as seeing all the competition Im worried it wont be enough.

Flinders route: 80 points due to low population area. ( 85 if Im able to get state nomination which I think will be easier in Adelaide than Wollongong? I think)

So that is my game plan above, which route would you suggest taking? I want to go to UoW as it is a better university in terms of ranking which will help if I decide to return to HK but I do want to prioritise PR as well so I can get both my degree and PR status. Which would you suggest I do and which route would give me the best chances?

I have spoke to some migration agent but my contact has been limited due to them only willing to look at my case after I pay the fees which I cannot financially afford at the moment. What I did gain from speaking to 1 was I shouldn’t change my path of going to UoW and try seeing if there are other ways. He as even if I go to Flinders due to the policy changing annually it still may not be a guarantee that I will get PR through going to Flinders and all. What would you suggest I do?

Lastly, I just wanted to clear some doubts.

1. Am I able to gain the 1 year experience while studying? Or is it only able after I have completed my studies?
2. Does part time work count as experience? For example on the medium and long term list there is Web developer if I were to do part time web developer jobs while I do my professional year would it count towards it?
3. Am I able to apply for the 189 visa if my job isn’t listed on the medium and long term list?
4. Will I have to declare my job? Like for example, if they require web developer does that mean while applying I can apply as a Web developer on the 189 visa, as long as I have 1 year worth of web developer experience? Or how does it work, as In IT a lot the programming skills are interchangeable so experience in lets say network security can also help in web developer roles so how do they actually check these roles? Would it mean that my best way would be to check the roles in need when graduating and then apply for these roles and gain 1 year experience in them for the best chance in PR status?
5. How does the 190 visa work? Is it that, if your job roll is in the short term skill shortage you may apply and may get state nominated and then get PR? If I get this would I believe I have to stay in australia in the state nominated area for 2 years, so during that 2 years am I able to leave the country for a short period of time like 1-2 months etc? Also what are the chances slim according to you if I were to try for state nomination in Wollongong or would it be better to do it in adelaide? Lastly, is it possible to lets say graduate from UoW but move to a state where its easier to get state nomination and apply from there? Like move to Adelaide for example after graduating and then applying from there to increase my chances on 190 visa.
6. Is it worth it to go to Flinders just for the 5 points? Does going to increase my chances substantially due to the points from region and maybe higher chances in state nomination?
7. Lets say I have enough points for the cutoff that year after graduating, will I be able to apply for the 189 visa without any experience? Or is experience required?
8. If Im put in a scenario where I had to choose between getting a year experience first or doing professional year which one should I do first? As from my research, professional year is basically like going to school with classes for 7 months and 3 months internship, I wont be able to get any experience beside the 3 months during internship as the agent said part time work wont count.
9. Are there any other routes I could take to get PR?
10. Any tips/advice or things you would like to warn me about?

Thank you very much in advance! I need to make my decision in a few days so I am in dire need of advice."
ahiu1e,1,2019-01-18,Did I ruin my life? How do you get over cyclical toxic regret?,foragingfemme,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ahiu1e/did_i_ruin_my_life_how_do_you_get_over_cyclical/,"Hi redditers. Need some help here and this is a long read so any advice is amazing. 

So I am 21, in the second semester of my senior year of college and always been a high achieving student. I worked my ass off and applied to 21 colleges (with fee waivers of course) to go somewhere with a full ride because I'm the third of four kids in a single parent household and I didn't want to cost my mom anything. It worked, I got into an amazing (but VERY tough) college and have been able to see myself through entirely on my own.

It has been a horrible fit for me though, and I have had problems there since day 1, and my anxiety and depression and issues on campus got so bad that I ended up taking my sophomore second semester off since I came in with credits. Its a super rich school and I always felt mad insecure and out of place since I don't come from that (which is lame). I worked during that time ""off"" however, about 50 hours a week and kind of slacked on actually treating my depression and anxiety (big mistake). The second half of my semester off was supposed to involve an internship in conservation in South America, and it ended up not turning out (as in I got stuck there, the guy overseeing the internship was actually a perve, and I ended up having to flee the country, got saved by the US embassy---basically a lifetime movie and a total trainwreck and not what I needed).

Right after I returned from my failed trip and before my junior year of college, still shell shocked and this time with a diagnosis of acute anxiety and PTSD, I went right away for an amazing internship in the Midwest. My boss loved me so much that he wanted me to come work for him and he would help me pay for school. The guy is amazing, I loved the project, and I really liked the work, and literally who gets an offer like that as a 19-year-old? I could have escaped my four year school right then and had the money thing paid for.

However, I was scared of owing someone my future and feeling stuck at that job. AND (and here's the big kicker) the boy I was with at the time really pressured me to stay at our four-year school (and im not blaming him, i let myself be influenced, thats on me). So i  turn my boss down, return to my orignal 4 year college,and go abroad (the boyfriend came with, against my wishes) and of course he cheats on me and dumps me before our senior year. That same weekend he dumped me, I actually got raped, and also had to appear in court agaisnt my dad who abused me growing up to support my mom, so basically im skipping over a ton of shit but it was a summer FROM HELL.  Since I also come from a background of abuse and trauma and the boyfriend I was with was the only guy I ever let myself get close to in all the ways, I really took the breakup a lot harder than I should.  Lost 15 lbs became a loweky alcoholic, basically real rough time. Anyway, to manage my misery, naturally, I decided to take 5 really hard classes, work 35 hours a week at a restaurant in the evening, and take on a research project with a professor I researched for all summer. Well, guess what happened? I crashed. I crashed badly. I went from a 3.7 GPA to failing literally everything. I was throwing up 3 times per day from he anxiety and misery, and had become pretty depenedednt on alcohol. I started believing about myself that I was the worlds hugest loser and that I shouldnt even be alive since all I do is screw up. Cut to sitting on top of a building, drinking and crying for four hours, and when I realized I couldnt do it, came down, booked myself a flight home with the last money in my account, and left campus with two weeks to go in the semester. And now here I am, as a 21 year old, living in my moms house, with 90% of a degree and 15k in debt. I am KICKING myself for litearlly every choice I have ever made. My mind is so loud that I cant think most days and all I can think of is what a loser i am. LIterally on paper Im not at all, but my belifs about myself are so harsh and negative that all I can do is want to melt into the floor, and all i can occupy my mind with is extreme regret for not making different choices. How do you come to terms with that?

I managed the sitaution somehwat in that I got in touch with my professors and got ""Incompletes""  on my grades, which means i didnt fail the last semester. They didnt want me to come back to campus however with grades that were incomplete, so I am enrolling at a university at home for my last few credits, and will be able to graduate on time if I can just. get. my shit. done. But guys what happened? I STOPPED. I quit being able to do ANYTHING. I couldnt write papers, I dont even know how I scraped thorugh that semester as long as I did. is that normal senior burnout? like its college, literally who doesnt want to die occasionally right? ANyway Im finsihing ""on time"" but all I have is huge regret for not taking that job as a sophmore and going and making myself miserable semester afeter semester at my orignal college becuase I felt like i had to ""stick out"" something I started, only to bail my senior year.

Anyway, while all my freinds are applying for jobs and partying our second-semester senior year, Im at home across the country, finally taking antidepressants and going to counseling and chipping away at my degree. I feel like i went from super ahead of the curve to super behind, becuase I made choices that were in the best interest of otheres rather than myself. The massive amounts of guilt I feel on the aily is insane. My sucicial thoughts come in waves, but I am determined to graduate in Spring , so Im mushing ahead and my school is so paranoid about their perfect gradaution rates that theyre paying for me to take my last class at home. However, all i can feel is that Im 21, super behind eveyrone, and totally fucked up my entire life. Im SO worried I burned the bridges with all my professors at my college since i took incomplete grades and ended up failing my research project. Im scared that all I do is fail and disappoint, so natually I keep fialing and disappointing. I take full responsibility for the choices I've made that have landed me here. But how do you come to terms with realizing youre your own worst enemy? and did I totally fuck up my life?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, this was an essay. everything looks very bleak right now and I feel old and like I fucked everything up. I'm just trying to be okay. Any help is appreciated in terms of managing self-responsibility vs guilt, and learning to end cyclical regret."
ahjbmm,3,2019-01-19,"I need to vent, someone please hear me out. I know I'm fucked up. Sorry, I need help. Please.",science_nurd,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ahjbmm/i_need_to_vent_someone_please_hear_me_out_i_know/,"I \[19M\] need to vent out some things because I have no one to do it with IRL. I have no friends irl for emotional support, and I can't discuss this (more like don't want to) with my parents for reasons I will state below.

Quick summary about myself: I'm 19 years old and am studying mechanical engineering with a focus on both artificial intelligence and aerospace engineering. I am currently in an internship with the Canadian National Research Council (C-NRC). For those living outside of Canada, it's the Canadian equivalent to the more well known American DARPA. I was born in India, moved to Canada for 5 years and got Canadian Citizenship, lived in the USA for 11 years, and came back to Canada for university (University of Waterloo).

&amp;#x200B;

A quick summary of my rant/vent: I have Aspergers, I feel alone, Imposter syndrome, mental health/trauma from my upbringing, and for whatever weird reason, females. I know, I'm a fucking disgusting grunt of a human being, but please bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

It's always been hard to make friends for me. Moving so many times (3 times between 0 and 7 years old) and my genetics has really fucked up my social skills. I know many people exist who move more times than that and have no problem making friends, and I envy them. My bullying and ostracization started in 3rd grade when I came to the U.S. During recess, I always found myself playing with the girls, and I got shit from guys and girls for that. But one day, a 4th-grade girl came up to me and started degrading me for being too feminine or some shit, I forgot. But that's not the important part. The important part is I shoved her away because I felt really uncomfortable and almost started to cry. I shoved her hard where her ""boobs"" would have been (I was 7 years old, I knew nothing about boobs and such). Needless to say, I got a week suspension for sexual harassment and bullying. From that day on, no one dared to even risk becoming my friend.

Slowly but surely, my socialization skills stagnated. I had no way to improve myself. No one in 3rd or 4th grade wanted anything to do with me. By the time I finished 5th grade and went to middle school, my socialization skills were on par with that of a 4th grader. Because of my immaturity, I effectively drove everyone away from me, further increasing my socialization stagnation. Eventually, by the time I was 18, I had the mental state of a 14-year-old at best, according to my therapist. Estimates are around 10-12 years old.

I don't understand wtf I did wrong. I did everything I could to get friends. It came to the point where I would pay people, do their homework for them, and do anything they said for me to be with them. But the sheer presence of me with anyone would apparently destroy their social reputation. I'm still looking to this day for what the fuck I did wrong. Even my parents were sick of my shit. Every time I would go to a potluck or something, I would always find a way to screw something up. It ranged from pouring glasses of water on people around me to me starting food fights. I didn't know any better because no one ever taught me. My parents just told me to stay at home whenever they went to a social gathering.

It came to the point where I went a whole year never talking to anyone outside of my teachers, parents, and MAYBE group members for school projects. I had never uttered a word for social purposes for years. 10th grade to 12th.

This is where I became heavily interested in and obsessed with math and science. I had nothing else out of school to even do. That's how I got into university at all.

Then at 18 years old, I finally learned what sex was. Yes, you heard that right. I didn't know what sex was until 12th grade. It's more understandable for yall to understand that my family was extremely religious to the point that I wasn't even allowed to be exposed to such topics until I got married. I had no idea wtf was going on with my body. Hell, I even though masturbating was illegal until then. I had no one to talk to about this- I had no friends, my parents told me to never think about that shit and just focus on my studies, and my counselor could only do so much until I had to move to university. Apparently, people learn about puberty when they're 10 or 12 years old. My heart is legit wrenching right now as I type because I missed out on so much. High school is supposed to be a time of exploration, socialization, and having fun. Not being on the verge of clinical depression. 

So many people doubt this because I would have ""used the internet"" or something, and that just makes me feel worse. Let me address the common questions here before anyone wants to harass me. Internet: heavily controlled by helicopter religious parents. I had no sense of privacy ever until I came to university. Parents: My parents love me, yes I know. But whenever I ask them if I should see a doctor because ""hair is growing in weird places,"" they just said ""Just focus on your studies. Don't think about that until we get you a wife"". I had never questioned my parents, nor have had a sense of independence ever. So I didn't question it.

I still cry about how much of a FUCKING LOSER I WAS. HOW THE HELL WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH. I'M FUCKING TEARING UP WRITING THIS. This is why I can't/don't want to talk to my parents about this.

If anyone bothers to read this far and for whatever reason wants to reply, please tell me what the hell I did wrong when I was young. I want to know why I turned out like this. I can't blame my surroundings or upbringing. I must have done something wrong that I fucked up this bad

I know, I'm one sick son of a bitch. I'm trying to vent. I'm sorry, but a man has his limits before he shows emotion. I know that men aren't supposed to display any emotions, but I can't take it. I just can't. My parents and grandparents drilled that message into me: Men don't cry. Men don't feel emotions. Only girls cry. Only girls experience emotion.

Once again, I never had a sense of independence, let alone social development, to even question them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, by the age of 18, I just figured out what sex was and mentally functioned as a prepubescent boy. What the fuck is wrong with me. I feel so left out. I feel so alone. I feel so ostracized. No one wanted anything to deal with me and it snowballed this hard. Why am I so pathetic? Why am I so inferior? I'm legit sick and tired of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now come university. Putting a kid with improper social development with possible mental illnesses into an educational facility about 500 miles away is not the best idea. I got manipulated the hell out. People around me in class quickly figured out that I was ""smart"", at least academically. But there was this one guy, let's call him MH (not his initials, just 2 random letters together).

Until now, I never knew how to make a friend, let alone manage a serious crush. I've had crushes in high school but ""don't focus on that. Focus on your studies"". MH had a female friend, let's call her MF. MH quickly caught on that I was 'different' and easily manipulatable. God my head hurts just remembering what they both did to me. They're the reason why my fuse broke and I went suicidal. But I'm going to share my story here for the sake of closure and advice.

&amp;#x200B;

MH and MF both knew I was good academically and was repressed in all shapes and forms socially. So what they did was they got MF to flirt with me. I never ever had a girl come up to me in such a way. The most a girl has ever gotten to me was in a desk beside me for a school project. 

Now that I think of it, I never had prolonged contact with a female outside of school-related activities until now in my life.

Now that MH and MF had full control over me, they exploited me to the fullest. They got me to do all their assignments for them, tutor them, and even carry them on all their group projects. They knew that I wanted more friends because I finally felt what it's like to not be alone. So they preyed on that. They told me to go to the dorm cafeteria and hug and don't let go of this random chick I never met. I got punched in the face and MH and MF were laughing. I genuinely thought this is what friendship was. I never knew any better.

Thankfully, a guy (let's call him RTH) came up to me and forced me out of MH and MF's group. He exposed MH and MF's wrongdoings and RTH himself was now shunned by the same friends' group he was once a part of. MH and MF both then reverted to degrading me and making me feel like all the wrongdoings done was all my fault.

I didn't know any better so I believed them.

Now no one wants to hang out with the kid who has publically humiliated himself. Why would someone in their right mind want to risk being friends with a kid who physically molested a stranger? That's what the rumor spread around about me was after that incident. Mind you, this is only one incident out of the dozens.

My, my, my. doesn't this sound familiar. History has interesting ways of presenting itself over and over again.

I started to feel myself being isolated again. No one wants anything to do with me if it's not for homework or grades. Except for this time, I became suicidal. Being dead is better than a life of constant pain and anguish. What made this stronger is that I finally understood just how behind and messed up I was. After all, a molester doesn't deserve to live. Doesn't he?

3 suicide attempts later and I ended up in the hospital. I went to the ICU and spent a few weeks in the mental ward. This is where I finally got my diagnosis of Aspergers, Major Depressive Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This is also where I realized that I am indeed, a 14-year-old teenage boy with the intelligence and body of an 18-19-year-old man. This is where I also came to accept the sad reality that people just don't want to have me as a friend. It's been a painful truth. According to my Psychiatrist and counselor, it will take me at least a decade to get to the social development where I'm supposed to be. My only purpose for living is to make this world a better place so people don't have to suffer as I did. I suffer alone being alone. The only worth that I have found to keep on living is my academic intelligence. Humanity can always use some improvement, especially with the AI revolution. This is the only reason I live.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day as I get up and go to work, I'm both amazed and confused. How the hell am I in one of the world's best schools for undergraduate engineering, for mechanical, AI, and aerospace, currently working on AI self-driving cars, but I can't make a single friend? What in the fuck is wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I legit still ponder what the hell I can do to accelerate my recovery. If anyone has any advice, please share. Thanks for reading about my worthless existence. Hell, I doubt that any person would ever read this long of a post. I don't even know what I want. Do I want your support? Validation? Just a place to vent? I honestly don't know. My feelings and emotions have been suppressed for way too long that I don't know what I'm feeling right now. It feels weird going to the internet for advice because I've rarely ever done it. My only experience with other humans has been negative with a few rare exceptions (thank you RTH, you saved me from something that could have been far worse).

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to express what you think of this. Should I have actually killed myself? Would this world be better without another pathetic human to feed? How do I go about actually feeling happy? How do I go about getting stable non-abusive friends? How do I go about improving my social skills when I've effectively made a negative impression on everyone in engineering because I practiced cold conversation starting techniques on way too many people. I need to learn how to make friends.

Please help. "

The saving grace was that it was from a good school and I did manage to have one responsible internship position. I found my current job after 8 months of searching and now I've been here for almost 6 months. It's a sales job and I'm not good at closing deals but my boss saw that I'm very hard working, organized, and capable of helping her out as she owns two businesses. Basically I can do everything except sell her product so she made me her executive assistant. 

Reasons why I'm quitting: 

\-She let me know that she will eventually train me to improve my sales skills. So she's willing to invest in me it seems. I don't believe I will be good in sales and while she's okay with me now, I'm afraid I won't live up to her expectations of me. I don't think the job is a good fit for me and I won't be looking for any sales-driven jobs in the future. 

\-I don't speak the foreign language she and most of her customers speak. I can only speak English and another language that about 10% of her customers speak. So another reason it's not a good fit because right off the bat, I can't serve these customers due to a language barrier.

\-It's low pay. I know most of this post talks about how I suck at this job and how I'm not a good fit, but I have many positives. I get a lot done for her and am the only employee that can handle both of her businesses. Throughout the day, I take calls, write emails, and solve issues for customers from both lines of businesses as well as talk to vendors from both which are completely different industries. I also handle some personal stuff for her. I get paid a low hourly wage, just a bit above minimum wage in California, and no benefits. I would like a better paying job and having benefits is really important to me.

\-It's a small company with less than 5 employees. I get along with my coworkers but I would like to work somewhere with better company culture. If not work with people closer to my age, I would like to work for a bigger company that would also include people closer to my age. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm applying for jobs while still employed here. When I go into interviews, how should I concisely tell them why I'm quitting my current job? Are any of these valid reasons?"

How is the weather? I've lived in San Jose California all my life, how does Austin weather compare?

How is life in Austin? Are there things to do and plenty of food/entertainment in the city? How easy is it to get to Dallas or any other major city in case I miss the hustle and bustle of the city life?

Are students super competitive or are they very collaborative?

Is there plenty of time for fun and extracurricular clubs as an engineering major?

Are there plenty of research opportunities, or do very few students get to take part in it?

How is social life on campus? Is it hard to make friends or are there plenty of opportunities?

Is the place crowded? Will I be able to find opportunities in internships and clubs, or are there too many kids for me to get any opportunities?


Sorry, I know its a lot of questions, but I appreciate anyone answering them for me:) thank you!

So we are in our replacement cycle right now and the new laptops are top of the line i7 16gb 1080p screen NVME 512GB SSD laptops. 

Were talking about 1.5-2K U$D laptops, 

And they are absolute shit

**Dell**

- Already had users complain about bent hinges no fix there.    
- the Ethernet port is absolute trash, i was running PXE to load the corporate image and on about 20% of the laptops unless you pushed the RJ45 all the way in with the force of the damn hulk it would give issues and disconnects.   

- A few were overheating and out of curiosity i opened one, excessive use of thermal paste and the paste for the processor was like dry Playdoe which i had to manually scrap off the cpu, once cleaned up and re pasted with proper paste i had a 30 degree C drop at rest and 15 at load... is this a joke ? dell is using some Shenzen special dollar store thermal paste on 2000 dollar laptops ?  
- We have 3 year premium warranty and they keep fighting us on details like ""yes, you have download and install our proprietary Windows iso and install that and rerun all the tests""... on a laptop thats 90c at rest inside the bios,  We just bought close to a million dollars in laptops with premium warranties from you and you want me to tell a user i have to wipe all his data so dell can fix his overheating laptop ?

- Dell in Raid mode for Intel Rapid storage + PXE = BSOD  

**Lenovo** (this is supposed to be the highest rated Laptop manufacturer)  

- HDMI starts to work intermittently or stops working all togather at times, only solution is to press the Reset hole at the bottom of the laptop with a Sim tool. (thanks to lenovo i always have one on me) , I have a possible solution but i was like ""why the hell would you route the HDMI exit through the Thunderbolt?""   

- Keys are falling off, a 2 grand laptop with 2 weeks of service and people are coming to me with keys coming off the laptop, WTF ?    

- Reviews state 12h batteries, real life experience puts it closer to 6 hours, i have not been able to get one of these to run for more then 4.5h on battery power, and i have users coming to me complaining and i have no answer for them, 

- They ALL overheat but they stay below the 105c thermal limit (havent had one go above 98c), i understand the laptop is thin and light but i cracked one open to see whats going on. 
The CPU was ""stained"" with thermal paste, it was more like they put a drop and thats enough, and only on the CPU core, the controller die next to it HAD NO PASTE on it. Who the hell is building these laptops ? 

Im just burned out and had to vent, 2 grand laptops i should just be able to set up with our PXE servers and hand to our users and they are giving us so much shit...  we´re not talking about 300 buck AMD E2 or Intel N4100 laptops off gearbest, these are top of the line laptops which people and companies pay good money for with the simple idea is that they are well built and made to last, and im seeing laptops which will probably start showing serious failures in months.

I’ve spoken to my mentor/other building counselors and while they’ve given me great suggestions, they haven’t been able to provide me with interventions on the scope it seems my principal is looking for, most of it being 1:1 counseling techniques, not interventions.

1) an error calculator that myself and a few classmates used during lab sessions - manually calculated errors was sometimes too tedious and very repetitive. I created a GUI so it'd be easier for other people to use.

2) a hangman game which I mostly did to understand and become better at creating GUIs

I've started learning how to code in C++ and java and I've just done some basic tasks e.g. shortest path algorithms, finding pi etc.

Another concern of mine is that I also lack a lot of theoretical knowledge and feel like I could easily be thrown off by any technical terms the interviewer uses.

Any help would much appreciated! :)"
ahq5sh,1,2019-01-19,Renegotiating Offer Letter?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahq5sh/renegotiating_offer_letter/,"Hi, I'm a current CS student set to graduate in a couple of years. I have a few years of experience at an IT internship which is currently ending. I've received 2 job offers: one is to do the same thing I'm doing now still as an intern but for more money (23.50 per hour) and benefits and the other job offer is for an entry level software engineering position at a small company with good benefits that Id like to work for. The problem is, when I interviewed I didn't give them a salary expectation because I didn't want to undercut myself. The problem is that I told them that I was getting another job offer for mid 20s an hour and they're planning on offering me mid to high 20s as well. This seems like a good offer but at the same time I feel I'd be underpaid for the position especially for the area (Maryland) and I'm not sure how I can negotiate for more when I basically already said that their offer would be fine. Any advice would be helpful. Note: I haven't yet received the official email with the offer letter for the entry level software engineering position

TLDR: CS Student (no bachelor's yet) with multiple job offers. One of the offers is much better than the other but is still below market value. How can I fix the bad negotiating mistakes I've made?"

I started having small panic attacks throughout my fall term as a sophomore due to stress from my classes and the fact that I was no longer interested in what I was studying (Biology) and feared that I wouldn't be able to find a related job after I graduate. The constant pressure I felt from having to find an alternative interest while juggling the coursework for courses I didn't want to have anything to do with made me anxious and stressed constantly throughout the first half of the school year. What was worst was that I only had 12 credits of classes and I didn't do as well as I did freshman year and I had no other extracurricular activities going on. 

After finals ended and I went back home and I planned on studying for the second semester of orgo to do better since it would only get more difficult but every time I opened my books, I started panicking and didn't want to study. I only have a week left before I go back and I don't want to go through the stress and panic attacks again. 

I wanted to switch majors to solve my problem of not wanting to study bio anymore, but the major that I wanted to get into, applied math, I needed to apply into the major along with completing the pre-req classes. I wouldn't be able to get in since I didn't take the one pre-required class I needed and it would be too late for me to switch majors since I'm more than 50% done with the bio degree. I decided to minor in applied math and am taking a linear algebra course next term, but I feel like I still don't know what to do with the rest of my two years. I was intending on concentrating my bio degree in bioinformatics, but I won't be able to take any related courses until next year and I fear that even though I concentrate in the subject, I wouldn't know what to do after I graduate to find a job. 

I feel like I have no interests and that I'm just floating around and doing what I need to graduate, but I have no true interests. I looked at all the clubs my university offers and non of them interest me. I went to some clubs during my first year, but there was nothing I could get involved in that made me feel like I had an impact. The school I'm attending is in the middle of nowhere and it's too far from the city to get an off-campus internship. 

I guess what I'm asking is, is there anyone else out there that is feeling the same way about not knowing what to do with your time in college and if you're also contemplating every single second you're spending studying something you don't necessarily have a passion for? 

Thanks in advance for any advice or stories.

I am writing here as a confused 20 year old CS student who doesnt really know where they want to go with their career. 

Current Situation: 

My CS degree requires me to complete a 12 month internship, I am currently working as a DeskSide Support Engineer at asset management firm BlackRock. I am on track to graduate with a first class honours (Equivalent of a GPA of 4+ in the US) in my degree. Sounds great right? Not really...

Concerns: 

* I am really concerned that I am going to get caught in the trap of IT support. My only experience in IT is my internship at BlackRock and it seems that right now its the only thing I'm capable of doing. I didnt meet the requirements for any Software Engineer/Coding internships so theres no way there will be any opportunities for me once I've completed my degree. IT Support doesnt pay enough money and I feel like theres more to my ability than swapping out old PC's and broken keyboards. 
* If I dont want to do IT Support, is coding my only other alternative? I hear all the time that CS presents loads of different opportunities, but when it comes down to job/internship hunting it seems like IT Support or Programming are the only real options. What else is out there?
* Have I missed the boat with programming? I have a real interest in coding/programming and would really love to be good enough to do it as a career. My real issue is picking a language and sticking with it, I never know what one to start with and always end up switching between courses and not really getting anywhere... one minute I want to become an iOS dev and the next i'm looking at scripting. Any advice? 
* Am I holding myself back being in the UK? From the looks of things it sounds like there are loads more opportunities for CS students out in the US, is this something I should be looking at?

I am trying to act on this early while im young, I would really appreciate any advice and tips guys.

Other than me there are 3 interns.  A little more background the company, they work 6 days a week with at least 10 hours a day.

First day here I was assigned a  sprint(alone) to work on a project on hyperledger fabric using Go.  I was new to hyperledger, new to Go and no one bothered to make a plan to achieve this target. For two weeks I was spending all day reading source code and a little bit of information from code documentation on GitHub to make the channel manager, and at the end of 14 days I still haven't been able to complete the task,

Now for three days past deadline I've been working my ass off to fix a problem (which still isn't fixed) and in the midst of it, CEO want's me to now learn Java and Mongo for next sprint, he even asked us to spend Sunday learning it. This is where I started losing my shit. I can't seem to catch a break from self-doubt and sadness. I called my parents and started crying on the phone just as I started talking to them.

I am thinking if it's all worth the toll on me and if I should just quit.

Update: After reading through some of the super helpful comments here, I decided to call and let CEO know what was going on and had a good talk with him. I told him about the stress and how I couldn't meet his expectations, he was surprisingly supportive and said he notices my hard work and understands things might take more time. He told me just work to my ability and even then if I can't finish then so be it, they'll reschedule it for future. So, I'm thinking of giving this another go as it isn't everyday one comes to learn at this pace, but I've also decided that if things get too tough for me to handle I'll let him know and leave the place if nothing improves.

ahug3k,2,2019-01-20,"Should I take a career in my industry right after I graduate, or teach English Abroad?",juzzie_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ahug3k/should_i_take_a_career_in_my_industry_right_after/,"I've got a bit of a unique situation. I'm a university student, studying engineering. I am extremely fortunate enough to say that getting a high paying career position in my industry upon my graduation is absolutely certain. I'm so grateful for this job security. This is obviously the industry I want to be a part of for life, something I take interest in, but there's one issue. Before I found this major to study, I was absolutely certain I'd teach English abroad and travel the world for a few years after graduation. I wanted to do this since I was in high school and discovered it was an option for me. The major I started out with in college did not have the kind of job security that my new major has, so I didn't think there'd be a problem with me going abroad before, so it was always a part of my master plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I know I'll have a high paying career right out of university, I almost feel guilty still wanting to teach English abroad. My family disapproves. I'm afraid of what my peers and professors will say if I decline all of my jobs offers to take a job that has nothing to do with what I studied and pays way less. But I don't want to care. This is something I want to do for myself. It's not about the money for me, it's about the experience. I'm so afraid that I'll regret not teaching abroad if I don't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question is: Am I acting like a spoiled brat? Everything I've done, I've done to make myself marketable in my industry. Teaching English Abroad would be an adventure purely for my own self-growth. I want to do what is best for me but everyone around me makes me feel like I'm being a child and I need to get a grip. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second question is: If I do end up teaching abroad for a few years (maybe 2-3?) obviously I'm going to be less marketable in my industry, but will that time be detrimental to my job search? Will no one want me due to that ""missed time""? I'll have 3 summer internships working in the industry by the time I graduate, but still. That doesn't quite compare to 2-3 years. 

Im not afraid of the truth, just give it to me straight!

&amp;#x200B;

I've stayed with this company for a bit longer than 2 years now. I've done some internships here and there, but this is my first full time job as a software developer. I can honestly say that I've learnt a shit-tonne of stuff here, and I love it. I love the developers that I work with, I love the products that I'm building, I love how I'm learning so much on a daily basis, and I love the salary. However, there are some coworkers that I really dislike. Not really as a person (they're not assholes or anything), but more about their professionalism. You have to understand that this is my 100% biased view and opinion, but I dislike how incompetent they are and I also dislike how they don't seem to have any drive to get better. Some of these people work pretty close to me and it's getting to the point where they're inability to perform is impacting me and my team as a whole. It's like every step of my job as a developer involves doubting their decisions and questioning them, because they're wrong most of the time. You might think that I'm just being childish and dramatic, but sometimes I really wonder why the company still pays them for their job. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you might ask: Why don't I just leave then? 

Well, other than the problem that I outlined above, I'm overall super happy with my company. They treat their employees well, and the office culture is awesome. On top of this, I personally feel that I owe them a lot. They hired me when I literally did not know shit, and they turned me into something much greater. I have mentors that babysit me when I was a new hire and pretty much boosted my knowledge base. 

&amp;#x200B;

I heard that in general, people in IT tend to move jobs every 2\~3 years. I think my time is coming. But I don't know if I have a good enough reason to leave, I'm sure that there are people like this in every company. Could I please get some feedback on what you guys think?

ahvs1b,2,2019-01-20,[Career Prospects] Stay at startup for higher pay or go to a huge four(accounting firm) to do data science/learn more?,Yanzal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahvs1b/career_prospects_stay_at_startup_for_higher_pay/,"I have recently graduated from university and last year got into one of the four biggest accounting firms to do things in data science/machine-learning and artificial intelligence etc. I accepted the offer last year to start in February 2019.

However, I managed to land an internship at a blockchain startup. Coming to an end of the internship they are offering me a full-time position.

I am wondering which would be better for myself personally to grow.

**Option 1** Stay at the blockchain startup

* 50% more salary than the other place

* My role is blockchain research and write smart contracts (I perform very little coding and more research)

* Huge downtime (half the day on reddit/runescape)

* Very flexible (can take breaks whenever, no set come in time)

* performance review if we deliver

* Boss said could hit 100k by next year with potential for higher numbers in the next year.

* company currently taking on 3 new clients (company growing)

* Learn blockchain technology (currently research, not sure when we would develop)

* Majority of the time I sit on my desk and there's not much collaboration in terms of what my tasks are.

* I'm not receiving much mentorship, I'm unaided in this work.

**Option 2** Go to the accounting firm

* I will be in a graduate program with hundreds of other people

* Data science department has recently launched, a lot of potential for advancement.

* Surrounded by a lot of professionals in a corporate manner

* Future opportunities to go overseas

* Learn cool technology involving AI, Machine Learning, Data-Science

* Interact with huge companies

* Work in a team with others

* With the companies reputation on my CV I could bring more value to myself in future job prospects.

* Will be working hard and long hours (probably)

* The salary is lower than average.

* Networking opportunities

Which option would be better for me in terms of future prospects? I actually do not mind staying as I would make a lot of money and I do not think I can get to this pay until a few more years but, I believe I may miss out on an opportunity at the accounting firm that I will never be able to experience.

Another thing is since I have already accepted the offer last year with the firm, rejecting them may burn a bridge that I could never cross over again. Is the experience worth taking the huge pay cut? thoughts?"

I'll try to do a quick rundown of various areas of my life below.

&amp;#x200B;

Education and work:

i'm in my last year of university right now, doing some internships. They pay pretty well, and have great benefits. i end up spending a third of my salary on housing, and getting two meals a day provided by my job, so i'm left with a good piece of money each month. i'm so bored at work though. i feel like such a piece of shit, because they're giving me so much and i can barely be assed to show up. I don't feel motivated to do school either. I was so excited for school when I arrived, but i've found it to be (IMHO) PC and dumbed down to the point of uselessness during my first 3 years of classes.

&amp;#x200B;

General Health:

I try to stay in decent shape by going to the gym. I put on maybe 10 or 15 pounds in the past 6 months, to the point that a pair of my pants didn't fit, but the weight's been coming off since I increased my exercises at the gym. i was very skinny before putting on this weight, so it hasn't really been noticable except to me. I drink sometimes, although I've cut back a lot in the past 6 months, and I very very rarely smoke weed (maybe a few times a year). I don't do any other kinds of drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

Relationship:

I'm in a relationship, for close to 2 years now. 6 months ago, I cheated on my girl-friend. (I kissed another girl i'd never met at a bar if it matters.) I was terrified of ruining things with my gf so i didn't tell her, which made things worse when she found out a week later anyways. We ended up staying together but things haven't been the same since. she was understandably very hurt. i thought things would get better but they haven't. it killed me seeing how heart-broken she was after i cheated, and it kills me knowing she still feels that way inside. she's also become less pleasant towards me, picking fights and acting jealous (even though i've seriously cut back on drinking and have hardly spoken to another girl since i cheated). I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Friends:

I have a few groups of friends I'll hang out with, mostly from school. things are nice with them but i don't see them as often as i'd like and i don't feel as close to them as i'd like either. I feel like there's no one really close to me in my life, even though i've got a gf + loving family + lots of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:

Objectively, my life seems to be going pretty well. But I can't help but feel like my friends don't actually care about me, I'm just an fraud who doesn't deserve my job and I somehow lucked into it, and i've ruined things forever with my gf by cheating. Even disregarding all my present troubles, i can't even see myself being happy in the future. my work will just be more of the same for higher pay, i'll get even less time to spend with my friends and on hobbies, I'll get fatter and fatter as i get older, and I don't think I'll ever get married and have kids (or that I even want that).

I just see myself working at jobs I hate until I die alone with no friends or family.

Everyone thinks I'm lucky, they always say I'm lucky that I can pass difficult exams without studying because I can remember lessons and don't really need to study. They say I'm lucky because I'm cold blooded and never get angry or show much emotion, that I'm carefree. But I'm not, I'm not lucky at all. Sure I do well at exams, but it's because I listen to what the lecturers say and revise before taking an exam. But that's the only part of my life I'm lucky in.

 I have shitty parents who only care about themselves, and never showed any actual interest in me if it wasn't when they were beating me or telling how pathetic and selfish I am. They got divorced when I was 13 and can't keep things civil because my dad's an arrogant twat and my mum's done with his shit.

From age 12 to 17 I constantly thought about killing myself, I would visualise myself bashing my head in or hanging myself. But I couldn't leave my brother alone and become my parents beating bag. 

Skip to age 20 and now I live with my brother and father, whom claims to be ill (but I don't believe a word he says since he always lies). I have to take care of my brother (who is 18 but has always been my parents baby and can do no wrong), so I wash his clothes and iron them when I can. I cook and do the shopping, I wash the dishes and try to do my best to keep things tidy.
Today my father wrecked one of the tires of our car, blamed it on me because he wouldn't have wrecked the tire if he hadn't had to ""go take his medicine"" (who the hell knows where he actually goes) because washing all those dishes made him unwell. That the house is a tip and he does everything (he doesn't, he cooks sometimes and pays the bills). 
Obviously its my job to keep the house clean and I never do it.
Thing is he doesn't even have a job, all he does is stay home and do fuck all.
I go to university and have internship so I actually have to work and not get paid. When I'm home I'm physically and mentally exhausted and only have time to study and cook. But apparently  I don't do shit ever, and will never be able to hold a job because I'm stupid and have no work ethic (hilarious since I'm 100% dedicated to my ""job"" and have only received good feedback from my mentors). 
My dad also loves telling me that I should never marry because I'm a stone cold bitch who will ruin her future husbands life, because that's how bad I am. All he does is talk shit to me and talk shit about my mother. My brother is perfect and can do no wrong.
I have to anger towards my brother whatsoever, it's not his fault and he tries to stand up for me when he can.
My father is jealous that I'm affectionate with everyone except with him, because I ignore him and physically recoil whenever he touches me. 
My mother only lives far away and we don't talk often, and only get along for about 3 days before we fight about stupid shit.

I hate myself because I keep getting into abusive relationships, and because I sometimes catch myself lying for no reason whenever I feel even a tiny bit threatened and I hate it so much (I try hard to own up and take responsibility but sometimes I don't even think before I say a lie about some stupid insignificant thing).

I wish that I were a good person or at least an honest person. I wish I was lucky. I wish that I had the means to just leave this shitty house and take care of my brother and keep him away from this toxic shit.

I can't and I hate it so much. "
ahx1dt,32,2019-01-20,Mid life crisis,Thunder-Sloth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ahx1dt/mid_life_crisis/,"I joined the Marines out of high school. Served 4 years as an infantry man with a couple pumps over seas. I didn't really gain any skill sets that would be useful in the real world other than the cliche respect, work ethic or whatever. I had a job lined up when I got out. Started as an armored guard which was a terrible job BTW. You're carrying millions and they give you a revolver with recycled rounds if that tells you anything. A month later I was interviewed by the railroad and took a job as a train operations manager. Three years after that I became a train conductor. Good benefits, amazing retirement and on average about 96k a year. But, I worked on average 60+ hours a week, a lot of long 12-15 hour days, 2 weeks vacation, 0 sick days, a handful of peers have lost limbs, or their lives, and a slew of other woe is me issues.. 

My wife and I had a baby a year and a half ago and that lifestyle was bringing me towards a long road of unhappiness, resentment, and regret.
I want to be a good husband and fsther. The railroad makes that very difficult. So with 4 years left to use Post 911 benefits, I enrolled at my local community College and quit my job. I got health insurance through the state and a decent savings built up.

I start school this coming Tuesday. I am currently enrolled to earn an associates degree in software development with a certificate in web development and web design. I originally enrolled for computer networking but after talking to some friends of friends who work in a similar field suggested I switch to software development. 

Since I was very young I have had a passion for computers. If I remember correctly the first online game I played was half life death match, then team fortress classic, counter strike. I'm old. I self taught myself html using notepad and a geocities website. Nothing crazy but I understood the basics of it all. 

I've spent a lot of time fixing people's computers, removing viruses from coworkers computers due to obsessive porn habits, replacing laptop screens, building shitty websites for businesses of friends or aqcuitances, and photoshopping dicks on people's Facebook pictures. I just love everything about computers. And everyone I know professionally and personally is always suggesting that I do something with computers. I'm a 34 year old man who plays pubg with a group of guys way too often. 

With all that being said I don't know anything about programming, software development, or anything like that. But it is very interesting to me. I want to succeed and have a career I am passionate about. I wonder if I am making a bad decision by doing this? But then again you can't really succeed without taking risks I guess. 

I am mentally ready to start college, I think. I bought a MacBook pro, installed Ubuntu on it so that I can learn those operating systems in addition to just PC. I'm slowly completing CS50 online and from what I gathered in my research, I am trying to focus on one programming language, Java, which is prevalent to the local job postings I am seeing. Versus trying to learn python, Java, C, C++ etc in one week. 

I'm curious to know if anyone has had some similar life experiences. Leaving their job late in life with the responsibility of having a family to pursue their dream in information technology / computer science as a full time college student. 

My hopeful plan is to start school Tuesday, learn as much as I can on my own time like Java for example and hopefully, through networking with people and studying hard, acquire an internship somewhere, paid or unpaid. Gain that coveted experience and start a rewarding career in software development. 

TLDR; 34 year old guy with zero programming knowledge or experience wants to be a 1337 programmer.

ahxo2w,1,2019-01-20,"By ~luck, I got an internship as a software engineer. What should I learn?",OrganicDino,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ahxo2w/by_luck_i_got_an_internship_as_a_software/,"I am currently in my last year of high school. Internship starts January next year.

**Short summary of what happened:** 

In high school, I project this image of geeky hacker dude who's really good with computers and programming. My senior who is now studying Computer Science at a university completed his 6-months internship for a web development company. He told his boss about me and I got the internship offer. I blindly accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem:**   
I have only been making personal projects and some open source contributions sparsely over 5 years. Even then, I only do it at the weekends to make up time for studying. Maybe I have quite a solid practical experience, but I surely lack the theoretical side and whatever Computer Science students are learning.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm **scared**. I genuinely do. I'm pretty sure I will feel inadequate at the workplace later. Most, if not all, of the engineers are likely graduates and I'm just a wannabe engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

I need your help and opinions. Maybe answer some of these questions.

\- What are the skills/knowledge I need to learn to become a competent software engineer?

\- What do you learn in CS that you don't learn by only making projects?

\- In detail, what do software engineers actually do in the workplace?

\- What do you think about MIT OCW as a place to learn? Course recommendation is highly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I have less than a year to learn. Realistically, with all the exams and university preparations, I can only learn the essentials. It would be great if you can help me choose which to learn. Thank you so much!"

Just a bit of a background about me, I received a full-time offer as an SWE from a big 4, before the company realized that I would be graduating in Dec this year. (I applied for an internship, but there was a mix-up along the way so I interviewed for full-time.) Thus, I talked with my recruiter and we both agreed to convert the full-time offer into an internship at the big 4.  


I'm  currently still a computer science and a data science double major with a  \~3.4 GPA and I'm thinking about dropping the computer science major in the hope that I will be able to boost GPA to a \~3.7.   
I believe that my previous 2-3 internships as a SWE and my current SWE skills are sufficient to prove that I have the abilities as a SWE  so that the lack of the computer science major will not hurt me.  Rather, the lower GPA may hurt my applications to some companies/schools/data science jobs in the future if I intend to pursue a  graduate program.

I would really appreciate  any thoughts on this. Do you guys think that the computer science major really matters in the recruiting process or does working at a tech company as a SWE matter much more than that?"

I came out of high school ""The Overachiever,"" and once I got into college, I realized none of that translated into life goals or passions. I was utterly lost. I got a full scholatship, so my parents were willing to put me through law, business, or medical school and especially wanted me to attend the latter. I picked up a Physics degree to get the best of all worlds while I was figuring things out, and included bio, chem, business, and law classes/studying in my time. I also got caught up in orgs on campus.

Note, I found Physics stimulating, but didn't want to pursue it as a career. Got too many credits to change majors. I'm actually going to be summa cum laude in it, but it's just not for me at heart.

Then I crashed mentally. I went to therapy and had a mindset change. I realized I was repeating high school and didn't want any of that: I need to grow anf allow myself to be me instead of trying to impress. I was able to get myself out of my anxiety and depression, and found ways to deal with it if it comes back. Also stopped partying and getting under ""influences.""

Started getting off campus more and nabbing internships. Got a Communications minor, which let me explore classes in fields likr PR, Film, and corporate communications as part of the curriculum. I got a political internship- not for me. PR/Marketing- good at it, but didn't enjoy it or like the field's atmosphere. Worked at a recording studio- difficult and horrible environment for me, and not the side of the industry I'd prefer to be on. Journalism was also a no go for me, too, although I found I loved writing. Just... not news. Also hated corporate comm. I cannot stand corporate, though learning to play office ""Survivor"" has been useful.

I did find I enjoy screenwriting, but I knew I couldn't just bank on the former fulltime and for Film internships... well, I just kept getting rejected for internships in this position because I'm not as skilled/geared up as Film majors (been told to my face by interviewers- also applies to other internships I've applied for). I do work on my own to get myself forward, but my having a ""weird major"" has held me back, such as interviews where I've been told that, despite skills and some experience, they'd prefer someone actually studying the field as a major and not just in a minor. I'm also not sure it's something I want to pursue fully. I'm mostly discouraged from trying to keep signing up at this point.

I've gone to networking events for a variety of fields, especially PR and entertainment, but not knowing my direction or what I want to do, it's hard for me to make career moves or figure out what I can possibly offer to other people, especially if I'm unsure with myself.

Now the time is coming. I don't want to waste money or time on further schooling I don't know or do know I don't want. I'm nervous as hell. I don't want to rely on my parents forever. I want them to be able to live their own lives and me be okay on my own. Currently, they help supplement me with generous allowances and free living as a student. They said I can take as long as I need (now that the not a doctor/lawyer disappointment is over), but I feel bad.

Right now, I work at an indie record label as an intern and was offered a job after graduation. I can do the work, but it doesn't strike passion in my heart. Probably going to take the offer to keep myself afloat and find other jobs to support self.  I've also been thinking of picking up bar work to eventually get to bartending to support myself. I just know that I can't stop swimming or I'll sink, and it's scary. I can code, graphic design, and cook, and I'll probably be trying to utilize those skills to keep me floating, too (I hate coding, but do love cooking and design). My brother has invited me to join him in real estate, but I don't really like it. I've also been studying up on Shopify and starting an online business.

Like sheesh, I've done so many activities in the past, and I can't figure out what paths click for me haha I feel... awful. I know I'm good at songwriting, speechwriting, vocals, playing several instruments, writing, travel, acting, film, producing, public speaking, and martial arts from past experiences, and I actually enjoy those a lot... but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with those to transform them into a lucrative career, especially since I'm drawn to more creative and artistic things and I'm stuck with a major that's helped hold me back rather than make me look unique. I just feel like an oddball who can do a bunch of things, but can't be made useful. A puzzle piece that doesn't seem to fit anywhere.

Any advice would be great. Sorry for the long rant. Thanks for listening..."

I literally downloaded an app to help me get that in check because of him (called Youper if anyone needs that resource too, it's not a substitute for therapy but it's free and I find it a helpful supplement to therapy).

He has this fantasy that his son should be exactly like him, physically fit, financially wealthy, and a traditional conservative Jewish man. Instead, my boyfriend is fat, gay, liberal, and has been openly off the derech ever since he transferred from his Yeshiva high school to my public high school almost 5 years ago. We've been dating for 4yrs, our first date was the first time he broke kosher rules and ate his first bacon cheeseburger. This pisses him off. 

He tries very hard to force my boyfriend to stop being fat. He bought him a gym membership and got him a trainer, whom my boyfriend became good friends with and he did lose a good amount of weight. He stopped paying for it because my boyfriend (who has a part time job and goes to school in the city full time) wasn't going every day like he does. So, after pressure from his Dad, he went on the Keto diet on and off for a year. It did help him lose weight, but it worsened his cholesterol, and his Dad didn't want to make pizza for dinner and keep having my boyfriend not eat it because of his diet (?????). He sent him to a nutritionist, and she told him that if he just limits himself a little, he'll be just fine. His dad ***listened to this through the door,*** and then ***called the nutritionist*** and told her he thinks he's fat because his parents are divorced. (Mind you, this was when my boyfriend was older than 18 and he was protected by HIPAA laws that his Dad was intentionally trying to break)

My boyfriend is a junior in college. He is a tax-paying adult, he is in a really good school getting good grades in the school psychology program. He's gonna try to go to grad school and get a Ph.D. ***BUT HE'S A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE.*** His Dad keeps bitching that he's got a retail job, because somehow, retail jobs are ""beneath"" him, and that he should be working at an office for behavioral services or social services or mental health services, and that he can just walk into any office building and snap his fingers and someone will give him an internship. He's literally hanging out with an INTERNSHIP ADVISOR who says that with the program he's in, there are PREREQUISITES HE NEEDS TO GET BEFORE HE CAN GET AN INTERNSHIP. ***WE HAVE TOLD HIM THIS MULTIPLE TIMES.*** 

Today, he got mad at my boyfriend.

Because when he walked into the living room, we were relaxing on the couch and didn't offer him a seat.

There was a free chair, and if he wanted to sit on the couch he could have asked one of us to move. But no, he walked into the living room and expected us to read his mind and understand that he wanted to sit on the couch and offer him a seat. His exact words were, ""when an adult like your father walks into a room, it is disrespectful and insolent to not offer him a seat."" Like dude, both of us are in our 20s, we are also adults. This is his house, he doesn't need to be offered a seat. He is a grown man, he can find a seat for himself in his own house. 

I'm so sick of him. We're moving out in the summer, and I'm under a tremendous amount of stress because his dad always assumed that like him, my boyfriend would have his own house by now and of course wouldn't need to learn how to save or budget or figure out which renters insurance to get or how to read a lease. That's not my boyfriend's fault and I've been including him in the process but I feel like I'm still driving the ship and I wish I could just move out tonight if I could. I hate him so much. I love my boyfriend to bits and pieces and I the fact that I put up with his dad and pretend to respect him shows that, but his Dad sucks and i hate him."

Before I begin, both options are GREAT opportunities for career development, but like many things, there are many pros and cons to each. 

Please help me make the right decision!! 

Quick summary: I am trying to choose between going to one of the most prestigious universities in the world for grad school or starting my career in engineering at a 500 fortune company that checked marked all the things I want in a company. 

A little more info on me: 

I am a US citizen and I will be graduating from undergrad in chemical engineering this semester. I enjoy technical work and using my creativity and I also enjoy mentoring people. This following bit is important: I do not know what I want to do career wise in the long run. I've had some internship experiences but they were not enough to help me determine what I want to do with my degree. I am open to many options. After my first full time internship at a 500 fortune company, it was a bit of a shock for me. I became depressed and my life felt like it was on a loop. Work, weekend, work, weekend. But to be fair, I think it's because my work was pretty boring and not challenging enough. Don't know. I am also the type of person to be a free spirit and not like any constraints. I do know one thing that I want to do career wise for sure though and that's having a global presence. I want to have an ""international resume"" and obtain a global vision.  


Grad School Option Summary 

After a trip to China this past summer, I had a great idea of a way to postpone selling myself to a company and having a bit more freedom before succumbing to the golden hand cuffs. ""I'll do grad school in China!"" After all, China is handing out scholarships like hot cakes to international students, I've been extremely lucky to not have to graduate with any student loans, and I can travel all around Asia during my school breaks! I even started taking Mandarin courses at my Uni. Fast forward a few months, I got accepted in the #1 ranked school in China and in the top 30 in the world for a master's program in Engineering Management. (The program is in English)

Pros
1. Great school with crazy opportunities and resources
2. The way the program is set up, I have to complete all my courses in Beijing during the 1st year and I can work full time in the 2nd year of the two year program while I write my thesis and it doesn't even have to be in China. This means I can get experience working abroad. I would LOVE to work in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, or Singapore. 
3. I won't have to pay anything because of the scholarship
4. I LOVE getting new perspectives and experiences and the fact that I could experience what a Chinese University is like is so cool, it's not just about being able to live abroad

Cons
1. People have told me this and I agree. This is one of the biggest reasons I'm having doubts about grad school:  I think it's pretty foolish for me to pursue a master's degree when I don't know what the hell I want to do career wise. The one way I think I'll be able to find out what I want to really do, is by getting experience in industry first.
2. People have also told me that I am more marketable now as a freshly graduated ChE than what I will be after doing my masters in China. I worry I would not be able to find a job if I want to come back to the States. Not sure if this is true 

 
And so this brings me to my other option ...

Starting my Career in Engineering Summary

I figure this many be the smarter option, but I don't necessarily care postponing this for another 2 years to have the experience of living abroad. I figure working is the best way to start my career as a real engineer but you know what when I'm on my death bed I think I'll look back to the years I lived in China and not care if I started working 2 years earlier. But in the end, I don't just want to follow my heart, I also want to make smart choices not just for myself now but for my future self as well. 

Pros
1. I can start getting real engineering experience
2. They offered me over 70k starting salary, hot mama is that hard to say no to. Im tired of being poor
3. I like the location
4. They are global and I could potentially do projects abroad with them
5. I can use this experience to really figure out what it is that I want to do career wise

Cons
1. What if I hate my job and regret not going to China for the rest of my life
2. Don't really see myself going back to school once I start working 


Do you see my predicament now? They are both great options and I want to go with my heart but I also want to make the best decision for me. 

THANK YOU FOR READING THIS LONG POST. FOR EVERYONE THAT RESPONDS, I LOVE YOU

Hello fellow Redditors. Made a throw away for this post because I felt insecure about using my main account. Insecurity will probably be a recurring theme though.

So first off a little background. 
1.5 years ago, started doing my Masters degree, and decided to do an internship abroad. I just came out of a long relationship of 4 years (bad break up) and wanted to get away from it all, but also knew this was good for my resume (abroad experience works allot in my field). So I set in a procedure to do a 6 months internship at a prestigious university in the US (I am from the Netherlands, to clarify). I got an offer from my former professor to do an internship with a college there, working on a cool project. This took a while but after some months I finally got everything in order to leave January 2019 till July. 

Here comes the problem, because when I was setting things in motion, around November 2017, I came across a girl. I knew her from my study, and we found out we had a lot in common. We were first just talking, then things clicked and so started dating. A few weeks later we had our first kiss. Everything went on and on, and we started our relationship. I was insanely happy that it happened but we both knew that I had my internship for 6 months in the future. We decided to carry on (best decision). She is my soulmate, and we have been super happy together ever since. We were together allot, basically everyday, but we both didn’t mind at all. We still did our things separately with friends and what not but just at the end of most days we would be happy sleeping together. 

Fast forward about 10 months, and January was getting closer. We talked about it a lot now but since I already set everything in motion I couldn’t really turn back, as it was still one of the best opportunities in my life. Last few days in December and start of January we were inseparable and very happy together. But then came my flight day off (8 of January) to the US. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing ever but we both knew we would see each other in 2 months (she’ll visit me for a week). 

At first I was fine! Yes it was hard, I missed her and my own place and family, but it was okay. But than after a day or two I became really insecure and sad. I always was (unreasonably) insecure, even when I was still home with her. I trust her 110% and I knew she would be forever faithful to me, but a voice in my head kept saying that she could just leave me whenever she wants. This made me even more insecure and drove me crazy. I talked about it to her and of course she told me she would never do something and be with me forever. Problem is, I really need to talk about my feelings. I need someone to help and listen to me when I’m feeling down. She on the other hand would rather not talk about it because it would remind her how much she missed me. This was and still is very hard because I have to give her space but I can’t really because I want to talk to her. So to sort of replace talking to her I now talk to my friends and family a lot, but this is sometimes really hard because I miss her and talking to her the most.

So we do talk once or twice a day, but it is hard talk. I am sort of pretending that I am fine to help her, but inside I just want to go home and cuddle her. I have enough to do here (made friends, have enough to do for my internship, can walk around and discover etc), so it’s not that I can’t distract myself, but my head just won’t stop thinking. The evenings are fine because then she is asleep and I can’t talk to her and my head can rest because it thinks nothing can happen now, but the mornings are though because I then want to talk to her but she is doing whatever stuff so we can’t really.

Going home is not an option really because I invested so much money in this internship, and would bring my former professor to shame, let alone the place I am now. I know she will come in 7 weeks and I also know I have to give it more time since I am here for only 12 days now, but there are times that I just break down and feel so intense dark/sad that I can’t really think about something else than going back home and be with her. Due to me being insecure, I am sort of a ‘doom thinker’ meaning that I am imagining all sorts of crap which I know is not true (She doesn’t love you, she found someone else, she is happy without you) but I can’ help thinking those thoughts. We talked about it, and she said to just don’t think that and that she’ll love me forever and that I am hers forever, and that helps every time she said that, but a few hours later  after we talked the sadness an insecurity slowly creeps back.

So, I can go into way more details but I think you get the point now. I am out of ideas to set these thoughts out of my mind. Read all sorts of guides online to stop homesickness and the feeling of missing someone. But I still feel so empty and lonely especially when I think about the fact that I have 7 more weeks to go till I see her, and after that week, 4 months till I am finally home and I am just here for 12 days now. I don’t want to count down the days but my head keeps doing just that. I am supposed to enjoy this super cool and adventurous period I am here but my head just keeps thinking bullshit.

Any advice?

TL:DR: Am 6 months away from home, feeling lonely and miss my girlfriend allot, but don’t know what to do to stop that feeling."

ai74aa,2,2019-01-21,Internship lost all its full-time staff,starry_cosmos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ai74aa/internship_lost_all_its_fulltime_staff/,"Over a year ago, we had a massive layoff of over half the company (25+ staff to 10ish). I was one of the fortunate ones, likely because I could do both IT and development tasks while also being paid less.

Fast forward a year, and most of the team has quit or moved on. After we lost our team lead, management tried to force other devs to take the team lead position but nobody wanted it. A compromise was reached but shortly after, several more developers left. Our last experienced full time developer just left the day after we hired a new full timer (whom none of us - including HR, IT, and our interim lead - knew was scheduled to start until he showed up and upper management introduced him). The company now consists of 2 experienced part time developers (myself included), a new grad and an inexperienced intern.

But there's nobody to train the new hires???

It is my final semester of college and I'm strongly debating leaving. On the one hand, I get 15 hours/week of ""work"" but there's very little I can get done in a couple hours a day, especially since our schedules rarely overlap.

But on the other hand, having one less thing off my plate and the extra time to work on my senior project could be really nice, especially since it involves undergrad research that will be published in a peer reviewed journal.

How bad of a situation am I in? Is it worth trying to ride out until they inevitably fold?"
ai7jkt,30,2019-01-21,"Possible discrimination, manager says he doesn't see me succeeding at company anymore, Senior Engineer says I'm thriving",_101010_,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/ai7jkt/possible_discrimination_manager_says_he_doesnt/,"So I started a new job out of college 5 months ago. I interned initially and received a return offer to a different team. For reference its a software company and one of the biggest out there, it may or may not have been valued at a trillion dollars at some point. 

2 things happened in the beginning: I missed a 10 minute daily meeting (optional to me as an intern) (also due to depression), to which I did not know the proper protocol. And then I had to fly home one day early of a scheduled vacation due to my depression and health  problems. My manager called this out as very poor behavior and we met about it.

I told my doctor and she said because this was medical I needed to get HR involved. So I did. I didn't go behind my manager's back, I let him know first. In the meeting, I told my manager that the disabilities were the reasons for the missteps, and he completely disagreed with me, when I reiterated that it was and tried to explain a little, it led to the end of the conversation.

This was 5 months ago. Since then, I have been thriving at work. I proposed a project that I was then put on, to which my manager said ""I never would have put anybody with less than 3 years experience on this"", I delivered it in 50% of the allocated time. I also wrote a paper that my manager's manager wants to use as an example for the organization. My senior software engineer says he is blown away by my progress and that I continually surprise him by my work.

A few days ago, during a career progress meeting, my manager told me that he doesn't see me ever succeeding at this company. He said ""I can't see through the fog of the beginning"" and he cannot see my accomplishments, saying I'm not even meeting the minimum bar of success. He called me arrogant multiple times for wanting to promote (even though I just put it as a goal (it was my first time writing such a thing)). And when asked what the rush (again, not a main goal, but the true answer is I don't know how long I'll live) when I remained quiet, he said any answer comes across as arrogant and that it seems I just want the fame and the glory and that it implies that others are less deserving than me. I also put ""quick learner"" as a strength, to which he replied ""that doesn't make you special, everyone here is a quick learner, it sounds arrogant and full of yourself"". He told me by the end of the meeting that I was on a plan that will eventually lead to my termination, and bars me from moving to a new team.

He has made several snarky comments to me over the months. And it has felt hostile for a while, and I have told people this. But a few days ago was the final straw, it felt very personal.


Does this sound like discrimination? Do I have a case here? Can I go to HR? I just want to keep my job and switch teams, but I feel like he will do anything to get me fired. What am I supposed to do?


For reference: my disabilities are spine problems (to which I asked for a chair with a headrest 5 months ago and I still have not received, but that's a whole different story), heart problems, and severe intermittent depression caused by the two.

I would really appreciate any advice.

The academics are fine, it's everything else that really hurts. There's no chance at a social life, I sort of resigned myself of that two years ago. I had the option to transfer multiple times even to schools in Europe but my parents were vehemently against that, so I decided to stick it out at my institution where to see the few friends I do have means a 30 minute drive for an hour a week at best. I'm miserable, even on days like today where there was a cool blood moon and it was chilly enough to wear my comfy black jacket.


I've recently began taking computer science courses (mainly webdev and mobile app type hands on programming of classes) and while I'm loving the content I can't help but feel bitter, like I made the wrong choice in major or something. Their department is less than a decade old, yet they have millions in funding and students get set up with internships every summer from freshman year. Meanwhile, my program while geographically in probably the most advantageous area of the country, lacks any real public outreach or presence. It's to a point where I've seen profs from big name schools like Yale or UC Santa Barbra or Georgetown etc come here to teach, and I'm starting to think this is a place where they can relax for a decade or two and grab tenure without producing a lot of research. I'm scared about not graduating on time, all I've been doing the past few days is applying to internships both at thinktanks and startups and working on my class work in advance. There isn't much else to do besides that and video games, or making music.


I have no stable social life, and honestly really just wish I had my degree already. My roommate's snoring (which I've spoken to him about ad nauseum) is keeping me awake and leaves me with maybe 3-4 hours of restful sleep each night. They often bring friends over and act like I don't exist. I've got a full course load, and except for one semester I've kept my GPA above a 3.0 every semester. I'm trying to stay positive but the job prospects seem nill, compared to the people in the other program. I wish I was at a more competitive school, hell even just a larger school would be nice. I wish I had the ability to make friends here but after almost 3 years I'd say it's not worth trying. I'm getting all these grad school invitations from UCSan Diego and a few others and while I dreamed of going to those places for undergrad they seem so far away now that I don't genuinely know how I'd even begin to get there... I'm just going to keep pushing ahead I guess, ""work hard, be nice, show up"", all that idealistic crap my dad drilled into my head as a kid that hasn't seemed to do me any favors outside of a rising GPA and a group of people who when I do see them I cry inside thinking of how much I wish I was at their institution. It's become a running joke that I wish I was in as much debt as them, and there's a kernel of truth to that. 


Has anyone else been in a similar position to me? "

&amp;#x200B;

I made it to the second round of an internship I was really stoked about. I had an interview with the hiring manager and didn't want to be late so I arrived about 30 mins early. The secretary made a snide comment about me arriving so early which made me super nervous.  She also kept offering me water while I waited and now I felt like it was rude to refuse, so I kept drinking. Well, 20 minutes later I realize had a random hard on and needed to pee. No big deal, I'll just go before I get called in. I've woken up with morning wood that goes away when I pee, so I figured after a quick piss the stiffy will take care of itself. I got up, waddled over the front desk and asked for the direction to the bathroom. The secretary told the closest bathroom is being renovated, handed me a small map and tells me that I have to use another bathroom that's in some far off location. 

I looked at my watch and was a bit nervous about making it back in time, but given that the other option was pissing myself I had to go. I left my jacket and bag and told her I'll be back shortly. I calmly waddled out of the office and as soon as I was out of her view, I fucking [racewalk](https://youtu.be/W3GGzq1PIqs?t=3) to the bathroom. This bathroom was far and tucked away into some hidden part of the building. I finally get there, push open the door and enter this dimly lit murder dungeon. There are two stalls in the back, two urinals, and one grimy looking sink. I run over the urinal in the corner, whip out my junk and release the steamiest piss I've ever had. I'm still hard as a rock and the relief felt amazing. I even let out one of those ""*Ahhwhwhw*"" good piss moans. Then I hear the door creep open. Oh shit!  

I look back and this tall ass dude comes wondering in and stands at the urinal next to me. This guy has to be at least 6'2''! Oh did I forget the mention the partition between the urinals is up to my chest? I'm 5'9''. This dude is towering over me and the partition and he's *just...just staring at my dick!* So I quickly finish up, shake my junk off and that's when he licks his lips and *MOANS!?* Oh, fuck no! I tuck my shit back into my pants then step back.  He steps back with me, cuts me off and shows me his massive erection! He's just there dick jiggling and stroking. That's when I did what any sensible heterosexual male would do when cornered and confronted with dick... 

***I FUCKING SCREAMED!*** I legit let out of shriek hitting octaves I didn't know I was capable of. I freaked out, he freaked out and I just stiff-armed him Heisman style and ran out of the bathroom. 

I racewalk back to the office all sweaty and winded. The front desk secretary told me I just missed the interviewer and to go wait inside his office until he gets back. I grab my bag and jacket and take it inside the room. I'm sitting there for a few minutes panicking about what just happened and hear ""He's in your office."" I turn around and it's the same dude who just tried to offer me his dick. We're both just us wide-eyed staring at each other for what felt like a decade before he suggests I reschedule. I just shook my head, mumbled some gibberish, grabbed my shit and got the fuck out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Had an interview, had to pee, had a hard on, went to pee, cornered by stranger dick, screamed, then found out the stranger dick was scheduled to interview me. "

Your help would truly mean a lot to me, honestly.",unbeatable18,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aiamgv/had_quite_a_heated_discussion_with_my_college/,"I'm in grade 11 IB, I'm not an American citizen, and I'm applying to T20's (US &amp; UK)

*So just for background info, I've never really been a guy who's done things for name-sake. I've always wanted to make a real change in the society, which would benefit people, and genuinely make a difference in their lives. The difficulty never really mattered, as long as I was able to make a change that counted. It is because of this I never believed in things like newspaper drives, plantation drives (which by the way, a* ***lot*** *of my friends do) and so on. In my view, they never made a difference to anyone's life, so I never did them. I don't mean to boast or do anything. My logic was just that even if I fail, I have nothing to lose right? In fact, it would be an amazing learning experience for me, which would help me do other projects better! Moreover, because I now had the opportunities to do EC's, I thought I'd do real ones, because I honestly wanted to be truthful to the college application, and reflect who I really was, rather than faking it.*

**Post begins:**

Dear A2C,

Today I had a quite a heated discussion with my college counsellor. I went to meet her during my Lunch Break, to speak to her about my EC's. 

I told her I didn't want to do any summer programs or internships. In my view, they were more for name-sake than they were to be a genuine learning experience. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate internships or anything, but the very purpose of doing them today in high school is diminished. These used to be insane learning opportunities, where people would learn invaluable knowledge, that they wouldn't learn elsewhere. But today, their purpose has flipped. These are more of money making opportunities for companies, than they are for the student. They give the student a certificate for the sake of it, but does he learn anything in the end? No, nothing. If I find an internship that would help me, I'd definitely go, without a doubt. This is what I told her. I'd much rather do projects of my own in the same time that it would take me to do an internship, simply because it would help me more.

She disagreed to this. She told me internships would really teach me a lot, and would add to my college application. I also disagreed in return. I replied back to her telling her that it truly wouldn't teach me a lot, and I'd learn much more doing projects, and approaching corporates, NGO's, etc for them. Then she told me, ""What if these projects don't work out? What would you put on your college application then?"" She had a genuine point. This left me in deep thought, and I didn't really know what to say. I finished the conversation, taking her point into consideration, and left.

It really left me thinking guys. **What if I fail? What if it doesn't work out, what will I put on my college app?** These questions really hit me, so I decided to approach you guys at A2C, and maybe get some advice from an Admission Officer/Expert if they really could.

From what I've read so far from posts and comments of experts at A2C like u/williamthereader , u/admissionsmom and u/peteyMIT **,** I've seen that I should be myself, and do things that I genuinely like to do, rather than doing them for the sake of it. I actually remember someone saying that the counsellor is probably the worst person I could show my essay to. But the advice I've received above today is logical, and left me with conflicting thoughts. I have a few questions bothering me which I'd like to ask your help for(Seniors, amazing AO's and experts).

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do I need internships and summer school? Is it something without which I would be put at a disadvantage compared to other applicants?

The reason I'm hesitant to do internships is because I want to do something I genuinely can learn from, because of which I'm doing projects. So far, I only have one ongoing EC project (to minimise honking by pairing up with an Uber-equivalent in our country). 

2) If I fail in a project, but it is a massive learning for me(which I'm sure all my projects will be), would it count in my list of extracurriculars? If so how will I list it? 

&amp;#x200B;

So guys, I'm sorry I'm repeating this again, but: I'm honestly in a dilemma.  When I joined IB, I was so glad I finally had an excuse to make all the difference I wanted in the society. Till today, I was firm that I wasn't going to do anything out of sheer pressure, and make my own college app, which would represent just me, u/unbeatable18, and nobody else. But what has happened today has really left me confused. Honestly guys, any help you'd give would really be invaluable to me and I'd really be thankful for it."

I am currently a student at a local public university, about to graduate this spring with a degree in fine arts (focus in graphic design). February of 2018 I was able to secure an internship at a local print production company. It has been great overall with a few minor hiccups here and there, but despite constant tension, I have learned a great deal from the designer here, we will call him Jack. Jack is a perfectionist when it comes to his work and his operating system. So for the past few months I have been shadowing him and learning certain technical skills that will make me a better designer down the road. Jack is a very particular person, some might refer to him as isolated and very much an introvert. I noticed early on that Jack and the other shop manager, we will call her Katie, love and thrive off of gossip. They focus more on placing blame in the workplace rather than fixing the problem or conflict. They gossip constantly about other employees behind their back, even gossiping about one another. This is something everyone knows they do and we all have just accepted it and move on. I particularly have confronted multiple times by fellow coworkers telling me Jack and Katie have been talking bad about me behind my back and blaming me for mistakes not even in my department. I have thick skin so this kind of stuff doesn't get to me. I can still keep face with them and remain professional, but recently they both have begun to be harsh to my face. Now I am a student trying to further and improve my skills. I know I am not perfect and that I will make mistakes once in a while, but even with that considered, I did not deserve what came my way. Because I am still a student, my hours are not full time. I work MWF and I come in on afternoons for Tuesday and Thursday on an as need basis (if we are overly busy or not). I was called in this past Thursday and came into work after I got out of class. It seemed to be a normal day, I was pretty busy getting everything out for shipments and making the deadline for the day. On an average day I leave at 4:30 PM, I had everything done at around 4:20 PM and was the 2nd to the last person here at the shop (just Jack and I). I clocked out and left. I was on the road when i received a phone call from Jack. He proceeded to cuss me out over the phone, telling me I was lazy and useless. When I say it was bad, I mean it. I have had total respect for both Jack and Katie up until recently. This unprovoked verbal harassment from Jack was the tipping point for losing all respect towards him. With Katie, it was the constant lying to my face that lead to losing my respect. For me, respect and trust is a two way street. I cant full respect someone who so blatantly treats people like crap. I am at a loss as what to do after the situation. It is extremely awkward at work, Jack is stomping around slamming doors and whatnot like a toddler. We are NOT on speaking terms what so ever. I feel as though I am working with two 40 year olds who act like they are in high school with all this drama and petty behavior. I learned soon after this horrible phone call that Jack in fact has done this to a recent past employee and because of it, she had felt she had no choice but to quit. I dont see this getting any better after this tipping point and it is starting to seem like the only solution for me is to move on to another job. I would really love input about how i coud handle this and what experiences others have had."

I’m working with two research groups at the moment, and work is moving along at a rather leisurely pace.

 I will be heading for a research internship in one of the two groups in the summer. There’s this one doubt, however, that’s been at the back of my mind ever since I started to plan for grad school - does the presence of a paper with your authorship matter when you’re being considered? Or is the focus on the quality of research and the effort that you put in? 

I’m concerned about how my chances for grad school will be affected (Masters) if I don’t have a paper submitted/accepted by the time I apply at the end of this year. 

(My grades and GRE score are comfortable for me to not be worried too much for my target schools.) "

I'm a final semester Aerospace Engineering student and was recently offered a full time position for after I graduate at a large company. I'm having trouble deciding my best course of action for the offer is.

The company who extended the offer has several different divisions. I currently am in an internship in Division 1. The project is all overhead and not incredibly exciting, but challenging and I enjoy the team. The title is Systems Engineering Intern, but I work in Software with other software engineers doing mainly code fixing/adding functionality/scripting. I have expressed interest in staying on after I graduate, and they assure me that I am a good fit, I just need to go to other managers and make them aware as well. I have also expressed interest in joining a development program to one of the board members on the selection committee, and he seemed very happy to take me under his wing and guide me through the process of applying. 

However at the start of the year, their were some budget cuts and several team members on an already smaller than average team were moved. After consulting some online resources, it also seems that Division 1 is not currently hiring for entry level jobs, as I would be filling. Division 1 is historically the most profitable branch of the company and would be a safe bet working at, if they were to extend me an offer.

I was just offered a full time job from Division 2 at a salary that I would consider above average when talking to coworkers. It would be in Software Engineering. The program seems like interesting work and the manager and I have opened up a solid rapport. Division 2 would be about 60 minutes extra commute a day however, and the program is government related.

I have no doubt the transition to the new role in Division 2 would be fairly easy and I would enjoy the work, but for an extra hour of commute a day, not having the same connections, not being able to earn investments in the safer option as I stay on board, and leaving my current team are plaguing my thoughts. I feel the current offer I have will pay more than any offer from Division 1, and I cannot be certain I would even get an offer from them. The main gambit is that I only have a few weeks to accept the offer from Division 2, and I have not started the process of talking to my newly instated manager about my future at Division 1. Any advice or direction would be appreciated."
aibvs7,3,2019-01-21,How should I spend my summer?,thinker224,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/aibvs7/how_should_i_spend_my_summer/,"Hello, 

I am a first year undergrad studying computer science with MS in computational linguistics (dual degree)

My first summer vacation is going to come up in a few months and I was thinking what would be the best way to spend it.

Should I spend it 

a) Trying to do an internship :  I don't know anything with enough depth to be able to do a lot at a company, so I don't think I would even land an internship.Even if I could land an internship at some small local startups (unpaid) if they don't give me time to learn things and implement them I would not fare well in that either.

b)Trying to do a research internship under a professor : Since my degree requires me to do research and publish papers, I think this could give me some exposure to research.However, from the next year I would get exposed to research in my own college. Also, once I am out of college I really don't know how many research jobs would exist that take a person without a PhD.

c)Work on making my interview skills better. Spend time doing interview coding questions and also learn new technologies and try to do some small mini projects. (if you think I should do this do tell me what technologies should I be learning.)"
aic8pq,2,2019-01-21,How do I handle asking for this letter of reference?,holocat1,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/aic8pq/how_do_i_handle_asking_for_this_letter_of/,"I am an undergrad student. This summer I worked full time for professor J, and part time for mentor H, who worked a few towns over. This was research work. They do not know each other.

Because of the commitment to J, getting as much work done as hoped with H was difficult, and while the project moved along it didnt quite come to the fullness I was hoping to this summer.

On the other side, prof J was a terrible, manipulative mentor. He disappeared for a month when I thought hed be with me in person for most of the summer, was never direct with me, and was an awfully difficult person. When the summer ended, I immediately stopped working for him and havent talked since. Additionally, he was under the eye of the department during the fall semester as he had made inappropriate comments to students and some faculty. 

Now I have to apply for this years summer internships and I need two LORs. I have an academic one from a professor I took a class in, and I wanted the other to be from H.

As I expected, H was hesitant to write the letter. We did not get through as much of the project as either of us wanted, and he said to ask my other professor first for a better letter.

I want to explain to him that I cannot do that. I dont think I have any other people who could write letters for me either, and i'm really hoping that H will. I feel pathetic, but I dont know what to do.

My question is, how should I reply to H that I am unable to get a letter from J and need one from him? Would it be appropriate to mention that J has been difficult both to me and at my university in general? What would be the right way to phrase my situation without sounding pathetic and defensive?

Sorry for the long post ahead of time.  

I am a month out from graduation and have only received 4 rejection letters and no kind of leads towards employment. 

For a little background, I graduated with a BS in CS and did not have the opportunity to take part in any internships, because of my current full time Job. I don't have any major side projects and to add to that my GPA is sub 3.0. With that being said, the most substantial thing on my resume is that I have a degree in CS. 

I am looking for Mobile development positions more specifically iOS and general java development but fall short of most job descriptions and have yet to receive a response from entry level opportunities. At this point I am pursuing internships paid/unpaid just so I can add to my resume and be more competitive. From what I understand this is frowned upon post grad but I don't feel I will get a paid Job otherwise. 

Here is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18zlhvrif0igzjc/Resume_Reddit_2019.png?dl=0) so you guys can have an idea of what I have to offer. Feed back would be much appreciated whether it be tips, criticism or telling me to give up on life lol. I worked fairly hard on it to make it stand out but in the end the substance is what matters. Thanks guys in advance and good luck to those out there in a similar situation.  

With all that being said, I am actively working on some side projects to beef up my resume and don't plan to give up. 

TLDR: I only have a CS degree to show on my resume, low GPA and no major projects under my belt. I have only received rejection letters so far. Link to [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18zlhvrif0igzjc/Resume_Reddit_2019.png?dl=0), any kind of feedback is greatly appreciated. "
aid1k6,620,2019-01-21,A guide to life in college (long post),MusicPi,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/aid1k6/a_guide_to_life_in_college_long_post/,"This guide was written out of inspiration from a reddit comment that I wrote in response to someone asking how to get a 4.0 in college. My advice was not to focus on the grades as much as the overall learning experience, and other important aspects of college, which often get overlooked from a usefulness perspective. These aspects include networking, learning outside of the classroom, exposing yourself to new things, and keeping ones life balances, and trying to keep oneself healthy, both in body and spirit.

## First off:

Balance is important to maintaining a healthy life and maximum productivity. The amount of stuff you get done is not based purely on the amount of time in which you attempt to be productive. Procrastination is often a result of emotional stress and anxiety, and not laziness. Telling yourself to ""just do something"" will not make it easier to be productive towards a particular goal.

This guide aims to give you advice on how to effectively manage your college experience.

## Time Management

Time management is an essential part of being productive. You don't need to account for every second of every minute, but you need to create a schedule that works for you. Attempt to find the worse uses of your time, and eliminate them form your habits.

Use time between classes wisely.

Try to track time and figure out where it goes.

## The Big Five

I like to think of ""the big five"" them as MEDSS ""meds"" with two s's. The big five are meditation, exercise, diet, sleep, and social (activity). Incorporating these into your life on a regular basis will vastly improve it. There may not be any magic pill, but these things will improve your life likely more than any medication will (with some notable exceptions if you are gravely sick). ""The Big Five"" also

### Meditation

Meditation can be easily started with an app such as headspace, or insight timer (I believe there are many others, these are just the ones that I happen to use). Only takes 10-20 minutes a day, and you will see real improvements in your life.

### Exercise

Exercise should be done at least 3x a week, and can be in very many forms. You can do strength training, yoga, cardio (running, rowing, stair stepping, HIIT), climbing, team sports, and many other things. I personally do strength training with some cardio thrown in (not as often as I should with the cardio, but I'm working on it). **Remember, an exercise activity you will do is more important than something that is ideal for maximum health, that you never do.**

I believe that strength and cardiovascular training should be included in everyones workout routine. I personally started strength training with Stronglifts 5x5, and I highly recommend it as something that is simple and easy to get started with. Starting strength is another good option. Please note: you _need_ to use proper form, or you will end up injuring yourself over the long run, I suggest watching the Stronglift's videos and reading the articles on form, and getting a knowledgable friend to check your form. (this does not take much time, just an hour or two, and you don't have to do it all at once)

You can avoid injuries by starting light and working on your form as you add on weight. If you follow Stronglifts you shouldn't have an issue. I did it for 2 years and was previously totally untrained (no previous lifting experience). With 3x a week I made some serious progress. Additionally, strength training will increase the amount of muscle on your body, while decreasing the amount of fat (depending on your diet), so you'll look *hotter*.

### Diet

I am no expert on diet, and there are many debates over what is healthy, mainly make sure to limit your caloric intake (so that you don't gain weight), and to lose weight if you are overweight. I recommend looking into fasting, as it seems to be a useful tool if used properly. HOWEVER PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND NOTE THAT FASTING CAN HAVE HUGE EFFECTS ON HOW YOU SHOULD BE DOSING MEDICATIONS.

I also suggest focusing on eating foods with less added sugar, making sure you get your proper daily intake of nutrition. If you want to lose weight, cutting out any beverage that is not water can make a huge difference. Additionally, eating foods that fill you up can help you eat less, since you will be satiated.

Note: if you start lifting, make sure you eat enough, otherwise it will stunt your progress

### Sleep

Sleep is something that very many people vastly overlook. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night is essential for your physical health, emotional wellbeing, and especially for your productivity. Productivity is not a function of hours in times some constant is equal to productivity. Productivity has many factors including your state of mind, how clear your head is, are you actually able to sit down and work to get started. You may gain 2 hours in the day by sleeping 6 hours a night, or gain 4 hours by sleeping 4 hours a night, but you will murder your productivity and health not only in the long run, but in the short run.

Two weeks of getting 6 hours a night is like having a 0.08% BAC, the legal limit. Also staying up for 18 hours consecutively produces similar effects. Sleeping less may be okay for one night at a time, but if you do it every night, you will be less productive, despite having more hours to work.

A very small percentage of the population can manage getting by with less than 7-8 hours, but they are a tiny minority. About 1-5% of the population, I forget the exact statistic. YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THAT GROUP.

College kids, and people in general like to brag about how little sleep they get. Don't be like them, get a healthy amount of sleep. You'll come out ahead in the long run.

Sleep is especially important the nights before exams.

Additionally, try to go to bed at the same time, and wake up at the same time every morning, including weekends.

No blue light before bed, preferably no screens at all. Try reading a book. :)

### Social (activity)

Believe it or not social activity is important to good health. I happened to ignore this for many years, because I tend to isolate myself when I am busy and stressed, and figure I can get more done by staying in my room for days at a time. Social interaction during the day is good, but taking time to get away from your room/routine also does good, especially if you can go to a game night, or concert, or whatever with friends. I don't know exactly what the research says about frequency, but I'd suggest trying to do something at least once a week for a couple of hours. By this, I mean do something outside of normal mingling and gossiping at your workplace, before and after classes, etc.

Social accountability is another powerful tool that will help you. If you can get your friends to be disappointed in you when you don't study properly, or do something you're supposed to do, like exercise, it will be a massive deterrent against doing things poorly. Additionally, finding an exercise buddy can be useful to help you blow off steam, and to encourage you to exercise when you don't want to.

A large part of college is the developing of social relationships, even though you may not be told this going in. Take time to date, meet new people, join clubs, try new things. You will likely not have many of the same opportunities again

Don't hang out with people who are going to get you to do stupid things, and who don't have any ambitions, they _will_ drag you down with them. It doesn't matter if they are good people at heart.

On the flip side, if you hang out with hardworking and successful people, they will encourage you to work harder, and you'll see what helps them succeed. After college they'll be helpful to help you network.

I seriously regret not spending more time with people in college, my mental health would've been better, and I would have likely had better grades as a result, hell maybe even a girlfriend, or some fun stories to tell.

### Dating

**_Never again in life will you be surrounded by so many attractive peers, who are generally open to  many with high ambition. Make use of this opportunity._**

However, keep in a mind, a good relationship may improve your life a little bit, but a bad one will make it much worse, in other words, get out of bad relationships as fast as you can, and preferably stay away from toxic individuals.

## Grades

My original response was to someone who asked about getting a 4.0 in college. My response was, don't focus on an arbitrary target, so much as making sure you use your time wisely. If you are trying to get into medical/law/dental or other professional schools, or into graduate school, having a good GPA is important. However, there are things to consider about GPA.

Say getting a 2.5 GPA takes 10 hours a week of studying, 3.0 takes 15 hours a week, 3.5 takes 25 hours a week, and a 3.75 takes 40 a week, and maybe a 4.0 takes 50 hours a week. Diminishing returns start to kick in heavily. What if you spent that time doing research, or interning, or in clubs and activities that help you build your network. Hell, maybe you could start your own company. Outside of getting into graduate school or a professional program, your GPA won't really matter past your first job. That being said, I'd shoot for at least a 3.0-3.5. (these numbers are 100% made up, find the balance that works for you and your goals)

Find the balance between schoolwork and research, internships, and clubs or other activities. The balance point will be different for everyone.

Your connections, will matter for the rest of your life, as your friends start to move from company to company, and as some of them climb corporate ladders and start their own companies. These connections will get you farther than an extra .25 on your GPA ever would.

**Do not beat yourself up over bad grades**, if you do this you will increase your chances of developing depression. Focus on managing your time effectively. If you manage your time effectively and do not receive the grades you want, it sucks, but it's okay. You can only do so much, and if you are making the most of your time you should be proud of yourself. Continual improvement is more important than perfection. Consistency is also very good.

Consider trying to develop good relationships with a handful of professors who you will use as references for jobs, recommendation letters, etc. It is especially useful if you do research or other non-coursework related activities with them, as they will get to see more of who you really are, and your work ethics.

### Studying

There are effective, and ineffective ways to study and complete coursework. Start off by _going to class_, it'll really make a difference even if you don't think you're learning much. Go and take notes by hand. Taking notes by hand is the most effective way to make sure you're internalizing the information from the lectures.Additionally, ask questions in class, and go to office hours, it doesn't matter if you feel like an idiot, your understanding of the course material is more important than what your classmates think. Most of the time other people in the class have the same question. If you're too afraid to ask during class, go to office hours (this is also a good chance to develop a relationship with professors).

Reading the textbook can be useful for some classes, but not so much for others.

Do homework. Homework gives you practice, and practice makes you better at remembering material, and using complex problem solving abilities. The more you develop problem solving abilities, the easier any question will become.

[This video] is a good source for evidence based studying techniques.

My advice is to trying and make connections between all the concepts in your mind, and how they relate, this will enable you to remember things you forget through related information, or may make you able to reconstruct a piece of information from other pieces of information. This technique has been useful to me many times. People often waste lots of time using rote memorization, but if a question on an exam is slightly different than something they expect, they'll be totally lost, whereas someone who understands the concepts well can adjust quickly, and digest the information.

I did disproportionately well on many exams despite my sometimes lackluster performance on homework. I believe it was due to my focusing on understanding of concepts, and not memorizing problem solutions.**Dumb songs, acronyms and other mnemonic techniques will make things easier to remember, even if they sound stupid.**

On exams I start at the beginning, and when I get stuck on a question, I stop and move on to the next one, often times a solution to something I was previously stuck on will come to me eventually. It is also good to look at all the questions on an exam before starting so you think about them in the back of your head. I don't know if this is pseudoscience, but it works well for me.

Study over weeks, don't cram the night before an exam. Also, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before an exam, it doesn't matter how much you studied if your brain is functioning at 25% capacity because you didn't sleep before the exam. Get 8 hours.If you're interested in learning to master your memory, check out ""Moonwalking with Einstein"". Anyone can train their memory to memorize lots of things quickly, which can be useful for some classes (and less useful for concept based classes). However, this will take time. I have not tried practicing the techniques, but it is an interesting and worthwhile read.

I suggest figuring out every class you want and are required to take, and make a timeline of when you'll be taking them. Maybe you'll see if you can dual degree or double major, it's much easier to do now than in a few years. Classes will get harder (probably).

You might consider taking a few classes in different disciplines in order to make sure you want to stay in your major, it'll make switching easier if you have a few classes done.

Or, consider doubling down and finishing your classes a year early so you can graduate, or maybe start taking graduate classes and do lots of research.

Take breaks from homework and spread out assignments, sometimes going to bed and then looking at the assignment in the morning will make a difference. Try to do them as soon as they are assigned (assuming you have been taught all you need to do them). This gives you more time to reach out to professors and TA's, and time to put them away when you get stuck.

I worked 2 internships related to my degree and prior i was a mechanic but i knew i didnt want to wrench forever. 

I was fired from my first ""real job"" after 3 months in May 2017. My boss was never clear on what she wanted from me and most people at that company agreed it wasnt my fault but an issue with management (in the 3 months i was there, 8 out of 20 people left, 3 of them just walked out on the job). It was also a niche industry that i really didnt care about. 

Fast forward July 17 i find another finance job at a mid size company in another niche industry i could care less about. It was going good because the job was chill, had perks and paid okay, but i felt like it was a waste of my time. Im basically a glorified accounting making sure numbers match and look organized and tidy, it makes me feel dead inside. My supervisor is very similiar to my old boss, i cant understand what she wants, she makes a big deal over nothing, and makes me waste time on redundant tasks. 

My boss (who has authority over me, unlike my supervisor) is very chill and laid back, there are months where i have nothing to do and this doesnt bother him? But my super is on a power trip keeping me busy with pointless tasks that mean nothing in the big picture, she also micro manages the crap out of me and its very stressful. She gets on my case about small things that my boss doesnt care about and that i believe don't matter. For example, she had me do a 2 hour analysis that resulted in a variance change from .0067% to .0066%. This wouldve resulted in a change of 7 basis points regardless due to rounding. 

Now i show up to work on auto pilot, knowing regardless of my accuracy i will be reprimanded for something small. I started learning SQL queries and ive found interest in this and ive picked it up quick, its the only reason i come to work, so they can pay me to learn new software. I don't care about the well being of my funds or my investors, none of it matters, i have no authority to make my own assumptions and anything i forecast or analyze is some back of the napkin BS calculation. If i lost the company millions due to neglect, i wouldnt lose sleep over it anymore.

This place is also very cliquey, they act very inclusive and ""family"" like (which i fucking hate tbh, were not family, were getting paid to tolerate each other). I hate feeling obligated to go to work happy hours and other shit activities that im not getting paid for. If you don't fit in you feel very shunned but still expected to participate. My coworkers are also distracting as fuck, its a toxic environment. 

My boss gives me no direction, my supervisor stresses me out for no reason, i was studying for my MBA but if every finance job will be like this then whats the point? This is all bullshit projection based on bullshit calculations, none of it matters. I spend 40 hours a week wasting my life crunching numbers that dont fucking matter?!?!? Im going insane. I feel like im accomplishing nothing, its making me very depressed. My therapist sees i dont like my job but she hasnt given me much advice about how to find a new career in something, something that might be vaguely interesting or at least feel fulfilling? I spent 6 years studying finance im slowly feeling like it was a complete waste of time, and that ive been doing it so long ill be stuck here.

I can't quit because of financial and resume consequences. I feel socially isolated, totally un-stimulated, unwelcome, and I want out.

&amp;#x200B;

No one said work was fun .. it's work. Hence the age old saying ""I'm not here to make friends"". That's not to say a work environment can be filled with warm and friendly people. Now, cohesive personalities are of course relative to the individual and experience. My experience with this construction company has been everything opposite of warm and inviting ..

I'm a late twenties male mechanical engineering student graduating in May, and I work for a medium sized mechanical construction firm, specifically under a few estimators. This highlights problem one — I'm not working an internship in my field. Now this is my fault. I was late to the internship game, and my options were what was left at the bottom of the barrel. Regardless, I started day 1 with an open mind and positive attitude. On the surface, it seemed as though I would get along just fine. It has been spiraling out of control since I started.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been slinging drinks for the last 6 years to pay my bills while in school. I'm a very friendly and personable individual who's income is reliant upon my ability to connect with others, interpret their wants/needs, even if they're unspoken. These guys are impossible. I have tried my absolute hardest to form even a basic connection with these guys and they refute any attempt. Much worse, they passively treat me like dog shit. Have they said or done any action which constitutes as direct infraction of company policy, including but not limited to: bullying, harassment, directly creating an uncomfortable work environment, or engaged in any sort of malicious behavior directly toward me? No. But anyone in the workforce knows you can be a total prick while adhering to company code.

&amp;#x200B;

They don't talk to me, ignore anything other than work related inquiries, let the door slam in my face, refuse to teach me anything of importance. They will set me up for failure: send me out on errands and then tell me how horrible of a job I did. This is of course a week after the fact while not providing any constructive feedback, therefor not even providing an opportunity to learn. Just that I suck at my job. They will lead me on with hopes of engaging in more tasks and responsibility and never deliver. After heckling one of my bosses enough he even went as far as to say ""I can't teach you how to do what I do."" They'll make plans and never invite me, laugh, carry on, etc. I'm a ghost. They deliver the bare minimum to ""remain professional"", past that they don't even treat me respectfully as a human being. More like a robot to which they input commands.

&amp;#x200B;

At first it wasn't this bad. They invited me out a couple times, and honestly I don't know what changed. Perhaps they don't think I'm proactive enough. Maybe they don't think I care? I have tried so many times to change my attitude, consider the fact that I'm just an intern and can't expect much. I have asked to get involved with others around the office. I have asked to shadow. I have tried to connect with these guys, start conversation, make jokes, find commonalities. Fuck today I tried to catch them as the group was going to lunch: ""Where ya guys going?"" \*Running toward door\* ""I dunno!"" \*SLAM\*. God damn I don't know what else to do. I have never in my life found it so god damn difficult to assimilate in my life.

How does this tie into my emotional health? I'm stuck. I need an internship for graduation .. and I'm trapped here for nearly 30 hours a week. My holidays? I'm here, ""working"". There is no worse feeling that being forced to spend time in an environment where you're not welcome. An environment where you're set up to fail. I have been here since August and I'll be here till May. It's not much longer, sure. ""Tough it out"" - Says everyone ever. My favorite ""Stop complaining, you're an intern"". Well, it's not any fun to be totally isolated for such a large portion of your week. Coming home and having 2 hours of free time until you have to endure it all over again. That and I feel like my time here has been totally wasted. What would you guys do?

I was getting pretty bummed about not getting an internship, especially since I am a Junior now when I realized that I haven't cast my net out wider yet. I have a few questions before I start applying to out of state internships:

How will you know if the company will pay for your rent/travel or will it be deducted from your pay?

Will the competition be as rough as applying to tech hubs?

Any recommendations for companies that are willing to bring in interns from out of state, specifically for an Android role?

Is it too late to apply?"
aifaxo,2,2019-01-21,How do I transition away from Education/Academia into Data Science with no (job) experience?,Macphearson,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/aifaxo/how_do_i_transition_away_from_educationacademia/,"Hello,

I am a graduate student currently pursuing an MS in Mathematics (BS is in the same). All the jobs I have held post-military have been for the colleges I attended (and then I started adjuncting after I got my BS). These have been tutoring, etc. Basically everything going back about 6 years is education related.

I have some marketable skills, with respect to industry jobs. I'm comfortable with Python, R, MATLAB, Tableau, MySQL, and Julia. However I find I'm underqualified for every job posting, even those marked entry level, with respect to ""years of experience "" for any of these skills.

And while I know this is an issue for most millennials in the job market it doesn't really give me any comfort.

How do I move forward? I live near Boston, not really able to move due to health of family members. I went to small state schools, not big name universities.

Do I quit my MS and try for another Bachelors with more programming (many internships here disallow graduate students)? I already moved home to save money. I have one class to adjunct this semester. Do I just take whatever semi-skilled labor job will have me? Do I live in ramen noodles and take whatever unpaid internships will have me to build my resume? Please advise.

Thanks!"

aigbzy,1,2019-01-21,"I'm a sophomore CS major and I feel like I'm so under the curve, need advice",Bomatic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aigbzy/im_a_sophomore_cs_major_and_i_feel_like_im_so/,"Apologizes for the incoming word wall. I recently transferred from community college to USC, where I'm pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Business Administration. Originally I was just a business major, but I changed my application to CS/BA at the last second because I've always had an interest in science/engineering, and I wanted to have some kind of marketable skill. I also took AP computer science my senior year of high school, which I found very interesting, but I got a 2 on the exam because I had really bad senioritis and slacked in all my classes.    
&amp;nbsp;

I was admitted to USC for the spring of 2019 as a sophomore transfer into the CSBA program. Basically, I'm taking the core classes for both business and CS majors, but I don't have a concentration. I was comparing the course offerings, and I'm taking all but 2 classes regular CS majors take. I've completed every GE and every math class I need, so these next few semesters I'm solely taking CS and business classes. I've talked to a few people, and the reputation for CSBA at USC is basically just a heavily-slanted CS major with a business minor. Right now I'm in the intro classes, and I plan to take data structures over the summer to graduate on time. I applied to a bunch of clubs, a few being CS related, and was rejected by all. Not even asked for the first round of interviews, just flat out rejected. I know freshman CS majors here who made it to interviews, and it's really discouraging.  
&amp;nbsp;

I've been browsing this sub a lot, and I've been chatting to a few of my CS major friends from home. One of them recently graduated from Berkeley and is working at Amazon in a few months, which is pretty inspiring. I've heard terms like ""back end,"" ""front end,"" ""full stacked,"" etc. and I have a vague understanding of what they mean. All of the USC classes teach CS in C++. Career-wise, I want to get into startups (not sure what industry yet, maybe space exploration? I've always been very interested in that), and ecommerce/app and web design. I also think software engineering and AI is interesting, but I don't know much about it. Right now I've forgotten most of what I learned in AP CS from high school, which was in Java, and I'm currently taking intro classes in C++.  
&amp;nbsp;

For the summer of 2020, what is the best thing I can do from now until then to improve my resume, and hopefully be a more competitive applicant for CS clubs and internships in the future? Should I try to learn languages on the side, like Python? Which one's the best? Honestly I have no idea where to start and it's a bit overwhelming, everyone seems like they know what they're doing and they're 2 steps ahead. I'm very determined to learn more, all advice appreciated."
aigcbc,1,2019-01-21,Far away from home and feeling empty,TooFarAway1011,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/aigcbc/far_away_from_home_and_feeling_empty/,"Prepare, this will be a long post. 

Hello fellow Redditors. Made a throw away for this post because I felt insecure about using my main account. Insecurity will probably be a recurring theme though.

So first off a little background. 
1.5 years ago, started doing my Masters degree, and decided to do an internship abroad. I just came out of a long relationship of 4 years (bad break up) and wanted to get away from it all, but also knew this was good for my resume (abroad experience works allot in my field). So I set in a procedure to do a 6 months internship at a prestigious university in the US (I am from the Netherlands, to clarify). I got an offer from my former professor to do an internship with a college there, working on a cool project. This took a while but after some months I finally got everything in order to leave January 2019 till July. 

Here comes the problem, because when I was setting things in motion, around November 2017, I came across a girl. I knew her from my study, and we found out we had a lot in common. We were first just talking, then things clicked and so started dating. A few weeks later we had our first kiss. Everything went on and on, and we started our relationship. I was insanely happy that it happened but we both knew that I had my internship for 6 months in the future. We decided to carry on (best decision). She is my soulmate, and we have been super happy together ever since. We were together allot, basically everyday, but we both didn’t mind at all. We still did our things separately with friends and what not but just at the end of most days we would be happy sleeping together. 

Fast forward about 10 months, and January was getting closer. We talked about it a lot now but since I already set everything in motion I couldn’t really turn back, as it was still one of the best opportunities in my life. Last few days in December and start of January we were inseparable and very happy together. But then came my flight day off (8 of January) to the US. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing ever but we both knew we would see each other in 2 months (she’ll visit me for a week). 

At first I was fine! Yes it was hard, I missed her and my own place and family, but it was okay. But than after a day or two I became really insecure and sad. I always was (unreasonably) insecure, even when I was still home with her. I trust her 110% and I knew she would be forever faithful to me, but a voice in my head kept saying that she could just leave me whenever she wants. This made me even more insecure and drove me crazy. I talked about it to her and of course she told me she would never do something and be with me forever. Problem is, I really need to talk about my feelings. I need someone to help and listen to me when I’m feeling down. She on the other hand would rather not talk about it because it would remind her how much she missed me. This was and still is very hard because I have to give her space but I can’t really because I want to talk to her. So to sort of replace talking to her I now talk to my friends and family a lot, but this is sometimes really hard because I miss her and talking to her the most.

So we do talk once or twice a day, but it is hard talk. I am sort of pretending that I am fine to help her, but inside I just want to go home and cuddle her. I have enough to do here (made friends, have enough to do for my internship, can walk around and discover etc), so it’s not that I can’t distract myself, but my head just won’t stop thinking. The evenings are fine because then she is asleep and I can’t talk to her and my head can rest because it thinks nothing can happen now, but the mornings are though because I then want to talk to her but she is doing whatever stuff so we can’t really.

Going home is not an option really because I invested so much money in this internship, and would bring my former professor to shame, let alone the place I am now. I know she will come in 7 weeks and I also know I have to give it more time since I am here for only 12 days now, but there are times that I just break down and feel so intense dark/sad that I can’t really think about something else than going back home and be with her. Due to me being insecure, I am sort of a ‘doom thinker’ meaning that I am imagining all sorts of crap which I know is not true (She doesn’t love you, she found someone else, she is happy without you) but I can’ help thinking those thoughts. We talked about it, and she said to just don’t think that and that she’ll love me forever and that I am hers forever, and that helps every time she said that, but a few hours later  after we talked the sadness an insecurity slowly creeps back.

So, I can go into way more details but I think you get the point now. I am out of ideas to set these thoughts out of my mind. Read all sorts of guides online to stop homesickness and the feeling of missing someone. But I still feel so empty and lonely especially when I think about the fact that I have 7 more weeks to go till I see her, and after that week, 4 months till I am finally home and I am just here for 12 days now. I don’t want to count down the days but my head keeps doing just that. I am supposed to enjoy this super cool and adventurous period I am here but my head just keeps thinking bullshit.

Any advice?

TL:DR: Am 6 months away from home, feeling lonely and miss my girlfriend allot, but don’t know what to do to stop that feeling."
aigpka,4,2019-01-21,Doing bootcamp after earning computer science degree?,godogs2018,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aigpka/doing_bootcamp_after_earning_computer_science/,"I graduated this past December with a degree in computer science. Prior to graduating, I had no confidence in finding a job, and thought about delaying my graduation by a quarter or two since that would allow me to better my skills while attending school as well as take a few CS electives that were offered that I had not taken yet. I cannot find a job and my resume is not good enough currently to get a job. It is too late to do any internships and I didn't do any internships because I was working while going to school at the same time. 

I then left my job to focus on school but I couldn't apply for any internships because I had to take required CS classes over my last summer (like senior capstone course). Our 3-quarter long senior capstone project was supposed to be a very big deal and a showcase for employers. Instead, it was something I totally did not understand. I was on a 3 person team that had a very disproportionate difference between the lead and me and the other guy. The lead had all sorts of coding experience as a full-stack developer for a few startups before going to college to get his degree and is also a person of very high intellectual ability. His work in the startups was done in the programming language that we did for the project. Me and the other guy on the project had never used the language before. I cannot understand what the lead was doing code-wise and cannot replicate the project from scratch (something my advisor told me I should be able to do). Instead, the lead would assign little bits and pieces to me and the other guy to complete, often putting in comments in the code what needed to be done and how to do it (like how some professors will do in their coding assignments). 

I’m only the third person to graduate from this new CS program being offered by the college.  I don’t really have anyone else from it I can talk to (like other people who have graduated from the program etc).  

At this point, I have no idea what to do. I can go to the temp agency and just start doing random assignments all around town doing data entry and then hope to eventually get hired full-time -- doing data entry, which is what I have been doing for most of my life. But I don't think that is going to get my anywhere as it hasn't in the past. I can continue to be unemployed, which looks bad to employers. I can do a bootcamp, which I have enough funds for due to working and saving from my various jobs in the past and living frugally. From some of the things I have read online, going to a bootcamp immediately after earning a CS degree says to employers that you did not learn enough from the degree to be able to get a job. At the same time, I have read about people who have CS degrees also doing bootcamps after graduating.  Thanks."

My degree is in computer science but the problem is, my gpa is HORRIBLE. I messed up a lot in my first couple of years, and in spite of good performance during my last 2 years (3.3 and 3.9 gpa) my overall gpa is 2.1/4. This has affected me in various ways. I am always super scared to apply for any job since I know I'll have to explain why my performance was so pathetic at the beginning. It's also the reason why even at 24, I have only ever had 1 job before - a 3 month stint as an ""ict guy"" at my granddad's friends' place where they had like, 3 computers and all I did was install office, antivirus etc. I am way too demotivated to do anything every time I think about my transcript, and it's been this way literally since semester 1 at uoft.

However, my family have been quite supportive of me and they have been pushing to me to try various things, including applying to other universities, for both masters and bachelors. Obviously, my masters applications have all been rejected due to the sheer number of fails I had in my first few years, even though I had 2 good LoRs in classes where I got 90+ but had C averages. But as luck would have it, I got into 2 unis - 1 for Bachelors of Accounting and 1 for Bachelors in Business &amp; Communication.

I'm willing to put my all and avoid my past mistakes, but my question is, can this actually help me? If, say, in theory, I do a 2nd degree, try my damnedest, and get 3.5+ gpa, would I still be able to get my career on track? Would employers accept that I will be a 28-29 year old fresh grad who has a pretty sparse resume except a good gpa? (and hopefully any internships i can get in the summers)

Any other advice is also appreciated, and thank you for reading!"

I'm a second year CS student at the University of Toronto, and I recently applied to a big company for both a 4-month and a 12-month internship position. 

I received a call from a senior engineer from that company about 5 days ago, and he informally gave me an offer to work there on a 12-month term in San Jose (I'm Canadian, so that offers Visa sponsorship). I asked him in the call if it was possible for me to do a 4-month term, and he said it was fine by him, but because of UofT's co-op policy, only a 12-month position was possible. I asked UofT's career centre, and they said through UofT only 12-month co-op could be arranged. 

I told him yes, I'm interested in the 12-month position and currently HR is going through the documentation to give me an offer. Is it okay to ask my recruiter to look into the possibility of doing a 4-month position, and if there is any way to get around working at this company through UofT?

aii7yl,3,2019-01-21,Thoughts about showing employers sample works,OnlyANorthernSong97,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aii7yl/thoughts_about_showing_employers_sample_works/,"I will be graduating this May from an accredited University in the northeast U.S. with a B.S. in Operations Management and a minor in Business Analytics.

The thing is, I really enjoy all of the business analytics/programming classes I've taken for my minor, and don't really enjoy the courses I've taken for my OM degree (or at least, not nearly as much). This already hurts my job prospects because I'm not necessarily applying for jobs that are closely related to my major- they're much more centered around my minor. To make matters worse, I shot myself in the foot last summer by turning down an internship offer (long story on that one). Regardless, I still have no relevant work experience.

That leaves me with one option to get a foot in the door of an analytics/programming company- 'publishing' (not sure if this is the right word) my work online. I am decent at R and SQL (MySQL) and am working on both everyday. I am by no means an expert, but I feel like I'm borderline well-versed enough in both to do entry level work with guidance (and hopefully I will improve with both between now and May).

I have two questions. The first is where would I publish any work/samples that I've done? I believe with R I could publish it to Kaggle? What about anything I do with SQL? And what types of things *would* I even publish with any work I've done with SQL?

The second question involves what I can or should publish. I've been following a book and coding along as I read it (*Analyzing Baseball Data with R* by Max Marchi and Jim Albert). Are the graphs/output I get from following this book capable of being put in a sample I show employers? I'm not talking about plagiarizing their work or claiming it as my own of course; I would give credit to both Marchi and Albert- but is this even allowed? And if I did do this, does it show employers that I have any real skills? in other words, is it even worthwhile to include graphics that someone else created? Obviously, I've been working through the examples (it's not like I'm just copying and pasting code into R) but I don't really know if putting them in a sample is permissible and/or advisable.

Any feedback would be of great value to me. Thank you!"

I've never worked with optimizing compilers and writing parallel code before. How useful will this be given that I intend to go into machine learning/software dev which'll in no way use C optimizations?

Should I leave this internship? I'm sticking it out because I'm hoping to get a good reco from the prof. But given his area of expertise lies in electronics and hardware, will it be useful? "

I will be graduating in June with a B.S. in economics and a minor in philosophy and I want to get as far away from where I currently am as possible. I grew up in the Bay Area of California and am going to college here as well. I’ve always wanted to live somewhere else, and as I get closer to graduation, I realize that it’s something I must do for the sake of my mental health and long-term growth.

I spent a semester abroad in Germany and absolutely loved it. I studied in a small city in Southwestern Germany, but I liked Berlin and other major European cities too. I still speak the German language conversationally to a point, but I am also open to learning another language or sticking to an English-speaking country. I travel pretty well and I feel like I can make a good effort to adapt to wherever I end up.

In terms of skills, I am competent in suites like Excel and R, and I have some experience with other programming languages such as SQL, Python, and C++.  Through economics, I’ve been exposed to econometrics and statistics courses as well. I would also consider myself to be a strong reader and writer. Overall, I feel like my skillset is pretty broad, if lacking in specialization. My interests include public policy, international relations, and law. Really though, I am open to pretty much anything that will get me out of here. Eventually, I plan on attending law school or grad school in some area like political science or philosophy. I’ve done well in school (I am slated to graduate magna cum laude) and have some internship experience.

I’m just looking for any kind of lead here. Which countries should I be looking at? Are my prospects for moving abroad good, or am I just delusional? 

Thanks, everyone!

I had some interest in programming and I knew how to code (loops, arrays, recursion, basic Java/JS syntax, OOP principles). After that I worked as an IBM BPM dev (low-code environment) for 2 years. For more than a year I've been working as a Junior Java (fullstack) dev for a relatively small (&lt;500 employees) consulting company. It's been rough initially, but I worked on my work ethic, communication, technical skills and generally tried quite hard to be as good employee as I could be.

The problem is that in December our boss informed that there will be no salary increases until end of our functional year, so April/May. This made me consider looking for a new job since I haven't seen a salary increase in my current company. So I interviewed at this nice company, but after spending over 10h in total on interviewing they came with an underwhelming offer and decided that they would classify me as an *intern*. Now, I won't accept the offer since it would make my CV look worse, but I'll try to ask them what they think about interviewing me again in 6 months when I'll be more prepared.

I know I should study more to master the concepts perfectly (and I will), but am I really in a position bad enough so that it's not surprising that a company would classify me as an intern?

(I have to admit I wasn't prepared that well for the interviews (and pen&amp;paper programming during last interview was a complete surprise), but I didn't expect this sort of outcome.)"

It has a better reputation (My current school is 300-400 the school I wanted to transfer is in the \~ 50's). However I started out at that school but because of poor grades moved to this one so my grades would be a bit low (with really great grades I'd could break into 3.0 territory). I currently work an internship doing IT support and some miscellaneous IT work that occasionally involves programming.

Finally, the upside is at this school although it has semesters that are one week shorter and easier assessments (especially the exams they're just like 2-3 pages on average sometimes they can be more) it is online and so when I find a dev job (and I am a capable programmer) after my internship I can finish my degree. At the other school it is not very amiable to people who are working full-time. Even if I study part-time there are assessments which require my attendance. I am due to graduate by the end of this  year. If I change schools then I will graduate likely by the end of 2020 if not latter (longer if I go part-time). 

My degree is accredited just lacking compared to other schools. Is it worth changing given the aforementioned costs, and could I make up the lacking education in my own time? Will it matter in the long-run as I see most CS grads only draw (like most other grads) upon 10-20% of their education and you end forgetting most of that stuff anyway.

MB: Gigabyte B360M Aorus Gaming 3

CPU: Intel i7-8700

RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 2666Mhz 16GB (2x8GB)

GPU: Gigabyte RTX2070 8GB Windforce

SSD: Samsung 860 EVO 500GB M.2

HDD: WD 1TB Blue (Re-using my current one)PSU: 750W 80+ Gold (Re-using my current PSU since I bought it 1-2 years ago)

Case: Corsair Carbide 275R Tempered Glass

&amp;#x200B;

My budget for the PC is roughly SGD$2000 (USD$1500). I will be using the PC primarily for gaming (WoW, Anthem, AC Odyssey, Division 2, etc.), with potential photo and video editing in the future depending on my internship or job that I land in the future.

Originally, I was going with an i5-8600 but I was considering the near future and decided an i7-8700 with hyperthreading might be better instead.

In a few days time I will be having a technical interview for Junior C Embedded developer, intern position.

Two months ago I have started to learn C from scratch. I could say I know my way around basic declarations, variables, I/O,  arrays, conditional statements, for/while loops, functions, bitwise operators and how they work etc. I still have to work on pointers.

&amp;#x200B;

Learnt some electronic basics. Know how to read a diagram, know what the components are and do, know how to solder a properly wire a circuit. Transistors still confuse me. Even got myself a breadboard and some components to mess around at home, then an Arduino UNO clone to get a taste of embedded programming. So far i'm REALLY loving all the stuff combined, however, I still have to learn a lot, and I think I'm missing some essential basics. And I feel like the Arduino is cheating, sort of... like the easy way in.

&amp;#x200B;

Some new terms I've learnt of lately are interrupts, interrupt service routine, I2C, SPI, UART, but I didn't fully grasp the concepts yet.

Another thing which comes to mind right now, I still don't get how a variable can be both const and volatile at the same time and what's the difference between static and const. When and why should I define a macro instead of using a const variable? Difference between void and non-void functions?

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE, note that I'm on the brink of switching careers, and I come from a field which has nothing to do with any kind of programming, so I'm learning these by myself at home, and with the help of a programmer friend, when he's got the time.

While for you these might be very 101 things, for me it's massive amount of information in a relatively short amount of time,  and I still have a long way to go.

This is sort of an Internship/Course, offered by a company, to which if I get in, in a few months time I will be qualified as a Junior C Embedded Dev. At least that's what they've told me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips and tricks? Thank you.

Obviously a pretty nice problem to have - just was wondering if Booth's wandering into the top 3 rankings was worth going with it over a slightly better fir at Kellogg.

Then, out of the blue, this IT company emails me saying they looked over my resume and thought I would be a good fit for the position. I receive a short phone call interview and I’m given two basic OOP questions. The second one I can’t recall at the top of my head so I tell them I don’t have the answer to that one. They tell me it’s okay but that during the on-site interview, I’ll have to explain these concepts with ease. **RED FLAG NUMBER 1**

I arrive to the onsite interview and I’m sat down with two interviewers and another one on webcam. It’s my first actual interview with software engineering so I have no idea what to expect. They first ask me a few more OOP questions which I can answer this time with ease because i studied up on them over the weekend. 

Then they ask me to link my github profile and I tell them I don’t have one set up at the moment. One of the interviewers looks at me like I’m nuts. Then they ask me to run a java file on Linux and I’m thrown off guard because I’ve never actually run Java in Unix, only C code. They end up telling me the answer and we move on. 

Then they ask me some questions about scrum and I’m tripping out because it’s the beginning of the semester and our team hasn’t started on a product backlog yet so I basically have to tell them we haven’t even done anything yet. Then they see macOS on my resume and ask if I’ve done any iOS or Mac development and I say no. 

This was basically the whole interview: me trying not to sound like a complete idiot to these software developers. As it was finishing up, I was fairly certain that I failed but at least I knew what to expect on my next one. 

Then this morning I wake up to an email offering me the position. What’s going on here?? Why would this company offer me an internship after I’ve failed so many of their interview questions? Why wouldn’t they offer a Hackerrank to weed me out first?

I am F, 23, from CT finishing up my degree in Computer Information Systems: Network Administration at a local community college. I work at the IT Help Desk in the computer lab at my school part time. Other than that, I do not have much job experience. 

Now seems like the best time to apply for paid Summer internships. I heard from my parents and friends that there are certain ""key words"" companies look for in resumes to select the most qualified applicants. Does anyone have resumes I can reference, guides to help me get started, or general tips on writing my applications? Most of these will probably end up being for insurance companies. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you."

I am a Computer Science major with a good GPA, but I am considering a Financial Engineering BS instead. I have yet to find an internship for the summer of 2019, but I am still actively looking. I have held a PWM internship at a large firm and CS research positions, but my applications to larger firms have been futile, most likely to me being a freshman. I had a few questions about ultimately breaking into quantitative finance:

1. Should I be aiming for more of a tech-related internship or work towards getting into IB/PE so I can transfer over to a hedge fund later on? I am pretty interested in analyst roles as well. 
2. And with that, how should I go about looking for freshman internships in the spring? 
3. If I wasn't able to land an internship, is there anything I should be doing besides personal projects?
4. I know networking is important, but I don't really understand how networking can leverage into getting a job and making meaningful connections, any advice?
5. Are there any essential math/finance/CS courses I should definitely take before junior/senior year?
6. What kind of internships should I be looking at for my sophomore/junior year? 

I know there isn't a specific path to getting a quantitative finance role, but I'd really love some advice to get me on a general route for success. Thank you for all the help!"

I feel a little lost; I have applied to around 60 to 70 software engineering internships and despite my efforts, I have received a whopping total of 0 offers. I've received around 30 rejections after the initial resume screen, probably moved onto an interview stage with 10 companies, and have been ghosted by the remainder. Most of the success I found in passing the resume screen with the 10 companies have been with underclassmen-specific programs with Big N, and I've only reached as far as a final round interview with them, only to be rejected shortly after. I've been applying to internships since August and have been preparing for technical interviews (despite not having completed a DS/Algorithms course until now) throughout the year. I just don't understand what it is, and frankly some companies that I've interviewed where my efforts seem promising only resulted in a discontinuation in my candidacy.  


But OP, why don't you apply to local and smaller companies for an internship, I'm sure you can find something there? The thing is, I have been and I've found myself interested in smaller companies more than some of the Big N everyone at my school talks about. I haven't found much luck there, and I feel like every time I get to the interview stage and end up arriving to a solution/answer effectively, I only get passed by the hiring committee as unqualified.   


I'm not sure what to do at this point. Sure, there are people on this sub who would contend that sophomores ""don't really have to have an internship"", but if the bar for hiring interns at any company, large or small, is so high right now, I can only imagine what recruiting season would be like for me next year if I were to remain without some real life experience. I guess I don't know what to do at this point; I've been burnt out just studying technical interviews in the pressure of tough core classes, and feel like at this point I should just drop it and hope for a better turnout next recruiting season. I'm not sure what direction I can go from here.

If you are so inclined, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I had little concern about my education in college. It's not that I didn't have any interest in Computer Science (B.A.), but that I had little interest in learning anything. I became what I dreaded most in High School - a passing student. Leaned more towards drugs and alcohol as a form of avoidance. Graduated with a 3.2 GPA and not a single internship within the field. I had little to no concept of a big picture plan in considering the value of a college education. I have certainly learned a lot (top 30 CSCI school) but not with the commitment/rigor that I expect of myself. 

Now that I'm facing the real world, a fire has been lit under my ass and my willingness to learn has suddenly returned. However, I lack direction. The only factor I feel I can take into account is salary which makes me more inclined to software dev. That and the satisfaction that I gained from getting through Calc BC in HS suggesting that more challenging problem solving would suit me (as opposed to troubleshooting web dev).

I'm getting through easy Leetcode problems in &lt;20 min (humble beginnings, I know) and CTCI is being delivered tomorrow. But I'm having a difficult time determining which would be a better avenue. My creative pursuits in the past (Motion Graphics/VFX) seemed fulfilling but mostly outside of the workplace whereas Math/Science felt more ""intellectually stimulating."" I question whether I could even get an internship for this summer and have only applied to the first 6 options found on LinkedIn.

Is there anyone who has been in this position that might be willing to offer their perspective?"
aix098,1,2019-01-23,"Raise/wage negotiation while still new, after prior increase that was supposed to be part of terms of hire but boss claimed it was for added duties at the time",inthemuseum,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/aix098/raisewage_negotiation_while_still_new_after_prior/,"I work in a VERY small nonprofit where I previously interned eight months, and I’ve been permanent for about eight months. As part of my terms of coming on, my boss and I agreed I’d start at $15 an hour then go up to at least $16.50 once a lease agreement was figured out, ostensibly so the board was less nervous to pay me more. This pay is with a degree and two years of relevant experience and beneath the low end of similar jobs in my field, though this place is among the smaller companies.

A couple months in, another employee left, so I took on a bunch of other duties that are fairly different from my expected ones. It means a lot of 180s from one project to another entirely different one that engages totally different skills. I’m qualified in both areas because I’ve diversified in my employment history, but I was definitely a Swiss Army Knife hire so they could fill many needs with one staffer. My title is suitably vague.

My boss came by my desk about three months in and said my wage went up to $17 an hour, in acknowledgement of my added responsibilities. No mention of what we agreed to, and I, like a dummy, didn’t argue because I was caught off guard and had honestly felt pretty put down by recent events (Another employee, hired between my internship and permanent hire, had been ruthlessly tearing me down for weeks, and we’d only just resolved it, but I still felt totally incompetent and like my work was subpar because my boss plays favorites and this nasty coworker was her favorite at that moment while I was left being like WTF.) Anyway - I essentially felt like I had no room to negotiate here because I felt like my work was seen as poor quality and like I’d gotten what we’d agreed to.

In the last few months, I’ve been busy as hell as things picked up more than they had by the time I got a little more money. I don’t have anyone who can help me, as I’m the only one with any training or background in either of the areas where I work in the company, and neither is something someone can just be trained to pick up and help with (eg. one is graphic design - just not something you can throw at the admin assistant). I’m not feeling particularly valued. The admin assistant, who has zero experience and no degree and isn’t even allowed to answer phones (I do), was given the same rate as me, and she has fewer responsibilities than I do and is part time. I learned this when my boss mentioned telling a complaining board member who wants to pay us less that “they [referring to me and the admin assistant] earn the admin rate.” Then today, I find out the other full-time employees are getting raises and discussed them in their annual reviews. These are raises on top of more recent raises they received.

Is it inappropriate to approach my boss about this now? My job now is far from what I signed on for, and I honestly would not have taken it for what it pays had the description reflected its current reality. And the fact I make the same as a PT coworker with fewer responsibilities and no experience is frustrating. I’m just unsure how to bring this all up. I don’t feel I can continue working here without saying anything and being valued more, but I’m supposed to get started on some big, longterm projects that do depend on my knowledge, and I either need to plan to square these projects to where they can be picked up again by someone else without my background or a new hire (if the board even LETS them replace me - which they probably wouldn’t, as I only got in because I impressed as an intern) or figure a way to not start something that will waste resources and time and never be finished because I’m just going to quit in a few months.

(I know I shouldn’t care that someone gets dumped with my project or that it dies if I quit, but this is nonprofit work. I care about the cause, not so much my boss or the company itself, and I don’t want to waste time I could spend doing the work I went to school and accepted nonprofit pay to do or waste resources on a doomed project.)"

I passed the courses and now I'm available full time. I want to contact them but also want to discover other job opportunities. Though they'll find out that I'm seeking other jobs. So what's the convenient way for me to let them know I want to contact with them and also explore other opportunities?

\-------------------

I know title sounds confusing. Situation is rather simple but I need your opinions. I am a final year CS student. This summer I completed one month internship. I liked the company and they liked me and offered me a part time job (3 days a week). 

I was willing to accept but I had 11 courses and I planned to take 10 of them in the fall semester. So I had no 3 days a week, they even offered 2 days a week which they don't usually offer to the candidates :D Though, my plan was to take the courses and they asked me to re-discuss this job offering after the fall semester ends.

I worked my ass off and passed 10 of the courses I took, and I don't even need to attend 11th; so I can work full time. I want to send a message to rediscuss but I also want to explore other opportunities in the job market. Though, via LinkedIn they'll find out I am seeking jobs.

So my question is, **when should I let them know I want to meet them? What's the appropriate way?**

aiz6i7,18,2019-01-23,Afraid previous employer may say negative things about me. What do I do?,dudenotrightnow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aiz6i7/afraid_previous_employer_may_say_negative_things/,"To begin, I've worked at 2 companies before. 1 (where I'm currently employed) is a really good experience and my boss is quite happy with my performance. However, my first internship was not a good experience for me. One of my colleagues did not like me for reasons that weren't clear to me and he said negative things about me to my boss (that I'm not competent enough to be a developer even though I fixed a lot of bugs). Unfortunately, instead of explaining my side of the story, I stayed quiet and hoped working hard and finishing more than what I was assigned would ""prove"" to my boss that I was a competent developer and not what my coworker was painting me out to be. I didn't understand that in the corporate world your boss is too busy to keep up with your day-to-day activities and communication is extremely important until it was time for him to give me feedback and many of the criticism he gave me were on things I already improved upon (I pointed this out to him, but I'm not sure if he'll remember). None of my the other people on my team had any problems with me but I don't know if I can list them as references since they weren't my boss.

Tl;dr I'm worried my old boss might say negative things about me due to my communication skills (which I've since improved upon) and his perceived impression of my skills. Another employer can vouch for my skills and so can my old coworkers or HR from my old job. The job I'm applying for is contacting *all* my previous employers and said their offer is conditional on their responses. What can I do in this situation?"
aiz9hd,1,2019-01-23,"Would these 2 websites incline potential employers/recruiters to hire foreign person with C2 Level English command, no experience and a Bachelor's degree from a foreign university?",Bozhidar95,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/aiz9hd/would_these_2_websites_incline_potential/,"Hey, I'm a 23 years old guy from Bulgaria who graduated university recently and lately I've been stressing about finding my first job. I'm not actively searching for jobs right now as I still haven't received and legalized my degree so I could use it in foreign countries but I am coding and working on my own projects which interest me on a daily basis.

Now my current goal is to straight up move to London or Dublin ASAP and try to find a job there since regrettably, Bulgaria, is not my cup of tea. Sadly, I have a couple of doubts that pester me on a regular basis:

* Firstly, Would employers bother to hire someone whose first language is not English? I have C2 English Proficiency based on the Cambridge English Proficiency (CPE) exam but am I no native speaker.

* Secondly, What would employers think of my Bachelor's degree from a Bulgarian university which they most likely have never heard of? Based on some universities ranking lists, my university is rated between number 2-5 in Bulgaria and 2500-4500 in the world. Honestly, I personally can't pass judgement whether it would be an advantage or not. At the end of the day I do have a piece of paper which proves that I have done my work to graduate (unlike some of my peers) but to employers that could be meaningless because they can't be sure whether I have actually learned something because the diploma is not from an esteemed university.

* Lastly, I have absolutely no professional experience yet. I've had 2 mandatory internships from when I was in University but they were rather short (like 2-3 months) and we didn't receive any document that could be used to show future employers that we've been to those internships. Frankly, this point worries me the least since everybody starts with no experience. This leads me to believe there are definitely employers who hire people with no experience IF you prove to them that you are willing to learn.

This is why I would like to hear your opinions on whether my 2 projects would impress future employers. One of those projects is already finished and I just need to fix the UI of the second one. I have a lot of other projects, however, they were used mostly for learning so they're not polished one bit so I frankly don't feel confident showing them on a resume or portfolio.

My first project is a CRUD system at its core which I have called ""**Artworks Showcase Platform**"". The interesting thing about it, is that I've been thinking about making such a website from before I even knew any back-end language and as soon as I started using Node.js and PHP, I began working on the core features. At the end I decided that at this point in life, I prefer working with PHP but Node.js was quite fun as well. It is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Laravel, MySQL. It has 3 base roles - Guest, User and Admin + the ability to add more roles if needs be.

I've made the website responsive through the use of media queries. The design is created using pure CSS without any frameworks. AJAX has been used quite a lot so that creation, deletion and edition of content can look seemingless. I've made it as SEO optimized as I could and most websites give me good score.



The second project on which I am currently working is named ""**Travel Diary**"". I started that project because I wanted to learn Vue.js, how to separate the front end from the back and how to use token authentication. It was build using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Vue.js, PHP, Laravel, MySQL AND Google Maps, Google Places and Geocoding API. Thanks to Vue.js it is a Single Page Application (SPA). 

The goal of this website is simple - After you register, you are sent to your profile page. There you can find a Google Map and whenever you click on that map, a marker is dropped on the clicked location. Then a record is inserted into the database that contains the latitude, longitude of the marker along with city, country and place_id associated with the marker. Based on those records in the table, you have  a page that displays all cities and towns that you have placed markers in. Whenever you click on a city, you're presented with a list of sights, museums, bars and so on and so forth based on your selected filters. Finally, whenever you click on a sight, museum, etc you get all the information about that place plus some images. It is a way of showing where you've traveled and what you've done on your travels

You can navigate to other user's profile and check out where they have placed markers

For now this is all the functionality there is, however, I intend to add some more stuff."

So, I'm going to ask an easier question this time and hope I can get some feedback! Anyway, since I've graduated I have had a difficult time finding a job, so I'm hoping the great people of Reddit can help me out!

First, a little background on my situation. I graduated in the Spring of 2018 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. About three-quarters of the way through my EE degree, though, I discovered that I enjoyed computer science/engineering classes far more than the classes I was currently taking. So, all the major electives I took were heavily involved in programming, and I also took the core computer science courses before finishing my degree, as well. I even landed a Software Engineering internship, which I've come to believe was more of a DevOps role, the summer before my senior year. I did all this hoping it'd help me land a job in Software Engineering, instead. It seems, though, that I am losing out on many job opportunities because I have absolutely no coding portfolio (I had no idea what this was until recently).

So, after looking into different ways of building a portfolio, I've landed on the following 2 options. 

* Taking ""classes"" from websites like Udemy, Udacity, &amp; edX
* Participating in open-source projects on GitHub

My preference would be the classes route so I can have reputable instructors who will help guide me and point out areas of weakness as I learn. Otherwise I'm afraid I might just be practicing bad coding habits and not making worthwhile contributions to an in progress open-source team/project. I'm just not sure if this is the ""smart"" route,

So, I'm hoping to find some people with experience in Software Engineering recruiting who would be able to tell me if these certificates, ""MicroMasters"", or ""NanoDegree"" hold up in a portfolio/on a resume? I don't want to spend money on these programs if a company will just shrug it off as a gimmick. Also, is it in my best interest to focus on the basics of software engineering (algorithms, data structures, agile development, etc.) when taking these programs? My preference would be to take AI/Robotics/Self Driving classes from theses websites, but I can put that on the back-burner if I need to. I know that is an incredibly competitive industry, and I understand I may need some industry experience first.

Thanks in advance for any help!"

However, I'm approaching the one-year-before-you-need-to-be-hirable point, and I'm currently staring into the abyss of serving coffee or bagging groceries until I'm 85 because, in a nutshell, I am not good enough. I started college as a comp sci major, switched to business for nearly two years, and ended up switching back (sort of) into the field by switching to Information Technology Management - I didn't want to throw my two years of business credits into the trash can, so I didn't change back directly to computer science. *Huge* mistake. From everything I've been told by friends in the industry/have read online, this degree is essentially no better than, say, a degree in French or Philosophy or Basket Weaving for actually getting hired as a software developer. So, in essence, my degree doesn't help at all, and I would probably have been better off just dropping out and going to code camp. 

My actual abilities in programming/understanding computer science, while definitely not zero, might as well be zero compared to the people who I will be competing against in the talent pool - kids who have been writing code since they were 13, with degrees in Computer Science that basically get them in the door automatically anyway. For context, my ability to actually develop software/apps is pretty limited - I've only been really learning for about 8 months. I'd say I'm at an intermediate level with Python (such that I'm able to make use of the standard library pretty effectively, write little programs/games like Connect Four that work), HTML5, and CSS/SCSS. I'm also familiar with relational databases. While I'm relatively new to Javascript and only started learning it recently, I have no doubt that I'll be able to learn that very quickly because, in essence, I understand the fundamentals of programming. Despite that I can list some things that I do sort of know, even entry-level, zero pay, slave labor, 'your job is to get me coffee' internships usually demand knowledge of things like Angular, Node, sometimes Bootstrap, ASP .Net, Android Studio/Visual Studio, other languages like C#/C++/Java and always, *always* demand at least two years of experience with these tools. Meanwhile, I haven't even made anything worth putting on Github, unless the goal is to humiliate myself.

Unfortunately, since I graduate in December, I don't *have* two years to get experience with all of these various languages, frameworks, and I don't have two years to spend building a portfolio. I *need* an internship this summer to even be hireable in the first place according to people in the industry/on the internet, and the time that I do have between now and then will be filled with 18 credits of classes so the amount of actual free time I can devote to cramming in the prerequisites of the internships is enormously limited. 

To resolve this set of problems, I've come up with a few different ideas on how to make myself more employable. The best ones that I've had so far are the following:

* Delay graduation by one semester by attaining a Computer Science minor, giving me at least some kind of degree-based credibility and more time to study and learn.
* Drop out of college, go to code camp, and get a job since the degree is more or less useless anyway
* Concede that I'm not good enough and just get some shitty job in IT restarting old people's computers

So, now that I've kind of outlined my position, what do you guys recommend that I do? 

**Tl;dr**: I have a useless degree. I am not good at programming. I want to be a web developer when I graduate this upcoming December, and I want to get an internship this summer, but I am not talented/knowledgeable enough to accomplish either. What do I do?"

I'm sure many people have experienced this ""quarter life crisis"" before and hopefully some of you can relate. I haven't been fortunate enough to form a mentor-mentee relationship with someone experienced in the field so reddit has basically been my mentor that I go to for advice.

The things I do know are that I enjoy math and statistics and analysis in addition to computer science so naturally I want to further study data science and artificial intelligence.  I was especially inspired after watching this [Ted Talk by Rajiv Maheswaren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ko_cWSHBU) from Second Spectrum that introduced me to the use of AI in basketball analytics. Sports is something that I occupy the majority of my free time with so a career in sports analytics would be a dream for me. Upon watching more similar videos and doing research, I see the term ""data scientist"" coming up a lot. However, this term is a bit vague for me and based on my research, I only understand it on a broad scale since I've had minimal exposure to the field. I understand that I will probably need to pursue a graduate degree to get into this field.

With this post, I'm hoping that you can ""teach me to fish"" so to speak, as in provide ways I can use to find out answers on my own. For example, what are some specific resources you use besides the obvious ""what is data science"" google search? What are some books that can steer me in the right direction? How can I find out about the different jobs that fall under the umbrella term of ""data scientist"" and their requirements? What kind of internship opportunities or entry level jobs do I need to look out for to gain experience? Any answers would be really appreciated. I would especially love to hear the responses from those who have experience in this area. Thank you for taking your time to read this."

The class is late in the evening, 6:00 to 9:50 , so I am considering doing internship as well (currently interviewing at few companies). How difficult I can expect this to be? I will only go for internship if they give me part-time option . Also , if I don't get internship, is it doable to do 206 and 440 (intro to AI) together in summer?"

All my other classmates were able to get jobs, although most of them worked in Tech but still get paid well, while I'm still at a dead end.

I would be doing integration using Dell Boomi which requires 0 coding since it is just an integration tool which I will have to learn.

 Now I love coding and I would love to start my career as a software engineer. The other team in the same company is doing Salesforce, if I want to transfer later I would have to compromise with Salesforce.

I am afraid that If my first job would be on that direction, then I will would have a hard time transitioning to a position as a developer since I would essentially have 0 coding experience.

Also the salaries for these kind of fields is lower than of that of software engineers, and I am not sure about what kind of demand there is in the market.

Essentially the past 3 years of college have been very spotty, huge issues with depression and mental health, just got diagnosed with ADHD in September. Since Sept. my life has turned around in every aspect. Friends and Family say I seem happy again, I can focus on reading, I can focus on homework, I noticed a 500% increase on my notetaking abilities...

So this internship requires a 3.0 or higher, I have a 2.917. It's because there are 2 classes I got D's in, over freshman and sophomore year. Junior year I withdrew from a class and did poorly (C's) in some others because of a suicide attempt and going to the mental hospital.

It's so frustrating to know that if I had my mental health figured out back then I would get this job. But I don't think I'm going to get it now, and I don't know what to do. 

My previous grades and cumulative GPA say nothing about my actual ability, work ethic, and knowledge. Obviously my resume was good enough, my interviewing was good enough, everything else is good enough, to get the job offer. So clearly the engineers all think I'm proficient enough to get this internship in a very competitive field.

I don't know what to do, anyone been through a similar experience? I really need advice on what to do. I scheduled an appointment with my academic adviser tomorrow.

Edit: Letter says: 

&gt;If we learn that your cumulative GPA has fallen below the required 3.00
at any point prior to your start date, your offer will be withdrawn; if we learn that information after your
start date, you will be dismissed from your internship immediately"

I recently started an internship at a large company 3 weeks ago doing Software QA and I have no idea what I'm doing. 

The lady training me always works from home so she communicates with me over the corporate messaging system or phone, but she barely responds meaningfully or answers my questions. I have never done this kind of work before, so all the software and stuff is brand new to me. 

I've been given code to test from a developer and it's already been 5 days and I'm only done half of the cases I'm supposed to test, with no idea how to do the rest. The lady training me said she doesn't know how to test them either (she's only been here for a couple of months and is leaving the company in a week), and she told me to talk to ask some of the developers (because all the other testers use completely different software). I've tried, but they brush me off and tell me to ask the lady training me instead, even though she doesn't know either!

I've brought up my concern to both my manager and my team lead, and they both said don't worry I will get it with time, and that the training I am currently receiving is poor. But this doesn't change the fact that the project manager, other team leads, and other members of the project are expecting me to start performing and completing tasks like they are, and soon I'm going to start getting questioned on what's taking so long. 

I'm really stressed and worried, I honestly don't love this job and I get worried going into my daily team meetings because I always say I'm working on the same thing when everyone else is moving fast. I want to at least finish the internship and not get fired, but if I don't improve my performance, I don't know what will happen. Does anyone have any tips?"

I've always felt under-qualified for this job, all of my coworkers are so smart and I feel like an idiot compared to them. I'm still learning the code base and the way things work around here, and I understand that it's okay to make mistakes, but I feel like I screw up way more than the average new developer, and other new devs know what they're doing WAY more than I do. I feel like I don't know the code base as well as I should, and I don't push high quality code either. My manager hasn't brought anything up to me in our 1 on 1s, in fact he says the opposite. He even put me on an important project and told me I ""earned it"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Today was an important day, the project we've been working on was pushed out to customers at 4pm. At 1am this morning, I got a message from the QA for the project with a laundry list of bugs that were all my fault that needed to be fixed by 4pm. This was for code I pushed over a month ago. Her messages were rude and condescending, and I discovered that several of the ""bugs"" she found were due to her not reading the jira tickets closely enough so she was looking at the wrong thing. But there were a few bugs that were my fault. Nothing major or anything really impacting functionality, just small UI things mostly that were due to me being a dumbass and not reading the use case close enough. In my defense, this was the first task where I had to refer to the convoluted use case document, before this I was just doing bug fixes. I got them fixed and apologized profusely, and the whole team was aware of my fuck ups, which was super embarrassing. The QA (who I'm convinced has it out for me and thinks I'm stupid) made sure everyone knew about ""\[my name\]'s bugs"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 1 on 1 with my manager tomorrow and I'm thinking about discussing this screw up and my issues with this certain QA with him. I will definitely try harder in the future to make less mistakes, because I'm terrified of this happening again, but I also know that it probably will happen again. I'm scared that after this he's lost his confidence in me as a dev. Is it normal to screw up things like this? I feel like everyone else on my team pushes perfect code and I'm constantly being told I'm doing things wrong.  "

I got bullied on by the other kids and watched them get adopted before me. I didn't know much about my parents except they we're druggies. My sperm donor wasn't in the picture and my mom died of a heroin overdose when I was a week old according to what I was told. I was born with it in my system. No ten year old needs to know what that is.

I did get adopted though. I just turned Eleven. An middle aged farmer picked me and my luggage up in an old red F100. The seats had a few tears. It had a cassette player with a knob missing and some rust everywhere. You could hear it clicking from the tail pipe. I questioned how Brenda (runs the orphanage) could let a person who didn't seem to have a lot of money adopt me.

""My name is Clyde."" He said while spitting out Levi Garrett in a paper cup. ""I'm Harry.""

""The hell you are. You got a buzzed head."" He crackled while rubbing the top of my head. I guess this won't be so bad. My new dad seems to joke around.

We pull up to a huge farm. Corn stalk for acres on acres. He had a pretty decent sized house that was white. It needed some paint. He had a lot of people working in the fields. I was too happy to see they were not.

""Most successful corn farm in Nebraska"" he said pridefully. He took me on and carried my luggage. Which was just a tooth brush and a few sets of clothes. My room wasn't too big. It seemed cozy though. It had a twin sized bed, a closet, and a little desk. 

""It's not much. But it will do. Maybe we can go get you a baseball and some toys.""

""I'd love that!"" I was eager. I mean all the other orphans would steal my toys when they'd leave. It wasn't fair.

Later that night at dinner I asked him. ""For you to be running the most successful farm why don't you have a nicer truck or a bigger home?""

""I have what I need. Not what I want."" He said while chewing up his fried chicken he made. 

I hear the front door open and hear a TV turn on. It didn't sound like footsteps bit more like can shaking
 I turn around and see a scarecrow on the couch looking at the TV.

He had a sack cloth face and drawn on eyes. His mouth was sewn. Old overalls and a red flannel shirt.

""That's funny. Who knew you had pranks."" I told Clyde.

He took a sip of water. ""No son, that's your uncle.""

I turn around and the scarecrow turned his head to me. I couldn't even scream. I didn't know what to think.

""How about me and you go get that baseball? Clyde said. Of course I agreed and followed him out. ""Now Jim, we will be right back."" He stared at me as I walked out.

About a mile or two later he speaks. ""He used to be my brother. Jim that is...he died in an accident when he was about your age. He fell in a table saw. My dad said he knew a person he could take him to. She took his heart and placed it in the scarecrow. So Jim is alive in it. He helps us work by standing in the field. I know it sounds weird but you can never tell anyone.""

I didn't wanna go back to the orphanage so I knew I had to play a long. I mean Clyde gave me a home. I mean Jim left me alone anyway. I felt so disturbed shaking his hand though and introducing myself. I live comfortably though. I even got him a brown hat he wore for Christmas. 

Around the Summer of me turning twelve I went outside to play. I would throw the ball in the air and hit it with my Louisville slugger.

""Oof."" I heard in a field. I ran over to see if I hit one of the employees. Luckily it just landed next to him. I ran over to grab the ball and he didn't seem to happy.

""Sir I'm completely sorry. It wont happen again.""

He grabbed me and leaned in close. ""Get out of here. Before Jim gets you."" He looked up real quick to make sure Jim wasn't on post duty. ""Listen to me. Run away. None of the employees want to be here but he will kill us if we quit.""

He seen Jim walking back to his post and he got on all fours and snuck off to another area to pick more corn. Jim propped up on his platform and turned his head to me.

""Hey Jim, heh heh. I found the ball I was hitting."" He turned his head back and was observing. I knew I about made the biggest mistake of my life. I asked Clyde a bad question.

""Had uncle Jim killed anyone?"" He spit out his drink and started going into a cussing rampage. He shouted for me to go to my room and never discuss Jim like that.

I woke up the next morning and went to school. Sat down at the lonely kids like table with my milk and sandwich and seen a kid crying hysterically. The officers and principal helped the kid walk towards the office. I walked over to a kid sitting next to where he was and asked what happened. My stomach sank. ""Ya know that big corn farm down the road? His dad was found hanging from the barn platform. He killed himself."" 

I went home to ask about what happened and they kept telling me he was crazy. Nut I knew Jim did it. The last year I lived there was rough. Clyde hit me every so often and they made me do hard labor. I woke up most nights to Jim laying next to me watching me so I wouldn't leave.

I packed my things early one morning when Jim wasn't in bed. I tried sneaking out but got dizzy. I fell down when I walked out of the room. I felt a huge pinch in my neck. I woke up the evening in the barn.

It Stunk in there. It was surrounded with hay and I couldn't move. I was strapped in.  Clyde walked in.

""We had such a good thing going you unlovable orphan."" Jim walked behind him as he continued. ""Let me tell you this. Brenda knows. Every few years I buy one of you shitheads and see if Jim likes them. He hasn't liked any. Some got sent back and some will never be found."" Apparently Brenda was the daughter of the witch who did this.

""What does it mean if he likes you.""

He took a hit from his rolled cigarette. ""Jim didn't get a normal childhood. And he loves you. We're going to switch your body's."" I tried screaming but it wouldn't work. ""Jim gets to be a boy and you get to be stuffed with hay."" He pulled out some hay and a knife. I close my eyes knowing this is the end. I know this had to happen to kids before me.

I hear a loud bang. I open my eyes to see an employee holding a shotgun. Clydes head was missing. I feel blood spraying on me and Jim. He cocks the gun shoots Jim. It was like a rag doll being tossed. He flew in the wall. He untied me and screamed to run as another employee had a truck waiting to go. I sprinted with the man as o jump on the back of the f100. The house was set ablaze. As well as the corn. I turn to thank the man but see him laying down dead. He had a pitchfork go through the back of his head. The man in the truck speeds out while I cry.

Uncle Jim wasn't fast enough to catch me but he followed us for a while. Eventually I was able to get to the front of the seat and hear the story. Thirteen employees have went ""missing"" in the past seven years alone. And three other kids. The man explained we could go live with his parents in California while we work everything out.

So here we are now. I just turned thirty seven and own a multi billion dollar security business. I had my name changed. And the man who saved me lives comfortably with his now wife and four kids. I didn't marry however. I even made sure Brenda's orphanage got shut down amd gave all the kids homes around here with loving families.

I have people searched before they enter my home and business. Which I get a lot of ladies coming in if you catch my drift.

Today was bad though. My assistant brought in a young college intern to learn some ropes. I shake his hand. His hair was stringy and very pale looking

""Hey there. My name is David. I've been running this place for a long ass time. What's your name.""

He smiled wide eyed with a sinister grin.

""Hello Harry, my name is Jim."""

This past summer I was able to intern at a popular company as a web developer. Going into the internship I was super excited. It was my first time actually coding for a job at a big reputable company, so I was absolutely ecstatic about doing web development there. By the end of the internship, I was given a full time offer! Feeling confident that I was able to score any sort of software engineering job after college and since I had enjoyed my time there doing web development, I accepted. However, many months have passed and I have since been discovering **a lot** of new CS topics that intrigue me. For instance, I recently took a graphics course and had a blast learning about VR, coding up 3D environments, and researching its many scientific applications. And this semester, I'm taking a course on more advanced mobile development and am having such a fun time doing it. Only now, I can't help but wonder if I made the right decision accepting the offer at the company I interned at. I know there is so much more to learn in web development and it can be a really enjoyable coding experience, but these other CS topics continue to intrigue me and make me wonder if it's something I could be more passionate about. What should I expect returning to the company I interned at, given my recent findings? Is this a common concern in the industry? Could it be that I chose the wrong CS field? Or am I just over-analyzing my decision? I really look forward to any experiences or advice on this. Thanks in advance."

aja4m4,4,2019-01-24,"New international grad, no luck applying to SE/CS roles, considering just going down IT path because of time constraints",ArticAce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aja4m4/new_international_grad_no_luck_applying_to_secs/,"TL;DR: International student not finding much luck CS career-wise, but finding opportunities in IT. With work authorization period fast approaching, should I continue to apply or just bite the bullet and take my open offer in IT?

I'm a recent graduate from a US university with a degree in CS. I finished with a 3.5 GPA and a couple of small projects under my belt. I haven't had much luck with any engineering internships or roles I've applied to over my college career, landing only a student IT job and another IT internship, nothing to do with actual programming. My job search hasn't really been fruitful either. The closest I got to getting a role was as a Developer Support Engineer, but got rejected at the last round after meeting senior management despite having a good conversation with them. I'm still continuing to apply, but safe to say I'm a little discouraged from the lack of responses.

On the other hand, I've been applying to a couple of IT roles and have received a few offers already. My most recent offer today is what sort of spurned me to ask this question. While I don't mind the helpdesk support roles, I feel a bit of guilt about not using my degree, as well as get stressed over the pay cut. $20/hr is okay, but it pales in comparison to getting a job as a developer, and with high cost of living in my area, it'll definitely be awhile before I can safely move out of my family home.

The biggest clencher is that I'm also an international student and my work authorization is set to begin soon, and if I stay unemployed within the next few months, I face deportation. In my mind I have two decisions I can make: continue to apply and risk getting booted from the country, or settle for a lesser paying job and delay my CS career.

With all my bitching out of the way, what do you think is the best course of action? Is there any way I can start at a help desk and then make a lateral move towards a programming position later on while on the IT career path? Maybe there's a role that might fit my current background? (CS degree/IT work experience)

Thanks for reading my stressed out rambling, any advice is appreciated!"

But I'm really struggling with lack of self esteem, doubt in my abilities, basically what is described as impostor syndrome. I'm worried I'll never be good at a future job and should be just happy that my current employer is satisfied with my work. The lack of self confidence is hindering me from perusing better opportunities in life. I think maybe the main issue is fear of failure so I always go for things where I'm absolutely sure I will do well. 

On the other hand, when I compare myself to people I personally know, I feel like I'm better than them. I was top of my class in high school, finished my masters with an excellent grade. During my internships, I have always heard from my managers that I was better than other interns or that I'm as good as experienced employees. If I compare myself to my coworkers, I feel like either I'm equally qualified or sometimes more qualified to do their work. This superiority feeling makes me feel really guilty and arrogant not self confident. 

Have you experienced similar feelings and how did you manage to get over them, enough to not let them affect your life negatively?  In summary, I'd really love to just be a confident person, to get rid of both my feeling of superiority as well as my low self esteem. "

I'm an international student who just got an offer from UNSW to study Computer Science.

Ive heard great things about UNSW CS but I would like to hear some of your opinions to help decide if I should take up the offer.

1. How internationally recognised is UNSW (particularly in North America)? It's kinda my dream to work all over the world and I also plan to do postgrad in the US, so international recognition for my degree is very important.

2. Will I have time to do an internship with the new Trimester system? It seems like most internships are 2 months minimum but we only get 3 weeks break in between terms.

3. How's the job market for CS students/grads in Australia? Is there an internship crisis or a lack of jobs in general for CS students?

Today thanks to the help of one of my professors, I had the chance of getting an interview for an internship at a local hospital's biochemistry lab. Thankfully they seemed to like me and wanted to give me a chance to work on their data. They didn't ask me for any specific task, so I have the freedom to think about any kind of project that would mutually benefit both me and them and I will hopefully have their support on whatever ""project"" I come up with. I'm very happy and eager to learn about data science but as a newbie in this field I need you guys' guidance on what I can do. 
- The hospital is a public hospital in a developing country, and I’ve noticed that they are mostly using older technology for their data related work (storage and analysis). I will have access to their patient data to some extent, which I imagine could be fed to some machine learning-driven system to aid them in their analyses? Maybe there’s some new software I can introduce to them that may boost their quality of life in terms of the way they handle their data?

- I’m open to all kinds of advice, thank you for your time in advance."

All three career paths sound interesting to me, but I know that I want to be in the best position to start off my career. I'm leaning toward the equity analyst position at the moment, but I'd love to hear any input that you guys might have.

I don't like Florida, I grew up in North Caroline but moved to FL when I was 13. I've never liked the scenery in FL and I miss seasons, mountains, Forest, etc.

I've been making some connections in FL, but the job market isnt great in SoFlo. My family and friends are here too. I just never felt at home in Florida and want out. Ive gone back and forth on this for over a year. Move and I lose all connections, stay and keep connections that will probably lead to internships or entry level jobs.

If I stay and get ""planted"" in FL I'll always wonder if I should have moved, but If I move I may miss my friends and it may push my career back. I've saved enough money to make a move feasible. My brother and his wife are moving to Colorado this year and there has been a lot of talk of me moving in with them after I graduate.

Im really into nature, hiking, biking, etc and really just want to move up north somewhere with seasons, mountains, etc.A lot of people think my FL is great and If I moved i'll end up back because of the cold.

This is probably a dilemma a lot of people face when graduating. Any advice? If I'm going to move is makes sense to do it right after I graduate so I dont get ""tied"" down in FL.

&gt;  I agree that, during my employment with the Company and for a six-month period following the date my employment ends, I will not, directly or indirectly seek or accept employment (or a partnership or consultancy relationship) with any entity that competes against the Company with respect to the type of software or services that I was responsible for marketing, selling, servicing or developing during the last year of my employment by the Company.”

The company has a lot of fingers in a lot of pies, and the duties I'd be assigned in this internship would be fairly broad. Since the internship ends in mid-August, this clause seems to mean that I would be functionally unable to look for employment until march 2020! That's just a few months before graduation!

So two questions:

1. Is this industry standard, and if so how do most people handle this kind of restriction when looking for a job senior year of college?

I have depression and anxiety, and I just feel like everything is really adding up and I'm not sure how to go about it. I finally got a lot of my school work done, and finished 5 finals, and I took my written for driving and now I have to take the skills test. Last week my grandma from my biological mom's side passed, and my cousin came back into my life. She causes a lot of anxiety for me and really only comes into my life to talk about drama and try to get reactions out of me, kinda of like some kind of Jerry Springer episode. She told me she was getting married, I've met the guy once, she asked while drunk, and I don't really agree since I feel they haven't been dating long enough. But she's decided I'm her maid of honor due to an agreement we made when I was 5 and she was 7. I don't currently have a job, or a car to help her with anything, and I feel like she's trying to make me push everything in my life out of the way for her. While I tried explaining I'd like to work ahead in school to graduate early (I do online classes, and I have no set graduation date so I can work at my speed.) and try to find a job and get my license and everything, to start my life. She doesn't seem to really care what I do, and my step grandma is at the same time trying to push me to do an internship program to earn a 200 dollar scholarship, while also trying to push me to work at Ross? I'm not really sure how to organize my life right now, and I just feel confused and lost, nor do I feel like anyone listens to me. How do I go about everything? Where do I start??"
ajja3w,1,2019-01-24,Time for a change.,parthpatel96,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ajja3w/time_for_a_change/,"I’m not going to get to personal with this, basically 5 years was enough being a mechanic. I started when I was 18 and now I’m 22. I had a passion for cars and well it just went out the window.

When I was younger I loved tinkering with computers, but networking fascinated me the most. So when the New Year Began, I set out to find something that will help me further my knowledge on Networking, and I happened to land on a website called Cybrary. I’ve completed 2 sections (cause I work nearly 60-70 hours a week) so I’m doing this on my own time and I’m already kicking my ass for not doing this from the get go.

My question is, this is a 36 hour online course, once I complete this or as I’m completing this is there anything I should start doing? Internships? Filling out applications? 

I did go to a Community  College to become a certified mechanic for said brand, and received my Associates Degree in Associate in Science. A lot of people have been telling me I need to go back to college, but I’m going to be  honest, I can’t do the class thing anymore, I’m capable of learning hands on and first hand experience.

Some have also told me, you can start at the bottom (help desk) and slowly work your way up to becoming a network engineer, getting all my certificates and such along the way. I just need some guidance, I don’t see myself being a mechanic starting next year. 

I just really don’t know how to go at this, I need some guidance.."
ajjhqk,4,2019-01-24,Tracking production goals live?,ODE_is_killing_me,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ajjhqk/tracking_production_goals_live/,"I am an intern that has been tasked with setting up displays on the production lines that show how close the shift is to meeting its production goals, which operators are producing the most, how one shift compares to another, etc. My company has an intranet database that stores all this information, but my programming knowledge is limited, so my options to get and manipulate the data are limited to excel at this point. Most of the engineers I work with use excel web queries to get the information they need. Only one or two know SQL. Recently, I have been doing web queries in excel and using this data and a little power query and pivot tables to create the graphs that I need. At some point I plan to somehow put them into a power-point that would update every so often.

I have learned a lot about excel so far, but it's very tedious and frustrating. I often have to deal with several thousand lines of data and use pivot tables to be able to get the information I need in a form I can use. I need to get these graphs automated so that they update often with the newest information.

Is there a better way to go about doing this? Is there another resource that would be useful in my scenario? I've looked and Microsoft Power BI, but I'm not sure if it's really suitable for what I need."

ajjrt8,2,2019-01-24,Can a hiring manager or recuriter contact your adviser about how bad you interviewed?,sheeptopia,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ajjrt8/can_a_hiring_manager_or_recuriter_contact_your/,"So, I have a really smart doctorate graduate student friend who recently had her first computer science interview for an internship in a long time. She doesn't interview well at all and wasn't able to answer things she would know. The recruiters asked for her adviser and now is freaking out about them contacting the adviser and losing her funding. She is scared of being revealed as an imposter based on how much she bombed the interview. She suffers from a lot of imposter syndrome issues. 

First of all, is this even ethical for a recruiter to do?   And any thoughts about this scenario?"
ajk0ce,0,2019-01-24,I'm afraid I won't propely showcase my personal projects during a jobhunt,samsop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ajk0ce/im_afraid_i_wont_propely_showcase_my_personal/,"I'm 6 months away from graduating with a BS in CS. I've worked on tens of personal projects over the past 2 years, published one web app that over 3 thousand students at my school use to track class attendance, managed several dev teams for AWGs on campus, and worked several freelancing gigs. I am not humblebragging (in fact none of this feels sufficient because impostor syndrome still holds me back). 

My fear is I won't be able to properly showcase these projects to a potential employer, and it will all be a waste. What if a client ceases to pay hosting fees for their website? What if I cease to pay for my own? How can I put them on my résumé then? What if an interviewer assumes I'm bullshitting? 

My point is I feel like I'm about to waste a year looking for a job because I can't demonstrate any provable experience apart from 2 internships under my belt. What is it that you do in order to document your work and present it to a potential employer as proof of competence? I'm very anxious about this. "
ajk2zk,1,2019-01-24,Not happy,Sai-008,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ajk2zk/not_happy/,"So lately life’s been going pretty well for me. I secured two Internships for this year. One of them is at a top 2 firm in their industry. I’m passing all my classes and I am projected to graduate on time. I have a great set of friends that pretty much feels like a family. With my actual family everything’s fine we are more than financially stable and have not had any issues recently . So pretty much everything that can go right is happening.However idk why but when I’m alone I don’t feel happy. Like most people would be happy to be  in this situation but idk I can’t figure out why I’m not happy. I tried thinking about it myself maybe it’s my physical health, I had to take step back from working out since I got busy with school or maybe it’s cause I’m single . These  are just thoughts of mine but I’m pretty sure their not it . So I was wondering if anyone else felt like this and how they got out of it.

ajk3jh,1,2019-01-24,What do I do if I have a friend/co-worker who creates problems at work?,Lindts,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ajk3jh/what_do_i_do_if_i_have_a_friendcoworker_who/,"So I recently started interning at a small CPA startup firm. I have two friends that intern with me (we'll call them AL and Y). AL is a great gal who's been working with me and we get along great, both in class and at work. Y is another student who is a year ahead of us and has been having issues at work.

So right now is busy season for accountants (after all, someone has to help prepare and file those tax returns!). Because of busy season, this is when most interns get internships. Everyone needs help. We're all lucky we get to work together, and we thought it was going to be great. Except Y has made it into a somewhat toxic workplace.

So Y has many issues with work.

1. He hates doing taxes, which is fair because it's not for everyone and it can be boring. Except, as I pointed out to him, he knew what type of internship this was and he signed up for it.
2. He talks crap about our boss whenever possible. For example, he'll say IN THE OFFICE things like ""Oh, \_\_\_\_\_ won't last in this industry"", ""He doesn't even know what he's doing"", ""The guy is all messed up"", ""This guy can't do shit right"", etc. And while I believe anyone is entitled to their opinion, no one should ever talk crap about their boss in the work place. It's not professional and it honestly feels like it's putting me and AL into a bad zone. Like we are both worried that our boss will walk in and hear Y say something bad and we'll get lumped in with him when we have nothing but respect for our boss.
3. He's not productive and does the least amount of work. Me and AL are taking our first tax course this semester, but we've caught on fast and do 95% of the work and get things done ASAP. We're trying to be efficient because we both want to make the most of this internship. Y has taken both individual and corporate tax courses, so he should be doing better than us. Instead, he does the work slowly and does not try to do better at all. This last point isn't really relevant, but in the sense that if he were to be fired or he quit, it wouldn't change much because me and AL already do most of the work and have no problem taking on more.
4. Getting paid. First paycheck, Y complains that he's not being paid right. Me and AL already know we were paid correctly for the amount of hours we worked and don't see the issue. Y says that he's being paid minimum wage, which is impossible because we're all paid the same amount, which is quite a bit more than minimum wage. Also, he claims that he worked 24 hours during the pay period. I know for a fact that he did not because the paid period was 12/31-1/13. During that time, Y only worked 3 days, in which he worked 18 hours (the hours he was paid for). We're paid bi-weekly, so it sucks, but you do get paid for the work you do. No one is getting cheated. I tried to explain to him that he must have gotten it wrong, but he insists and was quick to say our boss can't do anything right, etc. Basically, he was quick to talk crap about our boss AGAIN.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why Y is being like this. I really don't. But I do know that AL and I don't appreciate him being unprofessional in the work place and potentially getting us in trouble. We have no idea what to do. I did try to tell him maybe he should quit since he obviously doesn't like working there, doesn't like our boss, and isn't productive here at all. Other than that, we can't really think of ways to get rid of him or do anything besides hope he'll learn to shut up and keep his opinion to himself.\\

Edit: 

I just wanted to add that I don't think I can even be friends with Y anymore because it's more than this too. I constantly hear him talk crap about our boss who was, in my opinion, brave enough to stop being a corporate slave and start his own firm. That takes a lot. You let go of a steady paycheck and risk your financial future. I really admire my boss for that. My boss also has over 20 years of experience being a CPA, so I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing. Y has not even graduated yet; he'll be graduating this spring. However, he hasn't secured a job yet (which is sad because many of his classmates were able to secure a job in Big 4 or a job at a regional firm, and they also qualify to sit for the CPA exam because of extra credits), he hasn't accomplished anything. So for him to talk crap about someone who's clearly above him is too much for me. Y constantly acts as if he knows everything since we started working together and it's so annoying to me personally because if he's so smart, where's his firm? Where are his clients? Where's his CPA license? Where's his degree? It's tough swallowing this pill every time I work with him. "

ajmek4,1,2019-01-25,MSW practicum student needs help!,MSWstudentneedsanswe,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/ajmek4/msw_practicum_student_needs_help/,"I am in my first of a two year master in social work program. First semester field placement was very stressful with difficult practicum/field supervisor. She can be nasty. Insulting. Rude. Yells. No one in the agency likes working with her. I went for help at school practicum office and was told I needed to work it out with her and I did. I worked hard and got an A. However, this second semester (with same supervisor) started out really badly. It’s only getting worse. She is manipulative and angry that I won’t work additional hours at her discretion. Told me she needs me to cover for staff members who are away. I am an unpaid intern and can’t work for free and pay expensive parking. Only obligation is to work two days per week per our original agreement. Frankly, I left an important task undone last week as I wouldn’t work longer hours than what I was scheduled. Technology wouldn’t cooperate either which was partially to blame. She was furious.

How do you go about it?,Herrowgayboi,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ajmzn4/is_there_ever_a_good_time_to_start_looking_for/,"I'm currently a student who is pursuing a BS in CS. In the mean time, for the past 7 months, I have been working for the state(CA) as an intern web developer. The work given to me is... okay. Sometimes they give me a project that is extremely exciting, but more often than not, they usually give me the bottom of the barrel kind of work, where the work is extremely tedious, as I feel like a highschool kid with basic HTML knowledge and copy/paste could do it. It almost feels like i'm wasting my degree... And the pay, is okay... At $15/hr, I feel like I am not getting paid enough, especially compared to what my peers are making for a similar type of job. It definitely is better than nothing though...           

With that said, the manager, employees(specifically my team) and I have a very strong connection with each other, so much so that the manager and chief have asked me if I would take a job under them once I got my degree. Furthermore, my manager and employees(team) have become very close friends. I feel like trying to find another job without saying anything would be kind of disheartening to both of us...      

Don't get me wrong, I feel excited to go to work because I get to work with my manager and team, but rarely feel excited to make progress on the projects given to me since they are so tedious.   

So...   

Is there ever a good time to start looking for another job? 
If so, How do you go about it, if you have such a good connection with your current employer/employees?    

Also, OT... is it bad to look for another job within 7 months? Would that be a red flag to future employers?

ajn3ml,2,2019-01-25,Is this program a good fit for me?,NearbyAuthor,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/ajn3ml/is_this_program_a_good_fit_for_me/,"Background: 

I am a recent undergraduate from UT Austin with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have above a 3.0 GPA but less than a 3.5 GPA. I graduated in December 2017.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at a notable Enterprise Tech Company in Austin working as a Full-Stack Developer (React/Node). I have been working for 1 year so far, with 3 prior SWE internship experience.

My interests are in Web/Mobile Development. I don't really have any preference for AI/ML, Distributed Systems, or Cybersecurity. All I hear are the news about AI/Cybersecurity being really hot. I'm not sure if I should chase the hype just to make more money.

The reason I am considering a MS in CS is because my parents keep telling me that I NEED a MS in CS even if I get into Google as a SWE because they are worried about me being the target of potential layoffs or discrimination for leadership promotions at any company in the future. I told my parents that I was primarily interested in Web/Mobile Development, which I thought didn't require a MS in CS degree for most cases, but my parents suggested me getting a MS in CS specializing in Web/Mobile Dev, which sounds absurd to me.

Most of the applicants I see here seem to be Data Analysts, MIS, or ECE students who either don't already have a SWE job at a notable company or are trying to switch industries completely. I feel like my case doesn't match anyone's case at all, so I'm unsure if this is something I should be looking at given my specific situation.

I'm not sure if you guys think I would be a good fit for this program given that: 1) I am already a SWE at a notable Enterprise Tech Company. 2) The reason I would get a MS in CS is simply ""cause"" I want to have that stamp on my resume just in case of layoffs. 3) I'm not sure if I'm even interested in AI/ML, Distributed Systems, or Cybersecurity. 

Do you guys who have gone through the program already have any suggestions? Thanks."

During my college, I have loved operating systems and distributed systems the most and have been a back end intern and some startups. However I find many things out there on GitHub and AWS/other clouds that are ready to use in production with minimal effort.
This makes me feel like the back end engineering domain has or will soon saturate.


Most of the fancy work is going in the field of machine learning and people bragging like automate every fucking thing.

But at the same time, I can't tell if I want to work so hard on this subject that likely won't be applicable to me in the future. I could be spending time studying VHDL/Verilog/FPGA's/Microcontrollers, etc.

The problem is that I'm not the one paying him a visit. He visits me. What's worse is the way he *looks*. I consider myself a tough guy, and I was convinced I was just seeing things so I refused to tell my girlfriend to avoid looking like a wimp...but I regularly hide under the covers to avoid having to look at him. I don't know where exactly he came from but I think I have an *idea*.

This happened in the summer of last year (2018). I'd just landed an internship paying a full-timer's salary about 45 miles from home. So I did exactly what you'd expect: I signed a lease. I live near Toronto, so although I could live comfortably while paying for my one-bedroom, I wasn't saving any money. It was the first time I'd had my own place! I was so excited to be finally living on my own, and not having to worry about parents or siblings was **amazing.** I went to work, I came home, I played games, and on the weekends I visited my family and girlfriend, Lauren. Lauren is perfect. She's gorgeous, smart, hilarious, and savage as hell. Not savage like caveman savage, I mean savage like she's mean. She's unapologetic. She's fierce. It's hard to explain but I like that about her! For all her grit, though, she has one weakness...thunder.   


It was the early afternoon on a Saturday when we were hanging out at my place for once. The weather alerts had just come in: there was a thunderstorm headed our way from the Hamilton region. Being on the west end of the city, there wasn't much time before its arrival. We both knew she was afraid of thunder, so we tried to make the most of it. We gathered up some blankets, put on a relaxing movie, and snuggled up in preparation. That's when it happened. The first rumblings of the oncoming storm. Lauren had been still for a while, head against my chest, but when the rumbling started I saw her wince. She was shutting her eyes are hard as she could. We've got this thing we do to each other...it's kind of dumb but it works. Y'see, whenever one of us is upset - angry, emotional, frustrated, whatever - we'll use a silly voice and go ""Don't be upsetti, have some spaghetti!"" and it always makes us smile. So as you'd expect, I put a finger under her chin to get her attention. She looks up at me and I give her a big smile.

""Don't be upsetti! hav--""

A flash.

***""AAAAAAAAAAAH!""***

She screamed. The room lit up. She sobbed and buried her face in my chest. She was panicking now. So was I. 

""Please make it stop!! Stop stop stop stop stop -""

I held her as close as I could. 

""Baby just hold on, the thunder is coming and you have to be--""

 ***--------------BOOOOOOOOM--------------***

The entire apartment shook. The TV Flickered. The setting sun turned red. Lauren kept crying. I shut my eyes tight.

And that's all either of us remember before what happened next. *We woke up*. We woke up on the opposite side of the bed we'd laid down on. Like, we'd gotten into bed with our feet facing the window, right? We woke up with them facing the door. That wasn't the only thing...the setting sun that'd turned red? It was there. It was stuck in limbo on the horizon...and its influence had spread. Now everything was awash in hues of red. I guess saying the sun was in limbo was fitting because this was Hell.

I can't explain it but it was like we just *knew*. This was Hell. The world had gone silent. There was no electrical buzzing, or wind, or rain, or thunder. There was just this low humming coming from the sun. I mean, not literally the sun from space, but...the horizon? You get it. There was light coming through the windows, but everything was this *vermilion.* Like a red orangey color. I have honestly never felt anything like it. You know how people describe a feeling of *impending doom?* It was like that except instead of the feeling of doom *crushing* me, it was like it had completely demolished me with the thunder...and now it was passing through me. I felt empty. I felt hollow. I felt like I shouldn't be here.

We got up and took a look around the apartment. Lauren was wrapped in a blanket because she was afraid, and I kept her under my arm the entire time. We walked toward the window and we just stared. We stared at the perpetually setting sun. It was warm, and the sky was clear now. Despite how terrified we were we felt this serenity reach us. Like we no longer existed. The entire time we were...*there...* we didn't say a word to each other. We weren't there very long. It was like we were there by accident and now we were being *kicked out*. We died. You read that right, we died. It was horrifying seeing the life leave the woman I love. We grabbed at each other as we slumped to the floor. Then we woke up again. We don't talk about it, honestly. I suspect we won't get the chance. 

That's when I started seeing *Him*. I looked in the mirror and saw him against the back wall of my office's washroom. This first time I saw him his presence was so weak I dismissed it as my eyes playing tricks...it was early and I hadn't had my coffee. Then a few weeks later, I saw him again. This time I was wide awake. I was driving home and traffic had gotten really bad. I had to pee so I got off the highway and took main roads while waiting to come across a McDonalds or a Wendy's or whatever. That's when I saw him, just standing on the sidewalk, staring at me. This time I could see him clearly. This time I could tell he looked *wrong*. I swear I almost pissed myself right there. You've probably been waiting for this part so I'll explain what I mean.

He looks wrong. He looks like someone took a corpse and really just fucked with it. His eyes aren't eyes. They're...beads? Billiard balls? They're big and shiny and black with white orbs at their center. His hair looks artificial. Have you ever shaved a Barbie doll's head? Barbie dolls have these...holes where hair is inserted, like enlarged follicles or something. He looks like someone shaved his head and inserted artificial hair, but not nice hair. It's long and black and totally dead. It's wispy and thin, like a bad paintbrush or a strand from a broomhead that's about to fall out. To top it all off, he's huge. Like 7 feet tall and wider than a linebacker. I can't tell if his shoulders are that broad themselves or if there's something in his coat, but...it's like he's got a plank of wood across his back. ***He wouldn't fit through a door designed for humans.*** That's what I mean when I say he looks *wrong.* I got home safe that day and didn't see him for a bit. 

Then the *visits* got more frequent. I saw him in my house, and the first time I just yelled. I threw a shoe but it ...passed... through him. When I moved, the balls in his head followed me. He would never walk, just follow me with his eyes. Here's the thing, I'm not just seeing him. He is actually *there*. You know how I know? It's because his hair falls. I don't mean it falls out, I mean his hair falls like when you turn on hair physics in a video game. Whenever he appears, his hair falls as if he'd just been moving quickly and come to a halt. Like he'd been *moved*. Every time. I saw him in the hallway twice, one day. He was there, by the door. I turned around and he was there, too. Behind me. Within an inch of me. I looked up and his hair was falling to his shoulders like he'd just dropped himself from one point in reality to another. It's hard to explain, but...he doesn't *wait* for me. And he isn't just something I'm seeing. He moves. Anyway that was a few weeks ago - when he was still just a mirage. 

Yesterday though, he was solid. Not really solid...but he felt like Jello. When I opened the shower curtain he appeared in front of me. At that point he'd just been more of an annoyance...I'm terrified of looking into his eyes, but other than that I've never been convinced he could touch me. Whenever I saw him I'd just avoid eye contact and mumble something like ""fuck off"". The thing is, when I tried to pass through him like usual after muttering my profanities, there was some resistance. Again, like Jello. He wasn't being torn apart, but it was just like I had to put some effort into getting past him. 

I pushed past him to my mirror. I had a scar. Not a scar like the pigment in my skin was healing from a minor cut, but a *scar* on my cheek. Except I didn't. I knew I didn't. I could feel my face and there was nothing there. But in the mirror...a scar. I went to bed that night expecting to go through the same routine. See, every morning I'd wake up and fumble toward the light switch while keeping my eyes aimed at the floor in case he decided to show up. I didn't get that far.

That's because last night he touched me. I woke up to see his pale, dead face inches from mine. I had to put my hand over my mouth to stop from screaming. That's when he did it. He grabbed me by the face. His hand was cold, and his nails were long...like they were fake. They were black. I didn't, *couldn't*, move a muscle. I could feel his grip tightening and the wound on my cheek beginning to open. I felt the blood drip down onto my pillow and ear. He disappeared. The only evidence left of him having been there last night was the scar on my cheek - the one preordained by my reflection - and one word that left a sear on my subconscious. **""*****Soon*****"".** I didn't know what it meant until now.

That's the last time I saw him. I didn't go to work today, and I haven't spoken to anyone. I feel sick to my stomach. I feel the impending doom. Sometimes my anxiety hits me with something similar, but it usually goes away once I've had something to eat. I get the feeling this won't be so easily cured. I have a feeling I won't see tomorrow. That's because when I undressed in front of my bathroom mirror this morning I was covered in scars."

&amp;nbsp;

If you start looking now for a full time position that is to start after your internship ends, it seems like a waste because you don't get to leverage that internship experience into getting interviews/offers from better companies. It seems like it'd make more sense to be applying once you have the internship down on your resume.

&amp;nbsp;

But it seems like a bad idea to only start applying to full time positions after your internship ends as you could be stuck for quite a few months without a job. It seems like most major companies set up recruiting to match a traditional academic calendar. So if you apply and interview in fall only to start in spring, that seems like an extraordinary waste of time.

&amp;nbsp;

Is there a simple solution I'm failing to see? I'd be very interested in seeing how those who went for a summer internship went about applying for a full time position.

Also, the idea that seems to come to mind for me is to try to get one summer internship and one fall coop (although these seem less common), then apply for full time job in fall recruiting season."

Technically, I should be working as an assistant professor right now ( have all the certifications), but due to an ongoing Supreme Court case regarding reservations in University rosters, all new openings for teaching positions were suspended indefinitely. As a result, I wasn't able to get a teaching job and started working as a freelancer.

Now, the freelance thing doesn't pay very well, so I want to transition to a regular job at an advertising agency.

I had a very hard time finding an entry level job anywhere, so I started applying for internships. (I turned 24 in December )

I have gotten acceptance letters from 2 places, and I can't decide.Both  the companies pay exactly the same.Please help me choose 

Company 1 - Biggest Media House in my Country, one way distance from my place - 31.3 kms , One way travelling time - 2 hours, Event based internship ( Only 2 months), very little chance of a job offer unless I do something exceptional 

Company 2 - Local Ad Agency, Near to my place, 5.2 kms away, 20-30 minutes travelling time, moderate chance of job offer

Is a big brand name on my CV valuable to future employers ? Will it make a huge difference considering the fact that I'm a fresher ? (Both are digital marketing internships )

I'm a student looking for an end of studies internship (it has to be abroad for school credit). So I applied to offers that corresponded to my field (I study data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence); had several phone interviews/ video interview and 2 on-sites with different companies, some misses, some successes.

However, there is that one company that just offered me a position, a week after only one 30-minutes-phone interview with 2 technical persons (had a call with HR later, but it was more to check if I had the administrative requirement for the internship).

During this one interview, I talked a little bit about myself, my education, skills and projects, nothing much. I wasn't even asked any technical questions to check if I was legit or not. Needless to say I'm really surprised I didn't had to go through more rounds. I didn't fail the interview, but it wasn't also a huge success. Interview was also conducted in english, which is not my native language; we even had some miscommunications. 

Does this (hiring people based on a phone call) happen from time to time, or is it sketchy ?

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe some relevant details to add :

1. Mission is in R&amp;D, in a heavily technical project (with state-of-the-art tools). From what I could gather, it's not an entry-level position.
2. My résumé is pretty relevant for the position, but it's not stellar to the point where companies would just offer me a position just like that.
3. Company is a fortune 200, so it's not likely I'm going to get kidnap and sold as a slave.
4. Compensation is well above average for an internship (I'm getting 4 times the salary I got in my previous internship)
5. Research center is on a small town, so it might not attract that many students. But in the mean time, I remember seeing on their linkedin offer that there was at least 100+ applicants."

So how do I find an internship?  What developers have the best work environments?  I don't want to end up hating life or wasting my time.  I've been in the military so long that navigating the civilian job market is very foreign.

It is my first internship (I am a sophomore in college) and my first experience working on a project with anyone other than myself. I will be working under guidance of the 2-3 other developers for the company and working on small bugfixes/features at first. They have offered me 15 hours of work per week for a stipend of $200/week (\~$13/hr, but with no SS/Medicaid tax withheld since it's a stipend); however, there are a couple other points to make:

&amp;#x200B;

\- When discussing pay, my boss said to ""think it over"" and that I ""don't have to give \[him\] an answer today"" and then pretty clearly implied that if it isn't enough, I can ask for more.

&amp;#x200B;

\- He also noted that the company is receiving significant funding in the next month from investors and that as time goes on and I show dedication, that will allow them to pay me more.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a full-time college student and I do need to make ends meet as far as expenses go, so obviously more money is better. I don't want to ask for too much, but I don't want to sell myself short at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel that I have any leverage to negotiate with, as this is my first internship. There are no other candidates for this position. My plan as of now is to say that I am happy to work for whatever they can offer me, but that I want it in writing that my pay will increase as time goes on so that I can rely on that rather than a verbal agreement when budgeting. Is this a reasonable plan? Does anyone have any advice for this situation?

Thank you."

What do?,vulkkan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ajsveb/noncsmis_major_with_1_year_left_in_college_i_want/,"I know this question has been asked numerous times before, but I always find it helpful to hear some personal feedback. 

Long story short, I am currently a management information systems major at my university. I've added a finance minor in the past year, but realized that I am much more interested in coding. I don't have enough time to complete the CS minor track at my uni before graduation, but do intend on taking the courses up and through data structures and algorithms. What can I do to make myself competitive enough to land a good software development/engineering job upon graduation despite not being a CS grad, and how good/bad are my chances? 

More detail: my university does a five year, three co-op (aka extended internship) program. I've done two internships so far, one in cybersecurity with a healthcare company, and one in-progress in wealth management with a top investment bank. I'd say I'm decent at R and SQL, and was originally aiming to be a business analyst, but I feel like that career path is too narrow and there aren't enough jobs and flexibility in that field. As such, I realized that I think I'd be much happier as a developer. However, I don't have enough time to change my major and graduate on-time. I know that people from my major are considered ""weaker"" than CS grads, though I'm not sure how to quantify that. I have been self-teaching myself during downtime at work and after work on JS and Python, though I'm wary of my lack of fundamental CS theory and it's something I will improve asap. I'm unhappy with the finance field and how MIS feels restrictive, and how the prospect of being a manager isn't great if you can't understand what the software engineer guys are doing. I know some MIS major's have  become successful devs, though I haven't found much info on what made a company choose them despite lacking a CS degree. While I plan to take some courses in CS and also continue to teach myself languages, what are things I can do to get myself in the door at respected companies and also through the interview? Should I consider pursuing another bachelor's in CS? Should I do a boot camp? Or should I just continue to work as much as I can on teaching myself and maybe building a few projects to throw on GitHub? My friends have advised just taking the courses, learning on my own, and trying to land my third co-op/internship as a software developer, but I'd love to hear some more perspective. 

All advice is really appreciated - thank you!"

I am a sophomore student at Stony Brook, majoring in computer science. I had no idea what I wanted to major in when I came and just settled on CS because they have a respected program. 


I have now been coding for 3 semesters and I enjoy most of it!


So far, I have taken 3 major coding classes (not including ethics/math cs classes) with the 1st being taught in Python and the next 2 being taught in Java. When I compare what I've done and the projects we've been tasked with they don't compare at all, which is where I feel a little insufficient. The biggest projects I have done in school have been a Big-O calculator and a network packet simulator, both which work within Eclipse. Then, I see students who have fully functional projects which can integrate with websites or use Ruby. Personal projects are important, especially if they use some high level techniques, but right now there isn't much I can put together. I have an idea for an app (just for fun, really just a joke sound button app) and a program that scrapes a selling site and texts me when an item with a defined keyword is listed. I plan on starting these soon and having them as ""in-progress"" on my apps, but again they'll be very basic Android/IOS coding and more Java. 

-

The next classes I will be taking focus on MIPS and the other on ""high-level languages such as Java, Scala, Haskell, Python or Javascript"" so I hope this will help me become a little more versed in coding. 

-

I have done a little self-learning in HTML and CSS and taken some interest in the field of machine learning and AI, but haven't had the time to do anymore more than some basics and light reading. 

-

This summer I'd really like to get an internship in NYC, since I'm so close for school. Realistically I don't expect anything top of the line, but I'd like to get some experience under my belt for the future.

-

I just started TAing and tutoring at my school in the basic classes I took to solidify my skills, and I'm beginning to apply for internships this summer. What should I be doing to maximize my chances at an offer, even just a small one? I really don't know if I can even answer interview questions based on my current knowledge, but I'm eager to learn and know my way around my resume and, I think, and interview.

Thanks in advance, the help is always greatly appreciated!

I work from home for an internship and I do a ton of digital design, website building, and social media. I also study in graduate school.

Two weeks ago, my boss and I met where he outlined his ideal commitment of 20 hours a week with two weekly meetings. I built my schedule around this commitment. Now I know I do not make much money with an internship but in this case I make just enough to cover the electricity and cell phone bill while my parents help me with rent during my studies.

On Monday I got a call from my boss and he said “no hours this week and the internship is possibly ending because the other partners do not want it…I will call you back later this week and let you know.” He then ended the call.

I was very stunned and shocked because I had built my schedule around this and was using this internship to pay some bills.

I reached out to the other intern to see if she had heard anything but she ignored me ( she has read receipts on her phone).

I tried reaching out on Wednesday and Thursday to speak to my boss about whether the internship would continue but he continued to ignore me and my emails ( I sent one on Monday night saying “just let me know when or if you are free this week to discuss whether the opportunity will continue “.  I know he might have been busy and that this was annoying but I just wanted to set up a later meeting or phone call time to discuss whether it was ending or not and to start looking for another job and change my course schedule if that was the case. He ignored my emails (I have a service that shows when people read my emails) and I lost my temper.

I sent him a text on Thursday asking if he could speak that night to discuss the internship and he texted me saying “Ill call you tonight to discuss it”. I waited for him to call but never heard back. I figured that I would do some linkedin marketing work since I had been in the process of optimizing the site’s linkedin SEO and tried to log in but noticed that the password was changed.

Today I discovered that the internship program did not end and that my boss was keeping the intern who had been ignoring me on but letting the rest of us go. I did not find out from my boss or the other intern but I noticed it when I went onto our CRM and the other intern was communicating with my boss ( who was at the time ignoring me). THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED UP.

I lost my temper and sent my boss an email explaining that I was grateful for the opportunity and that while I knew that I was not entitled to any internship or job that I had built a schedule off of what he had said two weeks ago so I was frustrated. I also inquired about why he had told me false information about the internship program ended and explained that it came across as personal (with him telling me something, the intern ignoring me, and then not hearing anything) WHICH I ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE. I also said that it was not professional to ignore my emails and texts all week and that I would have appreciated some form of communication. I ended by saying that I respect his decision to end the internship but that I wish it had been communicated more clearly and professionally and thanked him for the opportunity. I also offered to send over any notes that he might need.

I then got an almost immediate text saying “Taking your emails into account- you are fired.” I clearly should not have lost my temper and sent that stupid email but I felt so helpless. How should I have handled that situation better? I know I screwed up. "

Or do i attend my local community college for IT, nPower seems like a really good choice.

I got a CS degree in December and I've been applying to jobs in my home state. I've done a couple phone interviews and an in-person interview, and it has me wondering, what the hell am I even doing in this field? I like coding, y'know, I don't love it but if I was working on something I felt passionate about then I think I could love it. Alas, all these interviewers have, relative to my knowledge base, ridiculous standards.

I emphasize my desire to learn (I really do, tech is great) and that I'm eager. I've iterated over my resume a dozen times and have had professors, individuals that work in the field, and the freecodecamp community approve of it.

So, what's the problem?

I have 4+ years of scattered programming concepts in my brain; Just a metric ton of information and it feels like a complete gamble whether or not they line up with the questions an interviewer asks. It's a gamble in their favor as programming is obviously a huge space. I've never been asked the simple questions like ""What's a for loop?"" or ""What are objects?"" or ""What's a protected variable?"". The easiest question I've gotten is ""What's a foreign key in SQL?"" which I blanked on. The rest is

""Have you coded with Java using Spring MVC and Hiberate?"".""What's your front-end experience? Angular? React?""""Describe all the object-design patterns""

I've done work outside of school. I did an internship at a networking company and wrote some software on the side for them to automate some things. I worked with another company designing an app for their marketplace on a new device. I describe these projects. One of the projects I used Python on so they automatically assume that I ""know"" Python and have all these thoughts about Python; I did one project, I don't. On my resume, I have my technical skills broken into ""Proficient"" and ""Familiar"" for a reason.

The in-person interview I did was corporate as all hell. Everyone was dressed to the max and the main programmer that interviewed me for the position complained about his job. I could feel the stress in this office; They were more stressed than I was and I was stressed. One of the phone interviews I had was a start-up where a very dreary individual described in detail how he grew his company from 2 million to 120 million; No passion, just dead inside.

I'm not sure if this whole culture is a result of passion coders created inflated expectations (lies) or what, but at this stage, I'm widening my scope, possibly returning to network engineering and looking at more IT positions as I've had drastically more positive experiences in that environment. The more research I do, the more recruiters I speak to, and the interviews I've experience just paint a very dreary and demanding picture of working as a developer.

I don't care about the money and I was never doing this for the money. 

Maybe my University was just awful. Maybe someone here can share their more positive experience entering this industry. Maybe this can serve as a cautionary tale for individuals pursuing this field in a University environment.

Solidly middle class, my town has little diversity. So, naturally, throughout high school I dreamed of going to an Ivy or similarly ranked school, hoping that I could get into the ""real world"" that wasn't my bubble back home. I had my favorites, and I applied to others that my parents encouraged me to, and of course I applied to UT Austin. I had mostly accepted that I'd be going to Austin after getting deferred from a school early, and had made all my plans for the Fall there and was extremely excited. But then, in March, I was rejected from the other couple of Ivies I applied to, except one. Last minute in January, my parents had suggested I apply to Penn because of their great business program. I was hesitant, because I wasn't sure if I wanted to do business, but I went ahead and applied thinking there would be no harm. Somehow, I had gotten into Penn, a school I had never seriously considered because I never thought I would get accepted.

When I visited for Quaker Days, I was skeptical and slightly hesitant. I quickly learned from my host and others than Penn had a big party culture, and it was the norm to go out multiple nights a week. Then, I found out that social life essentially hinged on being in Greek life and having connections. Then, I found out that the majority of students came from the top income brackets. The next day, I got my financial aid back. It would cost me more to go to UT, so essentially the choice was made for me by the end of the trip.

Over the summer, I tried to remain positive, curious about what else going to such a school would have in store for me. But, as moving day kept coming nearer, I began getting anxious and scared. My whole life I had known the same people in my school, and never really had to make new friends. My friends were all going to Austin together, and I would be going across the country where I knew literally no one. When I came to Penn, the first few days felt very lonely. I luckily had a great roommate and hall, but they all seemed to already know everyone else. One went to a fancy private school in Manhattan, another went to one in LA, already knowing the vast amount of other freshman who came from the same places. I seemed to be the only person who came to college knowing no one, which to some may seem refreshing, but for me was daunting in a place that mostly cares about who you know and where you're from.

Don't get me wrong, I have had a mostly great time here. I have matured in ways that I never could have if I went to UT, and have met so many people that I otherwise would not know. But, in the same vain, I have gone through many rough patches and hard adjustments that at times can be depressing. The east coast is very different than the south. People here call snow cones ""water ice."" The skies are more often gray than blue. It's actually normal to walk more than a mile in a day. But these bits are trivial. At Penn, most people have gotten in through legacy or connections. I can count more people that I know who have trust funds and pay full tuition than I can count my middle class or lower income friends. Growing up I watched Gossip Girl, marveling at the seemingly unreal lives that the girls in the show lived. But now, I go to school with girls who have never known worlds other than that.  Maybe it's that I haven't surrounded myself yet with more people like myself (but isn't college about expanding your boundaries??), but all my friends regularly pay over $50 a week to go downtown on Tuesdays and Thursdays. One even got us a $5,000 table at a club one weekend in NYC (that's a sizable chunk of my tuition!). My friends have gone through terrible pledging and hazing (when you come to Penn, you hear the oft-repeated rumor about a frat that has rushes smash Rolex watches). I talk about an internship I want to apply for, then find out my friend is considering a similar one because a family friend can help. Many of my initial conversations with people were only about whether I knew this or that person. Is this the ""real world"" I was dreaming about in high school?

What I wish I knew before coming to Penn is that I wouldn't ever truly fit in. I don't come from a ""sceney"" city, and I don't like going out as often as other people do. I don't have the political or business connections that others have. I am not the stereotypical extrovert that everyone assumes all Penn students are, and I'm not as social climbing as others try to be. I know I'm not the only one, but sometimes it doesn't feel like it. However, I want to end this on a positive note.

I have met people here, who despite being more privileged than I, will be lifelong friends. These people will have my back, despite our very glaring differences. Although at Penn it is easy for people of similar backgrounds to stick together, coming here has forced me to come out of my shell and try to talk to everyone. I will always be grateful for my experience here, even if it has been hard sometimes. Through a lot homesickness, missing my friends back home, feeling lonely, and trying to work my hardest, I will come out stronger."

I've never felt more defeated. I just got my next rejection letter after finally making it to the final interview stages. Currently in my junior year of college with a focus in Cyber Security, I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. On top of school, I've been attending tons of hackathons, CTFs, and Cyber Security conventions (even speaking at one of them, ironically, about the lack of entry level jobs). I understand the limit that school can teach, so I started studying for certificates as well (using this subreddit as a reference), and ended up with a SEC+, CEH, and OSWP (out of money for the OSCP). 

On the side, I try using some pentesting practice such as hackthebox or microcorruption. I'm trying to do anything to learn, but it's frustrating because I don't know what to learn. When I went to my first Cyber Security Convention, I was told that all I needed to do to get an internship was obtain a security+ and CEH. After a months of studying and preparing, I managed to finally receive it. But when I came back to this subreddit, to my horror, it seemed that the consensus has changed to believe the uselessness of these certs. While I certainly learned allot by studying for these, I have no idea if what I learned was valuable in a working environment or not. 

  
I've spoken to tons of people at conventions, many of which OFFERED me mentor-ship. Afterwards however, almost NONE of them have responded to a single one of my emails. I don't know why would you come up to me, be a shining beacon of hope, and then not respond to a single one of my emails. Don't worry, I get it, I know you're a busy person. But please don't offer me hand if you're going to pull it back when I reach for it. 

Apologies for my rant. But the frustration is building on me. I love this field. I love learning about new tools and learning how to use them, breaking stuff and putting it back together. But I'm at the point where I don't know what I'm suppose to learn and how I'm suppose to learn it. The certs I got are not meant to prove my knowledge. I got them to show my willingness and desire to learn. 

Please advise me on what to do at this step forward."

I have this big summer side project that I did for myself, and I feel if potential employers looked at this project, they would be more likely to hire me. The problem is that, the more people that use my program, the more likely the whole program would suddenly stop working, due to something changing outside my project. If this happens it will be hard fix the program and it might never reach back to its formal functionality.

I am thinking of putting the description (has multiprocessing, multithreading, UI, etc.) of this project in my resume, as I do not have any developer work experience. However, I feel that since the project is not publicly available, it hurts my chances of getting an internship. Does it? Would possible employers ask me to share it with them, or ask for it during my interview? I am willing to take the risk of sharing the project with possible employers. What should I do?"

I am a senior undergraduate at one of the IITs (known to be the most prestigious) in India, majoring in Aerospace engineering with 3.5 Gpa. Although, my interest is totally in CS. I cannot change my major now.

I have done two internships (1 summer 2018 and 1 remote) as Android developer and full stack developer and currently working in a startup remotely, by learning things all by myself in my free time. After the internships, I felt pretty confident about my skills and thought things look good for next year internship.

In November 2018, I applied to Google for a Software Engineering Intern for summer 2019 (no referrals). Heard back from them, submitted the coding sample which I know was absolutely correct but was rejected about a week ago. I think the problem was my transcript which clearly mentioned the CS courses I had done. Only 3 out of 32.

So, I am open to help of any sort(referrals, recommendations etc.) to get an internship for summer 2019.

So I'm in a weird spot right now, and I was hoping you guys might be able to help. 

I recently moved to North Carolina with my boyfriend to stay with his parents for the time being while we get on our feet. (Really long back story that I won't go into) Which should be all fine and dandy, but there's some complication. My boyfriend is going into software development and has an internship in May through the summer in California. 
I was going to just stay with his parents until the end of his internship and then we were going to figure things out from there... But as soon as we moved to NC his parents said they were moving to Montana. Yep. 

I'm currently in a spot where I'm still figuring things out with my life/career/etc. and really don't want to keep getting uprooted and moving to a bunch of different places in the U.S. Plus, living with his parents has been incredibly difficult despite the pros of saving money. I'm craving my independence again. 

Initially I planned on staying here in North Carolina on my own to create some stability in my life, but I honestly hate it here and feel like I want to take advantage of this state of limbo. As much as I feel like I should focus on stability, my heart wants more. I would love to go teach English in Japan, or do a working holiday visa in Australia, or really do anything abroad that could bring value and growth to my life while also making money to pay my student loans, etc. I'm looking to have a working abroad experience for the next 6-12 months while I have the chance and the initial funds. 

I'm 25, have a college degree that I'm not using, and have kind of just been coasting through life up until this point. I'm not sure which option may be best right now and my time is running out since they're leaving in March. 
And no, my boyfriend will not be with me. 

Reddit, what would you do in my situation? What option may be best? Am I stupid for wanting to go abroad instead of playing it safe?  "

Hi guys, Ill try to keep this short.

I'm an intern at a small WebDev company, I've been tasked with making a website for a lawyer. The attorney wants his clients to be able to send him an emergency contact form from his website. I have the form made and used the [mailto:](mailto:example@gmail.com)attribute in html to send the email. It seems to work when tested on my own email.

He also wants to be able to get a notification on his phone of when an emergency email comes through from the web server. The issue is he wants one email, but he doesn't want notifications of non emergency emails, only ones from the form on his website.

I was hoping someone could just point me in the right direction for a solution to this. One of my ideas is a small Android app that syncs to his gmail and pings his phone anytime it detects a form being sent from the web server?

Or maybe there is a simpler solution to this? (php script?). I just started this internship and its definitely trial by fire so any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

I'll be going back to school next fall and I'm at a crossroads. Long story short I have a visual impairment, I struggled in math growing up. I always loved technology and enjoy programming and networking. When I told my mom I wanted to major in computer science two years ago she said she wouldn't pay for my tuition if I majored in CS due to the math requirements. Now that I'm older and I understand why I struggled with math.

(A) I never studied

(B) I wasn't interested

(C) I realized I lacked the foundational skills required.

(D) Some of the teachers/ Professors treated me like I was a nuisance because of my disability.

I enjoy math more now, Don't find it as boring as I  did when I was younger. I really want this degree,  want to actually become good at math, not be afraid. I'm just unsure of how to go about it. I'm thinking of transferring to Farmingdale with my AAS degree in IT, taking the majority of the CS courses there while still transferring my credits.

so I recently graduated from my school a week ago and I'm looking for a job. The interviews hit me hard. School never prepared me for those algorithm style question or for actual employment interview process. I actually went through 4 years of Software Engineering and I haven't even heard of design patterns until my last interview. It was literally never ever brought up. Only usage of frameworks, and skapegoat web-dev project where you have to ""build a scheduler"" or some stupid thing where my teammates barely knew how to use a unix console for git commands. I thought I had it in the bag. I had good grades in school and followed everything teachers said now I feel like I got kicked in the balls by my own university and wasted 4 years. I never could get an internship because they were never part time and I'm extremely time-indisposed.

The more I read the more I realize I know absolutely *fucking* **nothing**. Observers, factory, decorator, etc. it feels like I studied the wrong things during those 4 years. There's so many things I don't know *anything* about it's making my head spin. I've never heard of writing unit tests first development until today. I just know how to write unit tests. Leetcode exercises are a *struggle*. I feel like I'm fucked. I quit my job as a part-time office clerk thinking I'm finally set and I can breath easily and should concentrate on interviews (mostly because a lot of interviewers seem to schedule interviews in the middle of the weekdays).

But those interviews deflated me. I felt like a moron. I went from a B+ student to a loser in my self-esteem. I have some money left for rent but I feel like I can't wrap my head around all those concepts in time for an actual career job. It's suffocating me pretty hard. I thought practicing some algorithms and recursive function translations (binary to linear and whatnot) would be enough. I didn't even know what a heap was. I've legitimately never seen it.

I don't even understand what the point of those Leetcode questions are? I've never encountered those issues in my life or any project. I usually just use a REST API or some framework to get the job done.

Right now: I'm trying to understand and be able to apply different design patterns from Heads First design pattern and they're taking some time to assimilate. I can't imagine how long it will take me to do medium or hard questions on LeetCode.

1- I need a job that doesn't ask me voodoo questions of reproducing palindrome partitioning over the phone or give me 30 minutes for K inverse pairs with arrays on the whiteboard. What can we do as CS/Software Engineering graduates that has a decent pay but smaller requirements? I'm looking at Technical documentalist that often requires CS majors as a temporary jobs. Is there something else in the sort?

2- Any tips? Is it normal to feel like you're that far behind? How long does it take usually to be able to do hard exercises in LeetCode? I'm struggling to not peak half of the easy ones... :/

3- What's the quickest thing to learn for a career cs job that I can cram into my skull? I heard it was being a rails developer . I have a strong preference towards web and AI (done Tensorflow+Keras with extra NLP) but I'll start off with anything. I'm untalented as hell for front-end. Everything I ever made looked terrible.

Thank you so much for any help

ak4fpm,1,2019-01-26,I'm a 23 year old guy going through a quarter-life-crisis; I no longer feel like the future is in my hands.,TheAbLord,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ak4fpm/im_a_23_year_old_guy_going_through_a/,"I recently graduated college with a job lined up as a programmer, and I am grateful for my life and the privileges I've been afforded. However, lately I've felt apprehension about entering my career. When I think of the next few years of my life working in an office, coding and doing work that holds no inherent meaning to me, I feel depressed. Lately, this feeling has manifested itself in my de-sensitivity towards otherwise emotional life events; seeing my far-away friends again after a year, or my 13 year old cat passing. 

My lack of emotion towards these events has surprised me a bit, and I feel virtually no day-to-day excitement on embarking on this new chapter of my life. When people ask me my plans after graduation, or what I want to achieve in life, my heart sinks; I lie because I don't have a genuine answer myself. The only thing that really excites me about my future is the possibility that I could go travel the world in my twenties, sustaining myself by living with and learning from locals, via websites like WorkAway where you can work internationally in people's homes in exchange for food and housing. If there were no consequences for my career/future financial stability, I would be planning this right now. 

Speaking of career consequences, this is the main concern holding me back; If I spend half of my twenties traveling for myself, I'm worried no company will hire me after because I'll be perceived as a bum or something. I'll have little relevant work experience to the software industry, and the experience I currently have (from internships) will likely be obsolete by then since the tech world changes so rapidly. I also acknowledge the benefit of higher quality of life, and financial security in one's thirties, for things like buying a house or raising a family, that come from working and building wealth in one's twenties, and am scared these are things I will forego in the name of ""life experience."" 

Ultimately I no longer feel excited for the future because I don't believe the future is in my hands. To me, our culture is oriented such that we are forced to give up our freedom in the form of long hours put towards the generation of capital for our employers. I believe there is a threat of financial instability and isolation for those who stray from this system, encouraging the average Joe to devote his life towards upholding the capitalist economy. 

Maybe I am being too cynical or idealistic, and I invite anyone to call me out or challenge my mindset if they see fit. I am not so much looking to argue as looking for advice on how to navigate this system and pursue the things I want, namely travel, at least for a few years. If anyone can provide advice or share their own experiences on this matter, I'd appreciate it. I'm just a disillusioned college grad going through a quarter-life crisis. "

**SANTA CLARA, Calif.,** Jan. 20, 2019—With a goal of elevating the value of its graduates to Silicon Valley and to a world in need of conscientious leaders, Santa Clara University announced the public launch of its $1 billion fundraising campaign Saturday night.

The launch was announced at the University’s 53rd annual Golden Circle Theatre Party held Jan. 19 at San Jose’s Center for Performing Arts, which featured a performance by James Taylor, followed by a dinner for 2,500 guests at the Fairmont Hotel.

Over the past four years of the “silent phase” of its campaign, Santa Clara University has raised almost $600 million of its $1 billion goal. Those funds launched numerous capital projects including a planned new 275,000-square-foot complex devoted to interdisciplinary STEM education, the Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation; the Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building completed in 2014; the recently opened Howard S. and Alida S. Charney Hall of Law; the Stephen A. Finn Residence Hall currently under construction to help accommodate 600 new undergraduate students; and a planned Stephen C. and Patricia A. Schott Athletic Excellence Center.

Now, the University will spend the next four years sharing with donors, alumni, and other supporters of the University its vision for additional academic, curricular, and co-curricular enhancements planned for the campaign: “Innovating with a Mission.”

“There truly is no other institution like Santa Clara University: our premier access to the innovation and entrepreneurship of Silicon Valley, combined with our Jesuit values of using one’s talents to improve the human condition, creates profound impact, both locally and globally,” said **Jeff Miller ’73, MBA ’76,**president of the business-consulting firm JAMM Ventures who is co-chair of the University’s campaign committee with real-estate executive **John A. Sobrato ’60**. “As we ‘go public’ with our strategic plan, it is crystal clear that the world needs these unique Santa Clara-educated alumni more than ever.”

The University [has a website describing the campaign initiatives and impact](https://campaign.scu.edu/).

Among the other initiatives that will now become a greater focus of the campaign:

**Opening Doors**  
$210 million for funds to make a Santa Clara education more accessible to high-achieving students and boost SCU’s national prominence. That includes:

* adding student scholarships
* increasing undergraduate financial aid
* expansion of the LEAD program for first-generation college students
* a new Athletic Excellence Center
* support for student-athletes

**Educating the Whole Person**  
$180 million for student experiences that “educate the whole person” in the Jesuit tradition. That includes:

* broadening the liberal arts to infuse arts and humanities into the University’s increased focus on STEM and innovation
* offering more study abroad, internships, vocational discernment, and experiential learning opportunities
* providing support for the Jesuit School of Theology and increased programming for the Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education
* creating classroom and studios and common-space upgrades to foster collaborative work

**Innovating for the World**  
$330 million for elevating programs that help SCU address social inequity globally and promote innovation in support of humanity. That includes: 

* the Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation, a collaborative hub for tech and humanities
* expansion of Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship focused on enabling social enterprises worldwide to bring environmentally sustainable solutions to those living in poverty
* expanding the School of Engineering’s humanitarian engineering focus
* expanding business-innovation and conscientious capitalism offerings at the Leavey School of Business

**General University**  
$280 million for general University funds for academic units, global experiences, and other programmatic and education-enhancing initiatives.

The University’s previous fundraising campaign ended in 2006, and raised more than $400 million from more than 41,000 donors. That resulted in construction of the current business school and learning commons and library, more than $100 million for scholarships, and new professorships, among other campus changes.

A full list of initiatives [can be found on the campaign website](https://campaign.scu.edu/).

**About Santa Clara University**  
Santa Clara University, a comprehensive Jesuit, Catholic university located 40 miles south of San Francisco in California's Silicon Valley, offers its more than 9,000 students rigorous undergraduate curricula in arts and sciences, business, and engineering; master's degrees in business, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministry, and theology; and law degrees and engineering doctoral degrees. Distinguished nationally by one of the highest graduation rates among all U.S. master's universities, California's oldest operating higher-education institution demonstrates faith-inspired values of ethics and social justice.

**Admiral Stephen Dai – Dimensional Plane of Arenal – Yggdrasil – 1 Month since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

“My apologies for being late.” The devil said with a smirk that exposed his fanged teeth, sending an involuntary reaction through Stephen’s spine. “My name is Zariel, I am the Archduke of the first layer of Hell. God of Territory, Defence, and Conquest of the Mind. I represent the infernal pantheon, led by Asmodeus, Greater God of Conquest and Tyranny.”
&amp;nbsp;

The devil had an elaborate chest piece that covered most of his body and limbs. Then as the devil stopped talking for a moment, Stephen realized that as he was listening to a woman’s voice, though he could barely see any feminine distinguishing features like he could with all the other species in the chamber.
&amp;nbsp;

“Izaiah, cousin, how are you? Long time no see.” The devil said with a slight smirk as she moved closer to the angel.
&amp;nbsp;

“Step away from me, foul beast! I will tolerate your presence only on command of my master.” Izaiah shouted back, causing the devil to burst out laughing and slowly turn around to take a seat at the table. “Now that all parties are here, I can introduce myself fully. I am Izaiah, God of Discipline and Retribution, representative of the seraphim pantheon.”
&amp;nbsp;

“++I have a lot of questions, concerning Judaism.++” Stephen subvocalized more for his own benefit than for the others. How did this even work? Did history just mess up the recording of such creatures in the past? Or was the source, the seraphim, diluted from the start and based on rumours? Or more likely, did the passage of time just mess up the stories constantly and morph them with other cultural influences before they got recorded fully at all. Did the seraphim even visit Earth?
&amp;nbsp;

“++Sir? The spell was only cast on you, so far we can only understand four of the Gods, the angel is still speaking in a strange language that we don’t recognize.++” Jacqueline replied for clarity’s sake. Stephen shook his head. Those questions would have to wait for later.
&amp;nbsp;

“Now that all *relevant* parties have gathered, we can begin.” Izaiah said as he shot an angry glance towards the giant God and the flying snake who both had arrived a minute ago. “The Infernal pantheon has invoked a rule set in place 3 millennia ago, meaning that only these 5 pantheons are allowed to interfere in the proceedings of the judgement of the supreme humans.”
&amp;nbsp;

Stephen had a lot of questions, but he subvocalized only one. “++Do you need me to subvocalize the translation?++”
&amp;nbsp;

“++No need, sir. Arundosar has begun to whisper the translation to a nearby marine.++” Jacqueline replied. Stephen nodded, glad that his marines were on top of things.
&amp;nbsp;

“What is meant by supreme?” Stephen asked.
&amp;nbsp;

“It is not your turn to speak!” Izaiah barked back.
&amp;nbsp;

“It means someone who is powerful enough to ascend to Godhood, in the traditional sense.” Ljordana, the elven God said in an almost bored fashion.
&amp;nbsp;

“++There is some serious dysfunction here.++” admiral Chen commented.
&amp;nbsp;

Izaiah shot an irritated glance around the table and continued after calming down a bit. “The Conclave has stood for over 14 milennia, encompassing Arenal from the very beginning with the explicit purpose of maintaining Order for all species that venture into Arenal. Your kind was once a frequent visitor, but have always lacked magic to open up the portals yourself. Lacking magic, your kind could also never ascend to Godhood. It is clear that has changed, and many questions are before us. As such, with the relevant parties present, the Conclave is *now* open for the first proceedings, the exchange of information.” After which Izaiah immediately smacked his empty palm onto the table, creating an unnatural gavel sound that echoed multiple times throughout the room.
&amp;nbsp;

“Excellent. Our first question is if it is possible for us to gain access to all the rules of the Conclave? This way we can continue in a way that is deemed *proper*” Stephen said, doing his best to bite back any sarcasm or cynicism.
&amp;nbsp;

“Of course. Access to the first level of the Codex of rules, subsequent versions, supplements, rulings, precedents, jurisprudence, and history of the Conclave and her dealings can be found in the First Archives. Anything that is not for mortal eyes are in the Second Archives and beyond. Don’t worry, you can’t accidentally stumble into them, those doors are locked.” Karottash the orcish God said with a calm demeanor.
&amp;nbsp;

The devil Zariel next to him grinned. “We shall grant you access now.”
&amp;nbsp;

Stephen immediately felt the room shift and move, like he was in an elevator. But after going up for a half a minute or so, he felt the room shift again, as though it was turning, and he was about to fall over. But to his surprise he did fall out of his chair, rather it seemed like gravity was being readjusted every few seconds so that he could sit normally. The Gods in front of him and the ones in the audience all acted like nothing was wrong, but his marines were clearly on edge.
&amp;nbsp;

“++Marines, stay alert. Tactical, they can manipulate gravitational forces.++” Stephen subvocalized.
&amp;nbsp;

After another ten more clicks the chamber stopped moving and the door behind him slowly opened, to reveal the inside of a massive library that spanned multiple floors and had bookshelves that seemed to be built from the branch of the world tree itself. The light from the outside barely seeped in due to the relatively small windows and the blocking leaves that absorbed all the sunlight. Instead the room was lit by the glow of the chamber Stephen was standing in. The five main Gods stood and started to move out of the room towards the library. Stephen slowly followed, after which the audience of Lesser Gods very slowly filed out of the room behind Stephen and his marines.
&amp;nbsp;

Following the five main Gods, Stephen quickly found himself in a side chamber of the library. But as more and more people filed in, the room lit up. Soon more of the transparent souls seemed to appear and lit candles, slowly revealing more of the room. The side-chamber turned into a recessed reading room, then a larger amphi-theater like arrangement with cushions in front of the bookshelves that were only expanding further out, until finally an entire arena was lit up. An arena-like room, filled to the brim with books and cushions in front of them. Ljordana smiled. “All the books you see here combined make up the first Codex of Rules and all accompanying literature.”
&amp;nbsp;

“++Preliminary scans reveal roughly a million books by volume, sir.++” A tactical officer said over comms.
&amp;nbsp;

Stephen almost audibly blinked. He turned around to face the five Gods and wanted to express his disbelief but stopped himself when he saw the wicked grin on the devil. They wouldn’t be grinning if this was a bad play on their part, unless they were particularly good at bluffing. Or underestimating humanity. If anything, they have misunderstood the fundamental nature of humanity’s progress. 
&amp;nbsp;

In a way Stephen could understand the devil’s reasoning. Stall the humans in a bureaucratic hellhole to get more secrets from their prisoner, in order to compete better on the long term, as competing military was clearly a no go. And if the humans refused to fight this ridiculous nightmare of endless rules that probably contradicted themselves to serve the ones who made them, then it would be the humans versus the Conclave, rather than just the humans versus the devils.
&amp;nbsp;

Stephen wasn’t sure yet, he had to ask a few more questions. “Are there any rules concerning learning the rules? Can I ask for help or such?”
&amp;nbsp;

Ljordana answered quickly. “Normally no, only the designated supreme is allowed to do so.”
&amp;nbsp;

That confirmed Stephen’s suspicion that the Conclave was basically an extremely elitist version of a boys club. “But if a supreme is a mortal, then how could they learn so many books and rules in time enough to ascend to Godhood?” Stephen asked.
&amp;nbsp;

The devil Zariel grinned. “They can request a sponsor, by joining another existing pantheon, or buy the information with gold or crystals. There are plenty of spells that can teach you the necessary material in mere months.”
&amp;nbsp;

The orc God, Karrotash, sighed and with downward eyes continued on that information. “That is the case usually, but I believe the Infernal pantheon will veto any such overture or action, as such, you are most definitely on your own.”
&amp;nbsp;

Stephen cursed internally. If it was war the Conclave wanted, then war they would get. But it was also clear that others didn’t feel particularly inclined to help the devils out in this matter. There had to be another way to deal with this, peacefully. For now, at least. Stephen glanced about the room to see if any person or creature was looking particularly angry or vexed at this situation as much as he was. Quickly he saw the giant God, who was talking to the Lesser giant God who came in before him. They were hard to miss. They had renaissance type clothing, where most others had more medieval styles, and they were obviously massive.
&amp;nbsp;

Stephen slowly walked towards the Giants who were whispering with each other angrily. They finally noticed when Stephen finally neared their feet. “You seem to be as unhappy about this situation as much as we are.” Stephen said. “Anything you can do to help out?”
&amp;nbsp;

“I will repeat, the giants were absent in the first proceedings and as such have no right to interfere in this judgement!” Izaiah shouted from behind Stephen’s back. Stephen wanted to ignore him and continue, but clearly the diplomatic relations were quite important as the giant Gods immediately stiffened up. Then the giant looked angry at the devil once more and then down at Stephen and seemed to come up with a plan.
&amp;nbsp;

“Argonan, don’t you think it’s strange that the humans are being judged as a single supreme, when it is quite clear that their entire race or at least a large subset must be supreme to have such a mountain flying through the air?” The larger giant God said in an almost earnest and questioning tone.
&amp;nbsp;

The other giant God was slow to pick up. “Uh, what?” The larger God stepped on his toes and the smaller giant understood the point. “Oh! Ah, yes, Drianon. It’s like the humans don’t understand that prospective supremes are allowed to help each other, thus still opening the door for entirely new pantheons to join the Conclave! Argh, that hurt.”
&amp;nbsp;

The devil roared in anger. “That is cheating!”
&amp;nbsp;

“Are you talking to me?” The giant God asked with fake confusion on his face. “I thought we weren’t allowed to interfere in these talks, so I was just talking to my companion here.”
&amp;nbsp;

“You were clearly addressing the human!” The devil Zariel shouted.
&amp;nbsp;

“What?” The giant God said with barely acted innocence. “Oh, I didn’t even notice the human! They are just so very small like the rest of you, that I must have mistakenly said that a bit too loud, but I assure you, I wasn’t addressing the human at all!”
&amp;nbsp;

“++Chen. I have a plan.++” Stephen subvocalized as he moved to the center of the room. He completely ignored the raging devil, looked around at the various creatures and peoples, coughed loudly and then proceeded to fake backpain. “Oh, my poor back! Woe is me!”
&amp;nbsp;

“++What are you doing?++” Chen asked incredulously. “++Backpain has been cured ages ago.++”
&amp;nbsp;

“Oh, my poor back, if only someone could help me!” Stephen now shouted.
&amp;nbsp;

“++Uh. Are you acting, sir? It looks really clumsy.++” Jacqueline asked. As Stephen complained some more, some of his marines and Arundosar came closer and started to crowd him a bit to try and figure out what was going on despite his terrible performance. Jacqueline then started laughing and turned on her speakers. “Sir! How horrible, how could we ever help you!?”
&amp;nbsp;

“None of you can!” Stephen shouted in a melodramatic fashion, clearly enjoying this far too much. “Not unless you remove my burden for me!”
&amp;nbsp;

“And what burden is that?” Jacqueline said with too much enthusiasm while some others started sighing over comms.
&amp;nbsp;

“All that gold that I have to carry, there’s just so much of it, I couldn’t possibly cure my aching back unless someone took my gold from me!” Stephen shouted.
&amp;nbsp;

“Oh no! If only some hero would volunteer!” Jacqueline continued as Stephen surreptitiously eyed the room to confirm that he had everyone’s rapt attention.
&amp;nbsp;

“Worse yet!” Stephen almost whispered in a Razzie worthy performance. “The only place to get treatment is to go home to so many other *learned* humans who are super smart and read all day for a living! And how can we get home without some magical crystals in order to go back and forth a bit?”
&amp;nbsp;

Izaiah and Zariel were both furiously demanding attention and started shouting, but it wasn’t enough as the room erupted into the loud bustle of a trading floor. Then the two giants started laughing and the larger one started speaking in his loud and deep voice that easily dominated over all the other voices. “I seem to have misplaced some gold piles. About the size of my foot, give or take a pinky toe. In fact, I miss my gold so much that I am willing to donate a finder’s fee upfront of about 4, maybe 5 large magical crystals.”
&amp;nbsp;

Chen sighed loudly. “++I cannot believe that *that* is working.++”
&amp;nbsp;

**Paralegal Selene Nwatu – Dimensional Plane of Earth – U.S.A., New York City, Harlem – 1 Month and 1 day since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

A familiar sounding voice came through the merciless gap underneath the door and bothered Selene. “Selene. Selene!” She ignored it and drifted back to a wonderful sleep. She was vaguely aware of her phone buzzing and somehow managed the neat trick of turning it off and stuffing it under her pillow, whilst staying completely covered, cozy, and warm underneath her blankets.
&amp;nbsp;

The door almost flung open with a crash. “Selene! Wake up, now! You have to watch the news, baby!” 
&amp;nbsp;

Selene moaned. “Uuugh, mom, leave me alone, it’s Sunday!”
&amp;nbsp;

“What!? It’s Monday! Sweetie, wake up, the news!” her mother shouted as she grabbed onto Selene’s blankets and started tugging them away, eventually dragging Selene onto her bedroom floor with them.
&amp;nbsp;

Before Selene had a chance to react to this indignity however, her phone started buzzing again, except this time it was through an emergency channel from her boss that automatically got picked up by her implants and augments. Selene almost audibly blinked as her boss’ ringtone simultaneously yelled at her.
&amp;nbsp;

“Selene, finally you’re picking up! Are you watching the news!? Wait, are you still asleep or something?” Michael asked. “Never mind, I know it’s the first day of your new contract and you’re not an intern anymore, but that just means you’re getting paid better to deal with my bullshit. Get up, watch the news while you wake up and get ready for one helluva day!”
&amp;nbsp;

Between her mother and her boss, Selene was having serious difficulty waking up properly. “ Wuh, mom? Mr. Scarpino? What’s going on!?” Selene asked out loud as she finally dug her way out of the blankets.
&amp;nbsp;

Within moments her mother had helped Selene into the shower and had the right news clips forwarded so that Selene could watch in the bathroom while she made breakfast.
&amp;nbsp;

Selene stared at the UN’s address, and then the POTUS’ address with an open mouth for a long time. Then she stared at the UN recorded footage of the other dimension. She completely ignored her breakfast as she stared at glowing elf *Gods*, an audience of mythological creatures, and the massive world tree.

**Commander Sam Robinson – Valkyrie – Dimensional Plane of Hell – Somewhere on the first layer of Hell – 1 Month and 1 day since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Sam took a deep breath and pretended that it wasn’t the recycled air she’d been breathing for a while now. It was a new day and that meant time for new victims and more walking. She scanned her surroundings and the large group of devils that were chasing her half a day ago hadn’t found her, nor were they anywhere near her. Her battery levels had depleted somewhat due to staying active to keep her alive under the rock, but she was still in the healthy margins. Sam activated her servos and dug herself out of the rock and stone that was all around her.
&amp;nbsp;

The view had changed somewhat. It was less volcano-y and more just bleak with the occasional firestorm. Though out in the distance it still rained burning rocks. Thinking about it, it didn’t really surprise her much. It was Hell after all. She checked her vitals and other signs and realized that, yes, just like yesterday, if a lack of battery power didn’t kill her then a lack of water and food would.
&amp;nbsp;

She scanned the surroundings again and started moving towards the area that was ever so slightly cooler. Her reasoning being that if it was cooler there, maybe she could find a spot that was cool enough for water to not instantly evaporate. If she had water, and enough battery power, she could use her internal suit tools to create some hydrogen and get some fuel for an emergency. She would also get more oxygen, but apparently despite being Hell, the air was full of it. She would also no longer have to use the *clearly* untested sanitary tools and re-use her own waste. They were uncomfortable and their very own version of Hell.
&amp;nbsp;

Another nice thing would be a high vantage point that wasn’t a damned volcano, so she could scout the immediate surrounding area better. Or at least a stable and not at all brittle hilltop. But those didn’t exist in her vicinity, so she kept moving.
&amp;nbsp;

Her sensors beeped, and she stopped and analyzed it. Some sound, coming from the northwest. She slowly creeped closer and saw about a hundred regular devils clearly trying to scout around and find her. These devils were the very easy to kill ones with only one pit fiend leading them. Sam grinned and gripped her sword. Time for some breakfast for the suit.

**Paralegal Selene Nwatu – Dimensional Plane of Earth – U.S.A., New York City, Downtown Manhattan – 1 Month and 1 day since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

“What!? Why me!?” Selene asked as her boss pointed to her. “I don’t even know if I want to go!”
&amp;nbsp;

Michael Scarpino shrugged. “Ah, don’t worry about it. It’ll be fine.”
&amp;nbsp;

Selene almost collapsed from the nerves and stress. “But, I was an intern just 3 days ago! I signed a contract just a week ago, I’m way too young and inexperienced!”
&amp;nbsp;

“Well, that’s why I am coming with you.” Michael answered with a smile and a wink. “Besides, being new and inexperienced is a *good* thing!
&amp;nbsp;

Selene only stared at him with an incredulous look as she ignored the either jealous or relieved faces of her colleagues. “Yeah, you’re new, meaning that you only know the very basics of law and haven’t really specialized yet.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Yes I did, in college.” Selene replied whereupon Michael immediately raised his hand.
&amp;nbsp;

“Eh, like I said, not really specialized yet. And that means that we can fuel a growth spurt of specializations into elf, orc, or whatever kind of fantasy creature law, that various government agencies will pay out their ass for, with you at the head from the very start!” Michael responded with with great enthusiasm and clear mental hand wringing.
&amp;nbsp;

“But wasn’t the massive recruitment for lawyers and paralegals for the Gods and pantheons and stuff?” Selene tried to counter argue. “Why don’t they ask the Vatican!?”
&amp;nbsp;

Michael just smiled and nodded. “Because we’re more expensive, American, and *not-biased*! Hah! We’re going to be so rich!”
&amp;nbsp;

“What Michael meant to say was that every member of the UN is allowed to send their own contingent of lawyers, either in a fixed size if they were going with the U.N.S.D.F. ships, or a practically unfixed size if their own country sends their own ships.” George, Michael’s partner at the lawfirm, said with a slightly smaller smile.
&amp;nbsp;

Michael’s smile grew bigger and it almost seemed like his eyes were replaced by dollar signs. “Selene, you brought your travel bag with you, right? After all, your country needs you!”

**Commander Sam Robinson – Valkyrie – Dimensional Plane of Hell – Somewhere on the first layer of Hell – 1 Month and 2 days since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Despite the temperature having dropped to a cool 50 degrees Celsius [122 Fahrenheit], Sam still hadn’t found any traces of liquid water. Throughout the past days her atmospheric collectors also found no humidity to drain. For about 6 hours now her HUD had been flashing warnings of running low on H2O specifically. She wasn’t going to last long at this rate, so for the past 2 hours she had been scouting and climbing a nearby mountain that was along a route that was being patrolled by a group of about 30 devils, led by a single larger devil. 
&amp;nbsp;

And for the past hour she had been constructing a trap at the top of the mountain. The rocks here were less volcanic and porous, and far heavier, which suited her purposes just fine. After constructing the trap she waited for about another 10 minutes, getting ready for the patrol group to move into position. When they finally did, Sam smiled and gripped her sword and pulled it out of position, removing a lynchpin that held back a couple dozen heavy rocks that started to tumble down towards the group’s position.
&amp;nbsp;

As the rocks started to tumble down they inevitably crashed into more rocks, taking them down with them and causing a small avalanche. Just like Sam intended. She waited for a few more moments and started to rush down, following the rocks, while bellowing a mighty war cry. The combined crash of rocks and her echoing cry of havoc through her speakers reverberated to reach the path below and shocked the devils.
&amp;nbsp;

For an instant Sam saw the devils see her, recognize her, and turn to flee. Then the dust cloud of the avalanche obscured her vision too much and she turned to infrared. The smaller devils were fast enough that they escaped the avalanche, but she still managed to hit about 10 of the devils with the heavy rocks. As she arrived on the scene just seconds later, she realized that the larger devil that was leading them was barely her size. In other words, no match at all. He had escaped the big rocks falling on him, but was blinded by the dust cloud. Sam quickly stuck him like a pig and recharged her suit’s batteries.
&amp;nbsp;

Looking around her, the remaining devils were either dead or fleeing, so Sam quickly powered her servos and ran in pursuit of the slowest one she could see. Within half a minute she grabbed onto him, a regular soldier devil. She smacked his steel sword and shield away with an easy kick and grabbed onto his neck and snapped it. Then she cut a few wounds into his neck. She held the limp body aloft, opened her atmospheric collectors, and essentially tried to wrung him like an especially grotesque towel, draining his blood. It didn’t really speed up the process, if anything it slowed as she heard bones cracking and muscles tearing.
&amp;nbsp;

She waited until she had collected about 2 liters [half a gallon] of the devil’s blood, and closed her atmospheric collectors. As she threw the body down she realized that the dust cloud had settled and that there were a couple of the devils all watching her, fear in their eyes.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam smiled and realized that she could use it to run a bit of a fear campaign. “Mmmh, tastes so sweet.” She loudly moaned through her speakers, then started to move towards the nearest devil, who quickly started to run away in fear. Sam used her laser to shoot and kill another 10 or so devils, leaving the last 10 to live and tell others what happened.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam pretended to pursue, but after a few halfhearted jogs she instead started to move deeper into nearby canyons to rest and further analyze the blood with her limited tool. And also to get away from the flying patrols that were getting more frequent each half a day or so.
&amp;nbsp;

Once she had found a secluded spot and scanned the surrounding area, Sam put her newly acquired fluids to the regular sterilization and filtering process. It wasn’t the perfect guarantee that nothing alien was going to stay out, but water molecules were one of the smallest, so unless the devils had something even smaller or stranger than that, Sam would be fine.
&amp;nbsp;

While waiting for the hours long filtering process, she wondered about the definitions of cannibalism and if it counted in this scenario, and what she was going to have to do when her emergency rations would run out in another few days. Briefly she thought about what advice she would give if she ever got back to Earth, and it would probably entail something like a travelling bag of sorts, filled with food and water, and other supplies, like soldiers used to carry in humanity’s past. Or at least better tools to help the recycling of the nutrient and liquid lifecycle in her suit.
&amp;nbsp;

After an hour or so Sam decided that she was getting too thirsty and took a healthy glug of the filtered and sterilized water. It tasted like regular water. Satisfied, Sam took a nap.
&amp;nbsp;

**Paralegal Selene Nwatu – Dimensional Plane of Earth – In orbit over the North Pole – 1 Month and 2 days since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

“Alright everyone, heads up! We’re about to embark on a great mission for humanity, and the good old U.S. of A!” The pilot said with a lot of enthusiasm over the various communication channels. “You’ll be the first civilians to enter a new dimension since centuries and as part of that, I’ll be patching through the final address of Admiral Stephen Dai of the U.N.S.D.F., while we wait in line to go through the wormhole that is on the North Pole.”
&amp;nbsp;

Selene looked down at her tablet and saw an incoming request to switch to a new channel. As she did she saw the by now familiar face of admiral Stephen Dai, the man who had led the mission into the other side against the devil invaders. Details as to how the UN had established control over the wormhole technology were all classified and only hyped up the mystery behind the man who is said to have a cybernetic eye that he didn’t like using, instead preferring to use paper.
&amp;nbsp;

Bits of confidential information, or rumours and gossip, had all come from her boss who was sitting next to Selene. Despite his sometimes sleazy behavior and almost aggressive greed, she had to hand it to him, he always found himself in the right positions to kiss the next client’s ass just right to get both the case, the relevant information, as well as the top price. In this particular scenario, Michael had maneuvered himself into this extremely important case as part of a contingent of 1.500 or so civilian contractors that would have to help the government’s lawyers and legislators in the extremely unlikely scenario that an advanced alien civilization popped up out of nowhere and the various gaps between their laws would have to be smoothed out and understood in all contexts, to allow for bilateral and multilateral treaties.
&amp;nbsp;

And in part of this scenario, Michael had apparently already figured out that admiral Dai did *not* embark humanity’s first mission into this new dimension. “Why risk so many high-profile and rich lawyers and legislators from almost every nation in Earth’s solar system, on a mission so soon, when he himself just went to this dimension just 2 days ago!?” Michael had asked.
&amp;nbsp;

Selene didn’t know the answer, but Michael continued, his years of experience blending with his expert gossiping skills. “It doesn’t make sense at all, it would be far too risky! *Unless* you already know of all the risks involved. Unless you already know you can breathe the air, unless you know you can safeguard the civilians, unless, unless, unless.” Michael smiled.
&amp;nbsp;

“Unless you had a team on the other side already when the devils first attacked New York a month ago.” Selene had answered a day ago. And now, on her tablet, she was receiving *a lot* of confidential information.
&amp;nbsp;

“Greetings, esteemed lawyers and civilians of the United Nations of Humanity.” Stephen Dai said as Selene gave an occasional glance at him, while furiously trying to simultaneously pour over the content of the newly received dossiers.
&amp;nbsp;

“You are gathered here as the civilian contingent and are an integral part of the United Nations’ Alien Preparation Plan, or the UN APP, that was established roughly half a century ago. There are more than 22.000 of you, all from various backgrounds and nations. Each of you diverse and different, in both your personal aspects as well as professionally.” Stephen said with a hint of tiredness. He certainly looked like he hadn’t slept these past two days.
&amp;nbsp;

“Each of you has already been background checked thoroughly, and each of you has already been briefed many times on what to do, what not to do, how to do what, and most importantly, how not to do what. And each of you has already been briefed on the scenario we are up against and what your personal detail and mission is. So I’ll not mince words and get right to the point.” Stephen said, after which Michael elbowed Selene in the side to get her attention and essentially warn her that the admiral was about to say something very important.
&amp;nbsp;

“Your main mission is to prevent an all out war with the Conclave of the Gods, which roughly operates like our UN and sadly enough has the membership of our actual enemy, the pantheon of devils. As stated before, each of you will focus on different areas to try and get the Conclave on our side, or at least to make sure they do not interfere, so that we can effectively fight the devils with minimal collateral damage and maintaining the defence of Earth. This could mean trying to find loopholes the devils could use, try and find jurisprudence to help our case to obtain more magical crystals, or other examples of mission objectives. But there is a second mission.” Stephen said as Michael almost immediately erupted with a gotcha motion.
&amp;nbsp;

“Before I continue, I will remind you all that as part of this mission you have all signed legally binding contracts that will try you for *treason* if you break protocol and confidentiality rules.” The admiral said with an extremely stern look that reminded Selene of her great grandfather from when she was a child.
&amp;nbsp;

“Your second mission has been deemed of equal importance during a secret session of General Assembly of the United Nations, and it concerns the rescue of a lost marine, presumed POW.” Stephen almost sighed as he said it. “Commander Samantha Robinson is presumed to have been captured and transported through a portal to Hell 2 days ago. She is most likely being tortured for valuable intel and is in an extremely vulnerable position.”
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Commander Sam Robinson – Valkyrie – Dimensional Plane of Hell – Somewhere on the first layer of Hell – 1 Month and 3 days since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

“Aw, shit.” Sam muttered against the inside of her helmet as she watched from behind some rocks. Above her there were about two dozen flying devils circling around the mountaintops some half a kilometer to her south. They were getting closer to her trail. It was inevitable really, as they were adapting to her method of guerilla warfare.
&amp;nbsp;

The devils on land were moving in larger numbers and seemed to be going to try and encircle her, over lines of kilometers, while the devils in the sky were going higher to avoid getting shot by her. There were less and less of the smaller patrols, and more of those pit fiends. Clearly, they understood that they were underestimating her.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam was confident the fliers didn’t see her yet as she slowly crept closer to a more advantageous position. She calculated their trajectories and distance, and then the appropriate firing solutions. Sam wasn’t worried about being seen as she had been covered in a sticky mess of blood for a while now and as a result her white and sky-blue exterior was now covered in a coating of dust, sand and rocks.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam put her laser’s output on low, so that it could rapid fire fast enough to hit every target in about 10 seconds. She stabilized her footing and fired, causing a disco-outburst of blue lights to shoot out and strike their targets almost instantly. Half a second later all flying devils immediately started to tumble and struggled to glide down. The shots were weak enough to cripple or hurt one wing and not much else, but that was plenty for Sam as she grabbed her sword and started moving towards the other mountaintop on her own leisure.
&amp;nbsp;

By the time Sam arrived she saw that the devils had banded together and were in a defensive formation. The instant they saw her, they started to throw fireballs, but Sam simply raised her barrier and darted between the rocks and absorbed the few relatively weak shots that did hit her. It didn’t take long for Sam to close the distance and use her sword to cull their numbers quickly and efficiently.
&amp;nbsp;

By the time about half of them were left, Sam deliberately started to punch them to the ground, to try and knock them out. When she was done, about 4 were left alive enough for her to interrogate. Sam needed to figure out her food situation and perhaps the beginnings of an escape plan. And while Sam was okay with *purifying* the blood of already dead devils to use to drink, sort of, as it was theoretically *only* the water molecules, but directly eating their flesh was a bit too off putting.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam needed more intel. And remembering that Arundosar was taken as a slave by the devils, it would make sense that the devils held their slaves somewhere in Hell. And they wouldn’t survive without proper food and water, and less hellish temperatures.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam grabbed two of four the surviving devils, turned on her loudspeakers and started talking in elven. “Where is the food? Where are the slaves you keep? Where is it colder? Point in the right direction and I’ll let you live!”
&amp;nbsp;

The two devils both snarled and one spit blood on her helmet. Sam grabbed them both by the heads and smashed them together. Sam turned around and moved towards the other two and held them in a similar manner. Again she asked, but this time the devils seemed to be confused and didn’t seem to understand her, or simply seemed to be too scared to reply properly. Sam sighed, then realized her translators knew dwarven too.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam asked again, in dwarven. “Where do you keep your slaves!? Where will it be colder? Tell me and I’ll let you live!”
&amp;nbsp;

One of the devils seemed to understand as he nodded and started to speak in broken dwarfish. “There, to the southwest, it’ll be colder there, with plenty of slaves. It’s over there, about a days’ worth of flying, across the mountain range, there is a headquarters there next to one of the main slave towns! Please, let me go!”
&amp;nbsp;

Sam didn’t know if the devil was telling the truth or if he was luring her into a trap, but she had to make a choice soon regardless. She let both devils go, moved towards one of the bleeding out ones and decided to fill up her water reservoir. As she turned back around she realized that the devils were staring at her with horrified looks, then got scared shitless, and started crawling away as fast as they could.
&amp;nbsp;

Sam didn’t care for now, instead she was content to snack on her semi-last ration, and very happy to find out that it had a bit of cocoa powder alongside it. Sam drank a bit of hot cocoa and snacked on her beef stroganoff, as she took a bit of rest, watching the sunset behind vast mountain ranges in front of her. She was feeling quite relaxed, all things considered, especially as she watched the two devils crawl away behind the rocks in the distance, giving her a slight feeling of victory.

**Paralegal Selene Nwatu – Dimensional Plane of Arenal – Yggdrasil – 1 Month and 3 days since the Infernal invasion of Earth**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

It was just the first day of work, but Selene was already feeling completely overwhelmed. The world tree was enormous, the library they were in was without compare, and the special chamber with the *first* level of the Conclave’s rules was filled with a million books.
&amp;nbsp;

Thankfully the work was simple enough. She was the least experienced and least knowledgeable in the entire contingent of legal workers and that meant that she was relegated to scanning and sorting. Under heavy guard by the marines she would start picking books, put it in the automatic scanner and try and help the algorithms decide what language it was written in, translate it, and afterwards skim through the contents to try and find out what the topics broadly were.
&amp;nbsp;

Her work was worsened by the fact that all these books were incredibly dense, seemed counterintuitive and even at times contradictory by the 100th book, and lacked any kind of structure or introduction about half of the time.
&amp;nbsp;

Then her eyes lit up as she found a book that detailed the discovery of humans some millennia ago, and the subsequent rules that were put into place that kept humanity under deliberate isolation. She tagged the book’s digital file and immediately escalated it up the chain of command.

I recently completed my B.S. degree in Computer Engineering, a curriculum that aimed to combine portions of electrical engineering and computer science, with a little bit on computer architecture. I am now trying to find work but have been experiencing a slew of rejections and want to know what I might be doing wrong.

In my undergraduate degree I specifically concentrated in robotic/ control engineering while also dabbling quite a bit in image processing content. Yet, as I began searching for jobs in this field, I found many positions were reserved to those with graduate degrees. I decided to explore and got quite involved in embedded controls in my final two semesters, in hopes of widening my options.

In addition, to my class work, I held two internships at NASA. One as a automated test software developer and another as a web application developer. While both were exciting experiences, neither gave me the more hardware side of computer engineering that i was interested in. In a final internship i worked for a Fortune 500 firm to develop algorithms on an FPGA.

I now seem to be in an odd predicament. Most hardware positions seem to quickly reject my resume, as much of my experience is pure software (i have some hardware experience from personal projects and undergraduate research, but nothing professional). On the other hand, pure software positions do tend to reach out to me more often, but I am somewhat underqualified and struggle with their coding interviews (I primarily work in Python, Matlab, and C).

Ideally I'd like to work with the hardware in robotic systems, designing robots, or developing image processing algorithms. But i feel for now, at least until I can afford graduate school, I need to go for something more entry level. Does anyone have any advice on my situation. Should I continue diversifying into pure embedded and hardware level topics, or should I be persistent and keep hunting for robotics positions.

Cheers!"

I am currently a sophomore at a good Liberal Arts College, I say good because I really like the CS department here. This summer I am in talk with one of my cs professors for the summer research. I have already submitted the draft of my research proposal and the deadline to submit the final version is soon. I applied to twitter and Microsoft and got rejected from twitter for an internship, maybe because I don't have any side projects (which I am working on right now including the ios app development using react native and next reason is it's twitter and very competitive). I am really on the big dilemma right now, I can't decide if I will have to apply for internship and not do the research or do the research now.

As next year is my only shot remaining for the internship, I am quite worried about what should I do this summer. As I am an international student, it is very important to get an internship next year at the least. As I am going for industry immediately after graduation, one part of me is telling me to apply for as many internships possible. But, the next part of me is also telling that if I reject the research opportunity right now and end up not getting internship as well, that will be the worst of all.

 I have talked to professors and they told me that research also counts like 85% like an internship while applying for next year internship, as recruiters won't push that out of boat while hiring interns. So, I am really confused on what I should do. Although I really like a CS department here, some part of me is also telling me to try to transfer into research and technical colleges just to be assured of getting jobs in software development. Here is list of things I have included in my resume, please suggest on what should I do or suggest me about my next path.

* Currently a sophomore,
* Major GPA: 3.83, overall: 3.75
* Taken classes in C++ (Object Oriented, proofs, Algorithm Analysis, Data Systems, Data Analytics, Algorithm Design, and some Math courses)
* Work as a student employee in 2 different departments of ITS (Help Desk and Deskside Support), also in Scholarly Engagement Center
* Also a Resident Assistant RA (if that will mean anything LOL)
* Received two awards from Math and CS department for good performance during the freshman year
* Some community services back home and here.

As I don't have any side projects right now and just starting to learn .net and node.js, I am not that hopeful of landing an internship, so please recommend me on what I may do this summer. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Cheers!"

I have an undergrad degree in Mathematics (with a minor in econ so I generally understand how markets work, if that helps) and am a year away from being done with a MS in Computer Science. Up until recently I was convinced I wanted to work in tech in a generic software engineering role but my recent exposure to AI and Machine Learning and some research made me realize that there's a developing role for someone like this in finance, working with more interesting and volatile data than I could hope to in tech. My degree is general so I'm not specifically a data scientist but I data science and quantitative analytics really interest me.


I'm wondering what resources I can look to in order to start learning about finance in general. I've done an internship in tech before but am interested in doing one in finance that would allow me to explore the area I mentioned, if possible, but I would like to have a better idea of what I'm getting myself into. Also if anyone knows of companies I should research that have entry level/internship positions in that area that would also be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I've just graduated college and got a job as a Software Developer at a VERY small non-tech company (my boss is the only developer). Benefits are quite good, pay is fine for my area, but I'm just having so much trouble with my boss and I'm still struggling with the work.

When I started 6 months ago, there were 2 new hires. Me and another girl (both right out of college). This girl quit about a month ago because of my bosses attitude.

I struggle immensely at programming. This is NOT impostor syndrome which seems to get thrown around so much on this subreddit. I struggled so much during my computer science degree and am still struggling in my current job. I study every single night and I'm still having trouble. I went to a very good university, and I'm terrible at programming, so this is another joke my boss likes to make about my skill level.

 On paper, my boss is an excellent mentor. He reviews every single line of code I write. He's always on Skype and answers my questions (albeit, usually with much sarcasm and criticism about how I don't know this). I love that he's giving me tons of advice. I clearly need it, and I don't want this to stop. The problem is just how he treats me. He's nice to everybody in the office, but when dealing with me, he's just... mean. I've been here 6 months so far, and he yells often at how many mistakes I'm still making after being here for half a year. He said he expected me to make these mistakes for the first month, but says I need to start pulling my weight and closing out tickets more frequently. He's right. I make a lot of mistakes. I feel like such an idiot, I still mess up on basic tasks. I take notes on everything he tells me and I study in my free time. I'm just having so much trouble. I know that I need to improve and work harder at this job.

I'm a pretty quiet kid. I've never had problems in any of my internships with anybody. I've never had somebody's face get so red or sound so frustrated when talking to me. He told me that my skill level frustrates him. I feel terrible every night and every night before falling asleep I feel so terrible knowing I'll have to go back to face him. He makes me feel so stupid and I get a long talk about once a week that I ""have to work on everything"".

The thing is, I don't think he'll fire me. Because although he says this stuff, he sort of tries to comfort me afterwards, but then goes right back to his normal angry self after a few hours. He says he knows I'm working hard, and to keep doing my best. Honestly, this may sound comforting, but we literally have this talk every 1-2 weeks. After the other girl quit, he talked with me and made it clear he didn't want me to quit. I don't really want to quit either.. I don't really want to get back in the job hunt after only 6 months. But as draining as that process was, it might be what I need to do.

I'm just ranting. I don't know how to deal with my boss and just wondered if anybody else had similar experiences. After the other girl quit, we had a talk about things, and he was really nice to me for that single week. But things have since went back to normal and I feel as though he hates me."

Now it is time to obtain an internship but when it comes to the interviews or coding questions in particular I'm hitting a serious wall. I would consider myself below average in programming but I would know the ""correct"" direction in approaching the problem, the issue is I cannot produce anything on the screen because I tend to constantly forget syntax of what data structure I would like to use, which destroys me.

I'm trying to get my application in for the OMSCS program and I have a couple quick questions about my application.

1.	Will it hurt my chances to have three letters of rec coming from my internship when I’m an undergraduate graduating in the Spring?
2.	I had a 2.9 final GPA in community college before I started in University. My University classes were mostly CS courses and I have a 3.6. There is a clear upward trajectory as my first 2 semesters in community college were all Cs in core classes as I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. Do you think I should bother explaining this in the statement of purpose? If they were to look at my transcripts I don’t think they would question my academic ability too much from it. I went from getting an F in intermediate algebra to getting all A’s in 5 courses with 4 being 300-level CS courses.
3.	Am I late in the application process to have not submitted the application already? I know the deadline says March 1st but people have been acting like I’m behind.

&amp;#x200B;

If you would like, I’ve provided more information below in case it helps with my question. Thank you!

**Background**: I am an undergraduate student graduating in May with a BSCS. Two of my letters of rec are from managers at my internship. One of my managers wrote a letter for me in the past that was very glowing, and I feel that the other manager I asked will have a good letter as well. I was planning to get the third letter from a professor but I’ve run into difficulty with her. I have taken 5 CS classes with her and gotten all A’s in her courses. I know this professor well and I was shocked that she said she would only write me a letter for our school’s graduate program and not the Georgia Tech program because she feels that her title as “Lecturer” won’t carry any weight. She referred me to other professors, but I could try to press her more. I have felt okay about my chances of getting into the program until speaking with her and now I am not entirely sure as she was so discouraging and acted like our school is my only option.

* **Academic Goals:** To achieve my masters so that I can pursue applied research at the national laboratory I currently intern at. I am also interested in pursuing potential research at Georgia Tech in my fields of interest (Cybersecurity, software design/architecture, machine learning, and neural networks)
* **Career Goals:** To continue working full-time at the national laboratory while pursuing my master’s degree and to apply it to issues regarding national security.
* **Academic History:** BS in CS with minor in Management, overall 3.6 GPA. First two years of college were at a community college with a finished 2.9 GPA there.
* **Professional Experience:** K-12 math tutor and a computer science tutor for about a semester. Just passed 1 year mark interning at a national laboratory which has involved work with large-scale microservices, penetration testing using Kali Linux, and some neural networks experience (creating a model for the CIFAR-10 dataset).
* **Programming Languages:** Java, C, Python, Matlab are the main ones. We do learn assembly and VHDL.
* **Personal Projects:** I have all of my academic code available on my Github. Outside of that, I have worked on a couple of video games, a small website, and a virtual reality application. I also have participated in 3 coding competitions, 1 48-hour game development event, and I won one of the coding competitions while 4th placing in another.
* **Awards:** A few $500-1000 scholarships."

1. E-Commerce, Mobile, Internet Application Development

* strong programming and analytical skills to develop and implement E-Commerce and web solutions for clients
* core courses: business application programming, internet applications development, wireless systems and mobile applications, business applications using java, and eBusiness: application and management

1. Network and Security

* administration and management of corporate network, performs security analysis and design, project planning, control, and implementation; information security planning, engineering, and architecture for the organization
* core courses: intro to business telecommunications, local area networks, systems integration and security, network modeling and simulation

Which one would give me more prospects after graduation?  I've read that fresh graduates in IS major with no experience are hired mostly in help desk/desktop support. If so, which option do you think would give me the best amount of knowledge in school that I would need to advance in the IT industry?

Some background: I'm female (I read somewhere that some companies are interested in hiring more female employees because there's lack of them, such as in programming), around Long Beach/LA area but willing to relocate if there's a better opportunity, working on getting an internship, good grades \~3.5 GPA

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask, what to companies in such countries demand?

Over here, companies hire interns because of law-requirements or benefits. Therefore, they don't really care about your experience, just that you have basic understandings of CS/programming. Internships rarely guarantee that you will get a job at the company in the future. I ask because it could be different in western countries.

&amp;#x200B;

And another problem is that I have poor grades (GPA of 2.98) and haven't got much related experience at all. 

I actually took 3 years away from this field to do my military service and enjoy my hobbies.

1. Though I have received no lower than a B on any programming-related course (e.g., Java, C, Unix programming, Web development), I've never gotten anything higher than a C on math-related subjects because I hated math. I just got back to studying Data Structures and Algorithms now that I realize their importance, but I can't do anything to change my grades.
2. The only ""experience"" that I have outside of school projects is running and writing plugins for a Linux minecraft server.

With my low grades and lack of experience, would expecting an internship in the US or a EU company be unrealistic?

I graduated with a Masters Degree in Finance and Risk Management in Belgium (not with an exceptional GPA). I did a finance internship in San Francisco for course credit and decided that I wanted to work in the USA and in Investment Banking. 

I knew I needed additional experience to get a job in the USA so I started an M&amp;A internship in a boutique in Belgium (not internationally known). It is a small team but with big deals, so I have been learning a lot. This week they gave me a pretty good full-time offer. My question now is the following: What is the best choice with the goal of a career in the USA?

1) Go for an additional internship right now. Go with the experience of these 2 internships towards an internship abroad and hope for a return offer. 

2) Take the full time offer and get 1-2 years of great experience. Since it’s a small team I have a lot of responsibility, exposure to the clients and buyers (PE’s) and thus a steep learning curve.

I don’t know what would give me the best chance of obtaining a job in the US. The first option looks the easiest one but is very uncertain. The second one is a guarantee of experience (within an internationally unknown company) and great pay but then i’d have to directly apply for a full time job in the US which sounds way harder to secure.

My apologies for the long question, thank you in advance."

Really confused as to why I got rejected. I thought I would really get into UVA. I put a lot of attention to my UVA essays, spent time on them. I wanna say I was yield protected because it'll make me feel better, but at the end of the day, nobody knows why except the admissions panel. I wasn't even deferred, just straight up rejected, my first one. Maybe it's also because nobody from my school really goes to UVA, even the ones who are accepted. But my stats on naviance were aligned with the people from previous years that got in. Anyways, I got into Georgia Tech. I'm still really annoyed at UVA, like really, really, really annoyed. But I guess this just means I'm meant for better schools. Let's hope I get some good news come March. If anyone wants to postulate a hypothesis on my rejection, feel free. "

Hello I'm 23, I've been working since last June from a help desk internship to a full time Help desk contact job. I'll be going back to school next fall and I'm at a crossroads. Long story short I have a visual impairment, I struggled in math growing up. I always loved technology and enjoy programming and networking. When I told my mom I wanted to major in computer science two years ago she said she wouldn't pay for my tuition if I majored in CS due to the math requirements. Now that I'm older and I understand why I struggled with math.

(A) I never studied

(B) I wasn't interested

(C) I realized I lacked the foundational skills required.

(D) Some of the teachers/ Professors treated me like I was a nuisance because of my disability.

I enjoy math more now, Don't find it as boring as I  did when I was younger. I really want this degree,  want to actually become good at math, not be afraid. I'm just unsure of how to go about it. I'm thinking of transferring to Farmingdale with my AAS degree in IT, taking the majority of the CS courses there while still transferring my credits.

Thanks!

*Edit, forget to mention, I got an A in Algebra/Trig and a C+(79.45) in Pre-calc. Like everyone else I realized once I actually put in the work by studying the book, notes practice problems I did fine, I'm willing to put in whatever hours nessicary to become good at math and get a CS degree, my only worry is how much time I'll still be in college. I already started to review my algebra/trig  for next fall.*"

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, I moved to Salt Lake City to attend a bootcamp that taught the fundamentals of JavaScript, ReactJS, ReactNative, Ruby/Rails, SQL, etc and I've been on the job hunt for about a month now. I've sent out about 3 dozen resumes and gotten I believe 3 phone interviews. It's been discouraging and I can't imagine having to do this for 6 months, but of course will if that is what it takes. I can't afford to spend money to go back to school, but most places seem to see a CS degree as sort of a tiebreaker between candidates, from what i've heard.

So not to draw this out..But do you guys have any advice on what to put my effort into project/networking/resume wise for an aspiring self-taught dev here? My plan so far is to create a few sites/games in React/React Native that show my skill and hope that I can get a foot in the door for an internship or a junior dev position. I also attend meetups regularly.  I have been reviewing the fundamentals and prepping every day for interview questions. I'm studying around 4 hours a day and committing to github most every day. I do have a few projects up online, but they are nothing more than simple apps that most anyone could do with a tutorial.

&amp;#x200B;

My hunch is that I probably won't get a chance unless I can personally network with someone to allow me to get an internship. Do companies look kindly on folks who are hungry who ask about internships without there being an online posting, paid or nonpaid, and turn in resumes in person, or does that seem desperate and unprofessional?

I also think that in terms of technologies, I need to narrow down my skillset...which is why i've focused my efforts into JavaScript/React/ReactNative, Node, etc. I like Ruby and Rails, but I don't see as many job postings for this position.

Any words of advice appreciated."

I’m a freshmen in college in Florida and my best friend is in New York. I have been close friends with this guy since lower school. We always hung out, always talked, always laughed. We were practically inseparable. During the last half of high school it got to the point were we barely had to say anything to each other to get ourselves to die from laughter, because we already knew the joke the other one would say before they said it. We would often say the same thing at the same time (sometimes I would say the thing he was thinking before he said it, which would cause him to exclaim, “you motherfucker I was gonna say that” or something along those lines.) We made countless inside jokes with one another, one of which was just the sound of the letter “s”. We had very similar classes for all of high school, we were both interested in the same things (computer science), and although I’ll never admit it to him, he is much better at it than I am. We both played video games together (I mean a lot of video games). We both developed our taste in games, him, more of a turned based strategy game and RPG kinda guy that occasionally dabbled in MOBA’s and shooters, while I was the opposite. I enjoyed shooters and RTS games and played MOBA’s as well. We both played games together all the time, he dominated anything to do with strategy, and I dominated anything to do with precise aim and quick reactions. I’m getting off topic. 

Anyways, in senior year, he got a girlfriend. Now, I had heard all the memes about when a guy gets a girlfriend, his friend group suffers. I can attest to that. There were many a time where I would ask him, “Hey are you free this weekend?” And he would look to his girlfriend and look back and say with a smirk, “uh sorry man looks like my calendar is full”. Even this became a meme. “I would walk up to him and his girl and say, “hey bro are you open 1.2 trillion years from now?” And he would say something like, “ohhhh sorry, looks like me and my girl are goin out then, catch’ya later”

We still played and hung out, but just not as much. Well, somewhere in the middle of senior year when we all figured out what colleges we were going to I realized that I was not going to see this kid nearly as much as I did for my entire life. And I would never see him as much as I did in high school, for the rest of my life. And this, this is the problem. What do I do. I miss him so much we still play games, it’s just, not nearly as much as we used to. Half the time when I ask him to play he says he is doing things with friends. Sometimes I just sit around on discord or steam waiting for him to come up. We still talk a lot, but not as much.

I feel like I’m losing the connection I had with him in high school. I don’t know if thats just how life works or if it’s something I’m doing wrong. But I hate it. I’m trying to set up a trip to go to Europe with him and another relatively close friend, but he is insisting on getting an internship/job (which I can respect and understand) but if I was getting an internship and my best bud asked me if I wanted to spend 2 or 3 weeks in Europe, I would figure out a way to do it in a heartbeat. 

I just don’t feel the connection with him anymore and I don’t feel any connection like it with anyone at college either.


I miss him so much.

If you have advice I would be happy to hear it. Thank you so much."

&amp;#x200B;

**What do companies in such countries demand?**

Over here, companies hire interns because of law-requirements and/or benefits. Therefore, they don't really care about your experience, just that you have basic understandings of CS/programming. Internships rarely guarantee that you will get a job at the company in the future.

**Is it pretty much the same in EU countries, or do they expect you to have more experience and deeper understandings of your field?**

&amp;#x200B;

One problem is that I have poor grades (GPA of 2.98) and haven't got much related experience at all.

I actually took 3 years away from this field to do my military service and enjoy my hobbies.

1. Though I have received no lower than a B on any programming-related course (e.g., Java, C, Unix programming, Web development), I've never gotten anything higher than a C on math-related subjects because I hated math. I just got back to studying Data Structures and Algorithms now that I realize their importance, but I can't do anything to change my grades.
2. The only ""experience"" that I have outside of school projects is running and writing plugins for a Linux minecraft server.

This is my resume, which is barely anything:

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping to get some insight on a situation I have gotten myself into recently. However, a little background on myself before i delve too deep into things. I graduated this past May, 2018 with a degree in Business Management and International Business. While I was in school, I interned as a Business Development Intern at one of Boston's hottest tech companies for close to a year. From there I managed to land a gig post graduation as a full time BDR at another tech company and was promoted to a Sr. level BDR in a very short amount of time. Of course no one in their right mind would want to be a BDR for life so naturally I wanted to land myself a closing role as an Account Executive after having gaining a significant amount of exposure on the BDR end of things. I was recently contacted by a third party recruiter to interview for an AE position at another tech firm in Boston. The issue is, I looked up LinkedIn profiles of current AE's at the company and from what it looks like, almost all of them have spent time as BDR's at various companies for close to a year and a half to two years before having transitioned into a full closing role. The total time I have spend qualifying leads and booking appointments as a BDR for AE's is 1 year as an intern and about 7 months as a full time rep. Do you think that I should pursue this opportunity with only 7 months as a full time BDR or should I stick it out for a full year before looking into closing roles?

I'm supposed to create an application as a final project for school to showcase what I've learned during my internship. 

My company makes a massive web app with a lot of tech debt based on an older Java web framework. 

Databases are MYSQL based, mostly MariaDB. So I know a bit of Java, but I'm a bit more comfortable in JS.

So for my final project, I decided to make an Android application. The business case isn't clear yet, but our customer base uses Android 99.5% of the time, so I haven't completely ruled out native Android development.

Can you help me figure out which framework, React Native or Cordova, you'd chose if you'd prioritise future learning?

Thanks!"

A little background: I've been feeling a bit depressed lately and letting my appearance go a bit as a result. But sometime this week I'll have an interview for an internship, which is a function that I've dreamed of for years. I thought this was the moment to make myself look better: doing a face and hairmask, dying my hair again, I recently bought a new outfit for the interview.

So last night I put some castor oil in my hair to leave in overnight, and the internet told me a great and nourishing way to take out the excess oil is putting in a raw egg mask. So today I DIY'ed a facemask with honey, and cracked some eggs for the hairmask. It leaked like crazy, so I put a showercap over my hair. First fuckup. My cat got very scared from seeing me with the showercap on, because apparently it suddenly makes me look like an alien, and bumped a plant out of the window in her flight to safety. 

After a while I rinsed it out. Now, I'm no idiot, or so I thought, so I did this with tepid water in the shower. Continued to wash it twice and figured all the egg would be rinsed out now. Now I like really hot showers, and I was cold, so I cranked up the heat to ""burning in hell"". 

I continued to condition my hair, and when rinsing it out, I noticed something weird and stringy in my hair. It was halfcooked egg. No biggy, I just took it out. Then I noticed that my hair was filled with tiny bits of egg. My hair almost reaches my hips, and it's very thick and full, so getting everything out, or even seeing it all, is almost impossible. I've been picking bits of egg out of my hair for the past 30 minutes. I thought I was pretty much done, but my cat just started chewing my hair. So apparently not. Hopefully I'll manage to get everything out today and my interview will not be for the next few days.

So, any nice DIY hacks to get halfcooked egg out of your hair? Maybe something with chewing gum or something stupid like that?

TLDR; decided to do a hair mask so I'll look nice for the interview for my dream internship/job, ended up with halfcooked bits of egg in my hair."
ako3dd,2363,2019-01-28,How I made $10k in one weekend as a college student with no cash,sweatystartup,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ako3dd/how_i_made_10k_in_one_weekend_as_a_college/,"It was about 8 weeks before graduation weekend in my college town in 2012. I was a senior about to graduate. My mother was bugging me to help her find a hotel near campus for graduation weekend. For her, my father, my grandparents and my sister. Three rooms.

I called about 10 hotels around campus. Checked Priceline. There was nothing available at all. AirBNB was the same.

The closest city with availability was about 30 minutes away. They only had 3 rooms left in the entire hotel and they were $350 per night plus fees, each, with a three night minimum. Even they were cashing in on graduation. Thats $3,150 + fees. I refused. I’d rather them stay home and miss graduation.

The closest hotels with normal pricing and availability were over an hour away.

I thought about my friends who were sophomores and juniors renting apartments in the area. Classes ended about 10 days before graduation. They all were gone for the summer working internships or back home. Their apartments were empty. I texted a group of three friends living in a three bedroom apartment. I offered them $500 if they let my parents stay there over the weekend. They quickly agreed. All set with my family and we saved about $3,200.

My college had recently added a feature to the email (Google powered email). If you started typing someone’s name it would autofill and provide you with their email address.

My school had about 4,000 students in each class and the facebook group had about 3,000 each. I joined each group.

I then went through using one screen on the facebook group members page and one screen on the gmail page typing in names and mining email addresses. About 20 hours later I had a list with the email addresses of 3000 juniors and 3000 seniors.

I typed out a nice email to the Juniors:

&gt;Friends,  
&gt;  
&gt;My family and a few of my classmates’ families  are looking for a place to stay on graduation weekend. If you will be gone that weekend and would be interested in renting out your apartment to them let me know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks!

I then typed out this email to my fellow seniors:

&gt;Friends,  
&gt;  
&gt;A few of my undergraduate classmates are offering to rent their rooms to the families of seniors during graduation weekend. If your family needs a place to stay right near campus during that weekend let me know!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks!

I sent both emails and then headed out to track practice.

When I got home 4 hours later I had over 400 emails in my inbox.

I ended up tiering the pricing based on location, cleanliness, ability to provide linens and amount of rooms. I paid out about $35 per room per night on average and I did a three night minimum for everyone. Graduation weekend is quite an ordeal so that was pretty standard anyway.

I rented the rooms at about $100 per room per night. This was a big savings over hotels but the guests had to be okay with a dirty apartment and bringing their own linens for the most part. But they got to stay in the heart of the action and save a lot of money.

I set low expectations for the renters. I told them it would be dirty. I told them it would be sweaty. I told them to bring linens and cleaning supplies if they wanted to.

I strictly told all of the underclassmen to clean their apartments very well. I sent them detailed checklists. I did the best I could to make sure it would be presentable.

As soon as I collected payment from the senior I would pay the underclassman and connect them on email telling them to organize the key hiding and check out stuff. I kept a few apartments extra in case of emergency and ended up using one of them so I'm glad I did that.

Overall I brokered about 60 rooms and cleared about $10,000.

* Are benefits like flex-time and work from home common?
*  Is it stressful like pure programming?

Looking for relationship advice but some life advice wouldn't be unwelcome either.

TL;DR: I love my depressed girlfriend and as I think more about my future (or lack thereof) I'm worried I'll have to leave her to focus on my self

Some background info: I'm 21, will be 22 in March. In high school I was popular, made straight A's with ease, took a few college courses, had plans to go to university for CS but on a whim decided to become a medic like my dad in the Army Reserves with a 6 year contract instead, while still planning to go to college after finishing training. Instead, when I finished, I was going to move out with my girlfriend and rent a house and try online schooling but my mother pressured me into marrying her (despite admitting later that she knew it wouldn't work out) because she didn't think I should live with a girl out of wedlock. Me, thinking I loved her and being non-confrontational, went along with it. I don't blame my mom, she thought she was doing the right thing and I'm still very close to my parents who I love dearly.

Fast forward about 10 months, I'm working in sporting goods at Walmart, still not going to school, marriage is falling apart, wife and I decide to get a divorce and she moves out. Three months later, still not going to school, working as an EMT, broke as fuck, still not actually divorced due to financial reasons, and then I meet my current girlfriend and things start looking up.

Throughout our relationship I feel I've grown a lot personally though it seems she is regressing. She has struggled with anxiety and severe depression since some rather abusive relationships in high school but at first she seemed to be doing really well. Within the past six months her depression has been steadily creeping back up on her up until last November when she had to go to the hospital for over a week because she wanted to end her life. I've always been super supportive and for the most part never blamed her. There were a couple occasions where I attempted to offer advice that was perhaps naive, suggesting controlled apathy towards situations I didn't think were a huge deal when she thought otherwise which led to small fights, but I have since abandoned any advice suggesting she changes the way she thinks. 

Anyways, her hospitalization and medication and therapy didn't really help for more than a couple weeks. She was supposed to graduate college in December but partially due to her time in the hospital and partially due to her inability to get out of bed she was unable to finish one of her classes and an internship in her theatre department, both of which are now due sometime in February and she's made little progress on. This past month she's been struggling to even get out of bed before 1 PM and spends most of her time either working, sleeping, spending time with friends, or laying in her bed emotionally beating herself up, afraid that she won't graduate, that she'll be a disappointment to her family, and that I'm going to leave her because of her depression. I've tried to help her find a hobby because I think that would help her more than anything. It would at least give her something to look forward to and get her out of bed but all my efforts have been in vain because she can't even attempt to do something different.

I've spent so much time taking care of her and worrying about her and trying to help her and I'm starting to realize now that I have very similar fears to her and am now regressing with her. Since about April I've worked as a courier for a medical lab company and drive for about 9-10 hours a day which gives me a lot of time to think (when I don't shut my brain off the entire time listening to podcasts, audiobooks, youtube videos, etc.). And I'm starting to realize that I am going NOWHERE.

 I've lost touch with most of my friends from high school. Two of my three closest friends moved far away and the third goes to college about an hour away so I rarely see him since the couple months he spent as my roommate. In rural WV I have almost no way of making new friends besides through my girlfriend. I've been moving from one dead end job to the next and despite all my short-lived efforts to better myself through fitness, reading, eating well, meditation, prayer, deleting social media (the only thing I've stuck with and will never go back), I'm no closer to achieving any kind of success. The only reason I'm not depressed like she is, is because instead of mentally abusing myself I'm playing video games or playing guitar or drawing or literally anything besides facing reality. I'm still not divorced because the paperwork is overwhelming and I can't afford a lawyer. I rarely cook, I eat an egregious amount of fast food, I'm getting fat for the first time in my life, and for the first time in my life I'm worried about who I'm becoming. A lazy, fat, financially unstable dude with no purpose. 

I've had some ideas to get a Comptia A+ certification, get an entry level IT job and start online schooling at a place an Army buddy suggested but I struggle with the self discipline to even stick with this Udemy course and guidebook let alone trying to attend an online school.  So I've come to the conclusion that I need to make a change. A BIG change. Whether it's quitting work and going to school (which I REALLY don't want to do), going to some coding bootcamp and moving in with my buddy in Texas who wants to start a business while doing some other job to pay the bills, maybe taking part in one of those college alternative programs, SOMETHING. And even if I did make a decision, I'm still somewhat trapped in this vicinity with 2 years left in my contract, my shit car, my divorce, and my current girlfriend. I don't see how I can do any of these things without leaving my girlfriend who I care for very much and whose future I worry about maybe even more than my own. She's so close to having what I want. If she would just get out bed and finish her schoolwork she could graduate soon, in March there's this job conference where she'd likely find a job or internship in her field and she'd be well on her way to building her career. And even if that led her away from me I'd prefer it over her failing and being stuck like I am. Even worse, I'm afraid if she doesn't graduate that the overwhelming sense of failure would bring her to considering suicide again.

I've tried to do all I can for her with no results and as much as I want to help her I realize I've got to worry about myself too. I just don't know where to go from here. So, please, wise people of reddit, give me some advice. "

Do do not major in Computer Science or Infomation Technology here unless you are completely ready to take every you degree into your own hands. Just don't do it to yourself. You deserve better.

You deserve academic and faculty advisors who actually care about your progress and future. The advisors barely understand the curriculum and will literally just read to you off of the advising sheet. There is barely any support for students from the faculty. You need to get into a class thats full? Tough luck, try again next semester and while you're at it, push your graduation date back a semeter.

I highly applaud teachers like Jupin &amp; Rosen who actually take the time to teach in depth and actually want their students to succeed but the rest of them? Trash. Utter trash.

I am not knocking anyone's intelligence but for my first three years here, my TAs were international masters students who could barely speak English! Do you know how fustrating that is?  Going to them and to ask for help was a pain because you'd end up more confused than anything because of the language barrier.

You need 4 elecetives to graduate. Half of the electives aren't offered every semester and the ones that are have like one section with 30 spots available. This department is huge at this point. How do you have 1 class open with only 30 spots? And then there's the department policiy where you're dropped from the waitlist the friday before the first week of classes. You also can't email teaches to be added into classes once it is full. I can count maybe 10 people I started with who are going to graduate on time. The rest of us have been pushed back for so many reasons, some due to reasons out of our hands. The amount of students who I've talked to that switch out, some even by their senior year is crazy. I understand CS/IST isnt for everyone but Temple CIS doesn't make it easy for you.

CST Career fairs? How many people can honestly say they've gotten a job through one of those? Please let me know if you or your friends/classmates have actually been contacted for job opportunties from the companies they bring. The internships I've had, I've had to find on my own. again maybe its me or maybe theres actually something lacking with the companies they invite. 

We are a growing department sharing like 3 computer labs between all the courses every semester. There's no where else on campus I can go to get to get the software I need to do work. You have to either sneak into labs during class period or stay after hours to get work done. SERC 359 which is supposed to be our lounge is becoming disgusting asf. The computers don't work and theres barely any tables or chairs to study/do work there. What about that tiny ass room the reserve for tutoring? I've seen LINES form in fornt of that door cause people need help and theres absolutely no room for them in there and students can't get tutored adequately. 

I am a IST major, fomerly a CS major and I know the department is TRYING to take steps in the right directions to eliminate student failures. For example by making Python a pre-req of Java I for incoming students or making Client side a pre-req for Server side(it used to be a co-req). But its just not enough. I just think this department needs to do better.

If you are or were in this major let me know your thoughts, cause I can not be the only one feeling this way."

Cognitive science is a versatile major that focuses on the study of intelligent systems, both real and artificial with a foundation in psychology but also emphasizes computer science and math. This major hopes to help students identity research topics and develop hypotheses to test. It is a highly interdisciplinary field involving matters regarding the human brain and mind. This major has very diverse options for classes from anthropology to communication to computer science. It is useful for technology related careers.  

Environmental Science: 

The environmental science program at UCLA focuses on preparing students for the blooming field in sustainability. It is a degree rooted in physical and life sciences but also extends to public policy, politics, journalism, and justice. Students must also choose a concentration from a list that includes atmospheric and oceanic sciences, conservation biology, environmental engineering, environmental health, environmental systems and society, geography/environmental studies, earth and environmental science. This program also offers a junior retreat to encourage camaraderie among students, researchers, faculty and alumni. Senior year is spent working on a project in small groups of 5-7 students. The practicum empowers students to answer critical equations and come up with science-based solutions to real world problems. 

Entrepreneurship minor: 

Entrepreneurship is a minor that introduces students to the field of entrepreneurship and teaches the basics of business and start-ups.

I see all the pushing to do personal projects and for a while, I dabbled in my own projects. Ended up working as a web developer intern for a non-profit, a research assistant for several months, and programmed a few electronic bits on my own. However, the process of going to school, doing homework, learning everything from scratch (no electronics classes in school), going to work, and building stuff on my own was very detrimental to mentally.

I've taken a break since November and now feel worried that I should start getting back into it.

A huge part of me feels like this is just an insecurity my head has created to stress myself out. But another part of me feels it's rational that I should put in the hardwork now in high school and learn things that will take a little bit of the edge off in college.

I'm just wondering how much you guys learned prior to college? Did it help you much? Would you have rather spent your time with friends/family/etc?"

What should I do?",Witty_Fox,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/akrn8a/torn_and_feeling_stuck_since_i_found_a_career_i/,"Apologies for the wall of text. For some background, I graduated college with my B.A. in English 5 years ago. I ideally wanted to work in children’s books/publishing. I had an internship at one of the Big Five Publishers and absolutely loved it. I got really lucky, 6 months after I graduated, I got a paid editorial internship at a textbook publishing company and then got hired full time as an editorial assistant. However, within 8 months my team got laid off in a wave of layoffs, so I ended up taking another job that ended up falsely advertising the job they offered me (I was told that I would be helping publish children’s books but it was actually a sketchy sales position in a tiny office with cameras that watched their employees round the clock) and I was fired within a week with no explanation. I was forced to sign paperwork that I think was an NDA or something similar that stated I couldn’t go after them for wrongful termination. I was absolutely devastated; I had never been fired from anywhere before and felt like a failure.

I managed to take some administrative assistant jobs for the next few years, but I never gave up on staying involved with literature. I took on remote internships at literary agencies, and made really good connections and truly loved the work I was doing. At this point, I was resigned to the fact that getting back into publishing wasn’t something attainable anymore; I knew that the pay wasn’t great, the industry is unstable and I didn’t want to commute into or live in NYC. My new “dream” was being able to grow in a position that allowed me creativity, independence, and stability like a marketing or communications job while working in literature on the side. It is truly hard for me to remain interested in a position for too long. I held a position in college for two years, but since then, I have kept jobs anywhere from one to (just shy of) two years. Once it’s evident to me that I don’t have an opportunity to grow to do what I am interested in/good at, or the environment is toxic, I jump ship.

Well, in 2017, I landed an administrative assistant position at an insurance brokerage firm, and within 9 months, I got a promotion as a sales and marketing coordinator, which I started in June 2018. I’m making more money than I ever made in my career, but I feel like I made a mistake taking the position. Working in insurance is so incredibly boring, and when I have expressed to my boss in conversations that I want to do more creative projects, she shoots me down and tells me that my position is based on helping generate revenue for our division through sales strategy, and I have become more of a business analyst than anything else. I am constantly tuned into my work emails, and my M-F, 9-5 job has now spilled into weekends where I have to go into the office to do work or drop anything personal that I’m doing outside of work if my boss needs me. I’m tired and sad.

I started volunteering at my local public library on weekends a couple months ago, which I have loved immensely. It’s not publishing, but I get to work with kids and promote literacy and interaction in the community, which is what I have always wanted to do. I actually got recommended for a Youth Services Library Associate position, which I interviewed for last week, and it went really well. I haven’t been offered the job yet, but my interviewer kept telling me that she was impressed by my program ideas, passion, and enthusiasm. The big issue with the job is that it’s part-time with potential to become full-time, and they offer tuition reimbursement if I want to get my MLIS.

I am 28, married, and scared about going from a job I hate with full-time with benefits and great pay to starting my career over in a job I love, working part-time with no benefits and a hope that the position will become full-time. I have bills and rent and various other expenses, as well as a spouse to think about. I feel like I figured out what I really, really want to do too late. I also am feeling like I shouldn’t leave after only having a promotion for 6 months. I’m not fresh out of college anymore and I can’t just leave jobs once the honeymoon phase is over.

Is there any way I can eventually become a librarian? Should I take this job if I get offered the position (maybe work a second admin or library job)? Should I stick out my current job?"
akrsod,4,2019-01-28,Do I need an MBA to effectively transition into project management?,HKJ276,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/akrsod/do_i_need_an_mba_to_effectively_transition_into/," So I've been working mostly in data science roles for 3 years since graduating with a BS in Comp Sci. My first job title was Data Analyst at a big bank, now I am working as a Software Engineer (machine learning / computer vision) at a healthcare company. I love coding enough to keep doing it as long as is necessary and have thought about going for an MS in Data Science/AI, but I am also growing curious about the management side of things.

But since I have already put so much effort into becoming a full stack engineer, is it worth it at this point to go for an MBA? Do I have a chance of getting PM jobs at good companies without any sort of masters degree? 

I think my technical ability and real world experience at solid companies + internships makes me a good candidate, however my undergrad GPA was only 3.1 at a state school so even if I killed the GMAT my chances of admission into prestigious MBA programs are not that good. I have been studying like crazy for the past month trying to get into the 700 range if and when I decide to take the test.

I did enjoy learning those new technologies that weren't covered in school, but I'm not sure if that is the direction I want to go in.

I've had a few coding assessments (3 of them) since then but didn't do very well on any of them. Realized my technical interviewing skills were way below par (and I don't think my degree helped me that much with this). My DS/algo courses in school were quite a joke.


The repeated failed interviews/screens took a toll on my confidence. I took a 5 week DS/algo course focused on interview type questions and started to enjoy problem solving again. However, I tend to psyche myself out before interviews. I have an issue with chronic pain and that combined with my pre-interview anxiety almost always leads to no sleep before an interview. 


At this point, I'm really just trying to get a job anywhere. And I don't quite care if its the most technical or at some big company or small company. Speaking to some new grads I just interviewed with, I realized I didn't have quite as many interviews as they did. Possibly due to the fact that I don't have an internship at amazon/{insert big co here}/was coming from a state school/etc. I feel that I'd get at least one offer if I had as many interviews.

 Should I start picking up new frameworks/languages to make myself more marketable (I already know Java/Python/HTML/CSS and have some experience with JS/PHP)? I'm starting to apply to companies/cities I usually would not apply to. Getting desperate over here."

Wasn't sure where would be the best place to post. But this community has always been helpful and I have given back when I can! 

So a little about myself. I just turned 25 years old. I started off as an electrical engineering major and actually switched over to Information Systems after Sophomore year. I loved systems from writing small programs to building pcs, I was hooked. I loved solving problems and I have always had a unique troubleshooting process. I've been in IT for about 4 years including my internship. I did get a 4 year B.A but it was super hands off! 

Long story short I am seeking where I could find a IT mentor. I would love to work outside of work with someone way more skilled then myself.. Essentially labbing it out! I don't have any CO workers at a higher level. Or maybe I am seeking some direction to what to learn and what order to do it. I want to focus on networking and systems administration/firewall administration. I have a full blown lab at home consisting of a few servers, a SAN,managed switch, firewall etc. I have used this lab for learning and replicating work issues at home.

What I am struggling with is focusing on what to learn and in what order and how to go about it. For example firewalls I am not sure of every possible configuration to learn so it's very hard to start that learning process until I kind of have a program to follow. Same thing with server administration/firewall administration and networking.. I get alot of exposure throughout work but I don't get to become a SME like I would like to. I want to know the best practices and know what the hell I am doing to T.. I understand this is going to take time to learn each of these subjects but I want to know the ins and outs of the subjects mentioned. I guess I want to be the best that I can be and my brain wants more than what I retain at work. I would say my experience level is that of a junior systems administration. I would say I am also exceptionally resourceful. 

I have bought a few books as well hoping that will provide me some sort of direction. It's helped a little I would say but again I would like more direction. 

Again work is usually fixing items or resolving issues not learning how to do everything from the ground up like I need to. 

Also what's the best way to document everything I have learning to be able to use for quick reference if needed? 

Just a young driven guy passionate about IT.. My boss is too busy to be my mentor.. But I just know I could go so much further and learn so much more with a mentor willing to teach someone who is more than willing to learn. I learn better hands on and I retain information pretty well. 

I am driven beyond belief and am always willing to spend time learning out of the office but would love some direction so I could really get learning again! "

akwka0,8,2019-01-28,Mom wants me to leave home and boyfriend for potential job opportunity,didneywerl,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/akwka0/mom_wants_me_to_leave_home_and_boyfriend_for/,"Hey everybody, I apologize in advance for this weirdly specific scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

First, some background. I (22, f) just graduated from college with my Bachelor's in Anthropology in my home state of Utah, and I'm currently part of the Disney College Program, which is a paid internship at Walt Disney World in Florida. I'm also currently doing long distance with my boyfriend (21, m) of 6 and a half years until I'm home from the internship. Due to some weird circumstances and a gap year, my boyfriend will not graduate his undergrad for about 3 more years. I'll be finished with this program in mid-May, and frankly, as of right now, I haven't really looked in to finding a job back in Utah yet because it's just a little too early to start anything. But, essentially my plan was, start applying for jobs at home in about a month, finish my internship, move back home, start a full time job somewhere there, at the very least until my boyfriend finishes school.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my main problem is that my mom keeps asking me about getting a full time position with the Walt Disney Company, and asking me what I would do if it was offered. While I'd love that, there are some issues with it:

\- My internship doesn't pay very much. I would probably need a higher level position to support myself.

\- Full time positions are incredibly hard to get with this company at all, let alone at a higher level.

\- I don't want to keep doing long distance with my boyfriend, who I'm hoping to marry once he's out of college.

\- I don't really want to live in Florida long term. It's hot here, and I'm afraid of alligators.

\- My lease on my apartment in Utah doesn't end until late summer, and I can't afford to keep paying double rent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably reading in to this situation too much, but with the number of times my mom has brought up me staying here with the company, I feel like she thinks I have the best shot at a good job here, which isn't how I feel, even if I'd love it. I've also mentioned all the above issues to her, especially about my boyfriend, as he's the biggest thing keeping me in Utah right now. She's always incredibly dismissive, and it makes me feel like I'm making a mistake by staying with him. I know she just wants me to put myself first, but it feels like she wants me to break up with him, which is stressful and makes me sad.

&amp;#x200B;

So I need advice. Would moving home and finding a job there be a bad decision? I love my boyfriend so much, but it scares me to put my career on hold because he's behind on school. But I also don't know if I even would be putting my career on hold because I might find a wonderful fulfilling job back home. Ultimately, my mom makes me feel like I'd be making a big mistake, and I just don't know if that's the case. Is there a better way to explain to her why it's important to me to stay in Utah for a couple more years without her dismissing me? And what should I do in the event that I DID end up with a full time position here in Florida where I could support myself, as it would be a dream position?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

akxz4q,2,2019-01-29,I'm not sure if I'm being taken advantage of for free labor or if this is a legitimate internship.,thecub55,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/akxz4q/im_not_sure_if_im_being_taken_advantage_of_for/,"This is more of a question about the legality of an opportunity that I was recently offered and not a legal question about how to take actions against this person for any damages to myself. And also sorry for the length. This one's a doosy. I am a film and media major in my second year and I do a lot of freelance video editing for random companies to make some money on the side. That annoying travel/resort ad you just saw on Facebook has a very small chance that it was edited by me. So I was recently asked by a friend of mine if I wanted to participate in a project that she was making for a person who is a semi known social media influencer. And when I say semi known I mean maybe 70k followers.

Anyways. I tell her I'm interested and I go to meet with this social media influencer and her team. The social media lady explains how they want to create a docu-series that will be about 10 episodes long about herself and what it's like to be a social media influencer. Now this is a large time commitment. Maybe something I would be working on for the next three or four months as a part of a four or five person team. She specifically said (multiple times) that she does not know anything about film or video so that would be our responsibility. We then brought up the issue of budget, to which she told us that because she doesn't know anything about film that that would also be our responsibility.

Because of that it seemed like she didn't really care about money, or at least had enough of it that it wasn't an issue for her. She described the role as ""an internship opportunity"" and left it at that. On the way back from the meeting I asked the friend who told me about the opportunity if the social media lady said anything to her about  whether or not she was planning on paying us, to which my friend responded ""I think so?""

That brings us to today when I contacted this lady directly and asked her about what we would be paid for the literal months of work that she was asking us to do to which she replied that ""we are not allocating any budget for any of us to get paid on this project until after it is done. Then whatever money we make on it can be used to pay all of us""

This is a semi normal practice in film but usually only for student projects when NOBODY benefits unless the movie actually makes money. However in this case, if the project makes zero money, her and her company still get the benefit of exposure/boosted social numbers etc. I also did a little research and found that it's technically not legal to not pay your interns unless you provide certain services, one of which is hands on training similar to what you would find in an acedemic setting, yet this lady said herself she knows nothing about videography. The main issue is I'm not sure whether these restrictions apply to this specific situation because she's calling it an internship but treating it like a student film even though we're really just making something that sort of resembles an ad for her company.

TLDR: this lady is trying to get us to make an ad for her social media company by labeling it as an internship, making a docu-series, but treating it like a student film project.

It sort of feels like she's trying to take advantage of students for free labor and labeling it as a job ""for the experience. "" is what she's doing legal? Should I try to convince my friend to pull out? What do you all think?

However I've since heard of people earning way more (albeit in larger companies). Still unsure though. Salary is a taboo topic so I never know where I fit in on a scale. And given that I live in Dublin there's not much left over at the end of the month.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a BA (Hons) in Business which I only used for a year or two before switching into IT. I then got a H.Dip in Development via Springboard.

&amp;#x200B;

I now have over two years experience working in startups. I'm fairly confident I'm a good dev. I've always gotten up to speed quickly and become a core part of any dev team I've been on. I even train interns and help a lot. I've been hired via word-of-mouth too which is a good sign I think. Taken on lots of responsibility in the startups. I strive to write professional, maintainable code with unit tests and learn best practices etc.... Main languages are Python for backend stuff (Django) and JS for frontend (Angular 2+, Ionic, React). Much prefer the backend stuff though. HTML and CSS too obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

I think partly I have impostor syndrome. I don't have a 4 year CS degree so big companies just filtered me out in the past. However I work with CS grads and I'm often miles ahead in terms of practical work-related skills/knowledge. Yet still when it comes to salary sometimes I think of 40k+ as being 'big boy' wages for manager level or whatever. And other times I feel like I'm being taken to the cleaners working for wages no far off what I was earning years ago in a retail position.

Am I underpaid? Or is 32k right on par for someone with just a 1 year diploma and a couple years experience?"

I got an F in a CS class my second semester freshman year and repeated it the following semester to earn a C+. The semester after that I was also failing a CS class but the professor was willing to bump me up to a C to help me keep moving along with the major. Then the semester after that, last semester, I got a D in a CS class. I've taken some time to think what I'm doing wrong and I determined that I would skip a lot of class, go on my phone in class, space out in class, etc. I also have a major issue with procrastination. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far this semester I'm doing better, I turn my phone on do not disturb, I come to all my classes, and I've bought a book on procrastination that I'm reading. I also blocked Reddit from my phone so that I waste less time on my phone (previously 5 hours a day now down to below 2 per iOS screen time). Priority number one right now is to try and get A's in classes this semester to bring up the GPA and if I fail any more classes I might have to take summer classes to graduate on time meaning more tuition so that's highly undesirable.

&amp;#x200B;

 However aside from the academic aspect, I'm worried about actually getting a job after graduation. Some information about my experience: I have a few personal projects on my GitHub, but nothing technically impressive mostly just web and simple iOS stuff. I'm also the secretary for an on campus CS club and last semester I was accepted into a CS course where you formulate your own project idea and see the idea to fruition under the guidance of some mentors. I also worked retail for about 8 months (which I ended up quitting because it left me exhausted further worsening the procrastination and skipping classes) in my Sophomore year. I don't have a good relationship with any professors (maybe the one who bumped me might be nice enough to write a recommendation) although one of the mentors from that course last semester seems to have a good opinion of me as he offered me some sort of internship or research position under his guidance (sort of unclear what he wants) but he hasn't followed up in the last three weeks after I said I was very interested but needed some more information and wanted to discuss it in person. The only other thing in my favor that I can think of is that I am a student pilot, I've been training since March of 2018, and should have my private pilot license by the end of summer 2019 but possibly as soon as April or May of this semester (depending on whether or not the government stays open or not). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling very lost and discouraged right now because all my junior peers are getting internship offers from respectable sometimes big N companies whereas I haven't even applied yet because I don't really know what to do. I've done essentially no interview prep (like cracking the coding interview questions) so I feel like if I apply now I'll just blow it. I want to turn my shit around and do as much as I can to fix things. What would you guys recommend I do? What are the best steps and actions to take from here to get a job at graduation? I assume an internship or job experience before graduating is very very important. I'm happy to provide some more information as needed and sorry if this is sort of a mess of a post."

Like the title says: I'm 28 years old, I've been a Web Developer for about 5 years now and I'm getting a bit frustrated with my work.

If it's about building a simple website I can do it easily, but it becomes boring. If it is about building custom solutions for enterprise I find myself frustrated with all the requirements from the clients, always having to search for info about stupid errors I'm getting and using tools that are not that well documented.

I thought with more experience this would get easier...but not so much.

I like systems and networks. My study field was actually more focused on that area. I also did an internship at the start doing this work and I liked it.

But I'm thinking that maybe changing fields when I'm already close to 30 and starting new again might not be the best solution.

5. Not too far away from the main city. I would be fine with it being about 1 hour away but if i wouldn't want to go to a college that is extremely secluded 
6. Greek life - eh, doesn't really matter


Colleges I'm looking at:
Richard ivey school of business (HBA + Econ dual degree)
McGill and ANU
But that's about it. These colleges are in Canada and I heard its much easier to get a job after college there. However I am open to choices in other countries just to broaden my options. 

I don't know where I should apply and hopefully you guys can suggest some colleges to look into based on my scores and ECs and preferences.
If you made I this far, thank you

al2cj8,30,2019-01-29,Top-10 school pressure is getting to me,Help_throwaway12349,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/al2cj8/top10_school_pressure_is_getting_to_me/,"I always feel behind. I go to a top-10 university and everybody just somehow knows how to do everything and still finds time to go out and do fun things. My major is technical in nature and it can be brutal just figuring out how to do an assignment before it is due, and then another one is released and due the following week.

Changing my major isn't really an option, and besides I wouldn't want to anyway. My grades are pretty good, but even though I get decent grades it feels like I don't deserve them. I don't think I understand things a lot of the time, but I do well on finals and pull my grades up at the semester or I get lucky. How can I get more ahead and feel more confident throughout the semester like everybody else here is? 

Everybody just walks around like they don't have a care in the world and has high-paying internships and jobs lined up at big banks or tech companies without trying at all, meanwhile I spend so long trying to understand simple homework and I can't get employed. How do they do it? Everything seems so effortless for others, but I'm constantly stressing about schoolwork and internships. I feel like I don't belong here and my life would have been easier at a state school, where I could be top of the class like I was in high school.

Take the (very nice) job offer that is outside of my field??",Rbirrus,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/al2sih/got_the_masters_degree_dont_know_what_to_do_take/,"So a couple months ago I graduated in human-movement sciences (health &amp; rehabilitation) and studied sports science before that. It figures that my interests have always been aimed at topics like: health, sports, rehab, therapy, etc. 

I also recently came back from a nice trip in South-Africa where I also visited a girl I fell in love with, right before she left to CapeTown for an internship. She's my girlfriend now so good job I guess :)

I quit my sports-instructor job (also had a company car) because I was done with it and wanted to travel after graduating. So I'm living with my parents, no job, no car, 26 years old, girlfriend and friends live in a city where I lived before and want to go back to... I'm feeling pretty stressed because I want to have a job, stability, a place to live, etc. as soon as possible again. 

When looking for jobs in my own field, there haven't been alot of feasible options yet (or only options that would have forced me to move to a different part of the country without friends, family and my girlfriend). However, there has been one company that's located in the city where I want to live that I would be well-suited for. It's a pretty well rewarding job (nice salary, company car, company phone, quite alot of days off) and the company culture is informal and nourishing (although still demanding). The job is like a mix between recruitment and account management. Something I haven't got any experience in but I do possess a certain skillset that would make me suitable for this job. I've already been on 2 appointments with them and I know they would have me if I say yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing is..... I'm just not sure what to do now. I feel like I could really be happy and get my life back in order by taking the job. It would give me the financial freedom that I need to get my own place in that city again, have a good life spent closeby my love and friends... But I'm scared.. scared that I will start to miss the health/sports/rehab industry. I have to admit that taking the job would almost make me feel like a failure, since I've spent so much time getting those degrees and then end up not using them immediately (although there is an overlap in certain soft skills that I've gained during those studies).

&amp;#x200B;

Long story I know... I just hope someone could give me some guidance. I'm just not sure what to do now and I fear that making the wrong decision will make me end up at age 30 asking myself: ''what the HELL do I want with my life??''

al3cx8,7,2019-01-29,Germany: Interview Experience + Internship conditions (Data Analysis),rosamundo,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/al3cx8/germany_interview_experience_internship/,"I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ais8gs/germany_interview_tips_data_analysis/) last week about interview tips for internships in Germany. I will first write about my interview experience which leads to a question that I have regarding the condition of the internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for an internship in data analysis at a large German manufacturing-based company. The job posting specified fluent German and English, so I sent my cover letter in German and CV in English. At the interview I was asked if I preferred to speak German or English and was told that English is not a problem for them since several of their teams are English-speaking. I kindly asked if I could talk about my background and some experiences in German and in English for the more technical aspects such as the projects that I have done. This idea went well and I received compliments on my German. 

&amp;#x200B;

The interviewer did not have my CV with him, but I brought along several copies just in case. The interview had no surprises, I was asked to talk in detail about my experiences on my CV, strengths, weaknesses, and answered some questions that the interviewer had about my projects. I did not receive any technical questions on the spot. Then the interviewer told me about the technology that this specific branch specializes in and more about the internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good feeling about the interview and believe that I will most likely be offered the internship. However, I am a bit in doubt because the interviewer told me that they don't have a data science team and are at the very beginning with building predicative models. He told me that I will not have a mentor and that I would be working independently. Is not having a mentor for a first internship experience bad?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have another offer to work as a student assistant for my professor's research about Apache Spark at the University, however, I would really like to have industry experience. What do you guys think about the conditions of the internship? If offered the internship should I take it? Or work as a student assistant?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

I am getting an offer from a company called iconectiv (Also goes by Telcordia and Ericsson). Essentially they call my role the Intern Web Developer/Marketing role. In the interview they said I needed to know html and css and when I explained my programming background they said they would need me to learn a CMS like Druple for managing their websites (they have 7, which the team Web Dev team I would be put on frequently updates) as opposed to knowing more about front end development. On the one hand, I don't have much experience and this internship would help me get my foot in the door and is also good since it starts right away, which means I can take a summer internship elsewhere. Also, the pay is 18$ an hour. But on the other hand, I'm worried I'd be working too close with the marketing aspects of things and not really do anything to help me become a better web developer. Do you guys think in my situation it is best to take this job to get some experience?

al5k6j,2,2019-01-29,Is there a competitive atmosphere at your institution? How do you feel about it?,iwantIvy,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/al5k6j/is_there_a_competitive_atmosphere_at_your/,"Originally posted to r/offmychest. TL;DR below. 

Currently I am in a mobile development course through my university, and as someone with both a physical disability I feel like it isn't competitive enough. I have felt this way since I got into the university, really. That healthy drive to compete, to get better, to never quit, has as someone with a disability that impacts my quality of life really fucking helped mentally. It was how my schooling was from elementary up to highschool. To know there's always a next step, always something to achieve for that despite my disability I can actually do.

The programming (and really most) classes I have taken, while perfectly fine in their own right, lack this sense of competition and drive. There's no real encouragement for me to find an internship freshman year, so I didn't. I didn't even know where to go, my college refused to help me. Meanwhile friends who got into NYU or a UC or even Georgetown told me that they were getting help, and (more importantly) were surrounded by people who maybe they didn't know what they wanted to do for the rest of their life or career but they had ideas and they were pushing themselves, encouraging others to do the same. I'm not saying everyone has to be at that caliber, I get that college and school in general can be tough for people. However, especially in these programming classes I feel that in an industry that thrives on always improving and rising in merit/skills how can you not have a hyper-competitive atmosphere? It could be my region but everyone just seems so complacent.

I'm at a loss, really. I go to other institutions and I find kind, intelligent, driven people who encourage me to challenge myself. I come back to my dorm after a few hours with them and it feels as though I'm stepping into a place whose students act like they're still in highschool and aren't driven to achieve anything higher. On the one hand I get antsy not having anything to do, I'm taking a full courseload and it feels like nothing. I make little programs that go nowhere (things to change the tab bar color, little budgeting apps, etc), start writing paper outlines, create music, anything to keep myself occupied that isn't dozens of hours of Netflix each day.

Meanwhile the people I know at the other schools (where we joke about me wanting to switch places and my willingness to take on 100k+ in debt to be in their shoes) have internships lined up by their professors, have access to world-class programs, intern at policy institutes and NGOs and with campaigns without fail. I just genuinely don't understand how at an institutional and interpersonal level when surrounded by a critical mass of intelligence and driven people you can't have the same or slightly lower standards. Are my friends hundreds of thousands in debt? Yes, but they're getting their money's worth from the outside looking in. Every day I think about being in their position because I feel like I fucked up, that I didn't work hard enough. The only saving grace is that I'll be there for grad school, or I'll work with them on things potentially later in life.


Tl;DR I grew up in a public school system with high expectations. Going to a UC (or similarly elite) school was not a rare thing, it was an expectation. Even the people who went into trades or things that weren't strictly tech/humanities were driven to be the absolute best at that thing. Not having a competitive atmosphere especially in CS classes makes me really feel as if something is wrong. I'm hopeful for the future, don't get me wrong, but I just don't know how to handle this and would like some advice. "

al68js,0,2019-01-29,Omitting Intern Job Title on Resume,DoggyIAMA,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/al68js/omitting_intern_job_title_on_resume/,"I've been a full-time (40-45 hours a week) ""intern"" for coming up on a year now. It was supposed to be a 6-month internship, but since I am exceeding expectations in the position, it was no surprise they asked me to keep working at the company. I do as much work as the rest of my team, and being an intern, I shadow  the systems admin and the network engineer, helping them along the way. 

For example, I was tasked with helping the network engineer deploy a new ERP system throughout the entire company. I worked side-by-side with them to upgrade the Windows Server from 2008 to Server 2019, and figuring out the setup of the ERP software. This is in addition to writing Powershell scripts to deploy bug fixes and patch updates to our workstations and servers.

Our office underwent major construction afterwards, so I worked with the sys admin to develop the networking infrastructure for the new layout. I sourced the person to run the cabling, and configured the DHCP and DNS servers for all networked devices on the newly built network under his guidance. I also call hardware vendors and troubleshoot our phone, workstations, and our server backup solutions. 

I also do traditional help desk work, AD password resets, minor computer issues, hardware issues, etc.

I make $34,000 gross pay right now, got a raise earlier this month. I feel like I should be paid more, but I'm thankful as this my first ""real"" job and gave my my wet feet in this industry. I'm sure my company doesn't mind me either, as they get tax breaks for interns and don't give me any benefits (dental, life, 401K, etc.) I don't really care as I'm still covered under my parents for the next 6 years.

My resume is prepared with my newfound skills, but the title ""Technology Intern"" really underplays what I've accomplished and learned in the last year. Is it wrong for me to put something better on my resume like ""IT Technician""? I don't want to be taken advantage of by hiring managers. ""Oh, he just has intern experience, we can underpay him.""

During interviews I almost got an offer from Big N, but I got hit with the ol' reliable ""we ran out of spots/can't find a team for you"". Ended up taking a role at a big consulting firm. I did so because I was running out of time and needed to know what I was going to do after I graduated. I despise my job. When I interviewed they promised me Disneyland, I got a dusty backyard slider instead. I work on a legacy Windows application (horrible documentation), adding to codebase for whatever features are requested. I don't get a say or vote on anything, everyone there is much older than I am so no one cares what the kid has to say. Training when I started the role was objectively 0, both on technical and business side. Things are requested of me without any context, background, or explanation. I have to annoy the hell out of my seniors so that I can get some 1 on 1 time to understand what I'm doing. I even had a formal meeting with a high up manager to express the terrible experience I am having, he just agreed with me and forgot about it. There has not been a single day in which I wake up and say ""I am looking forward to work"". So... it's bad.

I decided back in September 2018 that I was going to leave in 2019. I made the decision then because 2 big N companies wanted to interview me, so I thought to myself ""hey you still got it"". Well, those interviews (both PM) were done very fast. One company switched hiring managers in the middle of the process and finished me right there, the other I don't know what happened because the screening recruiter himself said no (maybe lack of spots). Then, very recently, I had a technical phone call with shared screen with a company I was extremely excited about. Brushed up on concepts and problems 5 days before the interview. When the day came, I was a mess. Could barely sleep, massive headache, was very nervous about doing bad on an interview for a substantially better role. When the question came, I did get to solve it but after several issues that the interviewer had to point out to me. I got turned down, not surprised there.

So I figured I need to sharpen up even more on my interview skills, which I've never been really good at since I get so damn nervous. Hit it till it's numb. I know nothing can simulate the terrible feeling of ""if you mess up on this code, that's it"", but practice can dilute that feeling at least. My plan is to buy a year of Leetcode. It'll push me to be more consistent on my practice because I've spent money on it. On the resume side: I have a couple of side hustles (one a serious app) that I am currently moving forward mostly because I work with such old tech at work that I need my skillset to be up to date. I have two internships (one PM, one Dev) and my current Dev job. My dream is to be a PM at a software shop (that internship I had convinced me I like PM much more than Dev), but I've been tossed around so much that I really just want to work at an engaging software company, PM or Dev doesn't matter.

I just wanted to share my experience so far. If you are also stuck somewhere shitty, that you thought would be better before you started your job: you are most definitely not alone. Also wanted to take the chance to ask for any advice on ways to improve my preparation. The idea is to start applying come June/July so that I have enough time to have a crack at plenty leetcode problems."

My (soon to be) ex husband is pretty vindictive and unstable overall (hence the divorce) 
However recently he is trying to prove that I’m unstable and he deserves full custody. 
We have a 2 year old, as of now we have 50/50, my son adores me very clearly, I’m currently living with my parents and he has a stable environment with me. I don’t get a lot of time with him as I work full time, and am also finishing up paramedic school which requires me to work night shifts, however I am with him during the day on my days and when I’m not able to be my parents watch him. 
I have FMLA at work, there was an issue with that where I was (wrongfully) suspended basically for using my FMLA.. and that is currently being sorted out. 
Now my ex is claiming I’m not going to my internship (easily proven otherwise), that I’m apparently taking drugs (also completely untrue, easily proven), he’s saying he has all these people to speak against me, that I’ve claimed my son is deathly ill (nope, never) to get sympathy, that my FMLA is fake (it’s physician signed, and frankly none of his business), however he’s trying to use my issues at work against me to prove I am unstable. 
I don’t really know what I’m looking for here, but he has gotten a subpoena for my work documents, and filed for emergency custody. What are the chances he gets this, my time away from my son is purely due to school, trying to get a better job FOR my son, and he has no proof that I’m unfit, but keeps claiming he does. His parents are rich and can afford a lawyer. I can’t.. I guess I’m just wondering what to do here. I’m at a complete loss. I’m absolutely not an unfit mother, my son cries whenever he has to go back to his father.. he asks for me when I’m gone, and is always giving me hugs and kisses and loves me to death. I can’t imagine getting him taken away based off these wild accusations. 
I guess I’m just looking for help on steps to take, any advice for fighting this.. etc.

al6vkb,1,2019-01-29,In dire need of help,Monoman2345,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/al6vkb/in_dire_need_of_help/,"Alright, after years of laptop gaming I finally took the plunge and decided I wanted to build a rig. I saved up from my internship this summer and had enough to pretty much build whatever I wanted, (which was flashier than I should've gone tbh), and I was so excited. Over the course of a couple months around Christmas, parts came in one by one. There was only one thing I feared. The lack of support, the being alone when something goes wrong and you can't find a single other person with your issue.

Sadly that is what happened.

I built it, no issues, surprisingly it turned on in my first try and went together rather simply for how much RGB I shoved in. I immediately put Windows 10 on it, got it all set up. Downloaded drivers for every possible thing I could think of, and then ran benchmarks. I was doing this to get a base idea for its power before I overclocked it.

Overclocking it was one of the things I was most excited for. I had literally no clue what I was doing, but I watched a lot of videos and ASUS bios seemed simply enough. After cycling through tests it seemed like I was good with my i5 OC'd to 5.2 GHz and literally every bar to the max in GPU Tweak. I ran a CPU stress test and then a GPU stress test for about an hour and a half each and both ran stably the entire time and with good temperatures. I think high 40's for the CPU and low 70's on the GPU. So I decided it was finally time to use it for what it was meant to do, gaming.

I start up the Witcher 3 just to see how great it looks, and it was jaw dropping. It was so smooth on the 200 hz monitor. Then after about 7 minutes it crashed the entire computer, not just the game to the home screen. I did this about 3 times before I gave up. I loaded up Jurassic World Evolution, another great looking game, and it wouldn't even start. It loads, goes blacks, then gives me the games crash warning. The list continues:

Divinity: Original Sin 2: Always crashes entire PC within 30 minutes of play.

Star Wars: Battlefront 2: Horribly laggy and usually crashes after a couple matches.

Skyrim: Always crashes to home screen within 15 minutes, with BSOD.

Metro 2033: Usually lasts the best, but has always crashed entire PC within 45 minutes.

Crysis: Crashes entire PC within 30 minutes, with BSOD.

ARK: Usually can last quite awhile, but often crashes with BSOD.

The choice seemed obvious. Even though I stress tested it, it was obviously overclocked too high. I step by step tuned down the overclocks until things would work.

But they never did. I have my CPU down to 4.8Ghz turbo and my GPU Boost clock, voltage and memory clock all LOWER than the STOCK overclock mode. I double checked all the drivers, and everything seems to be up to date, but honestly I have no clue how to know because nothing makes it easy, other than the Nvidia game ready drivers. And all the issues persist. This has honestly been a nightmare, and I constantly have buyers regret on how much I spent on something that right now literally only looks pretty.

Also, I realized the mouse looked terrible. At first I though my monitor was set to 60hz but I checked the monitor and PC settings and both are set to 200hz. It's wireless, so I tried downloading more bluetooth drivers. And I found some new ones! Downloaded, installed, and nothing. Still horriblly in laggy in Windows and in games, essentially ruining the high refresh experience.

I am mostly coming here for some mystery help. I have goggled the crashes on multiple different games and I haven't been able to find anything that works. Am I just unlucky? Bad silicon? Should I be RMA'ing something? I've attached my build list below.

al715q,45,2019-01-29,Roommate committing psychological torture. Located in MN,The_GreyDuck,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/al715q/roommate_committing_psychological_torture_located/,"So, I am on an internship for period of time and renting a room near where I work. The room I am renting is through a coworker of my aunt. The house is 4 bedrooms with 3 roommates who were all here before me, all with dogs. One roommate lives across the hall from me and prior to me moving in used my room as storage/a place for her dog to play. 

Everything was moved out when I came here and there’s been no issues that I’ve had with the roommates of them with me... Or so I thought.. Until about two weeks ago when the roommate across from me started to do something rather bizarre as a 28 year old full functioning adult with a full time job. 

She started to play Disney movies, The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan, Bambi, etc... On repeat for literally the whole time she isn’t home. Which is anywhere from 16 hours a day to multiple days. Just the other day I confronted her about this and asked her about why/if she could stop or turn the volume down. When I asked her she told me that she’s was pretty fond of my room for her stuff and her dog misses the space and that this is her way of making sure I don’t stay too long. 

I’ve tried reaching out to the landlord but she’s been very little help telling me that it’s not that big of deal. Unfortunately, I can’t break my lease without loosing a lot of money that I don’t really have. My lease doesn’t have a lot in it, just basically saying that i’m required to pay x amount per month with an x amount deposit that I loose if I break the lease before the end of my term. 

So, is there a way I can legally break my lease without loosing so much money. "

al7l54,1,2019-01-29,I hate the circumstances of my life and have no idea how to improve them,wonjan188,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/al7l54/i_hate_the_circumstances_of_my_life_and_have_no/,"Before I start this, I am acknowledging that the reason I hate my life right now is entirely due to the bad choices I've made; I am 100% to blame and am not looking for any kind of sympathy or validation, I just want advice.

I graduated from a great private university last year with a degree in finance, but the best job I could land after graduating was a clerk position in A/R. I had a lot of volunteer experience and held leadership positions in on-campus organizations, but I graduated with a 3.0 GPA (very terrible for finance majors) and 3 internships (one was a great analyst one I got through my business school and the other 2 weren't that great and hardly related to finance). I did great grade-wise in my last 2 years when classes got more difficult and much more specific to my major, but I fared poorly my first 2 years due to a combination of problems on my end - mostly due to depression/anxiety and irresponsibility. I didn't fully comprehend until it was already too late that GPA is incredibly important for getting jobs and highly sought-after internships, especially when finance is such a competitive field. I also have no relatives or close family friends whom I could use in my network (I did a terrible job at networking, anyway). I never consulted a professional about my mental health but managed to overcome it on my own after my 2nd year.

I make exactly $16.64/hour (~35K/yr) but due to the low cost of living in my area I am able to afford my own apartment and pay my own bills. I was proud of this at first, but after several months of working this job, I am really growing anxious about my situation. My job is very simple and straightforward, my coworkers are almost all dull-minded, middle-aged women (only a few people are younger than 30), and I feel like management is largely incompetent.

I have hope that things will improve because recently my boss has personally assigned me to do quarterly accounting projections for the company (actual analyst work), but I really doubt having extra responsibilities will warrant him being able to create a new position to promote me or give me a large raise.

Further, my company conducts monthly drug tests, which I think is really stupid considering we're all office workers and the money the company spends on drug tests could easily go to something like providing coffee for the office (no, we do not get free coffee) or holiday bonuses (last Christmas they gave us a $20 coupon for a frozen ham, which I thought was a flat out insult). And no, I do not do drugs, so I'm not concerned about the tests themselves, just the opportunity cost of the money the company spends on them (several hundred drug tests are conducted each year for office workers with simple desk jobs that pay very little).

Meanwhile, my friends whom I graduated with are making great money at jobs that provide substantial holiday bonuses, don't drug test, and offer excellent opportunities for advancement. One of my good friends graduated with a terrible GPA and no internship experience, and even he managed to get a great job out of college because his parents are best friends with the CEO of a large company.

I know this post is kind of all over the place and I probably explained the circumstances a bit too much, but I'm really beginning to stress about how little money I'm making in relation to the degree I earned and the school I attended and that compared to all my friends I'm clearly the one with the worst job.

Should I continue performing the extra responsibilities my boss has given me and see if that leads anywhere, or should I see if I can find a better job at a different company? Because I doubt that having a clerk position on my resume will look great to a potential employer for a job I want, regardless of how well I can perform."

al8l1z,5,2019-01-29,[Profile Review] Harvard 2+2 and other Early MBA Programs,marble7,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/al8l1z/profile_review_harvard_22_and_other_early_mba/,"Hey everyone, I'm currently an undergrad junior who is thinking about applying to some early MBA programs, namely Harvard 2+2, Stanford GSB, and Yale Silver Scholars. Let me know what you think of my chances and my profile

**Background**

* Work experience (all software engineering):
   * Internship at a Chicago Startup
   * Internship at NASA
   * Internship at Facebook
   * Internship at Google
* Extracurriculars:
   * Web Development Chair of Engineering School's Student Advisory Board

* Undergrad school/major:
   * Computer Engineering at Northwestern University
* Other education/coursework:

**Stats**

   * Harvard, Stanford, Yale"
al98xb,2,2019-01-30,Scared to leave my first internship turned job,Red-Droid-Blue-Droid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/al98xb/scared_to_leave_my_first_internship_turned_job/,"I'm a college student about to get into upper division classes. Sometimes I find it hard to balance my internship, Java and web dev mainly, with school. It only gets harder, and I've been thinking of leaving anyways. I want a different thing now, am starting to dislike web dev, and would like to do summer internships, because of school (computer science). 

The problem is I got this job through a friend. Felt like cheating, still does, but I've managed to do well. It's a tiny LLC (4 people) and the boss/owner is always insanely busy, so I can never know much about my performance. The communication problems lead to wasted time (I get there and the office isn't open, for example) and sometimes I go a week or so without work (I'm paid hourly). He'll ask me to program something, doesn't give enough detail or changes his mind, and might end up finishing it himself (or struggling to get exactly what he wants, which makes me feel less stupid). Sometimes I come back with something that does what he wants, but it's not right because of detail he didn't include or he wants it done another way. It's like if I asked you to draw a tree, and when you come back, I say ""wait, I actually wanted the leaves bigger and you need to use oil paints to color it"".  Like I said, he's busy, but never says anything so I don't know if he's upset or what. It's not all his fault, I know. And I overheard his biggest client isn't making money, so he isn't getting paid a lot. 

I know this is my first serious job and I'm young and all that, but I'm a bit scared to leave. Will I find another when I'm sure there's 100 people better than me? I'm assuming I'd need to secure a job before leaving, but what if that happens too slow? Might just leave on good terms, say it's school (because it is 80% of the reason), so he will give a good reference?

First job out of university. I like it here. My boss seems to really like me thus far, thinks i have a great future with the company, yadda yadda....

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I'm making \~80% of the average salary for someone with my years experience in my city. And not to sound like a self-righteous jerk, but I think with all my side projects, internships, skills, etc. I believe I'm worth more than the average person with my degree in my city. And I certainly know I'm worth more than what they're paying me, based on what some of my friends make.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm interviewing for another company, and it's going well. I wasn't even actively looking for a new job, they simply reached out and said they want to hire me. To be totally honest though, even though this new position would pay me better I'm not actually interested in it at all. I could go into why but it's not relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about the timing of this all is that my current company needs me now more than ever. I don't want to go into too much detail but if I were to walk a ton of projects would be completely unsupported.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways, my question is this: can I (respectfully of course) walk into my bosses office, tell him everything I've wrote here and demand a raise that matches what I get from the other company? Would using the leverage of the other offer come across as unprofessional? How should I go about asking for a raise that I believe should be substantial?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: This seems to be one of those ask 10 people, get 20 answers scenarios. I think I'm going to go for it. The way I see it, I don't want to stay here long term while underpaid. Worst case scenario I rip off the bandaid now."

I have a big debate about the future of my academic studies (and career).  
A little background: I live in Israel, and I'm studying CS in a good college (2nd year) and have a high GPA. There aren't many companies in Israel that offer internships or junior positions, as many ex-IDF soldiers that served in technical units get hired due to their rich dev experience in the military.

I've had an internship last summer at a small startup, and I'm looking for another one now, preferably at a large company. I have a few interviews coming up this coming weeks in some recognized corporates, which I'm super excited for.  
In the meanwhile, I applied to a student's exchange program in my college, and was accepted to a good university in the US (not Ivy League, MIT or Stanford) for next fall semester.

Although I'm very excited about the opportunity to live and study in the states for an entire semester, I'm also worried about the future of my career. Except that one internship, I have no real proven experience, and this summer can be my last chance to get a decent internship, and I have a real concern to graduate and not find a job.

I would love to hear your opinions. Thank you!"

But of course, I'm still going to worry. I want some advice, something to help formulate a plan/foundation for me to follow when I inevitably feel lost during the internship.

Is work/life balance good or bad? It seems to me a lot of people work 45+ hours a week, sometimes on-call or putting out fires on Holidays and weekends.

Hard interviews? Seems to me like you have to practice everyday just to pass the interviews. Other careers you just talk about your experience.

Ageism? i've heard from a multitude of people that it gets harder to secure a job once you reach 35+ years.

Burnout? I can almost feel this already, but probably just need a little break after college anyways. It seems to me that devs easily burnout, thus the reason they job hop every 2 years or so.

Hard work with tight deadlines?

Are these just stereotypes, or is there cause for concern?

Though unfortunately, I believe a lot of the internship opportunities are reserved for students in universities with an actual COOP office. Queen's doesn't have COOP. We had an Eng/Tech career fair, and I tried networking with some of these companies. Though I and my peers (especially talented ones) experienced that they were more focused on finding full time hires, yet I investigated and saw that these companies *do* hire interns in the summer. Upon doing some research, I believe this has something to do with tax incentives for hiring students in COOP programs.

Carleton University, University of Guelph, and Ryerson University are programs that receive a lot of negative feedback and insults it seems. Though they have established COOP offices. I went to some hackathons and I met a lot of people from these universities, that actually had some solid internship experience. Would it be worth it to try and transfer to these schools, just to be in a coop program? I'd lose Queen's better ""reputation"" (if that still at all matters), and my ability to participate in an undergraduate program in Machine Learning. Though I'd actually get some internship experience, which according to my investigations on this subreddit is the most important thing. The end goal as of now is simply to become a Software Engineer, becoming involved in Ai &amp; Machine Learning just seems appealing since we have to take some core Software courses anyways and I can teach myself the practical things like building web apps.

I feel like my goals were kind of crushed when I didn't get into Waterloo. I had a 97 average in high school, co-founded the school's largest club (CS club), and volunteered every week and it wasn't enough. I thought grinding side projects, going to hackathons, and maintaining a decent GPA here at Queens would be fine in landing me some internships. Though now I've gone through my first year, I feel as if no matter how well I perform here, there aren't any internship opportunities for me in the first place.

Bear with me folks, this will be a long post. I’d be incredibly grateful to those of you who take the time to read it and offer your input.

I will first give some background on myself. I am a 25 year old student studying Computer Science - B.sc in Applied Computing (Hons), to be precise. The Institute of Technology I study in is in Ireland. Its decent, but nowhere near recognized outside of Ireland. I have never been very academical. I passed everything at school, but I didn’t get better than honour level C’s. My grades throughout college, other than first year, have been below par to terrible. There are a variety of reasons why my grades were so poor, ranging from not trying hard enough from second year onwards, unsuitability to the course and bouts of depression.

First year I put in effort and had reasonably satisfactory grades. Second year was largely okay too, other than failing two modules which I still need to repeat. I didn’t pass them but managed to carry on in to third year. Third year I failed three modules out of 8. One was a 10 credit module so I had to stay back to do it again. The following year, I passed all three modules I failed in third year, though I was tired of it. I deferred my course with the two 5 credit modules from second year still outstanding. This was back in the summer of 2016. 

I have now realised I need to get a degree. I was intending on completing my 4th year, but I found it difficult to get back in to the programming after such a long break. I’m not great at it naturally nor do I enjoy it, so I didn’t feel it would be worth the effort (which might not be enough) of preparing from scratch for a project year in 10 months. Especially to only get an average degree.Taking this in to consideration, I’ve decided to graduate after third year. I won’t get my Honours B.sc, but I will get an ordinary B.sc. Unfortunately, they judge the grade on third year alone, so because of that, I think my average would be around 45-50, giving me the lowest graded pass degree possible.

As you can all see, my education has been an absolute write off. With all that said, let me now tell you a bit about what I am currently doing/want to do. I don’t have any skilled work experience or internships, though I have worked for a couple of years for a security firm. Ultimately, I would like to work for myself/be an entrepreneur, though I currently don’t have any real ideas, network of people or funds to do it successfully. As I feel the time isn’t right, I feel I should try get in to the corporate world to build skills, network and save some funds for when the time is right.

In the last year or so, I have taken an interest in Finance, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. I have done some investing and trading in that time. I would like to learn more about these things and potentially work in these areas. I am currently studying for CFA, which I will sit in December after graduating with my B.sc. I quite like the idea of Finance as its something I’m interested in and something I can make use of for my future goal of being an entrepreneur/running my own business. 

I understand my education track record will greatly hinder me, even with the three levels of CFA passed.  I am realistic, I don’t expect to be working in JP Morgan doing Investment Banking. I’d be happy enough getting a role as a Financial Analyst in a smaller company and being able to work my way up to a decent wage. I am now willing to make a massive effort to do what it takes. I will study long and hard for the CFA. I will learn things like Excel and Financial modelling in depth to make me a better candidate for the job.

With all that said, I now have two questions for you all: 

1/ Do I have any chance of breaking in to the Finance corporate world with my education track record? The CFA is quite the effort to study for if my efforts will be wasted because of my poor grades. I feel it will be difficult to even get an internship due to my grades and age.

2/ Is there anything I can do to try make up for my poor education record? Would I literally have to do a degree from scratch? 

I’d really love your honest feedback to help me consider my options. "

Within our intranet all workstations have access to a common Windows directory (lets call it G: ). The user will be opening a html (sitting in G://) from one of our win10 workstations in the intranet. This html loads data into a html table from a JSON ( saved on G://). This table contains parameters which i want to send as a string to our FIX PC, where a vbscript is running that either checks a specific G:// folder for new txt files (old version) or sends a http request to a specific FIFO storage webservice (unreliable newer version). The latter version has been working quite well but is interrupted now as the company is migrating web services. 

I would like to make the user send a http post request with parameter from the browser (file://) to an online webservice, store it there and let a script on our FIX workstation retrieve the parameters from there(maybe httprequest every X seconds or some websocket push). Im just not sure which service (read about aws and google cloud platform) would be the simplest and most cost efficient to set up.

While at my internship I worked on the weekends as a software contractor because of a stroke of luck talking to a friend while visiting my university. His dad's company needed some work doing which paid around £25 per hour. But this was a one-off thing. I've currently worked at my current company for like 6/7 months on about £28K.  This company contracts us out to other companies and we don't get training time because we need to bill hours to the client. Even though some training is required for the contract which we do in our time. I really enjoyed contracting, the money was nice but it was that fact that I didn't have like 3 different managers at one time or I could work from work in my setup which is perfectly adjusted for me. So basically it's the money and freedom I like with contracting.

So my question is how do I get into doing contracting?

1. Where do you find the contracts? I'm not sure I can rely on luck...
2. Do you think I've got enough experience to contract?
3. Is there enough workaround for a single developer on his own?

By way of background, I got into system administration in the late 90s when I got a summer internship working at my high school.  I was 17 at the time and the school had just received a technology grant.  They got some Gateway 2000 servers and I ended up giving myself a crash course in NT4 administration because they didn't have anyone else to manage them, and no budget to hire someone.

Back then I spent the time I should've been spending studying for senior exams studying for my MCSE (hey, it was the dot com boom, who knew it'd burst?)

Anyway, back then, everything was so much simpler.  Most networks ran at 10 Mb/s and only maybe 1 in 100 houses had broadband.  You didn't have Active Directory or virtualization or anything even resembling the Internet we have today.  Heck, back then TCP/IP was still competing with IPX and NetBEUI.

I've stuck with IT since then, but am amazed at the rate of innovation and how complicated things have become.  Back then, I knew a fair bit about system administration, network, programming, databases, telephony - I felt like I could run a project on any of those things.  These days it seems like everything is so much more complex and everybody is so specialized.

I still feel like I have a good high level understanding of all of those things, but could I read and understand code for a web app today?  Probably not.  I'd be completely out of my element if I went to a security conference.  I used to read PC Magazine to keep up and felt like I had a decent handle on all the new developments as they were being made, but there are so many buzz words now, and I don't even know what half of them are because to this point they haven't been relevant to my life.

tl;dr - I feel like I used to be much more technical and have transitioned to more operational/project management.

I'm sure that part of this is just me getting old and wanting to spend down time with friends and family instead of learning the latest technologies.  Am I alone, or are there others that feel like they're in the same boat?  Does it worry you, or just such is life?"

Important Note: I would prefer going to school in California for the internship opportunities as well as hearing about California Community Colleges having pretty good curriculum no matter where you're attending. Though, let me know which ones are the best out of the nation!"

The Austin one pays $85k salary (and TC) and the SF Bay Area (specifically the Lower San Jose area) one pays $115k salary (and TC). This is at the same company, just different teams. I would be happy with both teams, and at this point I'm deciding between locations.

Background: I'm currently in my early 20's, in good financial standing, no student debt, no relationship or commitments. I attended college in Austin, and have been living in Austin for 4 years. I did a couple of internships in Austin, and haven't really moved out.

At the same time, my parents suggested to buy a house in Austin, and were generous enough to give me the initial down payment. I ended up buying one, so I'm comfortably living in my own house in Austin while paying off the house mortgage.

At this point, I feel FOMO of not living in SF Bay Area. However, I'm wondering if it's all that's cracked up to be. When people think about Tech opportunities in SF Bay Area being great, are they usually Big N / Unicorns (think Uber, Salesforce, Google, Facebook) with high growth and salaries.

If you end up working on a ""regular"" but notable tech company in the SF Bay Area that pays $115k TC, is it worth the move just for the sake of moving to SF Bay Area when I got an Austin offer? Is the South San Jose area even a good place to be in? Thoughts?"

I would complete 2 years of my university by the end of the year and would be actively looking for internships. I was going through the *desired qualities* and some of them were:

**IBM** \- ""*Programming experience - especially Python*""

**Google**\- ""*Programming experience in Java, Python, C and/or C++*.""

"" Backend development experience with Node.js, Typescript, PHP, or Java""

"" Understanding of web based applications, Javascript and Restful API's.""

1. **In the above desired qualities, How much of a experience do these company really want?** 
2. **Apart from university studies, what can I do to increase my chances of getting a internship.** 
3. **I see people suggesting contribute to open source code, how can a second year student with limited knowledge contribute to the open source thingy?**

alm9bb,4,2019-01-31,How to get started?,guywithadream,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/alm9bb/how_to_get_started/,"This is my first post on this issue, so I hope not to come off as a total moron on all things startup-related.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student studying computer science at a well-ranked school (UC Berkeley), and I have software internship experience at three major companies (Apple, Google, and Facebook). I'm familiar with mobile development and I've coded a bunch of my own projects in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

For some time I've been developing an idea for tech startup, and I've just recently started thinking about putting it into action. My questions are to people who've started tech startups, whether right out of school, or well into their careers.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do you start? Do you just assemble a team, and bang out the entire conceptual design?
2. When is the right time to start a startup? Is it advisable to do so right out of college, or is it better to accumulate more industry experience? Does it make financial sense to work on a startup rather than taking a high-paying Silicon Valley job?
3. Do you code the project on your own, or hire an external team to do it? While my peers and I definitely have some level of experience in the software industry, the makeup of our project is currently (likely) out of our range of technical skill, as well as out of our current experience with various tech stacks.
4. Where to get initial funding? There are startup programs and on-campus accelerators here at Berkeley. Are those the best places to target? Is there some amount of funding one should aim for? At one point should you seek out funding? (I do have around \~60K saved up from my past internships).
5. What does the timeline look like? Do you build to perfection, then market? Do you start building attention and trying to connect with possible users/investors from the get-go?
6. When do you give up? When do you know that an idea's not going to work out? How financially damaging is a startup's failure, generally, to the individual members?

I apologize if I come off as naive on any of this. I'm really just thinking semi-seriously about this and exploring my options, so I'd love some advice.

almghm,625,2019-01-31,[Success Story] From $35k to $110k in 3 years,ancap_attack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/almghm/success_story_from_35k_to_110k_in_3_years/,"I've been seeing to much depressing crap on this subreddit, so I thought I'd share my story.

My story starts a little over 3 years ago. I was 20 years old and didn't know what I wanted to do with my career. I did work as a caretaker in a nursing home for a little over a year, worked at Walmart for a few months, but didn't have any direction. I graduated high school with my associate's degree, but I just didn't have the patience for college. I also married my girlfriend that year, and we were barely scraping by with both of us working full time.

That's when I heard about code bootcamps from a friend. I remembered that I liked my programming classes from high school, and if I did get a degree it would probably be in CS. So I figured I'd give it a shot. I got a 10k loan from my grandpa and did the 12 week code bootcamp.

I wish I could say it was all breezy from there, but it wasn't. Let's just say the bootcamp made getting a job seem easier than it actually was. I was unemployed for 3 months, but looking back it was mostly my fault as I didn't put as much effort into personal projects and applying as I should have.

I got desperate enough that I took an unpaid internship at a small startup in downtown Provo, UT for 15 hours a week. It was a web marketing/development company doing WordPress sites. At this point, I just took it to get some real world experience, with the hopes of proving myself and being hired on full time.

I did just that - they hired me on full time as a junior web developer after a few months. Even though it didn't pay very well (Salary was $32k a year.) I was grateful to just have a job. However, it wasn't a stable environment, the lead developer quit 9 months after I was hired on, and I realized that staying there was not a good choice.

So I was back on the job hunt after a less than a year of employment. This time, I found a job at a slightly bigger company in SLC doing full stack JavaScript. My starting salary was $45k - again, not really making market rate, but I was glad to get some experience.

This is where I kicked into overdrive. I was learning a lot about AWS - more specifically, serverless architecture on AWS. I started doing projects outside of work and speaking at meetups. I got an outside offer for $60k at another startup and ended up using that to negotiate a raise to $70k from $45k.

At this point, I was living comfortably, but I wanted more. I continued my personal projects, started a blog site, and even spoke at a tech conference last year, culminating in me getting my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification.

I started getting contacted by recruiters, and had 2 companies interested in me at the beginning of this year, mainly because of my experience with AWS and serverless architecture. This allowed me to take my time, and I ended up accepting an offer from another startup for $110k a year, plus equity. The other company was a large financial company, but I liked the team and environment at the startup much better.

So that's pretty much it, that's my story. In June of 2016 I was making $32k, now making $110k now in a medium CoL area, with room to grow in an exciting new company using AWS and serverless architecture.

**TL;DR did bootcamp, got paid shit, now I'm not.**"

I would really appreciate some advice based on my situation, thank you in advance.

Who I am - 26 yo, moved to Bay Area about a year ago from Russia cause of family reasons (very unexpectedly). Masters in Physics (though with really low GPA - at the time, I loved busking far more than physics) from Moscow State uni. Currently PhD student at the same place and researcher at other Russian institution  (doing work remotely and sometimes coming back). What I do - computational research on molecular systems (particle-based methods - molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, etc).  

So, there are obviously not that many jobs here in my field of expertise. Searching thru Indeed for some time I've found one, maybe two positions where I could fit in, but chances are very low - I'm not that brilliant to win competition with someone who has an US degree or experience, I'm just a guy from god-knows-where, professors I've worked with have no connections in this area.

Getting to the point -  I've been involved with programming for almost my entire life somehow, I remember that we built something like arkanoid in java(swing) in high school, and it even worked through network, helped some physics students understand basics of c++, worked as Windows system admin for some time, has been writing some analysis scripts  and small number-crunching programs for my research (though any real SWE would presumably throw up at my code with global variables and stuff - it was written mostly for my own needs), have sparse knowledge of some algorithms and DS, have seen some C, C++, CUDA, fortran, python, awk, bash and stuff (but not really proficient in any of these).

So, what doors would you knock in my position, what would you try to learn/build to become somewhat employable in Bay Area?  From my point of view, some kind of unpaid internship would be good for me, but  there aren't many of these as far as I can see...

The problem is, I have an extreme amount of anxiety when I even think about graduating and the thought of not being in school anymore has driven me into quite a few episodes (i don’t know if I’m depressed but i do experience cyclical episodes of “down”-ness, they’re usually pretty bad). 

I’ve always centered my identity around being a student and now that I am being thrown into the “real word” I have no idea what to do. To make things worse, i don’t really have a career goal per se - my degree is very flexible and allows me to do lots of different things, but I don’t want to get stuck in a job I don’t like and then realize I should be doing something else. I also don’t want to wrangle myself into a grad school program if i don’t know for sure that’s what i want. 

I come from an immigrant family and, given the fact that I’ve always been celebrated as a student, feel an immense amount of pressure to succeed. I’m extremely terrified of becoming wasted potential and being lonely and miserable for the rest of my life, and simply don’t know how to even begin to imagine a world where I’m not in school. 

TLDR I don’t know who I am without school and am graduating this semester. How do i move forward?"

The company that I got an offer from needed people as they are growing very rapidly, and I just happened to find them, and submit an application as the position is relevant to the field down the line of what I'd like to go into (Data Warehousing).

As soon as I graduated, I made it basically my ""Full-Time"" job, to search for work and I would submit about 10~15 applications a day for at least 5 consecutive days. All except 2 of the 2nd generations in my family (My cousins who are around the same age as me, give or take 1~3 years off) are not too well off in terms of career, and either have no jobs and living with their parents or have ""level 1"" jobs, etc. My parents were extremely proud considering this case as I would be one of the only 2 that are following a ""traditional life career path"", which is go to college, graduate, then get a job. I am the only one to secure a corporate job (I know some are not about the corporate life, but I really do not mind as I like to plan my salaries and having a stable income schedule works very well with how I manage my finances) right after a 4 year university.

I have been lurking around in this sub, and reading various job reviews, interview advice, offer advice, and even negotiation threads, which I learned from and negotiated the salary up! I know I'm literally just getting started but it is a huge personal milestone for me and I wanted to share the experience and wanted to thank this sub for providing insight into IT career path, and advice as well.

Those of you who are still searching, keep looking. Seriously try to submit like 10~15 applications a day at least, I guarantee you'll get interviews at least every week. It was that way for me and I didn't even go to an ivy league university. IT is a huge field, and those that say it is dying are only looking at some of the posts here talking about how they want to switch out of help desk jobs. Not saying help desk jobs are bad at all, but that's just coming from what I've seen around this sub.

For those of you who are still in school...DO THE SAME THING. Always be on the lookout for internships if you're only a junior, or lower, but if you are a senior, start applying the same way I did and hell, you might even get a job offer before you graduate and that is a blessing.

I wish all of you luck, and I'll repeat the same thing a lot of the successful IT people on this sub say: **Never settle, and always move up!**"
alplmg,6,2019-01-31,Landlord doesn't want to sign Wohnungsgeberbestätigung,brintal,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/alplmg/landlord_doesnt_want_to_sign/,"Asking for my girlfriend.

She is doing an internship for 6 months in Hamburg currently and is renting a room with a family.

Now she wanted to legally register her address there ([Anmeldung des Hauptwohnsitzes](https://www.hamburg.de/behoerdenfinder/hamburg/11252936/)). For that she needs the confirmation of the Landlord (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung).

But here's the problem. Her Landlord doesn't wanna sign that paper. He says he has to pay additional taxes if my girlfriend is registered on that address with his family.

So my question would be:

1. Is it really true that the landlord has to pay additional taxes just because of the registration? I'm suspecting that that's not the case, but that he would need to pay taxes anyway for renting out the room but chose not to do that and tries to keep a low profile. She does have proper contract though.
2. What's the worst case if my girlfriend does not register? I read something about fines up to 1000€. That's the worst case or might there be other consequences?"

alq93t,3,2019-01-31,Non-Compete Clause - Intern,Untarr,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/alq93t/noncompete_clause_intern/,"Hello,

I live in Texas and have the following situation.

I am currently interning at company A.  I secured an internship with company B for the summer.  Company B is a larger company that manufactures many things, including some, but not all, the things that company A makes.

Company A found out that I was going to work for company B through a slip of my tongue, after which, they wanted me to sign a non-compete.  The terms of the non-compete are as follows:


""...During the employee's employment by the company, and for a period of one(1) year after the employee's employment with the company terminates, ... , the employee shall not, directly or indirectly, alone or as a partner, officer, director, consultant, employee or stockholder (except less than 2%), engage in any business activity that is directly or indirectly competitive with the products or services being developed manufactured or sold by the Company.  The term ""directly or indirectly competitive"" shall include the performance of any services as an employee...The above restrictions shall apply (a) anywhere within the Continental United States, and (b) in such foreign jurisdictions in which there is a distributor or other representative of the company""


There is also a clarification on geography later that states:

""If any restriction set forth in this section is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period time or over too great a range of activities  or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities, or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.""


I had already been an intern for a while before they made me sign the non-compete.  The choice was to sign or quit.  Not knowing what to do and only getting 24 hours to consider, I signed.


No other interns have signed non-competes.  It seems like they only had me sign it because they found out I would be working at company B.


The two sites are both in Texas.  Approximately 90 miles away from each other.

My questions are:


What is the likelihood that they would go after an intern?

Do I have standing to argue unreasonableness in this situation?  Especially since I secured the internship with company B before I signed the non-compete, and company A didn't make me sign until after they found out.

thank you in advance."
alrkpy,2,2019-01-31,Does anyone have any insight into recruiters/HR,ImLog,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/alrkpy/does_anyone_have_any_insight_into_recruitershr/,"I've always found dealing with any recruiter/HR to be troublesome.  I tend to be rather pessimistic about people in relation to work, so perhaps it's just me.  But it seems as though anytime I try to communicate with a recruiter or HR, at minimum it's takes 2 days to get a response, usually like a week, &amp; way to often never.  Even when I intern for a given company and email a recruiter from the same company email, I get similar results to my personal gmail account.

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't a recruiter/HR persons job to essentially communicate with people?  Do they really get so many emails that responding to all of them is difficult?  It seems way to often they ""lose/forget"" emails or simply just don't respond. 

&amp;#x200B;

A piece of experience I have that really sticks out to me, is my Amazon recruiter.  I've interned for them once already, and I'm interning for them again this summer.  My recruiter sends me what I can only assume are automated emails, and they have never once responded to my emails, though I've tried repeatedly and have even emailed them from a company email (during the first internship), they have literally responded zero times.  I've always had to go around them and contact someone else."

I've only had two internships and about 6-7 months total of experience in the IT field. I'm worried I won't be able to get them as a reference. They were very generous to me and treated me well despite my issues. I fought my social anxiety to handle the people facing part which was the hardest part. The CIO knew of my difficulty and still continues to respond to my emails and is generally a nice guy. I wasn't the best employee. It took a while for me to get certain projects done when there was no deadline, I lost my patience at certain times, I had trouble figuring certain things out. I admit I didn't do many things well. I was even excused from the help desk for the second half due to my anxiety unless my managers really needed help then I would volunteer.

There were plenty of times I would stay late to install new workstations, get people set up at the last minute, finish projects staying hours later than I had to. Should the bad outweigh the good about me. I cared about the others and their work and became quite frustrated if I could not help them.

As of right now I can't get a response from the guy that had to work with me the most. The CIO whom I worked with still does though within a couple hours. Strange thing is the day I left that experience my main manager said he was going to follow up with me with my thank you email and give me resume advice but never did. The other guy I worked with also does not respond to me. Only the CIO is responding. That was a couple months ago.

Current school: Rutgers

Race: Asian

Gender: male

Home state: New Jersey

SAT: 1360 but none of my colleges have requested sats

College GPA: 3.76 with Honors

High school ECs: Key club, tutoring, Debate.

College ECs: IEEE, Dorm treasurer, Internship

Can someone help me? I'm in quite a predicament now as my peers have gotten internships already and am struggling to find one. Also if any of guys over here have an opening for an online internship currently in data science, can you please consider interviewing me, or give me a basic project to test me? At this point, I can basically get into anything, data science being preferable.

Also, since I need career advice, will data science be well paid in the near future, given the massive amount of students who are trying to pursue that career option."
alunlj,2,2019-01-31,"At a loss on where to go from here, would appreciate some guidance if possible.",Thoughts_In_Flux,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/alunlj/at_a_loss_on_where_to_go_from_here_would/,"So I've recently found this subreddit and have a bunch of things going on in life that I'm trying to turn around, not sure if this is the right place so please direct me elsewhere if it isn't. Going to try to not be too verbose but I also think giving a more complete picture of my situation could help when asking for guidance. 
Background: I am a mid/early 20's Hispanic male finishing up my Bachelors in what I would consider at this point to be a pretty lackluster CUNY college in New York. I'd be graduating with around a 3.2/3.3, with my degree focus being computer Networking and Security, of which involved relatively minimal programming coursework. All my previous work experience has been for small jobs not really relevant to building my career (retail, fast food, etc). The last hurdle I have before graduation is the completion of an Internship credit course, of which I'd ideally take during this spring semester although classes are about to begin and I still don't have one (although they generally give some leeway in terms of time for this specific case). I'm in a relatively rough financial state which would make an unpaid internship difficult to maintain under current circumstances (though not impossible), although my one interview lined up is at my school for an internship that is unpaid. My degree would probably line me up for an IT career, though very recently I've come to believe that I'd be more suited for CS. 
Reasons for wanting to get into CS: Due to some recent events, I've thought about my position in life and realized that I am both heavily unsatisfied with where I'm at, not super passionate about what I've been learning in regards to all the networking courses I've taken, and I am starting to think that the way I tackle situations lends me more to CS. I've only ever really been passionate about people, tech, and video games. One of the thing's I've enjoyed spending my time on the most is complex puzzle games, and in many ways I've seen programming jobs described it makes me think that the way I've come to enjoy thinking about problems and puzzles could be better suited to programming. I figure I might as well function in a way that is both enjoyable and productive in my life. I also spent some time recently in the SF Bay Area, which has helped motivate me more about my new career goals and aspirations regarding the things I am passionate about, to which I've honestly never had much motivation to make real progress towards before then.
Where I'm at now (Goals/Plan): My current goals are to attain an internship and complete my degree while learning programming concepts and languages and pivot into beginning my CS career asap. I've begun working on the OOP with Java MOOC.FI course today and plan on completing those two parts and was thinking of python and javascript as they seem high in demand and are some of the in demand languages at certain places I would ideally want to work in at some point. As it stands, I'd ideally want to work towards a career where I can work with companies involved in video games or tech, while doing work that compliments how I think about problems and situations.
Where I need Guidance: I have many questions which all just center around being unsure of what to do and how to progress. I'm not sure if I should go for the unpaid internship at my school or just take whatever I can get to try and graduate as early as possible, or if I should give it more time and look for a summer internship (ideally paid). I'm not sure if I should or even can apply to internships/jobs relating to programming with my near low familiarity with it, and I'm also unsure if taking a general IT internship would make the transition process more difficult down the line. Also, I'm not fully sure if my plan or my ideas related to learning Java and then Python/JS are sound. I'm also not even sure what exactly I want to go into in regards to programming, but I feel like that will become more apparent to me once I get into it more. I want to make the most effective use of my time to progress towards my goals as I feel like I've wasted the majority of the past decade slowly chipping away towards a degree in things I'm not completely passionate about doing career-wise.

* Undergrad school/major:
   * H~~Y~~PSM, engineering w/ honors, 3.5
* Other education/coursework:
   * Currently working on a part time masters degree online at Berkeley, but I was mostly doing it because my company would pay if I pursued the degree and I wanted to take some classes without paying out of pocket. I think I have a 3.5-6.
* Race/nationality:
   * Asian (US citizen)
* Sex:
   * Straight Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!):
   * GRE Q: 167, V: 164 Writing: 5
   * Equivalent GMAT: 740
* Undergrad GPA:
   * 3.5

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
   * Transition into MBB consulting. I feel like I'm really good at solving small / medium complicated problems using my data and analytical skills, but often times I have a hard time generating the big picture. The people I see who are really good at crafting a narrative and using my analyses to drive change seem to be ex-MBB managers around me. For me I feel like the analysis and the charts speak for themselves, but when we bring up the results to non-technical PMs (I'm looking at you MBA grads) they don't understand the techniques, etc so the changes that I want to implement fall on deaf ears. I talked to the good managers around about it and most of them point to their time at MBB as their ability to connect the dots and present the big picture coherently. I understand that I can probably pick this skill up over time, but I think right now I'm in a great position to leverage my body of work to go to a good business school and set myself up for further success down the line. I also think I can learn a lot of real business knowledge and soft skills in the MBA program, but don't think that'll be part of my narrative.
* Target schools:
   * HSW, Sloan, Haas, Darden (when available I'd like to do the MS/MBA program)

&amp;#x200B;

* Aiming for 2019 R1
* I can secure good recommendations, they won't be from Zuck or Sundar or anything, but they'll be good recs.
* I make about 175K all in so that's why my target list is so stupidly competitive.

Questions:

* Should I retake the GRE? I took it cold and I really shat the bed on the quant, though I did surprisingly well on the writing and verbal. I think I can get a 170 Q, but I don't think I can replicate that 164 V miracle. All in all we're probably talking about going from 740 to 770 max with the potential to score 730 depending on how the verbal shapes up.
* Should I just finish this masters degree? It'll take me another year to and a half to finish and I'd apply with 5 years of experience (6 at matriculation).
* Should I switch jobs? I've been interested in going to a new company Uber, Airbnb, WeWork, Tesla, etc. Given I take on a more senior position / get paid more will that help my profile? Any thoughts or suggestions on how to make this profile better would be appreciated.

It is a part time ""IT Technician"" job, although we don't actually tend to solve issues and instead monitor the ticketing system and just assign things to the engineers. It is more of a NOC job since a good 70% of what we do is just monitor the ticketing system or monitor the nightly servers and alert the correct people if anything goes wrong.

For about the same amount of time I have been trying to get a real full time job as either a help desk/desktop support person. I have had countless interviews, but nothing outside of a few temporary contract jobs doing PC refresh/moving desktop to new offices and setting them up.

This is my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odKGBBoKhihqI_Chn5ph9R8wHY-ZG0lakMDrnFDWLJg/edit). Other then not being really sure what I even qualify for, I am unsure of how to get additional experience outside of going back to school again or  getting more certs (the latter of which I am currently try to do but that will only get me so far without hands on experience). 

Given my resume, what am I qualified for? And if I don't really have a ton of experience, how can I get more of it outside of taking temp work or internships (which I don't think I can do since I am not in school)."
