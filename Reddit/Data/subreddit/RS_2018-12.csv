If I'm unable to find an internship this summer, next winter I will have graduated with no work experience and a low GPA.

Many of my friends have successfully secured internships, few might convert them to successful full time job offers. Lots of job openings are posted everyday and an average student manages to secure something at least to enhance their CV .

I am aware lots of things are changing under Trump, such as restrictions on third party contracting, increase in RFEs and latest is electronic filing for H1B. While these changes are primarily to eliminate the shady companies violating laws and taking advantage of immigration policies,I don't think MS students will be at any disadvantage.

Even though many people have told me not to go due to political uncertainty,I don't buy their opinion. I am taking education loan to fund my studies and the primary objective is to secure a job to recover my investment. I come from a middle class background,messing with the loan and returning back empty handed is not an option for me.

Need an unbiased advice on whether to take the chance or not. I consider myself an average candidate and with decent qualifications (Computer Science) in my CV and industry experience of 3 years. I am stuck at my job and I am not learning enough. Also I am not social enough to miss anything back in India if I emigrate (which implies I won't be homesick as I have lived away from home many times during long holidays and I haven't missed my family as long as I have had phone conversations with my parents)."
a22ztt,1,2018-12-01,"Need Advice, what should I do?",Zalyex,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a22ztt/need_advice_what_should_i_do/," 

So bit about myself. I'm 24 yrs old male from NYC and graduated with an associates degree in Business Administration in Dec of 2017. Unfortunately due to personal circumstances financially wise I cannot pursue my bachelors for now, maybe down the line. I thought that I'd be able to land a basic entry level office job in any industry, as an administrative assistant/clerical for public, government, private entities. The reality hit me hard when it's been about 13 months and about 7 interviews but no call back. I did one internship for a small accounting office which was mandated by all business majors but that internship was just an internship for experience for basic accounts receivable and accounts payable no job opportunity. I did 2 temp jobs which were basic receptionist duties and simple data entry into word-excel.

My main interest is working somewhere in human resources/Administrative Assistant or in a hospital as like one of those receptionists who checks you in and you do simple paperwork and filing in which I eventually move up the ladder. What I find really aggravating is the fact that all the jobs I applied for here in NYC around the Manhattan/Yonkers/White Plains/Queens/Brooklyn area ask for like 5+ yrs of experience and the need of Spanish speaking people. Most jobs that even have median pay that are willing to train in private offices like dental/medical office require Spanish speaking. I applied to hospital administrative jobs but I assume that's usually for medical majors.

What gets me even more down on a daily basis most of my friends and fellow classmates from the same graduating class got great jobs through the influence of their family members(/relatives/friends but my parents have immensely tried to try to get me a job through their customers and no luck. I'm a pretty smart guy, I know for many of you out there may not mean a lot as you're all 10x smarter than me but I graduated with honors with a 3.9 GPA from a community college. My father insists I do some sort of certified course work in the IT-Field, but that's not my interest at all like even though I breezed through my computer info systems and management info systems class with an A+, that's not my forte at all, I can feel it.

What I am considering is moving somewhere else where there maybe job opportunities available even with the most basic-tier level because NYC has nothing to offer to me and I'm just outta luck. Currently I work at my fathers Dunkin Donuts store while still hunting for a ""better"" job. He insists I get out of the house and go look to find my way in life but I'm very skeptical about it and I don't know much outside of NYC. Since I am of the Islamic Faith, I have to worry about food as the main reason, it's not like the old days where you'd travel and meet someone along the way that'll help you out in the long run. I have no connections anywhere outside of NYC and all my connections here have tried their dam best even my closest friends. So people of the reddit, I'd appreciate any advice on how to look for a job, who to talk to in a different country, particular area on finding a place, job, because I can't just go in blindly and be left out in the streets. Most places I'm considering is **Canada**, (don't how the job market is there with my credentials), and the **U.K** (also don't know how the job market is there with my credentials).

Any advice would be appreciated."

Without going into detail, I had a very difficult time growing up with abuse, homelessness etc. Despite this I worked very hard through school as I was taught that education was the best way to better yourself/earn a good wage. 

I worked hard at my A levels and got into a Russell Group University, finally getting a 2.1 in Psychology. 

Since then, my progress has halted. I work full time but in an unskilled job without any progression opportunities. 
I’ve applied for many better jobs and graduate schemes but have been unsuccessful every time. 

The main pitfall I’m coming across is that every decent job I come across needs extra qualifications which you can’t get funding for or 1-2 years experience in the role, even for entry level positions. 

I don’t have a family which can support me, therefore I can’t afford to intern for free, or pay for extra qualifications.

Should I give up and accept that graduate jobs are made for those with privileged backgrounds, or is there something more I could do that I’m missing?  "
a247mg,2,2018-12-01,I got promoted to Senior but I'm young and lack knowledge,csvz1542,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a247mg/i_got_promoted_to_senior_but_im_young_and_lack/,"C++ software engineer here, sorry for the throwaway account. I got promoted from mid-level to Senior but I couldn't be happy about it, because I think my manager only did it to raise my wage and keep me at the company, not because of my skillset.

In the industry I spent

* 2 years being a paid part-time programmer for my university's research
* project during my studies
* 1 year as an intern at another company while still studying Computer Science
* Switched to C++ and spent 1 year at my current company as Junior
* Got promoted to mid-level, spent another 1 year at same company

I was seen as talented. I always try to tackle hard tasks, actively participate in meetings, help evaluate technologies and refine requirements. I often stayed in late for ""fire extinguishing"" bugs reported by the stakeholder. However, I was always in the mindset that you need at least 5 years of experience (3 years as Junior + 2 years as mid-level) and I usually met with other Senior developers who are people in their 30s or 40s (I am 26 years old). I barely even spent 2 years at my current company. It's not a small startup, but a middle-to-big sized subsidiary of another big corporation.

I've read through foundational books (Code Complete, Pragmatic Programmer, Clean Code) and most of the Scott Meyers ""Effective C++"" series, but reading books only doesn't make you a better programmer, so I'm doing side C++ projects at home. I wanted to say that I have advanced C++ and software design skills, but I haven't written a memory allocator in my life and if I would go interviewing for other companies, I would have to study algorithms and coding exercises because it would look like that I couldn't program my way out of a paper bag when it comes to algorithms.

Also my manager told me ""you should not talk much about your promotion, because not everyone got promoted like you did"". Probably meant that I shouldn't go around boasting about it, which I didn't intend to, but if changing my title is that much of a nuisance, then why not just simply give me a raise then and keep my mid-level position? The more money feels good though to be honest. I was planning to change jobs (they didn't know about it) because I was scared that my knowledge gets outdated here, but now I would be a moron to throw all this away. I changed my title to ""Senior"" on my LinkedIn profile, but now I feel bad about it and I plan to change it back. I imagine talking to other developers and they would laugh at how a ""young kiddo"" like myself got to be a Senior. I would try to change jobs and the employers would think that I lied on my resume by making up that position. This makes as much sense as ""Junior Software Architect"". Not even this post makes me sound like a person who has his shit together.

I searched for similar posts like mine, but I didn't find satisfactory answers. The one I found was ""labels are meaningless, it mostly tells others how much money you make"". Should I write in my CV/LinkedIn that my position is Senior engineer? Or that would be a red flag when I decide to change jobs? Should I even call myself a Senior if I still consider myself mid-level?

EDIT: Update formatting because I composed the post in Vim and didn't use the Markdown mode. Because of that, line spacing was bad on mobile. "
a24qp8,1,2018-12-01,Feelings for friend/coworker for over 3 years,BunzofSteele,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a24qp8/feelings_for_friendcoworker_for_over_3_years/,"During my first job at college, I met this girl who I initially was just friends with. We both got the job from being the same major. As I got to know her more I realized that I started to like her. We worked together for 2 years and ended up having a couple of classes together. We never really talked outside of work and class though I had her number. I remember that my friends used to make fun of me and would catch the way I looked at her saying “I wished someone looked at me like that”

I ended up leaving the job because I had too much on my plate. We lost touch for a couple of months. During this time we both started dating other people. I never really loved my girlfriend because I couldn’t forget about this girl. We eventually broke up because of this.

One day there were higher level job openings in my school as paid interns that worked with the college. We both applied and got jobs as interns. She became my coworker again. I was thrilled about it. Though she still had her boyfriend I was happy to see her again. We ended up having the same office hours on certain days it was just us. We started texting more, almost all day every day.

At the end of the first semester working together she broke up with her boyfriend. Which made me think that there was a chance. This is when things started to change though. She barely texted me back. Didn’t even text me all summer. 

This semester we started commuting together and made our hours around each other so we would have someone to make work bearable. My feelings for her got stronger. When she hugs me my heart feels so full. I think about her a lot and I can’t even like anyone else. She started calling me her work boyfriend and everyone in the office says we’d make a cute couple.

This was great until yet again things started to change. She randomly changes from texting me every day to texting me once a week. She started talking to me about other guys that are talking to her. She also randomly gives me a lot of attention and won’t leave my side. She tells me that she doesn’t feel a connection with the guys she’s talking to. Every time I ask her to go for a drink or hang out she either cancels last second or tells me she’s always busy. At times when we’re away for conferences or breaks she says she misses me. It’s a lot of mixed signals.

She graduates soon but because I took time off I will be around for another year. 

My feelings for her are strong. I can’t tell if she feels even remotely the same and its honestly killing me. What do I do? Do I tell her?

TLDR; in love with coworker/friend for 3 years who sends me mixed signals and she’s leaving soon. What do?"

a251k1,66,2018-12-01,"My Apartment managers booted my car, left a vague and unclear note, and this ultimately led to damaging my car. Now the owners are only willing to pay a quarter of the damage claiming it's my fault and that I am attempting to take advantage of them. HELP!",GwapoakoPTM,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a251k1/my_apartment_managers_booted_my_car_left_a_vague/,"I'll do my best to keep this short, clear, and accurate. 

A little background: I have been attending a college in eastern Idaho for the past 3 years. I graduate in 3 weeks and will be moving back to California for an internship later this month. During these 3 years I have stayed at the same apartment complex whose owners have always been kind and helpful to me. On the day of the incident (Wed Nov. 28) the new managers were to come by to introduce themselves to my roommates and I. 

Wednesday night about an hour before the new managers were to come by I decided I was going to drive down the road and pick up some Taco Bell as I was hungry and tired after a long day. I went out to my car which was parked in the parking lot of my apartment and noticed a 3x5 notecard taped to the drivers side window that read, ""Please call ( NAME ) at ( NUMBER ) if we are not in the office. Thanks!"" I did not recognize the name or understand what the note could be about. I had a guess that it might be one of the new managers but was unsure so I figured I'd ask them when they came by later. 

After I scrape all of the snow off the top of my car (it had been snowing the past few days) I get in my car and start to back out of my spot. I had only gone back a few feet when I heard loud noises of metal scraping on metal and what sounded like a loud crack. I stop the car, get out, and notice that there was a boot on the front left tire of my car! It was now wedged between the tire and the bumper/fender of the car. Luckily there was no significant damage to the fender but it did crack the bumper which is now loose on that side of the car. It also popped the tire and within a minute the tire was completely flat.

I called the number on the card but nobody answered. I then called the owners of the apartment and one of them came out to check it out. He apologized that this happened and informed me that they (the owners) would help me out. He could not get the boot off himself as it was bent up so he took the whole tire off, boot included, and informed me that in the morning he would take the tire to a shop, get the boot off, and have the tire repaired. He said that once the tire was back on we would go together to a local auto repair shop to get an estimate of the damage. He also informed me that the reason the managers placed a boot on the car was because they did not see a parking pass hanging on the rearview mirror in the car. That would be accurate as I keep the parking pass on the dashboard of the car, still within view of the windshield, so that it's not blocking my line of sight as I drive. 

Now, here is a little bit of information that will be important later. There was already some minor damage to the fender of the car above the front left tire. There were some dents and rust from when a chain broke on the tire years ago. I never accused or claimed the owners of causing this damaged but I did not inform him that night that the dents and rust was already there. This was because I was so mad about the whole situation that I really didn't say much of anything to him at all that night. 

The next day he brings back the repaired tire, we put in on and drive to the auto shop where the mechanic examines the car and within 5 minutes he gives us an estimate of roughly $1,600. I looked over the estimate and noticed that he had included repairs towards the fender. I then informed him, and the apartment owner, that the damage to the fender was previously there and that it should not be included in the estimate. I informed them that the only significant damage caused to the car by the boot was to the bumper. The mechanic then redid the estimate and now the cost for replacement of the bumper came out to $778.52. The apartment owner tells me that he will need to go home and talk to his wife about this and that they will be in touch with me soon to work this all out.

Fast forward to Friday afternoon and I am in the manager's office with the apartment owners. They inform me that they are only willing to pay for a quarter of the bill (so roughly $200) and here are their reasonings why:

&amp;#x200B;

1) At the start of the semester I signed a contract which specifically stated that I was to hang the parking pass on the rearview mirror of the car. The contract also stated that any vehicle without a parking pass would be booted at the vehicle owner's expense.

2) Since only a small portion of the bumper is damaged, they should not have to pay the full price for a completely new bumper and..

3) Since I was ""dishonest"" about previous damage to the car (the dents and rust), they claim that there is no evidence that the damage to the bumper was actually caused by the boot and now believe that I am attempting to take advantage of them for money.

We obviously did not come to an agreement and I told them that I would like a few days to think more on the matter and that some time in the next week we could meet again to talk about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, I don't want to take advantage of anybody but I also firmly believe that this is not my fault and would like the damage done to my car to be repaired by those who are liable for it. Any advice???

Pretty soon I have to chose between two universities, manchester and southampton, for the university i intend to go to for electronic engineering. both universities have their pros and cons, but it boils down to southampton being better academically (supported by numerous university rankings) and manchester being better in terms of location and perhaps the experiences it can present one with. 

I personally see it this way, because Manchester as a city is much larger, much nicer, and overall my experiences visiting and interacting with the staff has been really pleasant (they event sent me a handwritten postcard after an interview, aha). It's a place I could see myself studying at with enjoyment for 3 years, and probably somewhere id stay even after my degree because there is lots of engineering companies within a stones throw away, and overall it seems as though the city is going under a lot of development (including a new £400 million engineering building for 2021!). 

However, Southampton seems like the place which would probably better my career. In terms of reputation, its perhaps worse internationally, but within the UK its *very* highly regarded in the EE industry. As well as this, its harder to get into, so you can probably assume the calibre of student there is higher, which brings everyone up together. Finally the university seems to have some amazing facilities, including a massive semiconductor fabrication suite - which is straight up awesome. Despite this, southampton is definitely a worse city, its smaller, you will more likely have to go else where to find internships , and it seems like the type of university where you'd be spending all your free time in and around the campus.

So, what do you think should be valued more, the city and how much you will enjoy yourself while youre there, or the way the university will set up your career in the future? 

If anyone has anything else to say about either of the unviersities, id love to hear!"

&amp;#x200B;

I would jump straight into a university/bachelors program but the costs, and the fact that I think I need to brush up on some skills/get back used to being in a school setting plus since I work full time the community college would probably be more accommodating.

&amp;#x200B;

I figure I could go to the CC and work towards the associates degree program, try to land a helpdesk/entry level job and hopefully land somewhere with tuition assistance/reimbursement, I do know the CC has a ""mentorship"" thing with IBM where students in the major can be mentored by someone from IBM and potentially get an internship and stuff.

This is their first intern class so much in the dark about how would it panned out and the conversion rate.

Ths is my first semester in college and I basically tried to hookup with a lot of girls because I was not thinking properly and assumed college would be the best time for this. However, I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in high school I got rejected by every girl I've spoken to and the reason for that is because I tried to become their friend first and they didn't realize that I liked them. My problem now is that because of this, it started lots of drama because those girls spread rumors and word got around which created a bad reputation for me. I go to a university which is nearby the area that I grew up and went to high school around so I'm extremely afraid of trying to ask out girls around here in fear of drama starting up. As for my appearance, I'm not really sure how attractive I am or anything (can send pics in DM if needed).

&amp;#x200B;

There is this one girl that is friends with a friend of mine here that I think is very cute but the problem is that she most likely knows about my history. This is because one of her friends is a girl that tried to hookup with me in the summer because she said I was cute (I was completely oblivious to the hints she was dropping and later said ""I think we're better as friends"" and completely ghosted me after).

My question is: what is the ""correct"" way to approach a girl and minimize chances of rejection? And also, how do I get over my fears of all of this? I'm seriously thinking of taking a semester off from school to intern somewhere out of state just to get somewhat of a fresh start."

a28xqh,2,2018-12-01,Investment Banking Internship to Product or Software Eng. Internship,poet_of_ambition,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a28xqh/investment_banking_internship_to_product_or/,"I'm currently a sophomore at a UC school majoring in computer science, and I've just secured an investment banking internship with a top investment bank (GS, JPM, MS) in their Technology group. I interned with the same bank last summer in their Operations division, but I did a CS project even though my role wasn't explicitly software engineering. I also have strong hackathon experience and CS research on my resume. I'm currently building up my portfolio of side projects and GPA's a 3.6 but will likely go up this quarter.

I'm concerned that for next next summer (the summer after my junior year, Summer 2020), I will have trouble getting a software engineering or product management internship if I do an internship in Investment Banking for Summer 2019. I know investment banking is looked highly upon in general, but I've also heard that Silicon Valley doesn't give two shits about investment banking. I'm sure I'd be able to find something, but I am hoping to be competitive for Big N software engineering internships and the big product manager internships (Google APM, Salesforce APM, Asana, etc.) I do find product more interesting than software engineering, but I'm not dead set on a career path yet. I'm interested in finance (IBD, PE, etc.) and consulting, but I'd prefer to be in tech long term.

If I do the investment banking internship for the Summer of 2019, do y'all think I'll have trouble finding a good Software Engineering or Product Manager internship for the Summer of 2020? If so, how can I fix that problem while still doing the investment banking internship? Also, for Product Manager internships, is it better to have an explicit Software Engineering internship?

PS: I'm looking for Fall software engineering internships so that I might have one software engineering internship under my belt before Summer 2020, but I'm having trouble finding many. If anyone has advice on that, it would be much appreciated as well. Thanks!"

I just finished my second programming course and now have two languages under my belt - Python and C++. For both of these courses, we get assigned a weekly project and are expected to write code that passes the given test cases. Now that I am actually done with both classes, I have absolutely no idea what to do next. I have no idea how to do these ""side projects"" everyone recommends me to have on my resume. It feels like I've hit a dead end. 

Hoping to get advice on how I can go about actually learning how to apply what I've learned in class and translate that into a meaningful project. I have applied to a few internships - and if I do land a spot, that should give me some experience. I wanted to start small - write an app that calculates my GPA, for example, but then again I have no clue how to even write the first line of code... Thank you for your time and advice!"

However, due to some personal issues and wanting to stay near family, the closest school is Florida Gulf Coast University  ([here is the curriculum](https://www.fgcu.edu/eng/softwareengineering/files/softwareengineeringcurriculumap_1819_91418.pdf)). Please ignore the first two years I already have the gen ed classes complete so I would start off with the engineering classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I am worried that it doesn't offer as much as the other universities. However, it is part of the Florida state university system and ABET accredited so it makes me wonder how much different of an education is this school compared to another. I work very hard and I have no problem working on side projects during school and taking it upon myself to try to find internships. But I am scared that maybe it will be looked down upon because the school is relatively new (founded 1991 I believe).

a29zjd,4,2018-12-01,Who is the rude one? I think we are all assholes lol,awkwardly_competent,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/a29zjd/who_is_the_rude_one_i_think_we_are_all_assholes/,"Our supervisor is soft footed and unknowingly(?) sneaks up on us in our cubicles and starts talking to us about whatever, literally startling us (our backs are to her).  

I got sick of it and put up one of those rearview mirrors so I can see people behind me.  She saw it and said playfully ""oh you're no fun, I can't sneak up on you anymore"" and I said, ""sorry but I startle easily"".  

Supervisor chuckled and asked my cubicle mate, Aa, if she is gets startled by her.  Aa said no. 

That was a month ago and the supervisor never sneaks up on me or gets in my personal space (I might have been rude but I got the results I wanted).  

Meanwhile, supervisor startles Aa 5x to 10x a day and I hear the nonstop complaints from Aa after almost every instant.  But Aa will never tell the supervisor because she doesn't want to appear rude or curt (but non-stop bitches behind her back and I'm sick of hearing it).

So... Who is the rude dude or dudette?

Me: Puts up a mirror one day that starts a mini dialogue with the supervisor about her teleportation powers.

Aa: Acts like she's okay with the supervisor but secretly bitching about the supervisor wanting to small talk and tell the same stories over and over...

Supervisor: Sneaks into cubicle without announcing herself and forcing her subordinates to socialize with her.

ADDING TO ORIGINAL POST:

The supervisor stares at Aa like Michael Myers in the bushes a good 5 to 10 seconds before talking.  Can't tell if the supervisor wants to socialize with Aa and is socially inept/awkward or if she's spying on Aa.  

Also, because of that behavior and two other co-workers in our group (to be fair they do suck), Aa is skipping the annual Christmas luncheon the supervisor hosts (she pays for everyone's meal).  

The supervisor rescheduled the lunch 3x so there are no excuses for not attending.  She expects everyone to be there: current group members, a secretary from another group she adores, the student aide who will finish his internship before the Christmas luncheon, and the recent hires who report two weeks before the Christmas luncheon.  Including herself, that's 12 people.

Supervisor will be pissed when she sees the new leave slip tomorrow.  Aa feels justified in skipping the Christmas luncheon because ""why the hell should she be forced to have lunch with people she doesn't like""?  

Aa will never be upfront about her feelings with the supervisor or the co-workers she dislikes.  Aa says she will claim she waited too long to book flights and it was cheaper to buy earlier departure time. 

So, in this scenario, who's the asshole?

Me: Going to the lunch because that's what the supervisor wants.  I'm not a fan of the aforementioned co-workers either but it's two hours a year I'm obligated to eat with these people.  Aa grow the F up.

Aa: Skipping the lunch knowing it will piss off the supervisor and lie about plane tickets (she cancelled the original departure flight).  She will never tell the supervisor what's really going on.  EVER.  

Supervisor: Practically making it mandatory for EVERYONE to attend a Christmas luncheon and low-key bullying people to attend (teleporting in cubicles asking everyone directly if ""X date"" works.  

I still think we are all assholes LOL."
a2aguz,844,2018-12-01,"Why Leetcode is a thing, and why you (probably) shouldn’t mind it as much as you do",belldozer95,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a2aguz/why_leetcode_is_a_thing_and_why_you_probably/,"In my two years of keeping tabs on r/cscareerquestions, I’ve seen hundreds of threads debating the merits of Leetcode style interviewing. There’s been a lot of insightful debate on the subject, but I’ve also seen a lot of people who have fundamental misunderstandings about why exactly this style of interviewing even exists. So, here I’m going to attempt to offer a thorough explanation of why Leetcode is even a thing at all, for all those out there who don't get why everyone is testing them on dynamic programming and graph theory.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Leetcode is a Thing:**

The Software Engineering field is one of the most favorable for qualified job seekers, in general. Anyone with a Bachelor’s degree in a technical field who can prove they know how to code and have good social skills should have little problem obtaining a job in the field.

However, there is a very big exception to this general rule: **big name west coast companies**, otherwise known as the “Big N”. These well-known companies in San Francisco and Seattle get WAY more qualified applications than they have available positions. For example, about **1 in 130** Google applicants get an offer, per Forbes. This number is probably slightly more favorable for Software Engineering positions compared to other positions at Google, but you get the picture. Even a very well-qualified applicant faces long odds of getting an offer.

Let’s say Google wants to hire 1,000 entry level Software Engineers, and they get 100,000 applications. There may be \~30,000 applications that are completely unqualified and easy to weed out. But after they do that, they’re still left with 70,000 applicants for 1,000 spots. Most of these people will have roughly equal qualifications: About to graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science or something similar, 1 or 2 internships, a few small side projects. 

How do you pick 1,000 winners out of a pool of 70,000 resumes that all look mostly the same? You interview them, of course. But normal behavioral interviewing is too easy, and won’t weed out nearly enough people. So another method is needed that can weed out a very large portion of the applicant pool, while still appearing fair and somewhat related to the job. Enter Leetcode!

Make all your well-qualified applicants solve 4 hard Leetcode problems. Maybe 10% of them will be able to solve all of them correctly and efficiently in a short period of time, and do a good job of explaining their answers. Now your pool just got narrowed from 70,000 to 7,000. It’s still a daunting task to narrow the remaining candidates down, but it’s now much more manageable.

Those exact numbers are just estimates, and certainly vary from company to company, but you get the idea: Google/Facebook/Microsoft/EveryOtherHotWestCoastCompany have to pick a small percentage out of a massive pile of nearly identical resumes, and Leetcode serves as an effective way of weeding out a majority of the competition in a way that’s (mostly) objective and (kind of) related to the job. That’s really all there is to it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why you probably shouldn’t mind:**

If Leetcode was suddenly deemed an illegal hiring practice, your chances of getting hired at your favorite “Big N” company probably wouldn’t increase. These companies would still need to narrow down their massive applicant pools in a way that’s not terribly time consuming, expensive, or overly subjective. How would they do that? Maybe they put more weight on GPA. Maybe they put more weight on where you go to school. Maybe they exclude anyone who’s not a CS major. None of those things are good indicators of who is going to be a great engineer.

There are a few ideas I can think of that would most likely do a slightly better job than LeetCode:

Assigning some sort of coding test centered on solving bugs in a large codebase would be one example. But it would be extremely expensive and time consuming to design and grade enough unique versions of these tests to make them free from cheating.

Placing more emphasis on quality side projects would be another good tool. But taking the time to actually read through the code of thousands of personal projects and coming up with some objective way to judge whose is better seems insanely subjective and time consuming.

Long story short, there’s no “right way” to pick a small percentage out of a massive pool of very similar applicants. There’s no way to magically tell which 22 year olds with minimal experience will turn into amazing engineers and which will just be good engineers. The industry has settled on Leetcode. It’s bullshit, but that’s okay, because the alternatives are mostly bullshit, too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So you hate Leetcode. What should you do about it?**

You have two options:

**1.**  Stop applying to Google/Facebook/Microsoft/Amazon/OtherHotWestCoastCompany. This is not the end of the world. There are tons of companies that you can easily get hired at without grinding hours of LeetCode. They will pay you extremely well, respect you, and give you challenging work. You may not be the coolest person at your high school reunion for saying you’re a Software Engineer at “random Midwest tech company nobody’s ever heard of”, or ""non-tech company that has extensive software needs"", but you’ll still have a much more stable and enjoyable career than most new college grads can hope for in 2018.

**2.** Grind LeetCode anyways. If you wanna work at to Google/Facebook/Microsoft/Amazon/OtherHotWestCoastCompany, you will probably have to excel at Leetcode. Yes, it’s bullshit, but the alternatives are bullshit, too. At least mastering Leetcode is a clearly defined, bullshit objective for you to work towards.

&amp;#x200B;

And in conclusion, I will add one last thought: If you don't think you can enjoy a software engineering career if it's not at a ""Big N"", you should probably re-evaluate whether you really like this field at all."

So I am a little but frustrated about my next career move.   
As a college junior, I have been applying for summer internships starting September this year. So far, I've got 3 interviews, 2 of which were with Big N although they didn't end up with offers. However, I've got an offer from a very nice local company, say A, through a very smooth process. The pay is on the high side for the area I'm living in and the benefits are good. Work is expected to be mostly web dev with an incline towards frontend (which I'm fine with, but, honestly, not a huge fan of). Anyway, this seems to be a great opportunity and it feels like I should go for it.  
However, the reason I'm posting here is because there are still some opportunities out there that could *possibly* look better on my resume. I've received some tests/interview invitations that could, again, *possibly* lead to offers as well. I feel like I have a decent resume plus couple internships under the belt which make me think there's still a chance for something else. It is also just December right now, so I still expect more positions to open up before summer. The problem is that I have to let company A know about my decision very soon.   
Now, r/cscareerquestions, what would *you* do? Would you go for something that's already there or aim towards better opportunities? I am really lost at this point and would really appreciate any advice.  
Thanks!"

I'm in this weird situation. I'm first year student of CS and I'm from eastern European country, where there's a lack of developers, so I managed to land an interview (I'm self taught basically, learned PHP, CSS, HTML, JS and etc., well everything web related) and they gave me some time as tryout period. 

I'm responsible for the website that was written in Wordpress and now I have to write templates, fix bugs and optimize, I don't mind, as I don't really touch wordpress, just it is as a platform for me, so I enjoy it. 

I've rewritten some part of their system, made optimizations in this week and it has been great so far, even the CEO said that I was doing well and everything is well... Then last week, I got a message that they want to talk to me, I come in and we have a chat about our future and they want to head me into the React stack and that I have potential, they give me entrance stuff to the building so that I could enter by myself, but there was no mention of any payment or anything? What the hell is going on? :D What am I suppossed to do? How do I go on and ask about it? 

This start-up is awesome and I don't want to fuck things up, any tips? I know this is an idiotic situation, I have no financial possibilities to work for free as an internship here, maybe there was misunderstanding between each other? Or what is going on?

In the first interview, they asked me to think about how much I want to earn, but there was no mention of it afterwards, so basically I'm here working for free for basically two weeks already.

At this point I'm completely lost if I'm either employed or not as I have to think about my financial future, but I don't want to lose this job oppurtunity. Also commuting to this workplace sips a lot of gas lately, so it is just a financial burden on me. "

**The story (for those who likes to read) :**

I'm a junior soft. engineer currently studying for my last year to get the degree around 2019.

I still have around 6 to 8 months of school before my first long-time internship ( 3 months +).

I  have been coding since mid school, and am extremely passionate about  computers, and everything that goes around it, from programing to  networking, hardware, OS, client/server architectures ... you name it.

This  year, i want to make tremendous progress in several areas, and i  thought that i could use this generous time frame to start building  solid skills.

Until know all i've been doing was pretty much scholar, for instance the largest applications i programmed were things like :

\- my own (buggy) version of Pacman in java in 2015

\- a web version of the hangman based on multiple language / categories selection

\- some device use applications in python for Raspberry Pi

\-  a booking web page (php/js,ajax/bootstrap/mySQL) designed for the  company i worked for as an intern a little more than 1 year ago

This  semester in terms of programming i'm learning JEE along with Android  studio, design patterns and some popular java frameworks such as  Hibernate / Spring / Struts (...)

Despite  the projects i'm working on for the purpose of school, i'm unsatisfied  with my general knowledge, part of it is due to my inconsistency from  year to year in my involvement in studies, and part of it is due to the  education system that doesn't allow for more freedom in the choice of  courses, but i mostly blame myself for not using my free time to study  enough.

In order to achieve my goals, and to become a reliable asset, I want to take my skills to the next step.

**The question :**

I  came here to ask for guidance in the path i should follow, and the way i  should organize my time to make the most of these months i still have :

Should  i focus on building a decent github ? And what would be a decent github  for a junior wishing to show that he has skill and adaptability ?

Should i focus on learning a specific language/framework or architecture ?

Only  now i'm starting to consider cloud computing and big data, should i  start learning those and completely dedicate my time to it ?

I  just don't know which path to choose from, I know that this step is  very important because it absolutely defines the way i will be working  from now on, and the things i'll be focusing on in my free time.

Most of all, i'm prone to ideas that didn't cross my mind !

Thanks for your time,

And have a good day/evening ! :)"

No extra language or anything 
We're expected to do so good academically and my parents never allowed me to do anything extracurricular (not that there was anything to do in such a small town).

I will be taking SAT soon and my aim is to score anywhere above 1550 and I'm sure I will.
But is that going to enough to get me into any good American college ?
I never played any game or participated in any activity !

Here's how I think I stand out from all other students !
I made computer games when I was 13 years old (in 9th grade). I loaded them to all the computers in my school and I became famous :P
Later on I got interested in physics and started reading books from scientists like Stephen Hawking. My current knowledge in this field is quite remarkable from a high school kid's perspective.
My problem solving skills are also quite good.And I used to participate in debates and always won but don't have any certificates or anything ;_;
I am also interested in learning other languages like Korean and French 
But I don't know if these things even counts to colleges :( 
Even If they do them how to tell them since I have no extracurricular history that do so ?

There is an honors section in college app where you're supposed to fill your extracurricular achievement but since I have none, what should I do ?
Should I go for some internships ?"
a2evg5,180,2018-12-02,I taught high school Biology 10 years ago. I moved on from that career 6 years ago and now I’m a nurse. I just met one of my students from back then working in my hospital. He’s an intern. Really humbled by him after speaking for a few minutes.,stihatchdude,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/a2evg5/i_taught_high_school_biology_10_years_ago_i_moved/,"I gave up teaching for a lot of the typical reasons. When I found myself dreading going to work and bitter outside of work, I knew I needed a change because I couldn’t let that become my life. I figured teaching was for someone more resilient than I was.

I moved back with my parents and started a nursing program and I’m very happy with my decision. 

Since the start of their residency there’s been one doctor who’s name seemed really familiar to me. I’d been meaning for months to ask him if he went to the school I taught at but I never got around to doing it.

Last night he came to the cafeteria where I was eating lunch and for the first time in years someone called me “Mr.*****”

So, I was right. It was him. In that moment I felt excited and happy for him. How cool is it that a kid I used to teach had become a doctor and what are the chances he’d be doing his residency in my hospital?

He say down and he said he wanted to thank me for being nice to him back then. He then went on to tell me how his life was pretty much hell when he was my student. 

I remember that literally every day, I’d be coming back from my lunch break and he’d be sitting on the stairs waiting for class to start. I’d always let him in and we’d talk or he’d just sit there while I got things ready for class. 

I really never thought anything of it. I guess I should have picked up that something could possibly be up with why this kid didn’t want to spend his lunch hour with friends. 

So he told me quickly how he was going through some bullying but really I think it went beyond that. The kids and even a few coaches were doing some awful and even criminal things to him.

On top of that, his home life was hell. His mother thrust him in the middle of her toxic relationship. I’m not going to drag on with all the details. I’m sure you’ve all heard and seen similar stories.

What was humbling was that he said myself along with one other teacher of his were the only people who were nice to him. He said that everyone else in his life made him feel unwanted and worthless but he looked forward to my class because he felt good that a “cool teacher” (his words) was willing to speak to him and show him things.

I remember we’d talk about how I competed in weightlifting and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and he was super interested in that stuff back then. I honestly just thought he was a good kid and I enjoyed the talks we had. 

He told me how he had a lot of suicidal thoughts back then but that the way that I treated him and the way the other teacher treated him made him feel like he was good enough. 

I’m sharing this here because I thought you all would appreciate it the most and that maybe some of you needed to read it to remember that even the smallest things can have a colossal impact on one of your students. 

I can’t even accurately describe how it feels to know that a kid I taught biology to is now a doctor. Not only that, but that he remembered me all this time. 

I had no idea he was going through the things he was going through at the time. He was always laughing and smiling and I remember being really impressed with how smart he was. It just goes to show you that teachers can have a great impact on students. 

My student is a doctor and beyond that, he’s one of the best interns we’ve got. Everyone loves working with him. Every single nurse or doctor I’ve spoken with has had nothing but great things to say about him.

I recently graduated in May with a double major BA in Economics and Computer Science from a small liberal arts college.

I have a job in finance and for a while I thought I wanted to pursue banking... I think deep down I might be better in a career in CS, at work I always think of ways I can apply python to automate and solve issues. I think I was blinded by the pursuit of the money that was in finance/banking... I know tech has a lot of money too but I think it would be more solid and better work/life.

 The problem is, I have a lot of experience in Finance and really missed out on any CS internships in during college. On top of that, I feel like my CS program in college was not the best and was not technical or project oriented...

I am considering taking the GRE and pursuing a career in CS through a MSc. I am interested in Data Science, AI, and SE. Would this be the best way? 

Another way I am considering is looking at Project development/management roles, which also really interests me.

I am just looking for advice and what people think I could do to break into a CS career. I feel so behind, I have a friend who works in the tech side of a bank as a business analyst and getting recruited by FB/Google, etc... I know I'm only a year out but I feel like I have to catch up.

I'm a junior at an in-state university that has no reputation for a good CS program, in fact I'm not sure if we have a reputation for any program. In high school I was a 2.5 GPA student, and currently, in college, I have a 2.90 GPA so basically a below average student.


My resume has a couple of jobs that I've worked at in the past local computer repair shops, I currently work at my university as a student worker in the tech department as well. I did not have any personal projects listed on my resume but I have one or two very small projects posted on my github, nothing more than a couple hundred lines of code in total. 

As internship application season rolled around I compiled a giant excel sheet of about 200 companies, I applied to roughly 150 of them. Mostly no responses and rejections, I only got one hit which ended up being from Google which I am still in the process of, and I also attended a school career fair. I also received an interview request with a top 5 government defense contractor. 
After attending the 3 interviews with the defense contractor which included an onsite visit they offerred me a summer position with them, with that said I am currently waiting on Google as well but I don't expect high hopes to come out with that if we're being truthful. 
The point I'm trying to make is, apply for everything that you can see, even if it might not be something you're interested in. A lot of people are stuck in the mindset of only wanting to work at certain places or only wanting a certain position but you have to remember an internship isn't really about the money(for the most part) but its about gaining experience and building your resume and contacts so you can succeed after college. You might have to bite your lip and take a position that you might not want at a company that isn't extremely ideal, but you have nothing to lose. 

My advice to any students who are in a similar position to me is apply for EVERYTHING, attend career fairs, you've got nothing to lose by trying, the worst that can happen is these companies say no. 

One other piece of advice that I have is: if you get get an interview at a company reach out to employees that are already working there and get their advice on the interviewing process, this helped me prepare for my interviews a lot. 

If anyone happens to have any questions feel free to ask, just thought I'd post this here to show that it is possible to get internships and interviews with below average scores. "

I'm in my senior year at school but I'm kind of at the point where I want to start a real job/career and finish my degree on a part time basis (night classes etc..).

One of them who is a large defense contractor wants me to come in for an in person, from what I've been told 75% of people who are offered to come in person get an offer. The phone interview consisted of technical questions asking about what SIEM tools I was familiar with, basic networking, URL/URI, some of it I didn't know but I stressed to them how passionate about security I am.

I want to do something worthwhile with my time off and I was thinking of doing some freelance work in the mean time. I understand that an internship would be a a good path (and a lot more secure) but I've always want to be entrepreneurial and I'd like to have something set up for when I finish my degree. I had a couple of questions before I proceed in which hopefully some of you can answer:

1) I'm stuck between doing web-dev or android. I'm more proficient in web so I could start off a bit sooner but I'm worried that there's already too much competition. I live in a fairly small city so I feel as if android development could be more niche. 

2) I've heard from people to forgo an hourly rate but how do you accurately value a project? I understand that this is relative to my region and the project itself but is there any rule of thumb?

3) If I am to go down the web-dev root should I learn more in regards to content-management systems? Any front end dev I've ever done as been hard coded but it seems the market has moved towards things like WordPress.

I'm currently studying political science and taking classes in tech (WebDev FE, Bootstrap on my own, and WebApp design) both as a hobby and potential second stream of income if the whole IR thing doesn't pan out. One thing I've sort of run into though is that in my region there's a dearth of junior dev positions.


 Maybe I'm not skewing my LinkedIn enough, but the general thing people do around here is they leave and come back when they're a little older for grad school or federal work if they don't have something really good lined up (25-29). You just can't afford it, unlike Silicon Valley or NYC the region I'm in is monumentally tough for new grads who don't get with a Big N company or a solid startup (and with my stack background and degree would I even get hired?). So I'm not sure if it's that I can't find them because they don't exist (people leave right after they graduate and have no desire to stay) or if they do exist and I'm not skewing correctly. 


I am currently helping to build up a website for a podcast so that is something to put on my resume, but I'm not getting paid for that work. Ideally I would like something that can pay my bills, and I worry that if I can't find clients or some kind of steady work for this spring and summer that I will be shit out of luck with regard to staying here. I am fine leaving, but right now the only real place to leave to is back home with my parents, which I am trying to avoid.


How did you get your first client? What steps would you suggest someone take in order to get a bit of part-time or even contracting work under their belt while in college? 


Edit: Inb4 ""ask your college"", we don't have that robust of a department for internships, nor are we allowed to start applying for internships let alone jobs until we reach a certain credit minimum apparently. I've tried asking, even pleading with them, but they don't seem to fully understand why I want an internship before my senior year when I have friends at other institutions who have had three by the time they are in my year. It really brings out the imposter syndrome, to put it mildly.

I'm going to be a CS junior in spring 2019 at the University of Central Florida and I have absolutely zero work experience, I don't even have a resume and my skill level is just around average at C and Java. My UCF GPA is 3.5 on a 4-pt scale. I want to start applying to internships for the summer as I'm probably going to graduate in the spring of 2020. I don't know where to start, what to put on my resume and how to be remotely eligible to be considered for a CS internship.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background info:

I was studying Computer Engineering in India and would have completed my degree last year but I had to drop out of college because of health issues and the way the engineering university system is structured there. I transferred to UCF last fall and was told that I would have to basically start from scratch after I got here, at orientation. Needless to say, the move was hard on me and I still struggle a bit to find solid footing. I'm going to complete a 4-year degree in almost 8 years which is another disadvantage.

I don't really know what I want to do once I graduate and if I don't find internships I can always take classes in the summer or try to get involved with research projects on campus but I don't know if that will help me much if I don't go to grad school later. I just need a place to start. Any help would be hugely appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

ACT: 34, 35 superscore  


SAT: 1480 (740 both)  


SAT Subject Tests: US History 780, Literature 730, and Math II 670 (not sending Math II unless school asks me to--  isn't great, but I also sent in my 5 in AP Calc, and since I don't want to do anything with math, I don't think it will have too much bearing)  


AP: AP GOPO 5, AP Calc AB 5  


IB: German 6 (we take our foreign language exam early)  


Course load: I am at an IB school, so I have taken basically all of the AP classes they offer in addition to my IB course load, so I won't have many APs to send in (since IB exams are taken at the end of senior year) but they will still see I have been taking the most challenging classes I can... I am actually doing the hardest IB option possible, where you take 4 HL courses instead of 3, which is very unusual and definitely the most challenging option... you can't grad without some SL classes, or I would take all HL.  


Unweighted GPA: 4.0  


Weighted GPA: 5.303 (my school does weighted GPAs super weird, so my rank is probably a little more revealing than my GPA)  


Rank: 6/261  


Extracurriculars:  


*Mock Trial*, all 4 years of high school, became captain my junior year; I have 11 most effective attorney awards as well as a most dependable award  


*Student Activism club*, founder/leader  


*Intern at our local chamber of commerce,* every week  


Volunteered on a congressional campaign this summer against 3 term incumbent until campaign ended  


Work as a runner at a local law firm about 7 hours a week  


Volunteer at our local museum where I help with kids activities  


Member of the National Honors Society, Science National Honors Society, and German National Honors Society (these are all the ones my schools offers).  


Beta club  


Math team (1 year) and soccer (1 year) - not that important but I think I checked the box on the application  


Junior Marshal at our school, which only the top 20 students get to do  


Awards:  


Mock trial (mentioned above), actually broke school record for most awards and am youngest ever captain of team  


Silver on the National German Exam  


Varsity letter in academics (I know it’s weird, but my school gave them out so I listed it)

&amp;#x200B;

IBMYP Diploma  


Essays: Good, I think they conveyed that I am passionate about government and life  


Recommendations: I think my recommendations should be good. One is from my 9th and 10th grade English teacher. She liked me a lot both years she had me, and she definitely knows I am a hard worker. She is also the mock trial teacher, and I am (I'm pretty sure) the first junior at our school to ever become captain, and I have broken the record for awards, including leading our team to state for only the second time in a long time. So, I think she will be able to speak to my leadership skills and my just overall extraness. My other recommendation is from my 11th and 12th grade english teacher (idk why it always ends up english). She has known me for a while and I consider her a friend. She also taught my Theory of Knowledge class for IB, where I actually got so into a conversation about the National School Walkout that I organized a group of students and got an article published in our local newspaper about it. Because of this, I started the student activism club with a friend, and she is the teacher supervisor for that, so she has seen my be very passionate about things and be a leader.  


I don’t have any amazing hooks or anything. No legacy, but I am from SC and I know that is usually less competitive than like California or NY, so that could be good.  


Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

She's been cooking for me which is great and I always say thanks but I noticed I started getting stomach pain and diarrhea on a regular basis. It went on for 2 months until I came home for the Winter and realize I was magically cured.

It was so bad I was worried if I got a disease until I started checking her food. I pointed out she had milk in the fridge 2 weeks after expiration and she said it was fine because ""the fridge is cold"".

She gave me some food to take home with me when I went home for Winter and I had crazy pain/stomach problems the day I ate it.

I realized that it has to be that I needed to do something and was hoping if I told her she'd be more careful about keeping food too long or that I could just get my own. So I tell her her food is great and I'm thankful she cooks for me but I get sick all the time and I think her food is too old. My aunt said no one else got sick so I said I'm get my own food and I might just be more sensitive than other people.

My mom yells at me saying I never should had told her and tried to tell me I'm lactose intolerant (spoiler alert: I'm not). Then says I made my aunt sad and I have to go to the doctor because I must have a food allergy (as far as I know I can eat basically anything, veges, seafood, milk, bread, etc.). My aunt cooks types of Vietnamese food I've been eating my entire life. And I said that I told my aunt it might just be me so I said I'd get my own food. Then my mom yelled at me she'd get me a plug in stove because I'd get my aunt's stove dirty.

I know Asians are sensitive about cooking but I know food hoarding runs in my family. They were briefly poor cause of the Vietnam war so end up stockpiling food. My mom will tell me not to throw spoiled food away because she can eat it... I think my aunt is the same.

What do you think? What's the likliness my aunt uses a secret ingredient that I'm allergic to? What should I do next for damage control?"

Another thing is, WGU doesn't present a GPA, however their grading standards would have you at a 3.0 or higher regardless based on their competency approach to classes. Would applying without presenting a GPA on a resume be a bad thing?  


I'm basically relying on having a couple side projects by the time I apply for either winter 2019 or summer 2020 internships. I'd also have to take a course on DS&amp;A (probably Princeton's), maybe just showing them that I'd have taken a DA&amp;A course and putting it on my resume just so recruiters are aware? This has been my main concern really, and I'm hoping to land an internship either late next year or summer 2020. Microsoft is the goal, but anywhere would be sufficient.

**Quick background: I** got my undergrad degree in bioengineering but realized quickly I had a passion for coding in my EE and bioinformatics classes. I had a pretty good resume with projects and various common skills but I was getting 0 hits on my internship and ft applications. I even had 2 prior software dev internships

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to start Georgia Techs OMSCS program to get cs degree on my resume and my response rate went up. I had almost 20 interviews  (each for different roles) in the past 3 months for various companies /200+ applications. Some were very good. I am in process with around 12 of those companies still (somewhere in between hr screens and final rounds). A few of those are prestigious companies, I made it to google onsites, got invited for amazon onsites up coming weeks, got an offer from disney etc. Things are going well with the cs degree on my resume 

&amp;#x200B;

**The issue:** OMSCS largely revolves around Machine learning and AI and LOTS of MATH. I have historically been a top of my class student in undergrad with upper div math but machine learning and AI take things to a whole new level. in my two courses Im still at a high A but I just cant do the work anymore. I cant see myself doing this for life, hell I can barely see myself doing ML for a year or more further. I have web dev experience, and imo I think its paid way better than ML/AI.

&amp;#x200B;

**The question** 

Im planning on staying in the program for some easy classes while I pick up 2-3 years of work experience. Ideally I would like to play my cards well and land something with amazon or microsoft in web dev space. **If I dont have a cs degree after working for 2-3 years will this affect me for future jobs?

Needless to say, everyone is very pleased, our team keeps getting requests and we are now thinking of hiring a second person. Since we are only a small company, the inclination is to hire someone junior that can help with the workload, and provide an additional person to discuss with. Does that sound like it will work - in other words a 2 person team with one senior and one junior? Possibly even an intern or new graduate. Or would the junior person require so much supervision that it will be additional workload for our data scientist and thus defeat the purpose? 

Let’s say in a few year’s time we manage to grow our analytics team to 3 or 4. How would you structure it? How many seniors versus juniors or mid experienced analysts?

This course requires relevant work experience stating: “You need to be able to demonstrate relevant work experience in your chosen pathway.”

Do I need a related internship to even have a chance to get onto this course? Or could say the completion of online Bioinformatics/Python/R courses help me here? Things such as the edX 7.QBWx Quantitative Biology Workshop from MIT or UC San Diego’s coursera course on Bioinformatics. 

Finding internships in Bioinformatics all require you to be highly competent in a programming language, but that’s experience you would gain on a masters course. It seems all the Bioinformatics internships I can find are aimed at current masters or PhD students.

2. Im currently 27. I'll be in my early 30's by the time I'm able to fully transition into the career. Will my age affect my prospect of getting entry level jobs compared to younger graduates? Will my history in a completely different field for nearly a decade work against me?
3. What should I do to right now in my spare time? I don't plan on enrolling in class for at least another year. Should I look into learning coding languages? Are there any tools for me to learn these?  

4. Lastly, how important are internships? I'm not sure if i'll have the ability to accept an internship in the future. How integral are these to success?

I have been wanting to build a career out of management consulting, or human resources (with plans to move into consulting work later on) for some time.  My education consists of a Psych major/HR minor BA degree, and an MA degree in Industrial/Organizational psychology.  I do not have any professional certifications (aPHR, PHR, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Work experience that is relevant or close to it includes:

A 1-year internship (kept extending me past 3 months due to my work performance) as an I/O psychologist where I helped a large, national company redesign its job descriptions, hiring strategy, and conducted statistical analyses to test hypotheses regarding consumer behavior.  All of these involved acting as an internal consultant to numerous CxO-level staff.

A 3-month Coordinator/Recruiter internship for a high-volume environment.

A full-time 9-month Recruiter position with a lot of coordinator work thrown in (background checks, i-9's etc).

A 2-year full-time role developing standardized tests and recruiting 200+ physicians annually for test development purposes.  Included here was performing massive amounts of data crunching and statistical analyses on testing data.  I lost this position unexpectedly after my boss - and her replacement - both unexpectedly quit their jobs.  The person that was promoted to be my 3rd boss in a year fired me for ""performance reasons"" and other despite me never having been written up.  I was never told what these reasons were even when I asked.

Several volunteer consulting assignments (two of which I found on my own), which add up to about another 1 year of additional experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Efforts to get a foot in the door involve extensive networking through cold-calling employees of these firms on LinkedIn, to reaching out to alumni, to tapping my professors for assistance, to attending job fairs, to calling their HR departments to see if I can follow up on my applications.  I've gone so far as to talk to random strangers on public transportation if I see them getting off around locations where prominent firms are or if I see an employee badge with a reputable name.  The only thing I haven't done is attend SIOP for additional networking due to the last few years being very difficult financially.  

&amp;#x200B;

Today marks my first month in a temporary contract position as an Executive Recruiter - a job that I'm good at as I'm already getting placements but the money alone is not going to make me happy.  I'm still frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned in the topic title, I am not even getting so much as a &gt;phone screen&lt; for entry-level roles where my current work experience ticks every single bullet point on the job description.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone out there provide some advice on what I could consider doing to help better my odds at securing the type of job I actually want?  I am hungry for success and will literally do anything I can to increase my chances.

I'm almost done with school and graduate next Spring. Last week, I got my first three interviews and received offers from all three of them within 2 days of each interview. I accepted the first one I got, and it is an internship that starts in a couple weeks and will go until April or May. However, they traditionally offer their interns a full-time position as soon as they graduate. The other two companies have their internships start in the summer (after my first internship would be done). They both want a decision as soon as possible. Would it be wrong to accept one of these summer internships so far in advance knowing that my first internship will probably offer me a full-time job at the same time? The first job is more of a stale job while the summer internships are with more modern companies that might advance my career more. Turning down all of my summer offers is scary knowing that it is not guaranteed that I will be employed as a developer then. BTW, all of these internships pay about $25 an hour, so that is not much of an issue, though of course, my first internship would give me a raise once (or if) they hired me full-time."

Problem is, the pay sucks, there's no room for upward movement in this organization, and the county is about as backwoods Florida as you can get. It's a dead-end area.

Maybe it's just from viewing all these super-talented individuals on this and r/chanceme, but I can't help but feel inadequate. For some background, I'm a senior, and I love computer science and engineering, and am currently torn between the two as of what to major in. But looking at all the other students applying to these majors, seeing how they've already done internships, are in robotics and STEM related activities, have gone to hackathons(which I didn't even know were a thing until a couple months ago), and have even done research already, it just makes me feel so... behind. I never was in robotics, or went to a hackathon, or got an internship, or did research. Hell, I played sports since my parents wanted me to, but I never wanted or planned to pursue them in college. Now I'm looking at my future classmates, thinking about how much catch up I have to do, and it's just overwhelming.

What I'm trying to get at is my nervous, anxious self correct? Do I even stand a chance in college compared to everyone else in my major? My parents always tell me to stop worrying, and I love them for that, but I can't help but be stressed out. Times are different from when they went to college; it's so much more competitive now, and students are specializing according to their majors at an earlier and earlier age. And here I am, just a confused, nervous wreck who played hockey instead of joining robotics or something meaningful to my major."

I am turning to you guys for some wisdom and guidance as I look to make this career change.

So a little bit of background, I graduated from UVA with a degree in psychology in 2015. Being the first one in my family to go to college, I didn't really have all the proper guidance to prepare me for what would be to come after graduating. I definitely dropped the ball when it came to internships and applying for jobs before I graduated. Needless to say, I struggled to find any job with my lack of experience the first several months after graduating. However, one of my friends was able to get me connected with a contractor via LinkedIn to get me started paying off my students loans. I started working in the mortgage industry, and have had several career changes since. I now have a pretty good understanding of what I do not want to do, but I am still seeking to find what I want to do career-wise. After going from mortgage, to law enforcement, and now construction engineering, I think that I want to switch career paths one last time and settle in IT.

Now I've been reading several posts on this subreddit, and a lot of you guys seem to want to find out why someone with no IT background is ""interested"" in diving into IT. Well, despite my lack of IT background and classes, I've always been fascinated by technology. I also really enjoy building things, and I started by building my very first computer two years ago. Since then I've built three computers, and I'd like to think that I'm pretty decent at identifying hardware at the very least (I was told that this would beneficial to me in studying to get my CompTIA A+ certification). Another reason I feel like would help me to enjoy a career in IT is that one of my passions and goals in life is to help people in whatever career field that I get myself into. To my understanding, I'll be doing a lot of that when you start out in help desk with all sorts of different people. I've read and heard of several people getting frustrated starting at help desk with all the people that you encounter, but I do not think that will be too much of a problem for me. For the most part, I am a fairly patient person when it comes to dealing with people, and as I mentioned, I really do enjoy helping people. I know that I'll encounter several technologically illiterate people, but I already have two at home that I help all the time haha. I know that helping your parents versus someone you don't know is different, but I thrive intrinsically when I'm able to successfully help someone with their problems. This leads to my last point as to why I think I would enjoy a career in IT. I enjoy solving problems. I love working on puzzles, and solving problems is a bit like working on a puzzle for me. In the end once I've figured everything out, I like to lean back and take in what I've accomplished. Although I don't know exactly what I want to specialize in, I know that I definitely want to get into IT, and I know I'll be able to figure out specifics as I go along.

So now that you know the ""why"" I want to get into IT, allow me to explain my plan (this is where I think I'll need the most guidance). I plan on studying to get my A+ cert to at least show that I have the basic fundamentals to get started in IT. However, I do not know what the best study materials for the exam would be, and where to go to get them. I prefer free resources if possible so I looked into it a little bit, but I was not sure what was reliable to get results. If the best way to study would be to purchase a study guide, then some suggestions would be very much appreciated. I also noticed that a new exam was coming up mid January of 2019...would it be better for me to wait and take that? Or will the new version not be too different from the current one?

Secondly, what advice do you have for me applying to different help desk positions once I've gotten the certification? I reside in Northern Virginia, and it took me long enough to get the jobs I've held now (and I didn't even need any technical skills to get them). How do I get companies to notice the addition of an A+ cert when all they see are the odd, completely unrelated jobs that I've held on my resume in the past three and a half years since graduating? If you guys offer any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance fellow Redditors :)

TL;DR Looking to start a career in IT with no IT background. Need advice on what resource are reliable for CompTIA A+ certification. Also need advice on how to get companies to notice me with my hodge podge of a resume after getting certified."

I am fairly new to data science and recently joined a course on data analytics and machine learning. To gain some practical experience in the field I decided to start an internship alongside my studies. I was selected for a project where I was informed that I would have to sit and analyse large sets of data on patents and come up with adequate data visualisations and interpretations. 

Since I have no prior experience in patent analysis and come from a relatively unrelated physics background, I constantly pestered my supervisor for help but was asked to use my own ""creativity"" to come up with ideas. He was polite  but completely unhelpful. Yesterday I got a phone call where I was informed that my group is doing an extremely poor job at things and our work is worth only being ""throw away into garbage"". 

This was something i needed to rant about but I really do want to salvage something out of this internship. Is there anybody with any experience in the field of patent analysis who could point me in the right direction ? I would be very very grateful.

I am a senior about to graduate with a bachelors in accounting. I really enjoy coding in my spare time, i took a intro to programming (python) course several years ago and started a software development certificate to see if i would like it and i did. But it would have cost too much money to get a cs degree so i went with accounting. The certificate is still in progress (2 classes from finishing) it will basically prove i know how to code even though i have my own apps (just not put on the marketplace) and webpages (not on a server) but honestly i dont care which field i end up in. Just looking for the money. So the issue im having is...
Even though i have had interviews for internships i havent landed anything. I have previous work experience general and some javascript and the advisors are impressed by my skills (whether they do that with everyone i dont know but probably) and they are suggesting i add another semester to get a cs minor. Problem is, it costs 20g, and i wont have it for a year... so my question to you guys is, does a CS minor for accounting hold more water than a Software development certificate?

Cliffnotes
-academic advisors advise adding 20g of debt + one more semester to getting a CS minor with my Accounting major.
-already started a software development certificate (basically 3 different languages and a basic intro to coding course and significantly cheaper)
-i have my own projects app and webpage just not on the web.
-does the arguement increase my likliehood of getting a job?

Programming Languages I know - Java, Python, C(solving rudimentary problems at University), Scala(only object oriented and not functional)

I had taken this Fall (what would have been my junior year) off of school to continue working as the company offered to keep me on to help finish their new web app. During this time I have developed core site functionality, received consistent praise, and even taken on my own intern. The back-end team is 3 other individuals who have over 70 years combined experience working at IBM and Scholastic. I have been able to learn more at this company being mentored by these individuals than I have at school. I was just informed that the company is putting an offer together to keep me on full time, and possibly pay for me to go to college nearby so that I can take a couple classes while continuing to work. This startup has recently closed some large deals and I feel that I am very valuable to them. They have attempted to hire a full time individual for the back-end team for 6 months and have had no success. As they are trying to continue the momentum built by the new web app and the recent deals I feel that keeping me on is very valuable to them and I feel that I have a good amount of leverage for negotiations.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking an offer would mean leaving my out of state college which is a good liberal arts school, but by no means strong in Computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

It would also mean that I would need to start paying back my $30,000 in student loans because I will not be taking enough classes to be considered part time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that the main benefit to taking this position is the experience and career opportunities. I am considering taking the offer and finishing school part time, eventually getting an MBA to open opportunities as a high level tech company exec. I feel starting work now at 20 years old, partway through college, will put me ahead of other grads time wise, but also significantly experience wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to note is that I am considerably happier when I am working and not at school. School is not good for my clinical depression and I feel better as an individual and have been significantly more successful in the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

As I wait for this offer to come through I'm hoping to get feedback on this situation, and advice on what things I should be negotiating for.

Over my second year I’ve pretty much lost any and all motivation, passion, whatever you want to call it for my studies. Overall, I’ve become completely apathetic to anything related to school. Because of this, I’ve developed a lot of bad habits that I know have caused a lot of harm and am becoming incredibly stressed out about the future.

Question is, how bad will it be?

All I’ve heard from forums, this subreddit, and junior and senior students is that third year is the most difficult year of them all. Usually the counter to this is that “you get better” but if anything, I feel live I've become worse. I think the crux of the problem is that I no longer care about my studies or engineering. I use chegg and solutions manuals to solve assignments, find solutions online to labs, if available, and do the bare minimum for tests. As a result, I’m failing most midterms/tests and just barely pass finals. I’ve hated each of my labs so far (especially physics and chemistry) and have absolutely abhorred anything related to some project. During the latter half of first year and all of second year, my final grades for my courses have slipped from slightly above average or average, to basically 15-20% below the average for a course.

I don’t really know what else I’d be doing, and, quite frankly, I’ve never really had an answer as to why I picked engineering in the first place. I do have several jobs lined up, following internships, I just need to graduate first. I’m not very excited about them, so that doesn’t help in the motivation department.

Assuming that I don't shit the bed at my internship, and that I get a return offer, what is the best way to utilize my senior fall to negotiate higher salary/benefits ? I have a considered underloading (i.e. taking 3 classes) and spending most of my time trying to recruit for FAANG level offers.

Later in the evening they came down to the event, and pulled me aside to ask about my previous job in a similar field. I told them the previous job asked me to do a lot of hard selling, which I wasn’t too comfortable with. 

They then told me they didn’t think it was a good fit and got really defensive about how they weren’t asking me to do any hard selling; which wasn’t what I said about my current job at all. 

I can’t get out of the head space that this is all my fault and that I’m useless and one of those flaky people who can’t hold down a job, even though I showed up on time, never went over my allotted breaks and asked on what there was I could do to help out.

I'm a senior CS major in college. Had planned on doing the military post-graduation, and after doing years and years of ROTC ended up getting medically disqualified. Due to all the extra requirements of ROTC, I never ended up trying for internships or anything of the like. My gpa (including transferwork) is 3.1.

I've been following the sub for several weeks now and applying for my jobs in my spare time. I haven't gotten the level of interest I was hoping for, so I put up a portfolio website using React.js and I've been getting professor's permission to put up the more complex programming assignments I've done on my GitHub to showcase.

Honestly any job dealing with Java/C/C++/JavaScript that makes at least 50k/yr I would be happy with. I have one part time semester left and I'm really terrified I'm not going to have a job offer by graduation.

Does anyone have any advice for me and how I can leverage years of ROTC on my resume? Additionally, I'm really struggling finding companies that are willing to accept new grads. I keep finding companies that are trying to fill the position ASAP or expect multiple years experience in tools I've never used for entry-level jobs.

Thanks for reading."

Europe based.

Completed my BSc in Biomedical Science and met my former supervisor (bioinformatician) who introduced me to the subject. Did basic stuff in my undergrad thesis; clustering, classification, PCA of SNPs, Used 1K Genomes Project Data &amp; HapMap Project

Moved to UK. Did an MSc in Molecular Medicine. Had exposure to basic online tools in bioinformatics (or should I say computational biology).

Moved back home. Started work in a diagnostic lab (90% of the time doing PCR lab work, NGS etc) Got the chance to have access to more NGS data.

Started teaching myself basic Linux stuff. Attended courses to the point where I could write scripts and use it on actual data. Also learnt a bit of Python on my own.

I am at a point where I would like to transition to a new job/position since my career progression prospects in current position are stalling. I would like to get exposure to computational biology, possibly abroad again. I would mostly love to use available tools for data analysis although I would love to learn to write longer pieces of code myself. The time I spent doing so, I found it intriguing.

My end goal is to work in Industry not academia.

Options include:

a) PhD: This is usually the most common course of action but I have a few problems with doing a PhD. Although I like research, I think using the PhD as a sort of a means to an end, to progress in industry would make me less motivated? (dunno) than if I were obsessed about doing research. I have no intention to remain in academia. I want to be able to do a PhD were I can get as much bioinformatics skills as possible to parlay them into getting a good industry job. My question is : Is there a better way to get that experience?

b) Work Abroad: Job opportunities in this industry are practically non existent in my home country. One option would be to work abroad in a position where I would be exposed to both lab work and dry lab and learn as much bioinformatics as possible to be able to progress. Any examples of such positions? One option would be to maybe get an internship, attend courses at the same time and then transition to a full time position.

c) 2nd Masters? : Focused on bioinformatics. Dunno what's the benefit of doing 2 Masters or if anyone ever heard of someone doin it.

Sorry for the long wall of text but I'm starting to feel a lot of pressure in deciding my next course of action. ANY HELP appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already applied to Georgia Tech, and I feel pretty confident about getting in since around 94% of people who make it into Tech math get into Tech, and I have some ECs at least and an A in the class so far. I have already applied to Tech, UGA (accepted with honors and scholarship), and Alabama (accepted). I am considering doing RD for one very high tier school, mainly just because I am curious and there are reasons that I would prefer to go to these institutions over the ones I have already applied to. I know my coursework/ test scores aren't great, but I know people get in with lower scores than me have before. I haven't taken SAT IIs so can only apply to schools that don't require them

&amp;#x200B;

For U of Pennsylvania, I would apply for Finance (Since their engineering programming isn't very highly ranked and I am torn between business/finance/math and engineering), and for Stanford, I would apply for electrical engineering. Obviously, Stanford is significantly more prestigious, but I was wondering what my chances would be at each school (or how much less likely of a chance I would have to get into Stanford). I plan on only applying to one of them since it is expensive and I know that the chances of being accepted to either are slim.

&amp;#x200B;

Objective:

SAT I (breakdown): 1520 (720R/800M) 1st try, but 2nd try I actually did worse (700/790). Obviously, not sending that.

ACT: 31 (Won't send)

Sat II: Didn't test

Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 3.875

Weighted GPA: 4.583

Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): 17/\~540

AP (place score in parenthesis): Chem (4), Physics (5), CS (4), World History (4), CSP(5), Lang (5), Calc BC (5), AB Subscore (5), Human Geo (5), Bio (5), Physics C Mechanics (5), Psych (5). Also, I took but didn't test in Stats and APUSH

Senior Year Course Load: AP Gov, AP Econ, AP Lit, Research and Internship (2 classes - includes a research project. I'm interning at a materials manufacturer (mainly ChemE/materials science focused)), Georgia Tech Distance Math (Linear Algebra and Multivariable), and AP Physics 2

.Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Nothing major. AP Scholar w/ distinction + a GPA/classrank award.

&amp;#x200B;

Subjective:

Extracurriculars: XC and Track (10,11,12), Swim (12), Boy Scouts of America (working on Eagle 9-12), Beta Club(11,12), Science Club (11,12). In freshman year, I didn't have transportation. Should I talk about this?

Job/Work Experience: Worked 2 summers in IT at an apartment complex. Could probably spin this to finance since I did some of that for Wharton.

Volunteer/Community service: Boy Scouts of America, Beta Club. Some in school stuff, nothing notable.

Summer Activities: see work. also, did cross-country training all summer.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 6. I'm not a great writer, and my topic was somewhat cliche. I was told it was a good essay, but I definitely didn't do anything crazy. If I choose to apply to any other schools, I will fully rewrite essays with a different topic.

Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):

Teacher Rec #1: 7/10 - Calc BC teacher and I'm in her classroom during GT math. She doesn't like me that much, but I think she wants the best for me to get into college. Probably not too personal, but I think she did a good job.

Teacher Rec #2: n/a

Counselor Rec: 6/10 - experienced counselor but she doesn't know me all that well

Additional Rec: n/a

Interview: n/a

Other:

Applied for Financial Aid?: Yes

Intended Major: Electrical Engineering or Finance

Thanksgiving weekend I slipped and fell while running to my car in the rain at a restaurant. I broke my wrist and had to have surgery done. I got discharged after 2 days and I chose to stay home from everything that week. Come this week I'm feeling better enough to work (not strenuous, I am a programmer). The president of the company I work for wanted a doctor's note so I left work and brought back my discharge packet, which has information for my follow up with the surgeon (mind you the president of the company is out for a few days to take care of her spouse). One of the managers called the surgeon's office and asked about a note for work because we weren't sure if the president would take the discharge papers (which say on them activity as tolerated). The office said they weren't sure at the moment and called back today and told my work that I can't work until my follow up visit.

This is my concern, them even answering the question whether or not I'm able to work (discharge papers say I can, pretty much) without my permission violates HIPAA laws doesn't it? I can't be out of work for 2 weeks because school payments are coming up and I've been paying out of pocket for classes. What kind of recourse do I have if the doctors office did violate HIPPA. If not what else can I do to recover lost wages?"

I’m in a fix about whether or not to take it, so I’m listing out the pros and cons, so you guys could help me decide/give me advice on the situation:

PROS:

1) Well known company, can open many doors

2) Never had a real internship before, and really need some kind of work experience before I graduate (did research/took classes the past two summers)

3) Impossible to get a summer internship at such a company (I’m not a stellar student, and to top it off, I’m an international student and it’s 10 times more competitive for me, and summer internships are 20x more competitive)

4) The exact area I’ll be working in (biologics) is right up my alley

5) I’ve always wanted to go to grad school but my grades are suffering/I’m starting to find industry to be nicer than I thought; and taking time off school might help me figure my life out.

6) I can use the off semester for completing my minor 

7) The mentor seems fantastic, and from what he mentioned it seems like I’ll learn a lot.

CONS:

1) My school only offers certain courses in certain semesters so the courses I need to take in Spring 2019 will only be offered Spring 2020, so I’ll be in school an extra semester (and I might need an extra semester any way because of my minor/electives)

2) I’ll be with a different cohort of people (the year below me), and I find engineering classes kind of hard to survive without a group of people. It’s going to take me a while to form a new network. I’m also not the best at making friends.

3) I’ll be taking the courses in the sequence a year later than I should, which means I might not remember everything/anything 😂

4) The location of this co-op is in the middle of nowhere (a small town in Massachusetts), and I don’t know how hard it’s gonna be for me to survive for 6-7 months.

5) It’s till June 28, 2019, which means I can’t find a summer internship that spans the rest of the summer.

6) I have so little time to figure out the logistics of this. 

So overall the job seems like an excellent opportunity, and I have literally 2% chance of getting any kind of job when I graduate without experience (highlight: As international student I need to be extra-qualified to get any kind of job). But the cons are also not completing surpassable.
So here are my questions:
1) Do you thinks the pros outweigh the cons?

2) Has anyone tried delaying a co-op to a later term?"

Beforehand, I want to thank yall for taking the time to read this. For those who are able to help me, I would absolutely appreciate any ounce of advice since I feel absolutely stuck where I currently am :(

I'm a 3rd year undergrad studying biochemistry &amp; molecular biology in a public university. So, here's the thing:

@my Freshman year, I didn't know what I wanted to do, switched majors practically every month and basically gave up on those prereq classes to the point where I didn't do well in many.

@ my 2nd year, I narrowed down my interests to any biology (even though the school is notorious for its cutthroat culture = deflated grades = bad for premed students or any undergrad students) &amp; promised myself that this year would be better. I even got into a lab! But then, personal matters came up and misfortunes happened; in hindsight it totally wrecked my mental health to the point where the university had to make sure I get professional help. By the end of my 4th semester, I had put my lab position on hold and I was basically jaded to all the things that had befallen me and decided I need to stop wallowing in the pithole I got myself into. The following summer, I retook the dropped class plus an organic chemistry lab, and got B+/A's in those two classes. It felt like a restart.

It's now my 5th semester, and things are starting to look up academics-wise. My bio classes mesh surprisingly well with the EE class that I'm currently taking, even though these classes were not meant to be taken concurrently. It's further confirming that bioinformatics/computational biology is the field that I want to pursue. I've honestly never felt so excited about anything until I realized how much of cell &amp; protein interactions can be understood as circuit systems with analogous concepts of feedback loops, steady-state, etc. and that some analytical methods of protein interactions use data derived from algorithms I learn in my EE class. Nevertheless, this light i'm finally seeing won't do any good on my marred GPA :(

As my 5th semester is coming to an end, it's time for me to think about summer internships. By now, I have taken enough ee/cs courses to declare a ee/cs minor in the upcoming semester, and I feel that I am now in a good place in the sense that I know what I want to pursue. I'm interested in dipping my hands into industry applications of these kinds of things, but I really don't know where to start. I'm located in the bay area, and even though there may very well be many kinds of these positions, well, those positions seem to be very competitive here.

Skills-wise, I have Data Science Python experience from my lab position and pretty solid coding ability in Python, SQL, and Scheme(Lisp). By the start of summer 2019, I'd have learned Java as well. I've looked at internship postings for Bioinformatics/Data Science/Analyst Intern positions at numerous biotech companies (Illumina, Genentech, etc.) but I don't qualify for their GPA threshold and feel very underqualified whenever they say they look for ""strong skills in machine learning.""

In a subreddit that seems to be filled with so many experienced bioinformaticians... am I a lost case? What can I do to improve myself -- what other commonly-used machine learning algorithm is worth studying/honing in from this point on? More importantly, should I go ahead and still apply to these internship positions given my circumstances? How should I portray myself in those apps? Would recruiters even consider me? Again, thank you so much for taking the time to even read this post; I appreciate suggestions and constructive comments please. At this point, I have nothing else to lose :'')"

They haven’t specified my role yet, but the applications I put in were for their finance/accounting departments or acquisition team so I would be filling one of those positions. 

They told me the pay starts at $14/hr. I feel like this is relatively low with my education and intent to work full time after the internship. 

For reference, I’m a senior at a non-target school graduating top of my class with a finance degree in May. 

Maybe I’m just being naive, but with the recent push for employers to pay non-college educated employees $15/hr, I feel like my education makes me more valuable than $14/hr. 

I have heard great things about the company and I know multiple people who have been successful through Quicken Loans. It’s also a 10 minute commute from my house which makes it even more attractive. 

Any thoughts on this? Should I accept the low pay with hopes they offer me a full-time position at a higher pay? Does $14/hr seem fair for an internship position? Or should I browse around for better internship opportunities? Thanks. "

Looking for advice on what to do now and questions about certain Countries,PMmeyourbestpepes,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/a3cox2/23m_us_eu_want_to_move_to_eu_in_a_few_years/,"Hello. I am currently a 23 year old male living in the united states (where I was born) and have recently started seriously considering moving to the EU at some point in the future. When I say the future I mean in around 3 to 4 years. I am making this post to try to get an idea of what I should be doing as kind of preparation for this kind of move. I am also hoping to get a little bit of information on some of my possible target countries to see if some of them are feasible. I’m going to try to include as much of the content from the “how to ask for help” post in the sidebar as possible.


Education: I am a senior in college right now and am going to graduate with 2 bachelors degrees. One in mechanical engineering and one in pure mathematics. I have around a 3.6 GPA. I’m not sure how to convert that to systems used in European countries but it is out of 4.0 and a 3.6 in most stem majors is considered very good (at least for engineering). I went to a good university which is generally ranked in the top 50 overall in the U.S and the mechanical engineering department is apparently ranked 20th in the U.S. 

“Real” Job skills: I have a lot of experience with solidworks and 3-d modeling. I also have a decent amount of experience programming microcontrollers with C++ and can also program proficiently in matlab and python. I also have novice machining skills. 

Experience: I am currently applying to full time engineering jobs so hopefully before i start the process i will have maybe 2-4 years of industry experience. Beyond that I did a one semester internship during undergrad which mostly dealt with robotics. I am a member of 2 design teams at my university which is where I developed my machining skills. I also did some undergraduate research in applied math (partial differential equations applied to mechanical engineering).

Criminal convictions: none

Languages: Fluent in English. Probably around a B2 level in spanish at the moment but still trying to improve. I have not actually taken the test, however, that is just where I think I am based on my understanding of the levels.  Would be completely open to learning another language as I would not want to feel like more of an outsider than I have to if I move. 

This brings me to countries of interest, in not really any kind of order

Netherlands - Both the Netherlands and Denmark are on this list due to the languages apparently being easier to learn than other EU countries. I have not visited either of these countries. 

Denmark

Germany - The reason Germany is on here is that it is typically the seen as the best EU country for those with STEM degrees.
 

Spain - I am visiting Spain next year in march for around a week. The main reason Spain is in my list is that Spanish is the only other language I am semi-proficient at. After doing some research, however, it seems the job market is not very good, even for engineers.

Switzerland - I have been to switzerland twice, each time for about a week, and really enjoyed it each time. Switzerland is also the country in which my Grandfather was born and some of my other relatives still live there. My grandfather is no longer alive and my dad was born in the U.S so I’m not sure if having cousins in Switzerland will give me any kind of leg up.

Financial situation: I have around 5,000 USD in savings at the moment but will try to get that number up as much as possible once i get a full time job after uni. Here is the thing though. As I am extremely lucky, I have a college fund which still has roughly 80,000 USD left in it. If I were to to go to grad school in Europe and I could use this money, I would have no trouble paying for grad school.

So that all brings me to my main questions.

1). Is having a masters degree absolutely required for working in the EU? After reading various posts on this sub, many commenters have pointed out that it is much easier getting a job once you have your masters degree. Would applying to jobs in the EU without a masters degree be a waste of time?

2). Are the job markets for mechanical engineers in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain very good? Obviously the job market for stem majors in Germany and Switzerland is pretty good but I do not know about these countries

3). Is there really anything I should do besides learning the language, saving up money, and applying to jobs before I start the actual process?

4).Would having a Swiss grandfather or any other kind of family give me any leg up with Switzerland at all. If not that is not a problem I am just curious.

5). Would there be any reason to try and forgo getting a job here and instead start applying to either jobs or grad schools in the EU right now? I know I would have less money and most likely no grasp on the language at all as well as less experience so there probably is no reason to try to leave now but I am not sure.

a3czyv,3,2018-12-05,Panic disorder: nausea,AppropriateCaptain2,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a3czyv/panic_disorder_nausea/,"Hello guys,

This is my first time posting here and I created a new account for it, as I don't want everyone to find out about it (I'm not ashamed of it, just use my original username everywhere on the internet).

I need help. I'm 19 year old (M) and in Univerity. Since July of this year (started during an internship), I suffer from a panic disorder. Whenever I'm outside with other people, I get nauseous.  It got to the point where I didn't want to leave the house without a plastic bag with me (I still do this). I also get nauseous at home. When I go to sleep, the nausea start. The last 2 weeks, I've woken up numerous times and couldn't return to sleep until after a few hours later.

Since July, I lost 10 kg, because I was not able to eat anything while outside (I was on summer vacation in August and restaurants were the number 1 choice of the rest of my family). I got about 4 kg back, but I'm still not able to eat the same amount as before the panic disorder (outside or inside).

I gets so bad that, even with a plastic bag with me, I feel like I have to leave the room, otherwise I will throw up. My grades have gone down, because I cannot focus during the classes and the exams. I feel like I have to distract myself from the nausea and do this by playing games on my laptop. Of course, this prevents me from (completely) focussing on the class itself.

Currently, I'm under treatment with a psychologist. After a couple of sessions, she concluded that I *might* be autistic and that that could be a reason for the panic disorder. Unfortunalty, I only have a session about once per month, so currently I do not know for sure.

The reason I'm writing here is to see if there are any other people that had a panic disorder where they felt like they would throw up. I think it would help me if someone could get me a few tips on how they dealt with the panic disorder and how they got rid of it. For example: did you go to a therapist/psychologist, did you use any medication, did a certain diet help etc?

I would be amazing if any of you have any tips that could help me dealing with my panic disorder."

I landed a comp sci internship last summer and got some GREAT experience with software development and web development, but I still worry that I might have a difficult time being taken seriously post-graduation when I look for a computer science job with a math degree.

I just graduated from college in May and got a degree in Information Technology which is just like a degree in Computer Science, but the watered down version because it is missing a few courses like science courses, software engineering, and etc. The degree mostly consisted of heavy theory/concepts like networking and cyber security as well as coding which I realized towards the end wasn't something I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life, but I do see it as something I would do on the side such as app/game development because that is something I am into. In my senior year I got an internship in my old high school where I did desktop support and I realized this seems more appealing to me and am now going down this path in IT. The internship taught me the basics and got me comfortable to work in the field. After I graduated I landed my first help desk position after 4 months of looking for a job. I have been working there since August and I feel like I want to do more and already thinking how can I take my career to the next level. What I am doing right now what from my understanding is Tier 1 stuff, but I want the chance to do more. I am on a contract right now and its about to end in a January. Also I am going to be honest all the stuff I learned in college hasn't really helped on the job. I am learning as I go. My help desk manager is the coolest dude he has been patient and trained me. He said I have improved a lot since the beginning, but I know I am still far from an expert and quite amazed that I even landed this job. 

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to what I do on the job its basic help desk stuff such as create tickets and try to handle them myself remotely or in person if I can. If I cannot resolve the issue I would escalate it to the right person. I use AD to make accounts, reset passwords, and unlock accounts. I prepare computers for employees to use by installing the OS which would be Windows and installing applications. I would also sometimes pop them open to put in a new hard drive, add RAM, or to diagnose an issue. I also have just recently asked my network manager if he has any simple jobs to let me know so I can help out and get my feet wet with networking stuff. Hopefully eventually if I get hired to work at this same company when my contract ends he can give me harder stuff to do. I also always show I am eager to learn when there is down time I sometimes ask my help desk manager if there is any work for me to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So now my question is how do I move up the ladder in the world of IT? After working this help desk position for a few months I feel and almost 100 percent positive I can do more. I want to move onto the next step and try to become a junior system administrator. By the end of this contract I will be having a year of experience which comprises of my desktop support internship and my current experience working help desk. I just bought the Comptia A+ book, so I can study and get my certification. What other certifications should I get? How do get to the next step in my career? Should I just stay doing help desk or do something else? I see a lot of posts of people saying do that for a few years and then try to move up, but I am here thinking is there any way to move up faster? To anyone that responds with advice thank you."
a3fgfb,1,2018-12-05,Manager from old team in old internship company asking me if I am still interested in coming back after graduation?,LibertyState,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a3fgfb/manager_from_old_team_in_old_internship_company/,"Hi,

I interned for a year at a company, then came back to my last year, and graduating next April. I learned a lot at the company but the location/social environment is not the best, people work overtime everyday (and so did i), so I want this to be my backup.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I had already told my manager that I am interested in coming back to the team if a job opens up (as my backup, but obv didnt tell him that). Additionally, I had also talked to a different team that I may join after grad too (also as backup), but that was at the time when I didnt know my manager would open up a role in my old team, whereas the other team was almost guaranteed to open up a new role by the time i graduate, and i told them I am interested in joining them (as my backup).

&amp;#x200B;

now, this is the situation:

1. backup 1: not with my old team, I was told i must apply to them in january time for a may start position after my grad. since this entire company is a backup for me, my plan was to take the backup and keep applying at other places and by beginning of April if i get something else, i will cancel my acceptance of this backup team, giving them a month of time to adjust (I was told this is okay by several people).
2. new backup2: my old team during my internship. I had already told my manager I am interested in returning. However, this is also a backup just like option1. The problem with this, is that i prefer this backup over the previous backup. However, I cannot cancel this acceptance if i find a new job because I know this manager well and he's well connected, and I dont want to burn any bridges with him or waste his time. But obv he doesnt know this is a backup for me.

None of the backups are 100% but theyre lets say 90%. I prefer backup2 but there are higher consequencese with backup2 if i cancel it, since i would be burning a bridge with a manager i know well. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I say to my manager to let him understand that I am interested in joining, but it does not mean i will not pursue any other positions (in the same company or outside) in the meanwhile, and it does not mean that I will accept his offer if he gives me one, even though I am interested in being considered in his search for a candidate, without sounding like I dont know what I want?

This semester I took a leave of absence to take a step back to clear my head regarding my decision about staying or transferring. I've decided to go back in the spring but submit transfer apps before I go so that if I still don't like it I have the option to transfer. 

During this semester I've been taking a data structures and discrete math class a local university. My normal school's CS department won't accept the data structures class for transfer credit bc it's department policy that every CS major has to take the school's data structures class. Unfortunately, every other CS class has this data structures class as a prerequisite and the professors I've asked have said it's a very strong pre-req - it's possible to take one of these classes without having taken the data structures class, but the professors are either not going to allow it or put up a bit of a fight.

The schools on my transfer list will accept the data structures class as transfer credit though, so in my mind it's a waste of money to take my normal school's DS class if there's a good chance I don't end up staying at the school. 

Given the difficulty of taking any other CS class, I was thinking about doing an independent study. This summer I did research with CERN which was basically all data science and programming. I'm planning on continuing the research with my professor I was working with in the spring regardless, but I figured I might as well make an independent study out it and get credit for it! The benefits of this are that it would count as credit towards the major at my school if I choose to stay and I'm pretty sure the same is true for the schools I'm looking at transferring to. More importantly, I don't have any side projects and didn't get a chance to get super in--depth with my research this summer (most of the time was getting familiar with the science part and the proprietary data analysis framework that CERN uses) so my resume could definitely be stronger. This is probably the most important thing to me given how important internships are for getting jobs after college - my logic is that if I can spend a semester going all out on this research I'll have plenty of code to show off, which will strengthen my resume, allowing me to get a better internship next summer hence setting me up to be in a good position for recruiting my senior year. The downside of this, however, is that I'll be missing out on learning more about CS from a theoretical standpoint - if I don't do an independent study I'd probably take a Computer Architecture class or Intro to the Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms class, which are beneficial I'm sure, but I feel like actual experience is more worthwhile.  

What do you guys think? Any advice/input or suggestions to help me make this decision? 

TLDR: considering transferring, current school is super stingy about everyone taking one class which is a prereq for all other CS classes even though I took the equivalent at another school, considering doing an independent study continuing research writing software with CERN (which is very data science and programming heavy) instead. 

Thanks!

a3irom,2,2018-12-05,Extremely stressed in graduate school and afraid i'll graduate without a job,throwawayatayaua,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/a3irom/extremely_stressed_in_graduate_school_and_afraid/,"I'm a first year graduate student in an applied economics Ph.D. program. It's been a very stressful semester and have felt like I haven't done well. I'm used to doing quite well academically and now I'm a little bit below average. As a result, my self-esteem has been going down and I have no self-confidence in any of my work.

In addition, I am afraid that I will not find a job once I graduate. If I was unable to obtain one lousy internship in undergraduate with a good academic record, how the fuck am I supposed to compete with other Ph.D. students for positions? This anxiety probably stems from, despite applying to 300-400 internships, not getting any positions. I mean fuck, I haven't gotten a call for an internship in 2 years. I really have no idea what to do if this trend continues. My inability of getting a job is a major contributing factor of me staying in the program. 

I am sick of being such a loser in very faucet of my life. I don't want to have to be driven by anxiety throughout the day. I just want to be happy for once. "

Courses taken:

Control Theory (both analog and digital)

Cooperative Control

Microcontroller Programming and Architecture (AVR ASM &amp; C)

C++ for embedded systems (AVR)

RTOS (Intel 8051)

Experience:

Several projects with Arduino when I was younger (grown to had Arduino)

On top of my course work during my internship I was exposed to some more RTOS at my internship C and C++ on an STM32 (don't remember which board exactly) and a Redbear duo.

I'm not worried about about the company trying to save on costs by this as they are paying full compensation  for this probationary period. I don't get benefits though so maybe there is that? (Holiday season so it is understandable, in my opinion. Again, the compensation was much higher than I expected and makes up for it to me).

I am honestly ahead of their schedule for my tasks (We use Jira or something. ). There are interns and I usually take on their easier questions if I can answer it before it has to go to our more senior developers. I don't seem to have any conflict with any of my coworkers yet. I am super comfortable with their tech stack and while I do learn new things every now and then, it is not overwhelming as much as I expected based on the pay.

For more senior developers/decision makers out there, what are you mainly looking at when you get someone on a probationary period as a ""consultant""? What can I do to increase my odds of getting an offer? I really like this company and this job and would love to stay here for quite a while. Are there any signs I can look out for to see how well I am doing? Any other tips or advice helps!"

$me : 17 year old and working my first real job as an IT intern for our school corporation. 

$friend : one of my closest friends that I roped into working this job with me.

$NT : new teacher that started working a few months before we started our work in IT.

$Boss1 : head director of the IT department, very busy in meetings to secure funding for 1 to 1 program.

$Boss2 : chill and laid back fresh out of college.


So $friend and I started working as interns for our school cooperation over the summer. We started out doing basic camera work, running cat5 and terminating ends.

At the beginning of the school year we move on to more tedious work such as taking inventory and reimage every computer on the network.

The school corporation included 4 elementary schools, a Jr high and high school, as well as a central office and alternative education building. 

In total we inventoried and reimaged roughly 1000 student desktops and 300 staff desktops.

One fateful day, $friend and I aimed to knock out an entire elementary school in one fell swoop. We planned for me to go through and restart all computers and get them ready for $friend who followed behind and selected the correct image and took inventory while he waited. 

We made good time and ended up actually making it through the whole school in less than 4 hours.

It's important to note here that we were only supposed to image student desktops in this manner, since the staff computers needed to be backed up first which took much longer and had to be performed by $Boss2. 

The next day, $friend and I are in the IT office looking at the rather short list of tickets that needed to be taken care of, and then we realize that all tickets are from the school we were at yesterday. 

The first ticket reads: 

[
$NT - I don't have access to the share drive to pull my lessons for today and my backup folder is gone too.

$Boss1 (hidden note user can't see) - $NT is a newer teacher who has one of the old Dell's from storage. (The same we use for student desktops)

$Boss2 - after investigation, it looks as if $NT's computer got a student image instead of a staff image . The backup folder is also gone since to backups were made for this desktop. I will get the correct image pulled this afternoon. 
]

$friend and I facepalm and then continue to read and realize that we have wiped 4 teacher desktops. 

Baffled at how we did this because we only imaged student desktops. (Typically 4 computers sitting in a row at the front of the room)

We called $Boss2 to ask what we did wrong and he explained that the newer teachers have set up their computers right next to the student computers. 

TLDR: 

My friend and I wiped 4 computers clean of all data, thinking we could get our jobs done faster.

Both parents are immigrants. First-gen to college. Only child. Family income &lt;30, applying through Questbridge when possible. Significant acting experience. Homeschooled.

**Geography:** Gorgeous Glendale, California.

**SAT:** 1600 (6/3/5 Essay RIP)

**GPA:** 4.0UW (school doesn't do weighted). Community college GPA: 4.0.

*Rank:** 1/1, literally.

**SAT subject tests:** 800 Math 2, 800 Physics, 800 Chemistry, 700 US History (submitting all of them).

I'm homeschooled. This puts me in the unique position of 1. not having much access to ECs and 2. not having much access to APs, but it also lets me take advantage of California's fantastic community college system.

**APs:** 5 on Calc BC (5 AB subscore), 5 on English Language. Those are the only 2 I took.

**College classes:** Ho boy. 2 semesters of US history (3 units each, early, pre-Civil War and late, post Civil War), 4 semesters of physics (4 units for algebra-based mechanics, 5 units for calculus based mechanics, electricity &amp; magnetism, and waves &amp; optics), 3 semesters of chemistry (5 units each, covering all of general chemistry), 4 semesters of piano (first two semesters were 2 units, next two were only 1 unit),  2 semesters of math (4 units for statistics, 5 units for calculus III, multivariable and vector calculus).

**ECs:** different, to say the least. Tons of acting- I have a manager and an agent, audition all the time, have booked plenty of stuff and made some decent cash (though I've barely broken even because of the absurd amount of expenses, I might add). Nothing anyone would recognize me from. 

I've also done improv at The Second City (s/o to /u/epicsquared) for over 3 years in Teen Troupe, which performs to the public weekly.

I completed the entire Kumon program (even though I'm not Asian, which is what literally everyone assumes when you mention it), and now work at the center where I studied. I am in charge of the upper levels.

I volunteered and later worked as supplemental instruction leader for Physics 105 at my local community college.

I volunteered over 200 hours as a tutor for underprivileged students in the Hollywood area. Looks nice, got a great letter of appreciation from the director, but nothing particularly prestigious.

I also work as an SAT tutor. I'm pricey cuz I know my shit, y'alls.

**Now here's the big one:** Research Internship at Caltech. Tootin' my own horn here, but this one's pretty bomb. I interned under a mathematician at Caltech and under him, did research using some fancy mathematical nonsense. Culminated in a report (which I wrote) and a presentation (which I gave). Nothing published, unfortunately. Also, thanks to this, I got a letter of rec from a big shot science man. Can't say who, but the guy's got his own wikipedia and is, to use a technical term, kind of a big fucking deal.

**Awards:**

Questbridge College Prep Scholar, and also National College Match Finalist.

National Merit Semifinalist.

National Hispanic Recognition.

Dean's honors at Community College, 3 times.

Honestly these are pretty weak. Aside from the national stuff, I just don't have access to much due to being homeschooled.

**Expected Major:** Some combo of math, physics, music, and theater. I wrote a lot about my love of both the extremely mathematical and the extremely artistic, and how they have a strange, small, yet highly satisfying intersection.

**Letters of Recommendation:**

Counselor: I think it's half-decent? Again, here's the trouble as a homeschooler. She's super proud of me and obviously wants me to succeed- and I've been working with her for years- but I've literally never met her.

English: Same story as above. That said, I think she let me read it once and it seemed pretty good.

Math: Very solid. I asked my kumon teacher (who is now my boss) and she's worked with me extensively, needless to say. She's been pushing me towards college for almost a decade, so she definitely made this one good.

Supplemental recommendation: In the words of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr, ""lit af."" This was a pretty great letter from my mentor at Caltech, who's got some nonzero gravitas.

**Senior schedule:** first semester: Multivariable and Vector calculus, statistics, piano 4 (already accounted for earlier). second semester: differential equation, linear algebra, piano 5.

**Essays:** Ya boi. Idfk man. Sometimes I feel like Hemingway, sometimes I feel like an 18 year old pathetic high school senior who needs 3 and a half scholarships to afford college, and sometimes I remember that I actually am a pathetic 18 year old hs senior who needs 3 and a half scholarships to afford college. I think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8a1fkl/fuck_my_1600_or_why_i_wish_my_parents_had_made/) is a good example of what me writing at my best looks like. I wrote about tons of different stuff- I wrote about the beauty of entropy and chaos and how it's actually a manifestation of God, and I wrote about math, and music, and Mexican food. And on my Stanford roommate essay I wrote about pesto sauce. My writing is more like a rhapsody than a symphony. The reader doesn't know where it's going because to a certain extent, neither does its author. They're still pretty fucking good though imho.

**Schools:** 

Through Questbridge: Stanford, MIT, Princeton, Yale, Pomona, Rice, Caltech, Columbia, Emory, USC, Williams, Amherst, Bowdoin

Through Common App: Harvey Mudd, Harvard.

UCs: UCLA, UC Irvine, Cal, UC Santa Bawbawa, 

Of these, I've submitted Stanford, MIT, Princeton, Yale and the UCs. Probably only gonna finish the supplements for like half the rest, lmao.

Chance me, nerds.

EDIT: adMITted. Still waiting on some RD schools I would ***maybe*** consider over MIT, but chances are I will comMIT."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always up for some Excel experimentation, but at some point, you have to ask for help.

I'm currently trying to make a worksheet for my internship. Every day different suppliers arrive with their order. They send a packing list a couple of days/weeks in advance, so our Warehouse knows exactly what they will receive, and when.

The issue here is that some shipments come in without pallets underneath, so they have to be stacked onto pallets here, in the Warehouse. Every article has a different size, so there are different ways of stacking them.

We've created a list where every article in the shipment has a specific way of stacking the boxes. Right now, we have to do this by hand completely.

Imagine the first sheet being a list of all articles the company has in store, with product info and stacking ways. This is what it is supposed to do:

&amp;#x200B;

1. User clicks button and a new sheet opens. The new sheet is renamed the current date.
2. User clicks button in new sheet. Screen opens where user can fill in an article number.
3. Article number is found in first sheet, entire row (with product info) is copied to the new sheet.
4. Next article number, until every relevant article's line is copied to the new sheet.
5. Now I have a list of the articles that will be delivered. Two more columns have to be added: Number of full pallets and number of leftover boxes (already have these formulas).

I hope it's slightly clear what I want the macro to do. I however have no idea how to efficiently start this and how to make it work in the first place. Any suggestions?"

First of all, thank you to anyone that takes the time to offer advice.

A quick summary of my situation: 

I work full time as a purchasin agent at a small company. I'm starting my BA in CS at FIU Summer 2019 as a Junior. My main goal is to earn an internship at a decently sized company by Summer 2020. I have no programming experience at all. I've asked many FIU students of the CS program about which factors helped land them internships at large companies.

The the main factors were:

1. Meeting recruiters at career fairs + hackathons

2. Leetcode

3. Side projects

So here are my questions:

1. Will I be able to handle a full time work load while enrolled full time in my courses?

2. If I do leave work for Summer classes will I have enough time to learn enough leetcode for Fall internship interviews?

3. How should I start preparing now for internship interviews? I thought freecodecamp html/css would be a good first step. But where do I go from there? 

I'm trying to develop the right plan to land that internship in 2020. Thanks for any advice.

I have no programming experience at all. I've asked many FIU students of the CS program about which factors helped land them internships at large companies.

The the main factors were:

1. Meeting recruiters at career fairs + hackathons

2. Leetcode

3. Side projects

So here are my questions:

1. Will I be able to handle a full time work load while enrolled full time in my courses?

2. If I do leave work for Summer classes will I have enough time to learn enough leetcode for Fall internship interviews?

3. How should I start preparing now for internship interviews? I thought freecodecamp html/css would be a good first step. But where do I go from there? 

I'm trying to develop the right plan to land that internship in 2020. Thanks for any advice.

I’m a transfer from a community college. My GPA at the community college was a 3.6ish and now at Berkeley, it’s a 3.1.

However, due to mental health issues (I’ve been dealing with depression but haven’t spoken to anyone about it), I’m failing almost all my classes this semester and my Berkeley GPA will probably fall into the low 2’s, maybe even lower.

I never put my GPA on my resume and my offer does not say it is contingent on grades. Will my GPA come up in the background check? Will they rescind my offer?"

I have just recently finished my first internship and started to surf the job posts. Most of them require years of experience, but you can't get experience without a job. So I was thinking, maybe I should apply for an internship one more time (3 months unpaid and 2 months minimum wage) to rack up some professional experience, and, perhaps, land a job at the same company.

What do you think? Are internships worth it when it comes to landing a better development job? "

So I’m a college student, studying a 4 year paramedic program. This semester I decided to take cardiology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology, along with 180 hours or so of field/clinical internships. Sounds like a disaster, right? Not really. I have A’s in both cardio and pharm, and HAD a B in patho. 

Until Tuesday morning at 8am eastern time. 

This patho course is online. I wasn’t required to take it for my degree, but signed up for it because I like to learn. A&amp;P focuses on how stuff should be normally but who calls 911 when they’re normal? 

Our exam was supposed to come online at 8am Monday, and it was due by 8am Tuesday. Monday morning I check the website. I expect a notification that the test was up, but there wasn’t one. This prof has forgotten to post a scheduled exam before, so I figured that’s what happened. Closed the laptop and packed to go home. I’m living in VA for school but home is NM. I was set to drive, with my guinea pig. My other guinea pig passed away on Friday, and I just wanted to go home and see my family. It’s been a rough semester with walking pneumonia, then constant nausea and vomiting, and 4 courses of antibiotics in 2 months. 

So it’s about 2pm and I check again. I quickly scroll through the side bar checking for it. Look for any notifications, and check my email. Nothing. At this point, I should’ve sent my prof an email. But this is TIFU so obviously that’s not what happened. 

I decided to start the drive. I get to Atlanta around 10:30-11. After I set up my guinea pig, I immediately opened up the laptop to look again. I couldn’t find it, so I sent an email to my prof, asking where it was. I cc’d the email that came to my phone so I could see his response quicker. 

I go to sleep, thinking something came up for him and it would be up a day late. I woke up at 5:30 and checked my phone, no email. I wasn’t surprised, I sent it so late, around 11:30, and it’s barely 5:30. Ok. I try to get some more sleep but that’s not working. Now it’s 6:30. At this point I should have checked our official school email.. but think that’s what I did? Nope. I scrolled through reddit and Instagram cause I’m an idiot. 

Finally at 7:30 I relent to being awake, and turn on my laptop. I check my school email. He had replied within 20 minutes of my email, and told me exactly where it was, and had been, since 8am Monday morning. 

Under a tab on the sidebar. Called “**exams**” 

That’s right folks. I opened up announcements, course content, and even the gradebook to search for “upcoming assignments.” 

I checked the site 3 separate times. And each time, I NEVER SAW THAT TAB. What’s worse? Apparently our previous exams were there too. I remembered them having a notification and at least one was at the top of “course content” I think. But really who cares what I think because it doesn’t matter, I was wrong. 

Like I said before, my grade was a B. I had missed a written assignment because I didn’t realize it was due by 8pm that day. I’d been working back to back 12 hour shifts and wanted to study for it during shift downtime, then do the assignment (which was timed, and you could only start it once) after I got off at 8pm. I didn’t want to start it during downtime because a call can come in at any time. 

So that assignment was worth 14%. My other exam grades were 85, 92 and 82. The exam I missed was worth 14.25%. 

I took our final anyway. I was prepared for it, just like I was prepared for the exam I missed. Got a 94, missing only 2 questions. But per the syllabus, my overall course grade is a 64% now. 

TLDR, I apparently can’t read and don’t have the sense to immediately contact my prof asking where our exam was. Didn’t realize it until it was too late, and now my grade went from a B to a D, in the last few days of the semester. "

I have recently graduated high school(kinda recent May 2018) and to be honest my grades/test scores aren't the best. My GPA was a 3.46 and my SAT score was actual garbage(1250 out of 1600). I have enrolled in a Community College in California that has lot's of transfer students enter the UC system and has even had (VERY FEW ) transfer students attend Stanford. I also plan to take the ACT because I have been doing serious prep for the last 6 months. Since graduation, I have also been working and saving money for college. In high school, I was also class president and did a cool internship. Also, I will be a first generation college student.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to get into these schools by taking a HEAVY Math/Physics/Computer Science course load. I did well in these classes in high school (STEM Courses). Obviously it's going to be VERY hard but I will do my best to get and maintain a 4.0 GPA and get to know instructors so I can get really good letters of recommendation. I also want to join clubs and help out in the community.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I have started a gaming company. I have made 2D games compatible with Android and iOS devices and I plan to step it up by making 3D games(I've made 3D characters and done some animation before). I will soon have a kickstarter which I sure hope doesn't fail, but that is definitely a possibility. I also will have an engineering internship with Facebook next summer which is VERY EXCITING!

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to apply to Stanford next fall and I start at the CC in January! If you have any advice for me please let me know and I will greatly appreciate it !

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: I'm starting community college so I can transfer into the UC system or Stanford. Got any advice? Also , I will be taking the ACT."

Add the second column and boom a red x appears....wtf.  

""The tool is not licensed""

Turns out, if you want to sort a feature class with two columns you need to have the ArcGIS advanced license.  You can't even sort by two columns if you pay extra for the standard license.

Are you kidding me? Go to hell ESRI.  I know there's workarounds for it, but imagine if Microsoft told you that you had to pay more for something as simple as sorting an excel spreadsheet by 2 columns.  It’s just so arbitrary and stupid.  I’m turning into a grumpy old GIS curmudgeon every day I use their software. Soon I'll be yelling at interns to ""Get off my shapefile!"".

I am a recent grad with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET). I have been working as a commercial HVAC Estimator and Project Manager for the past 6 months. I do not like it. The company I work for is an awesome company in many ways. I have been told by my parents, and from other people in the industry that the company I work for is one of the best. That's the good part! The bad part, is that I just don't like the job, but I have no idea what job/career I would enjoy/fit into. Right now, my plan is to stay at this job for at least a year to ""build up"" my resume. The idea is that I would have a better chance getting hired somewhere else if I stayed at the job for at least a year. My resume isn't really tuned for anything in particular. I worked as a home remodeler, and an overnight worker at Home Depot during my summer breaks in college. As an engineering student, you're told that you need an internship in order to find a a full time job after you graduate. I applied to probably over 75 companies, and never got an interview anywhere. Through a family friend, I was able to get in touch with the people at the company that I am working for right now. I was actually the first intern they had in the estimating department, which is kinda cool! After the summer internship was over, I went and finished up my last year of college. During that year, I applied to a bunch (maybe 35) companies for a full time job. I got 1 in-person interview, and a phone interview somewhere else. I didn't get an offer from either company, so I applied to the company I am at now (internship place) because I was kind of desperate. They ended up offering me a job, at $45k a year. It's pretty dang good pay straight out of college. This job I have now sounds great, but the problem is that I don't like it. Basically, what I do, is that I am the middle man in between the Contractor, and the Manufacturer. I buy the equipment, and sell it at a higher cost. My job involves lots of paper work, and takes a person with great organizational skills (which I like to think I have) in order to succeed. I am succeeding, and I have made the company, in the past 6 months, more than they are paying me for a year (the pay in not the problem here). It's more of the fact that I don't like sales or never getting to see any of the equipment I buy and sell.  Lately, when I get home after work, I have been looking online, and have taken some of those short ""what should your career be?"" quizzes. None of the career ideas from the quizzes line up with what my resume shows, or what my skills are. Can someone suggest some ideas of companies or career fields that I would fit into? 

Some things about me, and what I am looking for in a career: I am very mechanically inclined, and I watched ""How It's Made"" every day before elementary and middle school. This is one reason that I got a degree in MET because I liked to know how things were built. I was always taking things apart and putting them back together (minus a few screws haha) as a kid. As a side note, I did pass the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, but I don't know if engineering is actually for me. Basically the MET degree says I should be running a CNC, but I would rather not. I don't mind working outside in any condition (I live in Colorado). Right now, I sit at a desk all day, which has it's perks in itself. I am a very visual person, so seeing physical equipment (instead of the just blue prints) is import to me.  I know there is that quote from Mike Rowe about how this perfect job doesn't exist, but there has got to be something out there that I can match up with, right? How in the world can I get a job anywhere if I only have experience in the HVAC estimating and project managing field?? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!!"

In terms of offers, I have 2 right now. Both with consulting firms.  One is in Chicago with a salary of $60,000 and the position itself is resigned to one language that Im not fond of workig with. The other is in NYC with a salary of $50,000. No signing bonus. 

I'm not fond of the idea of living in either of these places right after graduation, especially for what seems like a lower salary than what I'd need survive in each (student loan payments are gonna be high).

My dilema is that my deadline for the Chicago one, the better of the two offers in terms of compensation, is next Friday and I'm unsure of what to do. 

Do I decline in hopes of getting an offer from one of the companies I'm still in the interview process for?

Do I decline and hope I can find a job before graduation?

I got an internship at a great start up but my coding skills weren't on par with others and no one had time to coach me on anything, but my soft skills were appreciated after I managed to sell an usp to a client, and I was moved to management and sales after 5 months of dev. Using this opportunity, I worked hard on my communication, management and moved to a Big 10 Tech company in junior management. It's been great so far.

I've obviously been in touch with trends and started to get into Blockchain. My company has many teams and it's pretty easy to move horizontally if not vertically. They had an opening for an entry level Blockchain dev, and I stepped in. People do know me as credible and hard working as a manager, and I was accepted immediately. I start in 2 months.

My concerns are:

* I haven't coded a proper application, ever. I do learn now, I do it for about an hour a day as my schedule and work doesn't leave me with more time, but it's almost as though I've forgotten how to sit and code as though it's the only thing I have to do.
* I don't have the same 'tech' mindset that I used to - I'm intuitively a people management person now, but I desperately want to code.
* I'm worried that my credibility will reduce as I may not produce the same results as I used to as a manager.

Because of that I am currently working as an operator in a data-center for a relatively large company in the hopes that i might be able to get a job here and they will forego the lack of experience because i am already with the company(long shot at best). My concern is that I don't have any confidence in my abilities, my grades were always good and I always worked hard to produce good work, but it just feels like I don't know anything that even basic programmers should know, its as if I didn't retain any of the information. I was always the type of student that would do whatever I had to do to get the assignment done and done well, whether it was pulling all nighters or learning completely new frameworks that i needed to make my code work the way i wanted. I started watching Web development courses online, and that was good and all, but then when I was with a professor they had me create a project that was completely different then the way i was learning online, so it came that i found to be staring at 2 completely different ways to develop. That got me thinking that there are so many ways and methods to development that everything i could be learning might be fine that specific way, but that way is only good like that, and i would only understand that way instead of the more ""right"" way that others may develop and the social norms of the development community. My project consisted of my web application that used Express and MongoDB, because that was what i had experience in from my online courses, but even then i was only a rookie and some of the things that my application intended on doing were pretty advanced. The way that i created the front end with was embedded JavaScript which i basically only used because the course had used that method, other than that it seemed that it was not something that everyone used because i had hardly ever even heard of it before. Eventually the project did enough of what it needed to do for the intentions of the assignment but in my eyes was a complete failure of my expectations. I thought that i could produce something that could actually have real world value and help me get a development job, but all it did was make me further question my skills and show me that i somehow don't know anything about web development as i moved from one stack overflow page to the other trying to find a way to incorporate ideas to perform my unique data manipulation in express. Now i barely even have the drive to look at code, let alone try to learn more, because i don't think i will retain anything. I basically just go to my job and come home and sleep, then the cycle begins again and again. I just feel like if i apply for a job i will not get it and i feel lost in the world of development. Everywhere i try to learn from tries to teach me some new way to develop web applications that specific way and everyone is different than the last and i feel like they only teach how to make that specific thing like just using a cookie cutter instead of learning to mold the dough to whatever you want. I want to get a Development job but I'm just not good enough right now and I don't know how to effectively get better. I could really use some perspective on my situation from someone, because at my current moment i don't see myself getting a different job, or trying to pursuit what i want without a better understanding of everything i need to be successful.

a3yv6q,0,2018-12-07,"Real Talk (""Professors"" and ""Administration"" welcome too)",GTAdminsSuck,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/a3yv6q/real_talk_professors_and_administration_welcome/,"Yellow Jackets, I hope you're doing well. Hang in there, this semester is almost fucking over. You got it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my last fucking semester and I'd like to share some advice and make you aware of some very real things. Unfortunately, there are so many things school doesn't teach you and it makes me question the point of school. Things that are essential to life. I will also criticize GT professors on a good bit because \*most\* of them don't fucking get it.

&amp;#x200B;

1) School doesn't matter. Learning does, but school doesn't. I can't emphasize this enough. This doesn't mean drop out. Instead it means that school doesn't teach you what you really need to succeed in any field or life. Seriously (they don't require things you need like personal finance). Teachers think making us memorize a bunch of \*useless\* facts will make us smarter. Think again. Research has suggested that rote learning doesn't necessarily lead to understanding. From my internship experiences (bias involved here), I and many of my friends haven't been able to utilize a lot of what we learned in our classes -- this is a hot debate and I can get into it very heavily, but I'm not going to because that's not the point. The point is that the stuff they teach you at school is really pointless. \*Most\* companies don't give a shit about your GPA. They want to see if you think metacognitively (procedural knowledge more than declarative). They know a lot of bright minds understand that the traditional curriculum design is a failure and pursue their own agenda (aka not interested in school). After all, you're just downloading a bunch of algorithms and data in your brain. Who gives two fucks about theoretical bullshit that you can't utilize? Companies will train you, and life is really a joke after GT (still be driven and passionate about what you do). I am a perfectionist and my family is foreign. They always expected straight A's. Take a step back and really look at life......FUCK STRAIGHT A's and even B's. I'm not saying do the bare minimum, but do your best and if you don't get the grade you want, then fuck it. Move on. Get your degree and get the fuck out of this here. Use the brand and networking opportunities that this school affords -- THAT'S what matters. It's unfortunate that a degree is really needed, when in fact, it doesn't do much for you. Yes, school is a business. Yes, school is designed after the factory model (fostering obedience, raise your hand, don't question things, etc). Oh, and don't trust (different from listening) academic advisors when it comes to workload -- they didn't go here, they don't fucking know. Talk to your peers. And that leads us to the next point.

&amp;#x200B;

2) You need to get out of your shell and be a socially compatible nerd. It's okay to be a nerd. I am one. BUT know how to talk and deal with people. Your people skills will get better over time. Sometimes you will mistakes, whether it be in emails, your tone when talking to someone, your choice of words, your actions, etc. But you need to stop being a wuss and start talking to people. People don't really want to work with introverts. If you want to be a code monkey, then go ahead. But most jobs will require communication skills, and excellent ones and mannerism if you're dealing with clients. When companies interview you, they look for more than ""do you know what you're talking about"". They look to see if you are someone they can work with. Someone that they can talk to. Someone they won't mind sharing the same office space with. Yeah, this school's social culture sucks because off the \*useless\* fucking work they give us. It's okay. There are still opportunities to socialize and go out. Talk to your peers and get to know them. Go talk to that person you're interested in taking out for coffee or dinner. When I say go out, I'm referring to things that will refresh your mental health. Events that will get your mind off this shithole school. It could be hanging out with friends and playing a sport or game. It could be networking events that involve drinks with CEO's, SVPs, EVPs, engineers, analysts, recruiters, etc. It could be a punching bag with a corrupt or selfish administrator's/dean's face on it. It could be cooking something. It could be vaping CBD, or getting shitfaced in Beltline/Midtown/Virginia Highlands/Edgewood/Buckhead/Athens/Atlantic Station/etc. It could be getting a good nights rest and taking a jog in the morning. You gotta be able to say fuck your studies sometimes. There's more to life than that. I'd sacrifice my GPA a little for networking events throughout my college career. Because connections are more important than your stupid fucking GPA. In other words, they get you further.

&amp;#x200B;

3) You need to be driven if you want to succeed. I'm sure a lot of you are spoiled and feel entitled off mommy's and daddy's connections and money. Ask yourself: Where would I be without my parents? If the answer is ""I can still survive"" then great. If the answer is ""I don't know"" or ""I wouldn't be able to make it"", then you need to really be grateful for what you have and realize that there are students who have it \*a lot\* worse than you. There are students who have been paying their way since 18 years old and sometimes before that. I'm talking about paying for every bill you take for granted. Most of you have it so easy and you need to stop bitching about ""too much work"" and stop acting entitled. Lol, most of you don't have the slightest idea. If you act entitled, most people will not want to associate themselves with you. Realize there are people who don't have clean water or are able to eat a grain of rice in some parts of the world. You're at Georgia Tech. There are bigger and worse problems than your grades, research, etc. Look at Palestine for example. You need to have this epiphany and wake up. Please realize your problems aren't the end of the world. If they seem like they are, then please talk to someone and figure out a solution. Don't give up. Keep pushing on. I can't tell you how much shit I've been through. I used to be a bad boy. Spent \~13k to the system (yeah I was treated unfairly by the corrupt govt) in things like speeding tickets and things I will not mention. I also went to jail a good bit (nothing is on my record!). I thought about suicide. Yet, I still made it to Georgia Tech. And I'm about to graduate. Fuck this school. You can make it out. Beat the fucking system.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Now this point is aimed at the professors and administration (especially CoC) at this school. First with the professors, and then the admins. Some statement may apply to both.

&amp;#x200B;

""Professors"" : 

You need to start assessing what's really important. GT is a research institute, but you're here to teach younger generations. If you put your research over teaching, then you should get the fuck out of here. Period. I and all the students here aren't paying tuition for the TA's to teach the course or for you to not give a shit. If you are, you better stop being bitches and be lenient when it comes to grading. This is a major reason that pisses students off. This is a part of the reason why it's us against you. Because a lot of you are shitheads. I had a professor for a particular class who barely came to class. He was to busy getting his PhD. Then he wants to be an asshole and not round up students who were .1 away from the next letter grade. That's what you call a double standard asshole. I had another lecturer who missed more than 2 weeks of his summer class (this is a weedout course). I believe lectures can only miss 2 or so days the entire summer. This guys didn't give two shits. You need to get the fuck out of here if you're not going to do your job. Period.  

&amp;#x200B;

Next, you're not going to come to class and make jokes when you're an awful teacher. If you can't communicate, then you should NOT be hired. GT admins need to step up their fucking standards and have a higher baseline when it comes hiring faculty, etc. I don't give a fuck how brilliant you think they are. They need to know how to communicate. I had a teacher for linear algebra and this motherfucker would come to class and make jokes the whole time (treat everyone as if they were a freshman) and could not communicate concepts. I and many others had to teach ourselves. What the fuck is the point of having a professor who can't communicate? Don't get me wrong, I have had brilliant professors here. But the ""professors"" that can't communicate are not good for the students, especially for their \*mental health\*. Have them go somewhere else, like uGA.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to establish personal authenticity with your students. You need to share this collective cognitive responsibility within your department. Stop teaching shit that doesn't matter. Start sharing meaningful applications of what you're teaching. Stop teaching stupid fucking theory that isn't practical. 

&amp;#x200B;

For students that don't know, in the summer of 2017, someone from the provost office (no longer works at GT) was honest with me and she told me that there was not an organized body who reviews CIOS. She stated it was something that was being worked on, but it didn't exist at the time. What the fuck is the point of us filling them out?  Be aware students. Interrogate everything, especially if it comes from authoritative sources (govt, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

More on collective cognitive responsibility. You need to teach the fucking truth. I understand America's true colors. It's the one that isn't taught in school because it's not appropriate. Why don't we learn that the CIA created Al-Qaueda in 1992 (history)? Why don't we learn that the US govt tried to assassinate MLK in 1999 (history)? Why don't we learn about Thomas Drake who exposed major things 6 years prior to Snowden (4001)? SOPA (Aaron swartz and in 4001)?  Why did my teacher for one of my classes not tell students about how it was the CIA that actually conducted the Tuskegee Syphillis Study...that professor just stated the govt (lol, what a fucking shame). Students need to understand the truth about a lot of things. Things that school or the govt doesn't want them to know. It helps understand the perceptions people have about our country. US govt agencies are nation state threat actors --&gt; look at the ""White Company"". The US is now transitioning to training cyber terrorists to meddle and cause havoc in other countries (the new wave of war). How long has the US been in war (2xx years)? Teach the fucking truth you scumbags. Stop trying to push a perspective/your political agenda.  Could it be the factory model? For example, we're taught to despise communism and countries like Russia and North Korea ever since we were kids, among many other things. Yellow Jackets, interrogate everything. Do your research. Don't get me wrong, I love the US (land of the opportunity). But the govt. isn't your friend. Realize that. #peaceIsBetterThanWar

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Administrators"":

You want to push the ""Let's talk"" stuff, but you don't seem to want to address concerns from particular students. You know damn well what I'm talking about. You say one thing, but do another. What would you call that?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad I'm getting the fuck out with my degree. Ya'll have a lot of clean up to do. And no, you're not getting my fucking money. Get your shit together. You need to change the social culture and things mentioned above."

Some background info, my school pays for my tuition. They have paid 12k so far.  I have 4 years at my employer. I have a BS in IT. So the issue I have is 2 years ago my employer noticed my degree(AS) at the time. So the IT department came to me and talked to me and thought I was a good fit.  I interned (paid) with them for a week before being sent back to my last department.  For months I was not given a reason. Finally I received the response the IT supervisor did not follow protocol. So I left it at that. Then a year and a half later 2 spots opened up in IT. One was given to their current intern and they interviewed for the other. Of course I interviewed. Didn’t hear back. My supervisor told everyone I got the job and even gave me date I was transferring. So as it got close to the date I never heard anything official so I emailed the IT manager. He told me they haven’t chosen a candidate that I was being considered still. So several weeks pass and never heard so I emailed regarding another issue he still said he hasn’t chosen a candidate. Several weeks pass by again and now I need 40 hour internship as part of my final. So I email again he said he would get with HR. Several weeks pass again and I email again he said he was working on it. Several weeks pass again I speak to HR she said she would work on it. Still haven’t figured it out. This has been since May for my interview.  Also I just learned a couple weeks after the week I did the internship a year and a half ago. The reason I was removed was the Supervisor is also in charge of engineering and one of his subordinates son got the internship and is the one hired for the spot. What can I do? This is in the state of Florida. "
a40hha,1,2018-12-07,My boyfriend is being harassed and left unpaid,MurphyDontLetMeLeave,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a40hha/my_boyfriend_is_being_harassed_and_left_unpaid/,"Hello,

I've been doing a school internship in Paris, France for a tech company, I've met my boyfriend there during this period and since then his boss has been harassing him and making his job depressing.

The superior has always been a pervert and sent him adults site links on Slack, he mimicked sexual gesture in front of us while eating and has said politically incorrect things about his other employees too. He's known to be an alcoholic drinking at work and have already been held up from the company for a week last year for smashing things during a ""customer party"".

Pretty much everyone has something agaisnt him but nobody dared to talk about it. So one day, I decided I would after he became increasingly invasive while I was with my boyfriend. I reported him to HR who panicked and immediately reached to the CEO, an investigation was made for three weeks and the CEO was generally supporting the guy, saying the company wants to be ""human"" and forgive people who makes mistakes, he basically talked everybody into excusing him and eventually the pressure about the whole thing or so a few weeks later made us give up and ""excuse"" the guy after he supposedly made a heartfelt apology to us.

We still didn't feel the guy, and things have gone terribly wrong since he came back even though we gave our trust. I ended my internship earlier because it was getting on me mentally, I learned that the CEO said I was dangerous to my colleagues because I would not ""shut my mouth"", he also told them I had been anti-semitic during a meeting with him (regarding the investigation on my BF's boss). Which obviously, never happened.

So my team believed him, of course since I was new in there and they made shit of me until I quit. My boyfriend stayed because it's his only source of income since he has no family left. Now some people in the company started hunting him down (his boss for sure, we suspect the CEO too) and he has received warnings over sick days he had justified prior but his mails were ignored. Some colleagues testified to him that his boss told his colleagues he was trying to have my BF kicked out by all means.

Last month they didn't pay him 300 euros and called it a mistake, they said they would pay him next month the missing due.

This month he didn't get paid for 1500 euros. That's about 3/4 of his salary.He's depressed and we don't know what to do. We can't afford a lawyer and barely food at this point. We can't pay rent either. What can we do? We're lost.

Many thanks,"

I am set to graduate May of 2019 with a B.S in Computer Science. I have a 4.0 GPA. I am eager to start working in the field and a little worried that it will take me a long time after I graduate to find a job. I'm trying to figure out when is the best time to start applying in the field.

I have sent out a few applications recently but I'm afraid that it was a bit too early. I won't be able to work full time until after May because of school and taking care of my daughter full-time.

I have not had an opportunity to be a part of any internships and when I do apply for them from now on they are always taking place in the Summer. 

I'm willing to work part-time until I graduate but I don't know how to tell which organizations offer part-time jobs.

Last year I had an internship at consulting firm in Calgary where we regularly rented vehicles from Enterprise and the company was directly invoiced. I finished the internship and came back to Ontario. I got a call from Credifax collections saying I owed Enterprise money for a truck that had been rented in June 2017. I managed to acquire the invoice and it had invoiced the company but apparently at another address (seemed to be their US head office). I got in touch with the consulting company and they paid off this amount immediately. I often check my credit file and when I refreshed my score I saw a huge drop. It now says I have a ""Derogatory Public Record"" and under collections account lists the Credifax collection account as being paid. I understand that even if such an account is paid, it still shows up and is a negative that will stay on for 6 years. I checked my TransUnion account and no such negative entry appears there and my score hasn't been hit.

What can I do at this point to resolve this. It seems that once Enterprise did not get any reply from the invoice they sent to the wrong address, they used my information that I had given when picking up the car and dumped it to collections. Any guidance would be very appreciated."

I'm a 3rd yr student at a Canadian university. I'm a bit conflicted about my current situation regarding summer internship. 

I have already done an internship last summer and have an upcoming winter coop from Jan to April. I was lucky enough to get an offer for the summer from a big defense company.

Pros are that it's a good company, work is what I wanted to do (software engineering intern python). Cons are intern salary is a bit low, its in a different city so I'm gonna be away from family and friends and have to pay rent for the summer and need a car. 

I have until mid December to accept the offer. I'm torn because I want to accept this and not let it go, but I feel like I'm missing out on other opportunities since Canadian recruiting won't really start until January. Also this will potentially be my last internship before graduation, and I don't see myself working in that city full time, I would much rather live and work in Toronto. So I wanted to aim for a company based out of Toronto that would potentially give me a full time offer after the internship. 

I was thinking of accepting this offer, but still recruiting in January and see if I can get better offers from Toronto companies, but I'm scared to renege the offer after accepting it. Has anyone else done this as an intern? What are the consequences. And if I end up going through with this company, how's the job outlook in Toronto looking for getting a good full time offer without interning with the same company the summer before? (Job outlook for reputable tech companies, non banks, with good salaries. eg, amazon, wealthsimple..etc)"

a42av9,1,2018-12-07,I hate my job but I'm scared to quit and start over from scratch somewhere else,buurd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a42av9/i_hate_my_job_but_im_scared_to_quit_and_start/,"I've been at my current job for almost 4 years.  Over the years I've grown to love my job but the stress has been weighing on me heavily lately.  I've gone through phases of feeling burnt out but the feeling always passes after a short while, however it feels like over the past few months, I've been feeling more and more burnt each time and it takes longer for the feeling to pass.  If I were to quit my job, I have no idea what I would do instead.  I dream of having a job where I sit at a desk all day and have to find shit to do to fill up my time, but I also know that I would go crazy doing something like that.  At my current job, there is zero downtime, I'm constantly on hyper alert mode and have to be incredibly aware of everything happening around me at all times.  It's very stressful every day and I feel super stressed hours or even days leading up to my next shift.  I want to quit but also don't want to be out of a job for however long it takes to find a new one.  I also don't want to push myself to a breaking point to where I leave on bad terms with anyone.


There are also perks to my job, which I likely won't get with any other job I find, at least not in the immediate future.  I work 4 10-hour days a week.  I get 4-5 weeks of paid vacation time every year.  I make pretty decent money, enough for me to save a bit and spend the rest on whatever I want to live comfortably.  Good benefits.  My boss is super cool and we have a great working relationship and friendship.  


But the more I think about actually doing the work I need to do, the less those benefits shine.  What's the point of working 4 days a week when I dread every single one? What's the point of having so much vacation time I don't know what to do with it, when there are some days I need to call in sick just because I can't handle the stress of it?


Another factor that has come up in the past couple weeks- I was injured last year and was unable to work my normal job for almost 6 months.  My job was cool about allowing me to work alternate positions for a while, but it got to a point when my injury wasn't healing, that they basically were going to have to let me go if I couldn't return to my position.  I was able to get by with my injury thanks to the nature of the job at the time.  Now, I feel the same injury coming back and I'm scared to go to the doctor because I won't be able to do a crucial function of my job in order for it to heal.  It's not completely debilitating, but it is very annoying just in my daily life to deal with, and I feel it getting worse every day.  I feel that since I've already been through this same thing before, my job is not going to allow  me to work another position and will just tell me if I can't work then that's that.  Which honestly, wouldn't be a bad way to go.  Also, I should add, I likely got this injury due to the physical requirements of my job, but don't have the paperwork to prove it since it's kinda developed over a period of time, so I can't really count it as a work injury.


I'm just at a lost.  I really don't want to take a major pay cut, but I also don't want to work anything related to what I'm currently doing, at least not in the same position.  There aren't other positions available at my job currently, but there are people at my job that have sort of created positions for themselves in the past.  I have an idea of something I could present to my supervisor, but I'm worried they wouldn't want to pay me for what I'm doing, especially right now as we have interns that are currently doing a lot of the work that I would propose to do in this created position.


It feels good to get all of this out, sorry it turned out to be a long read.  If anyone has been in any kind of similar position and has any advice or guidance, please throw it out there.  I don't really have many passions, I'd love to do something related to gaming but I have zero experience doing anything outside of my field and the thought of going back to school for something totally different is just such a major setback.  Plus I fucking sucked at school in the past and I'm really worried I'd fuck that up again.  I currently live with my girlfriend, and she doesn't make enough to support both of us, so I need to find something that pays decently enough to support myself, at least."

This'll be a wall of text and probably therapeutic to write. I'm currently 22/m and I’m shaking with adrenaline as I type this out. Its hard to organize my thoughts and I’ve been jumping through the timeline with whatever comes to mind. I should probably say this to a therapist, but my parents are keeping money from me and don’t believe in therapy. I had attempted to talk to them before about my depression but was told to ‘cut the shit’ and not to tell my father about it because he didn’t have time for it. I used this attitude with my friends as lots had been pushed away because they didn’t understand why I was like this and why I couldn’t do anything about it. I was called a downer in the sixth grade and I kept a majority of this to myself since. I’m currently using DXM as a release, my first exam is tonight and I’m about $3500 in debt as I write this out.

I had abusive parents growing up that would yell at me and be beat me for a lot of reasons, some made sense to me and some didn't. If you're eastern-European a lot of us joke about this kind of abuse and I don't know if mine was any worse than others. 

Before I was five, I don’t remember anything of this, we lived in Europe where my family is from and I had some troubling health issues as I grew up. I believe I was in very bad condition for a time and wasn’t sure if I would make it. More information doesn’t really come up and I don’t talk to my parents a lot. I am not in touch with any of my relatives on a personal level as when we moved here I was mostly cut off from them except from phone calls and times when my grandparents would be here to take care of me. 

We moved to Canada when I was 5 and don't remember much from then. I was a timid child, but I picked up the English language quickly from watching TV often, I resulted in being the person that people came to for help when we had a new immigrant that spoke my language but didn't speak English. I didn't mind any of this and helped wholeheartedly and these were most of the friends I made growing up. I sought solitude and had become more and more engrossed in cartoons - I'm a bit of an expert on the few cartoons I watched and did well at a bar trivia night on the matter. We didn’t have a computer or any video games for me at this point. When my grandparents came here to visit I was given more freedom as I got to go outside with her a lot to the park – but not anything more than because she didn’t speak the language and wasn’t particularly close with anyone for playdates. There was a small park in the complex where I played with some children from my home country. 

My taste in these cartoons was first things like Tom and Jerry  and classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons but soon I started watching the more avant-garde shows that made me cover my eyes like Courage the Cowardly Dog and this one weird episode of The Ripping Friends that involved a finger and nail coming out of a guys belly but the nail would lift and up and this would always make my skin crawl.

The one thing my parents had made sure of was that I never wanted any material good. I had numerous big cardboard boxes filled with toys and they were proud of this because it gave them pride to know that money was taken care of, something we couldn’t have in our home country, my mother had never learned to ride a bike simply because she couldn’t afford it. However, we never went on vacations and in order to be able to afford this my parents worked a lot and were never very affectionate with me, they couldn’t afford the vacations that people had to exotic resorts or Disney land. We had gone to MarineLand a few times and Wonderland but mostly when my grandparents had been here. 

My parents had worked so much it would require me to come home from school in kindergarten and go commute with my mother on the bus to the factory they worked at and then commute home with my father in the middle of the night and getting a pizza for dinner. Other times I was stuck waiting in the work cafeteria with books to keep myself busy, no one else would bring kids in. Speaking of books, I loved these immensely. My younger grades had a reading contest where I was blowing past my classmates and read at one point had read 100 more books than anyone else had with favorites like Amelia Bedilia and Geronimo Stilton – and other books of this difficulty that I can’t really remember. My parents were very proud of this fact and would tell everyone. I think I was looking for someplace to escape to and remember more of those books than my life.

The abuse wasn’t constant like some others, but a memorable event was when I was younger was when I had really wanted something and threw a temper tantrum, to solve this as we went home by mom came into the backset of our Honda and beat me, I was threatened with this this happening again as I was growing up. A lot more than this I can’t remember. 

Once we moved to a house as I got into grade 3 things changed, I had previously mostly hung out with other kids from my culture exclusively (my parents had also liked this since they were in as much culture shock as me and had had me mostly have playdates with them). When we got to these new kids, I suffered culture shock, the next-door neighbors were as white trash as you could get in a 300k house 15 years ago and treated their kids far differently, the few yelling matches were worse, but the kids fought back and swore and stuck up their middle fingers at the parents. It was very weird for me and eventually more arguments occurred with my parents as I craved the freedom my peers were given. I was only allowed indoors as my parents went to work during the day and once, they were home I was only allowed to go as far as the lengths of my street. 

I was very alienated and still dressed weird with weird clothing my mom picked out, they were kind of like cheap badly translated Chinese clothes from cheap stores my parents would shop at. Being only allowed indoors and already spending a lot of time on cartoons – when I got an Xbox for my birthday, I flocked to it, I loved Halo and Amped and other games and got engrossed it. When we got a computer and the internet, I loved it even more.

My academic success was paramount, and they didn't care much for anything else - my grades were important and math and science especially so to the point where my dad tutoring me ended in tears and beatings – the math and science was beat into understanding and I didn’t have much of a choice, the other subjects was though of as not important and easy and no assistance was offered here – I was just expected to get a good grade. I was threatened with tutors as child and didn’t want to spend the little bit of time I had home alone before my parents got home after working doing homework – Since I would have to keep doing homework after they got home. Once my schoolwork was done, I was given a workbook to continue working on. I was encouraged and pressured to do things above my grade level and continue to be beat till I could do it. I grew up being the weird kid even more, I always had dandruff since I was only washing my hair once a week and dressing as well as any blunder-years photo you see. 
Living here and being like this lasted until I was in the seventh grade, where because of the housing market we moved to a small 3-bedroom apartment and sold off most things. I didn’t keep in touch with anyone from before but lots of kids do this when you move as it gets difficult. Here I was quickly accepted by a lot of the girls at school because I had hazel eyes like in the Twilight saga that everyone was going crazy about. This was weird to me and I had no exposure to it but I was soon finally feeling accepted by others that were here from a different culture and they were helping me get into it as well. These two girls who lived in the complex next door had taken me under their wing and soon I was getting more fashionable with their help and socializing more with people. The few crushes I had on girls I was too afraid to do anything about or say anything and continued to be a shy and timid person. I couldn’t join any clubs or do much after school as I was always required to go home and do my homework. On the weekends I had more leeway, but this was fruitless since it was hard to make friends while only being allowed outdoors on the weekends. Eventually I was able to go outside in front of the building and talk to my friends during the week but couldn’t go anywhere with them. In the classroom I was calm but had outbursts when kids would bully me – I would yell and scream at them before getting sent to the office as it got quieter.
My grades suffered once we went got to the sixth grade and I switched to a middle school where kids came from all over. Being this weird meant I was more of an outcast here where there was a larger population of kids as the cliques formed and I couldn’t relate to anyone and no one took pity on me and I became a recluse with the exception of a younger kid that lived next door who really liked Videogames and had a PlayStation but sadly went to a different school. In this time, I was bullied more and more and would spend time at recess imagining to be in my videogames and going around the yard acting it out. As you could imagine this didn’t make me popular. 
My parents were none to happy about any of this, my beatings continued and got harsher as my grades dropped, and I had gone to school with bruises only where the clothing covered. We would argue a lot about where I was going and why I wasn’t doing homework instead. All my time was spent indoors  doing homework or with them.
My first kiss in the eighth grade was with one of the girls in the complex next door who understood me enough to make the first move and continue to do so. The girl I kissed, S, could relate with being secretive to parents and doing things behind their back like we were. Both of their parents had more issues with drugs and alcohol and just didn’t care about her. But soon I was going to the mall for the first time, and the movies for the first time and eating out and enjoying food, music, clothing and art from different cultures. However, this wasn’t without its flaws since I was bullied the way little sisters bully older brothers, I was teased often and made to wear a bra at one point because of my man-boobs. The lack of physical exercise since I couldn’t go outside made me a chubby kid and I have yet to ever be confident about my body as the teasing about man-boobs continued. I had become friends with another boy who also spent lots of time indoors and around this time I was taught about online gaming and got hooked on online games. The first times I was allowed to stay over at a friends house overnight were here.

Soon after S had broken off her friendship with the other girl lived in that complex and it was just me and her. Our relationship had lasted until early high school, as by then she started hanging out with other friends and wanted to break up and go have fun. She would soon tell me about making out with the emo guy and having sex at our high-school. The 2000s were rough.
 
Throughout high school I was still not allowed to do many things, parties and staying out late were off limits so I flocked to the groups that played videogames and enjoyed books. Soon I was staying up late whispering to all my friends playing Counter-Strike and Halo CE. 

These friends stuck with me for awhile and most of my time in high school was like this and it all blends together in my memory, some new games came out and the group changed but it existed and that’s what mattered. I was a big part of the 4chan /mu/ community and commonly joked around about ‘tfw no gf’ as I harbored a crush on the same girl for all of high school. In the 12th grade I had my first long term girlfriend where we dated for a year and a half. I was her first guess, she was the first person I saw naked and fingered. Things were great between us but from influence by her friends she wanted to go farther and be intimate together, but I struggled and would get nervous when thinking about sex and had harsh performance anxiety. We eventually broke up not long after a harsh argument where she thought I didn’t want her due to my lack of sexual performance and how nervous I was when meeting her parents for the first time. 

After we broke up early in my first-year university career my depression worsened, I was left lonelier than ever before in a new university where everyone felt like they had already made cliques or we had nothing in common. 

I could never keep my parents happy, any bad grades or news were met with arguments and beatings and any good grades meant I didn’t get beat. The constant amount of time they call me ugly and fat continue regardless of what my academics were like. I would have panic attacks and breakdowns while arguing with them and I would just be forced to stay alone in my room with the TV off. Trying to get my mind off things via my cellphone or TV would result in them taking it and turning it off, forcing me to think about what I did wrong. I never knew what I did wrong, I couldn’t keep them happy and it was so hard.

I struggled to find friends and still do, any time spent is by wearing a façade and interacting with other smart students to get help on homework. I had hooked up with two girls from my past but never got past heavy petting as my sexual performance issues were never fixed. Drinking had started here with a single, pretty, friend but had not managed to turn into anything more. I did not drink a lot but would skip class and go drinking during the day since I had to be home in the evening or my parents would get upset. I had also started smoking marijuana around this time as it gave me a nice release. The marijuana use continued with friends for my old group in high school and soon resulted in getting caught with it in my backpack. A large argument ensued with my father, but he decided not to tell my mom. I was not beat, but he was hurt and cried. I didn’t stop smoking. I had begun using more and sneaking out to get it too. I was caught once more after I grabbed, and my father found 4g in my car before I had a change to get it out. 

Soon after my depression continued getting worse, my use with marijuana has continued to grow more. I use it whenever I get a change and struggle to find anything interesting when I’m off it. When I was away from home for 16months at an internship I stayed indoors and smoked every change I got. My grades are mediocre, but I got the internship anyways as I answered the questions fine.

The arguments with my parents continue throughout this, I’ve wanted to move out and live closer to campus my whole time here to get an escape, but I can’t as my parents don’t approve of it and think all I’ll do is party and do drugs. There’s nothing more important to them than me passing my exams and graduating.

Now I’m here, this week my parents went on their first vacation and I went through 3 bottles of cough syrup as I started experimenting with more drugs but luckily I chose something shitty to start off with and got scared of the side effects I had, enough to stop after the third bottle. 
I can’t find help at my school because the only offers I’ve gotten were to go into group therapy as too many people need help and I wouldn’t be able to talk about my experiences in a group setting, although hopefully now I can. We have a 4-month long waitlist to see a therapist in Canada and I don’t have the money to see one in another way due to the money my parents keep from me. I talked to a doctor when I was told I should start exercising and eating write, going to speech therapy and a test was done for low testosterone. I can’t find the motivation to eat well or exercise and my testosterone levels were normal.

I fear I won’t graduate and be stuck here longer. I can’t focus on my studies and struggle to find the help I need. What do I do?

a42pc8,0,2018-12-07,Another one of those unpaid internship questions,dehmise,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a42pc8/another_one_of_those_unpaid_internship_questions/,"A little about myself first... I am a 21 year old self-taught full-stack developer who has been developing with Javscript for around 6 months now, but have programmed in Python prior for around 4 months. I have experience with popular front-end frameworks like Vue &amp; React and also back-end frameworks using Node. I have built a decent portfolio with apps hosted on Heroku and have a ton of Codepen work that is decent. I was on and off with college and have around 25credits total so far. Apart from the ""go back to college and focus on that"" advice (which is not bad) I would appreciate advice other than that.

Okay so about the internship, I have been contacted by a start-up company that is developing in the VR realm, but needs developers of all sorts. They mentioned data processing and analytics  to me and that there would be a group of interns working together on projects. Now I know that 99% of these free internships in this field are illegal, not to the interns benefit (unless working under mentors more experienced then them), and that you're better off just contributing to open source projects. I also know that its degrading to even respond to free internships since it devalues the work of developers and is just straight unfair and unethical in most cases. I'm not entirely sure what work I'd be doing there, but it does seem a bit off track of what I'm currently doing.

You may say that I answered my own question and that I realize it's not to my benefit and a waste of time and money. The thing is though, I never had any experience like this before and was thinking that I'd at least go for a day just to see how it is and at most do it for a month or so to see if I have any chance at being hired and compensated. Again, this still seems stupid since I personally believe that under no circumstances should that even be the case unless you're truly learning a great deal from the job. Also, I live on Long Island, NY and would be commuting to Manhattan for this job so that adds possibly 3hrs of travel time total and travel expenses.

I guess my question is, is it at least worth it to try the internship out? It would be twice a week from 10am-6pm. Have any of you contemplated doing a free internship as your first gig? "

Should I put it on my resume?,dmfreelance,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/a43123/i_left_a_job_after_about_6_months_without_any/,"I graduated with a bachelors in IT about a year ago. I then got a job as a repair tech.

The thing is, this job was exactly what I wanted to do. It's in my field, I'm good at the job, and I really enjoyed it. Displaying the job also gives me the chance to highlight that I do in fact know how to work in this field.

I don't have a good reputation with anyone in that company because my abusive boss went out of his way to destroy my reputation with the entire company, and any claims I made about his abuse landed on deaf ears because nobody would believe me (the new guy) and everyone implicitly believed him (the perfect manager).

Should I put it on my resume? my cv? How should I spin this?

edit: I could also try to drive home into potential employers minds that this is not necessarily a normal experience for me, because I have been a school bus driver for the past ~3 years. Although it isn't all that relevant, it does highlight the fact that I can hold a job long-term, and even a stressful one. I guess you could say that it's only relevant in light of the fact that nothing else on my resume shows me being employed for more than a few months, because all the other opportunities I've had recently were an internship, a short-term job as a tutor, and freelancing, although all of those were in my field."
a434hb,0,2018-12-07,Nvidia AI vs Big G for new grad?,csnewgrad2019,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a434hb/nvidia_ai_vs_big_g_for_new_grad/,"Hello, I am currently deciding between 2 new grad offers. Compensation wise, they were surprisingly similar but Big G offers more stock and bonus while Nvidia offers higher base and more sign on bonus (sign on + anniversary). Big G also have more outlandish perks (free food, onsite gyms, etc) while Nvidia's perks are in a way a bit lesser (subsidized food, gym membership discounts, etc).

For Nvidia, I will actually be a new grad conversion from intern. The team I will be working for is their AI Infra team which focuses on creating a general AI platform at Nvidia that needs to scale out to petabytes of data and can work on their super computer clusters (think 100+ petaflops).

For Big G, it is a general SWE position which means I do have to get team matched. Therefore I am not sure which team I will land on. However I would be ecstatic if I manage to land on Tensorflow Extended assuming that Big G Brain and Deepmind requires Masters+

In general, I also really like working with my team at Nvidia and the mentor ship is great there on my team. The team is also heavily expanding and trying to lure in top talents. Basically the team is composed of senior engineers from FANG / Big N, Twitter, Uber, etc. However, there is a sense that Big G is more ""prestigious"" however I doubt that all the teams at Big G would be better for my career growth compared to Nvidia AI. I do intend in the future move back to Toronto where I know that AI is booming there and Nvidia also do have an office there focused on AI.

Basically, I think I might know where I want to go but I don't know if I am underestimating the magnitude of Big G might have on my career if I picked to go there."

Notable Experiences: I’ve done a SWE internship for Google/Facebook this past summer and I’m going to return as either a SWE or Data Science / Quantitative analyst intern. I’m also doing research with a grad student. 

Some questions I have: 

Based on this information what should my next steps be? 

Are my courses relevant to quant research roles? How useful is Graph Theory? Same thing with Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning, although I’ve heard numerics can be helpful. 

Which research areas areas most applicable to quant work? I’m just curious, probably won’t make any big decisions based on this. 

What are some good projects to do to make myself more qualified for these roles? 

Is there any hard GPA cutoff?

My resume is currently geared towards typical chemical engineering positions; meaning that that the descriptions of my experiences focus on the end result rather than the technical specifics of how I built the tools/applications. In my experience, the chemical engineers live on massive/clunky spreadsheets and don't understand the technical challenges of building better tools.

What is typical of a resume geared towards data science positions? Do you list particular packages that you're familiar with such as Python's data science stack, sklearn or tensor flow? Do you described some of the programmatic challenges you faced on different projects? What level of technical details do you include?"
a43sp5,0,2018-12-07,I am beginning to seriously regret my college &amp; major choice - is this normal? Looking for advice.,JTank97,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a43sp5/i_am_beginning_to_seriously_regret_my_college/,"**TL/DR: I made my college/major choice based off of salary and job outlook and not off of something I actually enjoyed doing and was passionate about. Now I am beginning to realize the mistake I've made and I'm not sure what to do - I'm unhappy and I'm completely lost.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old junior currently in his 5th semester at a well-respected technical college in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. I graduated high school in 2016, not really sure about what I wanted to do as a career. I was a good student, graduated in the top, say, 30-40 in my class (so middle of the pack), and also got Eagle Scout in 2015. In high school I cherished three things, particularly: art, music, and primarily history. While looking for colleges however I realized that none of those three ""professions"", per say, made a respectable living salary in comparison with other career choices. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, in a hasty panic, I chose the next-best option: I loved to cook and eat, so why not do something in culinary arts and hospitality? And so I found myself on the doorstep of Pennsylvania College of Technology and took a tour. My initial reaction was basically ""Wow, this school is perfect. Good social opportunities (it seems), great instructors, a perfectly blended combination of hands-on and classroom education"". So I applied and was pretty easily accepted. My first semester (Fall 2016) was fantastic - I managed to get on the Dean's List (requirement of 3.5 GPA) with a GPA of 3.73 and knew I had made the right choice. Perhaps this field could be a hidden gem. And this is where the optimism ends...

&amp;#x200B;

My second semester (Spring 2017) was an unmitigated disaster. I finished with a GPA barely over 3 (3.07 I think). My kitchen lab professor and math professors were terrible. I was getting poor grades I hadn't really ever gotten before. And on top of this I had an internship requirement for that summer. Let's just say that this internship ended up being the most frustrating and crushing two months of my entire life, and we'll keep it at that. My third semester (Fall 2017)  was decent as I was recovering from my awful internship and took a break from the kitchen (due to the funkiness of the curriculum) and had classes that focused on my beverage management concepts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth semester (Spring 2018) was my turning point. Mid-February I had realized that I had made a mistake in my major choice and decided on either transferring to a new school (in which I'd run the risk of almost none of my credits transferring making my first 2 years at Penn College a complete waste)  or stay within Penn College's School of Business and Hospitality and go from culinary arts -&gt; applied business management and hospitality management dual-bachelors. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am typing this now with finals starting next week, my fifth semester coming to a close. It had been an alright semester, given that I have just switched majors over the summer. Currently though I am not very happy - my social life here sucks (the social opportunities here are comically minimal and most students here aren't that sociable anyways - and I'm more of an omnivert), there aren't that many extracurricular options that have garnered my interest (most students here aren't enrolled in clubs or the clubs are very, VERY small). The town, Williamsport, is void of anything fun to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lost, and I'm not happy about the current path that I am on. Yet I feel like I've come to this realization a bit too late and I've fucked myself over already and now I'm just paying the price, figuratively and literally. I know that if I decide to change schools and majors I am basically rendering my education over the last 2-3 years obsolete and putting myself back at square one.

What should I do? "

The other programs I could possibly graduate in are

IT - Data Specialist (Certificate)  I could complete this in maybe a semester, if not one year.  Jobs would be Data Analyst or Data Specialist.

IT - Network Specialist (Degree) It would be about a year or a year and a half for this degree.  This would have a core corriculum that includes coursework up to Cisco 4 and prepare me to take the CCNA, CompTIA etc.   

Do you think it would be prudent to look into one of these courses and expand on my education so I have more options in the future?  Anyone done something similar?"
a43vek,86,2018-12-07,ASK-THE- ICS DEAN Response,VitaminB21,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/a43vek/askthe_ics_dean_response/,"Hi again peeps. I am Bryant Gunaman, one of your ICS Senators. A few weeks ago, we sent out an Ask-The-Dean survey to give you an opportunity to raise your concerns to the Dean. After receiving all your responses, I and your other Senator Priyanka Saba chose 5 points that we felt were most urgent to discuss. Yesterday, we finally had were able to have a brief meeting with Dean Marios Papaefthymiou and Associate Dean Gopi Meenakshisundaram; and here’s their responses on:

Non ICS majors who want to take ICS 31:

* The school of ICS is currently prioritizing ICS 31 to ICS majors. Non ICS majors will have to “fight” in the enrollment window to get into this class.
* The reason for the point above is that the school of ICS is currently attempting to make upper div courses better. Therefore, they are going to make it harder to change your majors to Computer Science. After a few years, when the upper div classes are better, the school of ICS will eventually open more seats for lower division courses.
* If you are undeclared, 48 ICS 31 seats will be reserved for you in Winter Quarter with the condition that you have a high gpa by the end of Fall quarter.

It is hard for ICS majors to get classes:

* The Dean is aware that this issue exists and is planning to add 8 more Professors of Teaching (professors who do more teaching than research). This year, we have added 5 Professors of Teaching so far and they are Jennifer Wong Ma, Sergio Gago and Sang Woo Jun, and others.
* However, the school of ICS do not want to only hire professors, but quality professors. Therefore, they are not going to try hire as many as possible but are going to give their full attention on hiring the best professors.
* Other departments such as Mathematics are not short of lecturers because they have graduate students teaching some of their courses. We are trying to avoid that as much as possible in the school of ICS.

The school does not do much to help students get internships:

* The school can only help with some resume prep and exhaust students with school work. To prepare for internships, you will have to take the initiative to do projects outside of school work.
* The Dean will try to make more 190 courses to help students do projects outside of school work.
* The Cal Poly School of Engineering, for example, bases their whole curriculum on projects. The Dean will look into this but still believes in a research institution, students should learn interesting individual skills from research professors instead of focusing on projects and teamwork.

Lack of Mental Health Resources in the school of ICS:

* Associate Dean Meenakshisundaram who worked in MHI (Mental Health Initiative) before, requested to ask for representatives from MHI to be available to ICS students for a few days per week. However, MHI did not have enough people to be able to do that. (side note: Associate Dean Meenakshisundaram also said that he tried doing this for faculty and also failed)
* Both the Dean and Associate Dean will bring the issue of mental health to UCI Provost.
* In the meantime, we suggested to have therapy pets roam around the ICS area close-to-exam periods. The Dean agreed immediately, so we do hope for this in the near future.
* The Dean will also try to provide more TAs for harder classes.

Towards the end of the discussion, we asked the Dean if it is possible to have a BBQ party with the Dean during Spring quarter that is open to the whole school of ICS. The Dean said yes and it’s going to be a pretty big one. "

One of the managers recommended pursuing certifications as a means of showing my determination and learning since I don't have a CS degree (I have a BA in history and a MA in math). He especially recommended certifications related to C#. I see that Microsoft has an exam for C# but am unsure how to go about studying for it. In the past I've always just read books (like Head First C#) or gone through videos on Pluralsight. So I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to prepare for this. Any advice would be appreciated.
a44zrc,0,2018-12-07,Seeking NVidia job for self-taught dev,TheNVhopeful,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a44zrc/seeking_nvidia_job_for_selftaught_dev/,"A couple of years ago I made contact with a startup company seeking a developer, which was one of my attempts at breaking out of web dev. They claimed that the startup was part of NVIDIA Corporation's Emerging Companies Ecosystem. Last minute they rejected me but they seemed to sound more sketch the more I talked to them.

That was 5 years ago and they haven't made any new presence since. I assume they are no longer in operation.

This is the closest I've gotten to work in something that resembles what I'd be into, parallel and distributed computing.

 I am a self-taught web developer, and graduated with an unrelated degree a couple years ago. After graduating, I became a web developer working mainly for agencies. I have LAMP stack experience and have been JQuery-ing it up since 2012. The most high profile company I worked for as a programmer is OWC, that should mean something I hope.

Due to my interests in parallel computing, it was suggested to me to apply to Nvidia for a general SWE position. I applied over half a year ago via their Workday site but no response. It looks like my value of my past web dev experience is zilch if I cannot leverage that kind of experience. 

There are two ways I can go now:

1. Web dev experience --&gt; Two years college studying my ass off --&gt; Nvidia internship 3rd or 4th year --&gt; Nvidia job interview and offer

2. Web dev experience --&gt; (get the attention of the ""right"" people, but I don't know how?!?) --&gt; Nvidia job interview and offer

I want to know if I should go back to college and secure an internship through them first.

If you propose an alternative, I'd like it to be an alternative that is as structured as a college curriculum, and with the same opportunities to network."

I finished my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering earlier this year and worked two month as contractor for Volkswagen (I am German btw). I quit this very well paying because I couldn't deal with all the bureaucracy and didn't have any meaningful responsibilites either. I wanted to be part of this big ""innovative"" industry but I wasn't more than a bored office clerk checking documents.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I applied to only one company because I knew one of their employees who would have been my direct superior but got declined because of that connection (alleged nepotism) although I was more than qualified for the position. Quitting the other job after two month was also a huge redflag for their HR department. They asked several times if I really quit myself or got fired. I feel like many German companies in the engineering industry are very conservative with old management styles. I don't feel like working in this industry anymore because they are not open for the things I like to do. If they create a new position for a design engineer or development engineer they have very specific expectations to applicants and their responsibilities. In Germany there is a saying that applies very well here: ""Schuster, bleib bei deinen Leisten"" (which I think roughly translates to ""Cobbler, stick to your trade!""). I hate that saying because I like to explore new things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the fortunate position that I can live with my parents but I have been thinking about what to do for five month already - waiting for that \*one golden\* answer. My parents are slowly (and rightfully so) pressuring me to at least earn some money on the side as waiter or tutor. I would like to skip that part honestly and work for/at/with something/someone that fulfills the following things:

&amp;#x200B;

\*What I like to do:\*

\- Communicate with people and solve communication issues

\- Being active, staying ahead of problems, solving problems when they occur

\- Dealing with products and their creation (from the idea to development and all the following processes including production, sales and customer support )

\- Diving my nose in all kinds of topics

\- Learning new stuff

\*What I can offer:\*

\- mechanical engineering degree

\- Communicative, Straight-Forward but somewhat diplomatic, Analytical

\- Intercultural experience (I worked in China for 6-month)

\- CAD design (CATIAV5)

\- Can do Calculations of different kinds

\- Knowledge of the automotive industry (18 month combined internship experience)

\- Projectmanagement and product development

(- English?)

&amp;#x200B;

\*Questions:\*

Something entrepreneurial would probably be the right thing but I can't just create a company without substance (idea) or meaningful experience, right? What job/industry would you recommend that I could do or pivot to that either has the above characteristics or leads me to having my own business one day? Maybe a small company would be a better fit for me but I doubt they are waiting for a 23 year old inexperienced guy.

Thanks in advance for all your answers."

I will say I also switched my major from electrical engineering so had no idea about how common technical interviews are. Being that it is already pretty stressful just trying to get a job in the first place I find it very intimidating and painful that I could potentially have 3 or 4 Interviews and still be rejected.

Long story short my CoOp/Internship decided to wait until today to tell me I won't have a job come January.

&amp;#x200B;

Originally going into my last co-op term this summer I expressed I wanted to be put in a department where I could work part-time from September to May as I finish up school. I was told no problem my current department would be able to accommodate that. End of summer comes and they tell me I can only stay in that department until January but that they would have another position for me for spring.

&amp;#x200B;

To be proactive I reach out to my HR contact in October trying to get this situated. She told me to check back in mid-November as it was 'too early to know what positions will be available"".

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-November comes and I reach out to both her and my Co-Op advisor. My co-op advisor tells me I'm on my own and I need to reach out to managers myself to find a position. I decided to reach out to the director of engineering, and a few of my old managers. They all gave me interviews and told me they'd ask around to see what was open. Also that they would talk to my HR contact and she would keep me in the loop.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to now my HR contact finally gets back to me beating around the bush pretty much letting me know I won't have a job come January. She would for sure let me know Monday. There's an opening for an internship on the job board but since I'm graduating in May it wouldn't make sense for them to give me that position since I graduate in May.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of trying to set me up with a department for long-term, letting me take another position early fall that would allow me to stay until May, or even let me know that I should start looking for another internship they waited until today to tell me. It's a little upsetting.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking for advice. Should I be looking for another internship or try applying early for full-time gigs? I'm at a weird sport where it's a little early to apply for full-time positions, but also a little late to take on a new internship. Especially since I graduate in May. I would like for the internship to transition into full time but not a lot of companies are interested in that. What do you think?"
a47vg2,3,2018-12-08,I might need a psychologist. Just not sure how to go about this.,ardi2022,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a47vg2/i_might_need_a_psychologist_just_not_sure_how_to/,"I guess some background first. I'm a nineteen year-old male in the U.S. and in my first year of college. I have always had issues with socialization and self esteem, but I have never sought help before. I made the naive assumption that for some reason going to college and getting into a new environment would help me discover my identity. Instead I spent the entire first term sad and withdrawn, barely having the energy to stay on top of academics. I am now home for holiday break, but I spend almost all day, every day, in bed, completely unmotivated to do anything. I am so disgusted and afraid that I will just waste away these important years of my life. It feels terrible being completely sedentary while everyone else is off traveling and doing internships and research. 

I want to change. While I was in college I tried the free counseling service (my first experience ever with counseling), and honestly it did not feel too helpful. They are always swamped with students, so it is very difficult to secure an appointment unless my life is in jeopardy. When I did finally get a meeting, the counselor seemed to empathize with me and repeat back my feelings, but I left without really knowing how to change. She thought my issues had to do with my childhood and parents, but she didn't really give me strategies to improve. 

So now I am thinking about seeking help elsewhere. My dad is retired military, so I have health insurance under him until I am 21. I just don't want him to know that I am going to seek help. We have a fragile relationship, and I just know that he would grill me with questions and reignite issues. He is part of the reason why my counselor in college thought I had issues. 

I just have no idea what to do. For so long I have told myself that I don't need help just because of how privileged I am. With all their faults, my parents have always made sure I had everything I needed. But now, with the end of my first term at college, I am just defeated. I was miserable in high school, and it seems that things will never change.

a48kg2,1,2018-12-08,(22) Feels like I'm losing my mind and have no direction in my life. Please for the love of all that is good HELP ME. Beware: Long post,Throwawayaccountdual,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a48kg2/22_feels_like_im_losing_my_mind_and_have_no/,"Alright, my instinct is telling me to dress this up in a pretty bow as to not offend or seem like I'm whining, but at this point I need to talk about all of this. Fair warning, I was an asshole for a lot of my life. Here it goes.

The summary of my current situation: 
Just got back from 6 months in the Bronx after a string of mental break downs and a couple of failed suicide attempts. I went to check myself in a mental hospital, but bailed because I didn't feel safe at all there. This brought me into having a brief scared straight period that I'm afraid is fading. I want to thank you for reading this far. 

Before my father passed away:
As far as I can remember before my father passed away, I was fine-ish. My mom plopped me into a private school after I finished elementary school and I hated it due to losing all my friends and feeling like a genuine outcast. I had told her many times how unhappy I was, but she never listened. I used to be a good student who always turned in his work on time, but after a year there I stopped doing my homework altogether. I ended up acting out all the time. I consistently disrupted class with crude jokes and made sexual remarks to my female classmates (Makes my stomach turn having to talk about this.) My only few friends were all troubled kids. What keeps repeating in my mind is that my mom and dad never listened to me about any of this. Mid school was where my suicidal thoughts started.

Relationship with family:
I love my mom, but I have to be honest in that me and her butted heads for the majority of my adolescence. Me and my brother used to be best pals til we had a falling out when I was 16. It was never the same after I told him to kill himself. My mom says it's all water under the bridge, but the guilt eats at me to this day. Me and my sister never got along, but even though she told me I was her favorite, I never understood that at all. My dad is tricky. I loved him the most out of anyone in my family. I felt like I could talk to him about anything and he would always talk to me like a human being (something I wasn't used to). He was not the best to my mom though. As a kid I genuinely never noticed, but now I can put the pieces together.

My dad dying when I was 14:
Freshman year of high school was actually nice for the first half. I went to a great school it tons of facilities and more than 60 students attending. I made friends and stopped being such a jackass in class. I even brought my D's up to C's(progress!) I remember that day. I was watching a cutscene from crisis core when my dad’s employee picked me up. After dinner we arrived to the hospital where everyone was in a hospital room. Nobody would give it to me straight what was going on. I thought my mom was dying at first (She was sickly), but the silence told me otherwise. I didn't cry when I found out. I deleted my Facebook, got sick for a month, and didn't talk to anyone.

Brief delve into satanism:
After losing my dad I lost my mind. I was a zombie most days and my family wasn't taking it too well either. One day I ended up learning about satanism. I tried using it to fill the hole, but it just made me become delusional. It took many conversations with my best friend and two failed attempts to stop when I finally gave up on it. My friend kept telling me it looked like I was using it to replace my dad. I think he was right. Around this time my mother had continually locked herself in her room before becoming a horder. It was a particularly dark time. I just remember piles of trash in every house we stayed in till we got evicted from one

My mom’s boyfriend and going to a dog house college.
Me, my mom, and sister had to hop hotels for months after a financial issue. I shared the same room with them and never got a moment to myself. It wasn't until my friends father came back into town and offered to let us stay in my parents extra house. When my mom got together with my friends’ step father I wanted him gone. I had heard nothing, but bad things about him and I didn't want some jackass causing any problems for my family, but also this was about a year or two after my fathers passing. I'd still dream about my dad every other week. We'd always fight. One day he misheard something I said in the back of the car and thought it was a veiled insult. He told me to get out of the car and I did without a second thought. I was hiking around the whole day till I found a library to rest at till night.

Drop out and moving to cult school
After all the business with my moms boyfriend I moved in with my brother and took full time hours as a janitor at my store. It sucked and me and my brother were kind of at odds sometimes. I broke up with my girlfriend, lost more friends. After a few months my friend tells me his grandmother can get us into college for free with paid internships. I ended up sneaking out of the house to board a plane and leaving my brother the rent. I was done with my family for many things. After a short drive to the college I realized something. This college wasn't accredited and they wanted us to stay in dorms without running water. This was also a hyper religious college as well, but I had stopped being religious. After they found out both me and my friend were agnostic, they'd single us out in front of everyone and insult s constantly. I made some friends here, but later on after my friend voluntarily left I began working at a local factory from 6pm to 6am with an hour walk (Didn't have a car and no public transport) up hill to get home and moved in with a chill bro and a dysfunctional couple. I remember one time when the tub was dirty the couple blamed me, because I was brown. I asked them about the expired stuff in the fridge and they cursed me out as if I had insulted their mothers. Because I worked the graveyard I had to sleep in the day, but it was difficult. It was either the couple cursing each other out over toothpaste or their dog whining for 8 hours straight. Funny enough I wasn't suicidal in this period of time. Eventually me and my landlord became good friends so it was nice having someone to talk to. 

Making amends with my family and moving back:
After talking with my mom on and off I decided to move back. The experiences I had in the 2-year period of cult school and factory work were somewhat cleansing. My moms husband likes to joke that I left a boy and came back a man. I ended up staying with a med student and working at a call center. At first it was nice till I found out that I can't take the stress of being told to kill myself over a 10$ fine and became a suicidal, shaking mess. After that job I ended up sticking with an electronics job for a bit. I ended up hallucinating around this time. I had major paranoia and couldn't and still can't look people in the eye. Turns out I had gained some intense fear of people in general. After switching my job from electronics to hospital janitor I ended up having a breakdown in the room I was cleaning. I couldn't breathe well, my mind was screaming like static (It'd been doing this for the past year.) I walked out on a job for the first time without a two-week notice. I was so devastated and more so scared that I ended up trying to drink myself to death. Around the beginning of last summer, I had made plans to jump from a large structure at the end of May and end it all. I ended up telling my best friend and he told me that if I needed to I could stay with him in the Bronx.

Bronx Poorboy conception:
Bronx was a weird period. Around this time my suicidal thoughts were daily. I had hallucinations and that uncontrollable screaming in my head had gotten worse. I tried to make the best of it and power through, but my crippling terror always found a way of creeping up on me. I tried to be an office assistant. a bachelor, an announcer, an artist, and then a man trying to starve himself to death. After two months money had gotten tight. 
We'd resorted to selling are possessions on craigslist to by groceries, because we couldn't afford to ship. We invented a new type of food on our shoe string budget. The way you make it is you take flour and mix it with water, then you heat it on anything metal and hot. If you have condiments then you put that on as well. It was called the poorboy. This period of time wasn't the first time I'd experienced hunger pains so personally I was used to it. We couldn't get EBT due to some bizarre screw up of which I don't remember. After a while of this I came upon some money and flew back to my home to where I'm currently on medication and seeing a therapist.

START HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THAT:
I might sound like a moron, but it's late and I don't care. I've never felt a real sense of fulfillment. I've been drifting through life like leaves in the wind. I'm terrified of people and sometimes I can't stop this shaking and this clenching pressure in my chest. I desperately want someone to say that this will get better, even though I know no one can know that for sure. I have no friends, because I can't talk to them anymore. I don't feel comfortable talking to my own family and sometimes I feel like screaming and crying. I'm going mad I'm going so damn mad and it won't stop for fucks sake it hasn't stopped. I just need help no matter who it may be. I want to talk to somebody who gets this. Somebody who's had it rough and has pushed through against the odds. Is there any hope for me? I don't want to be scared and suicidal anymore I don't want to have to crawl constantly. I just want to live. Everything to an extent seems like it leads into some sort of miserable spiral for me. Things are going well now and I'm still afraid something terrible will come again. I want to be a writer and even with that I fear failure. I'll never know if I don't give it my all and failures just a part of life, but I don't know how much more I can take. I must sound like an asshole right now. I haven't always been the best, but I want to try at a better life. Thank you for listening or even just glancing at this.

I am a final year student at a famous private university in India.

&amp;#x200B;

I have got two job offers:

Company X: through college campus recruitment drive.

Company Y: applied directly to the company.

The salary and job role offered at Y is much better than X. X is a MNC and Y is a famous startup.

I have already signed an agreement with company Y and have not signed any agreement with company X.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I informed company X that I won't be joining them. Company X contacted my college's placement cell( don't know what conversations they had).

The placement officer of the college called me and scolded my for applying to a company off-campus and said the following things:

1. He said that I have no right to choose which company to join.
2. Further, he told that, there is a rule which prohibits me from applying to any company off-campus(Don't know where any such rule is mentioned).  But, I know few alumni of the college who had got offers from the company they had applied directly, and they had even joined those company.
3. He told be that company X has threatened to ban the college from further placement drive(I highly doubt whether it is true).
4. He told me that I should either give in writing that I will join company X, else he shall cancel both my job offers and the college won't permit me to go for internship(It is mandatory for me to go for internship).

I am currently very depressed with the whole situation.

Now, few of the senior officials of the college are trying to help me by trying to solve this issue with the placement cell.

I hope that this matter gets resolved internally. But, I want to be prepare myself for the worst case. Therefore, I wanted to ask advice from r/india regarding my future course of actions.

Can the college contact company Y and cancel my job offer with them. And can the college restrict me from going to internship?

a4ah0i,147,2018-12-08,Stay strong everyone!,looking2helpUout,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/a4ah0i/stay_strong_everyone/,"Hi r/Cornell,

I'm an alumni and I can't believe this is the first time I stumbled across the subreddit for my beloved alma mater. Browsed through some posts. Chuckled at some, smiled at the others that brought back nostalgia. Then I saw a few that weren't quite too positive. Thought I'd just add some perspective and some encouraging words.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, you all are amazing people. Cornell chose you for a reason! I think most people go through some form of imposter syndrome and it's not uncommon to experience phases of depression, anxiety, self-doubt, you name it. It's okay to feel like this, and I wish people were more open to talking about it, but unfortunately there's a stigma with mental health. Maybe it's hard now, but one of the greatest things I learned was not to compare myself to others. I always had an insecurity people judged me based on my rank, achievements, etc. This couldn't be farther from the truth and now I live much more stress free. I know times must be stressful right now, especially with impending final exams. It's the last final stretch before a big long winter  break. You can do it. The greatest power you can have is believing in yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to open up about my Cornell experience: I graduated with a &lt;&lt;3.0 GPA, no internships, rejected to grad schools, been hospitalized 2x for suicidal ideation. I share all these details not to make a pity party about me, but to say it wasn't all roses and sunshine for me either during my time here. 

&amp;#x200B;

But guess what? I also ended up meeting some of the most amazing people along the way, forged lifetime friendships, had some of the funnest times of my life, and even lost my virginity along the way (okay, maybe this isn't something to be proud of, depends on you). I now am working my dream job, am healthier than ever and also having an affectionate wave of nostalgia about Cornell hit me as I write this up.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck ya'll and feel free to hit me up if you just feel the need to rant, ask for advice, or just need someone to talk to. &lt;3"

a4fcu4,1,2018-12-08,"I have been lying to my family about college, and now I need to do the right thing.",dragonnite4,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a4fcu4/i_have_been_lying_to_my_family_about_college_and/,"I'm sorry but this will be a wall of text cuz I aint the best at being concise.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started about three and a half years ago. I was starting college as a Freshman, and I was a straight A, hard working student in high school. But that first semester of college I didn't do so well. I started to let the idea of having more freedom in college get to me and became less responsible and less motivated. The beginning of that semester I did well but as the weeks progressed I started to procrastinate more, skip classes, and just not do work. At the end, I received 1 F, 3 C's, 1 B, 1 A, and 1 Pass(Was a class you either Pass or Fail no grade was given). This was heavily demotivating for me as this was the first time I had a report card with only one A and one B and the rest of the grades were bad, especially to a student who came from high school who always had received A's.

&amp;#x200B;

So this first semester is over, throughout the semester I had lied to my Dad about how my grades were, and when I told him the results, he was sad and angry. He wasn't angry because I got bad grades, mainly cuz I lied, he told me that most times kids don't do so swell in first semester, and both him and my older bro pushed me to come back strong the next semester and to not lie anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So second semester, same thing happened but worse. I literally just straight up went there, skipped classes, slacked off and failed all my classes all the while still lying to my fam about my grades and such. That semester I got all F's. Told my dad, he got even more angry, but I told him I just need one more try, so after that summer break I went back for a third semester, and to keep it short and simple, I did the same thing again.... but this time I lied to my fam about it. Told them I did good, got A's and B's which was a lie, I truly had failed all the courses again.

&amp;#x200B;

So its the end of three semesters, I've done so poorly in college that I was put on academic dismissal for one semester, and yet I had told ma fam am good and am going back to college next semester. I made up a fake schedule for school and just pretended to go to college for that spring semester. At the end I told ma fam again that I did good and got good grades. Even though the whole time I had just pretended to go to school.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to add here that for my first two semesters of college my tuition was mostly paid for by a scholarship from the school and a financial aid loan I got, and my Dad only had to pay a little bit for the two semesters, but that changed after the first year. That third semester I had to pay full tuition with no aid(which was understandable I did so badly the first two semesters), but I never told my dad this and he still thought I had the financial aid loan, just no more scholarship. He still paid up, I lied to him that half was paid for by the loan and the other half he would need to do it. That other half of tuition would end up being due and I never paid it and it got sent to a collection agency over the time I pretended to go to college in the spring of 2017. Over the summer I made up a story to my dad that I had forgotten to pay the tuition for spring 2017 and he would hand over the bucks to it thus paying up for fall 2016 semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we come to Fall semester of 2017, I was allowed back in school, and this time I did really well, got all A's, told my Dad about it, but not the truth, just said I got all A's and in courses I didn't even take that semester. I lied to everyone that I was now a junior in college and was pursuing higher level courses when in reality I was still a freshman taking all the required basic courses. Let me add here again, My dad paid the college tuition here, atleast half of it with the other half remaining, but when I would go on to do Spring Semester of 2018 I would lie and say I that needed that same amount for the 2018 spring semester but instead paid up for the previous semester.

&amp;#x200B;

So we are now on the Spring Semester of 2018, I got mostly great grades, 2 A's, 1 B, and I failed one course. All the while I still owed the school the full tuition for that semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

So with still having money due to the school, I still lied to my fam told them I got all A's, and was going onto my Senior year. Over the summer the money would go to a collection agency, my dad would get notice and I would tell him a story that involved me not doing some things on the school website that would intern activate the loan to be applied, and he bought it. So as august rolled around, I did it again, and started to Pretend to go to school for Fall 2018 semester since I couldn't officially go since I still owed the school money. Fast forward to December and I have told the collection agency I will pay them on the 15th.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout all of this I have always known that the right thing for me to have done from the get go was to tell the truth, and to then move on with life with the support of my family but I always chose to lie because I wanted them to see me as they have always wanted to. That has ended up being one of my biggest weaknesses. I know that they would have loved me even if I didn't succeed in the way they wanted me too. I regret never tell the truth since the start and I am now here.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell the whole fam about what it is I have done tomorrow, so that I can move and make my life better. So that I can get their help and pay off the debt I have to the college, and in turn I can start making good use of my life and go get a job, earn, and re pay all of them, for they have given me so many gifts over the last few years thinking I deserved them even though I never did. I want to repay my Dad of them the most, ive wasted his money the most and I am very ashamed of that

&amp;#x200B;

Everytime I want to tell the truth though, I back off, and am never able to do it. I need help in being motivated, I need help in facing my fears and just doing the deed even if it means I will lose everything, even if it means I will be kicked out of the fam to live on the road... I end up not doing the honest deed because of fear even though I am faithful my fam would never do that, I still fear it and that blocks me from doing the right thing. I need help in overcoming this fear. I know I need to suffer the consequences for my actions, I just can't come to terms with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this, I am sorry I couldn't do a TL:DR version of it but I can't its too hard to do without it not losing any crucial details."

a4gun4,221,2018-12-08,I work at a radio telescope. I'm sorry.,PNWood_writes,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a4gun4/i_work_at_a_radio_telescope_im_sorry/,"The blood splatter on the cafeteria wall giving Jackson Pollock a run for his money? The brain of a former Nobel Laureate. The other lifeless body of a man clutching a picture of his kids tight to his chest with a gun in his mouth? That's  Dr. Clyde, he taught me the virtues of wisdom. Two men, both brilliant and talented in their own rights, dead on the floor. Not your common murder-suicide pact participants, but the results are the same.

Forgive me if you detect a cold and callousness in me. They were my friends, hell, one of them was my mentor. But maybe we should not have pursued our discovery.

Running a radio telescope is well, it is as boring as it sounds. When you are isolated in a building built before the Second World War ended and surrounded by machines that would have difficulty upgrading to Windows XP your optimism about science runs dry pretty quickly. In truth, there was really only enough budget to pay two of us, which means that at the end of the day I was just a volunteer. Technically, I could list this as being an ""unpaid intern"" on my resume, but I'm pretty sure that in the science-phobic world we live in it would do me better to just not mention it.

Our's was not a budget funded by a university. We did not have the luxury of having a corporate backer. No, the telescope in all of its decades-old glory was run off of the kindness of donations from eccentric hobbyists. We were one of the last telescopes dedicated solely to projects like SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. Now you get why we were so poor. Only Spielberg can make E.T. Profitable.

Driving up to that mountain was a pain in the ass. We had to be far away enough from civilization so that we weren't bombarded with cellphone signals and Rush Limbaugh. It would take me a good hour to climb that elevation. I would relieve Dr. Clyde of his duty and then spend the rest of the night by myself. Quietly drinking and watching Doctor Who on Betamax. Did I mention that I started this ""job"" in 2016? America hates science.

No matter how cynical I became, no matter how bitter I was at our Sisyphean task, I was always hopeful that we would discover something. Anytime I would see a signal on the monitor that had any kind of spike I would call Dr. Clyde in the middle of the night. ""We got one!"" I would yell through the receiver with all of the excitement of a twelve-year-old fangirl. ""Come over quick!"" He was never mad when it turned out to be a solar flare or a pulsar. I won't bore you with the science, but space is noisy with radiation. Dr. Clyde was a patient man. Sad to see him go.

The hope was that our radio telescope would pick up a signal from life from afar. If you have ever seen “Contact” then you get the idea. But we weren’t actually expecting direct communication. It was nearly ninety-nine percent more likely that we would pick up the equivalent of alien TV or radio from a race that had been dead for eons. We would have proof that we weren’t alone, but we would have no way of ever answering their call.

The stars are clear up that mountain. The crisp air and desolate darkness really drives home the emptiness of it all. One night, I parked my car and stepped out into the cold to admire the night sky before starting my shift. Snow had already covered the area. Dark and dry pines were masked with the white chill of snow, making the whole mountain look like it had lost all color. The vast stretch of stars above felt oppressive. That night was the first night I actually felt like something was staring back.

Dr. Clyde was excited when I came in. “I think we might possibly have something,” he said. In the world of science being less vague was obscene. No one speaks definitively without absolute proof. “I’ll take it tonight,” he continued with tired eyes and a genuine smile. “Go home to your family.”

“What is it? You can’t just send me home if we have proof—”

“Please,” he begged. Only one of us was a Nobel winner, and Dr. Clyde was not him. “Let me just be sure.”

It seemed selfish, but if I’m being honest I didn’t think he had found anything. I had given up on the whole deal by then. Going home meant that I could watch new Doctor Who. I let it slide.

As much as I respected Dr. Clyde, he knew next to nothing about me, or he didn't bother remembering anything. I had no family to go home to. Instead, I drank too much wine, yelled at misogynistic fanboys here on Reddit who don't like the new Who and passed out. Science is lonely.

The first of fourteen missed messages I missed while I was passed out was time-stamped at 1:15 in the morning. ""This is it! This is what we have been waiting for!"" Dr. Clyde's voice was as giddy as a man about to be wed. ""Get back up here as soon as you hear this!"" It was damn near noon. I called him back but got no answer. I did what I was told, and started the drive up the mountain.

I listened to the next message on my phone as I drove. “Where are you? Pick up! I need your laptop, these old machines aren’t powerful enough.” Next Message. “Please! Pick up! We can share the discovery, just don’t make me call Dr. Larson, he’ll never let me hear the end of him having two Nobel prizes.” Next message. “I’m calling Dr. Larson, this is just too important, but please get here first if you can!”

By the time I was at the base of the mountain, the messages had taken a turn. The excitement in Dr. Clyde’s voice was gone. “I’m sorry. Oh god. Oh, I’m so sorry. The message it—” I could hear the angry cursing of Dr. Larson in the background, heard something heavy being thrown against something hard. “The message was compressed. Impossibly compressed. The old machines could not handle it, but with Larson's new laptop we… We made a mistake. We didn't have enough processing power, even on his laptop—"" The faint sounds of Dr. Larson openly weeping in the background, muffled as they were, pierced my heart. ""So, so we let our crowdsourcing network handle it, let the internet do its thing."" I heard another object being thrown. ""I'm sorry.""

The message ended. I went over the speed limit.

Next message.

“The problem is sight,” Dr. Larson’s voice was shrill. The call was made only a minute after the last one, it was still Dr. Clyde’s number. “It cannot hurt what it cannot see? You understand? Infertile abyss laughs at the barren moon,” he was still sobbing. “Madness is perception, yes? It needed to see us to hurt us, to show us the smile on the edge of forever. It has seen. It sees. It— it smiles.”

I was only a mile away from the radio telescope. Next message. This one was only sobbing with a high pitched and piercing noise in the background. I listened to the next message as I parked. It was still Dr. Larson. ""It has waited, waited longer than forever started. It can wait longer, but not much longer. It needs to incubate. To spread. It needs to widen its smile."" I heard the blast of gunfire through the phone only a moment before I saw its aftermath painted on the walls. Two of the most brilliant minds I have ever had the privilege to meet were now crimson Rorschach wallpaper.

Dr. Larson’s laptop was busted, presumably thrown at the wall. So too were all of our ancient computers and equipment. Scratched into the vinyl tiles of the floor from Larson’s bloody fingernails was a star. The kind you draw without lifting your pencil in grade school. He was smiling, lifeless, ear to ear.

I have no idea what they found. Hell, I’m not even sure if they knew, and if they did it drove them to madness. We knocked on the door of the cosmos and something knocked back.

God help us if it learned to open [**the door**](https://www.facebook.com/The-Works-of-P-N-Wood-2207178692829092/).

a4h5yk,2,2018-12-08,What are the chances NASA rescinds a Pathways offer due to a possible misdemeanor?,idiotboy5957,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a4h5yk/what_are_the_chances_nasa_rescinds_a_pathways/," 

Throwaway account, but after four years of interning at NASA through the standard OSSI internships, I was finally offered a Pathways position. Literally a dream come true. The trouble comes a few days afterwards...

I had a little bit of time before finals started and I had just recently gotten the news that I got the job, so I decided to have 2 days of celebration before starting the study grind. The second day, however, I got *way* too drunk. I live on/near a very large college campus, so it's nothing too out of the ordinary. However the walk home I ended up alone and I only remember bits and pieces. The problem is that I'm fairly certain I just out of the blue, for no reason at all, kicked a random parked car's body kinda near the tire. I was approached by a cop who could obviously tell I was super intoxicated, and he asked if it was my car. I told him no, obviously. The conversation was relatively pleasant, as he continued to talk to me for a bit and asked where I lived and what I was studying and if I was going to be able to make it home alright. What I *don't* remember is whether or not he let me off with a warning or if he told me that he was going to mail me a citation for disorderly conduct. I think he checked my driver's license, but my fingers are crossed that he mostly did this to ensure I was 21. This all happened at approximately 2AM on December 7th, so at the time of writing this it's been about 37 hours since the incident.

I'm horrified that I just completely blew my chances at this Pathways job if I find out that they mailed me a citation for a minor misdemeanor. I have accepted the job through discussions with HR, my future mentor, and the branch chief, however I have not yet received the official paperwork for it (not sure if this matters). If this goes down and I end up with a misdemeanor from one god damn stupid night, I'll end up hating myself. I have no criminal record or tickets other than a fender bender or two when I was 16. I also called both the University Police and the City Police this morning (approximately 31 hours after the event) to ask about reports filed, and both of them said that no reports were filed about the event. I don't know if this means the cop decided to give me a break or if it's just taking a while for him to report it. I plan on calling the court that would mail out the citations on Monday.

TLDR:

Accepted a Pathways position, have no criminal record, get too drunk in celebration, unsure if let off with a warning or if a minor misdemeanor charge for disorderly conduct is going to be mailed to me.

What are the chances this completely screws me over?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying so hard to convince myself that because I've interned there for 4 consecutive summers and that I've never had anything like this happen before that they'll let it slide, but I know that government work (especially when we're talking about the aerospace industry) can sometimes be unforgiving. Please be honest."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a senior about to enter the last semester for an engineering degree. I was in the middle of grad school applications for next year, but a few days ago I got an incredible internship opportunity for the spring semester. I've already accepted it, pushing my anticipated graduation date to December 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I find the idea of having another year until application season appealing. A chance to study for another GRE, more time to get research experience, maybe get a publication, etc. However I'm curious what options I have to fill the awkward 8 month gap between graduation and fall enrollment in graduate school. Almost all internships I've seen require enrollment in a university. That might make me eligible for a summer internship, but probably not for the spring. I could pursue a full time job and not tell them I'm not applying to grad school, but it would feel skeevy to just leave six months later. Especially if they realize I knew I'd be leaving the whole time! Plus my industry of interest is relatively small, so that might burn a bridge I can't afford to.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this situation? If so, what do you recommend to peruse to fill the gap? Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I realize some programs offer admission in the spring, but I feel like most funding and fellowship opportunities are geared towards fall admission.

a4k62d,19,2018-12-09,Join industry or pursue PhD after completing Masters in RF and Analog/Mixed Signal,ozil_eyes,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/a4k62d/join_industry_or_pursue_phd_after_completing/,"I am an international student pursuing MS in a university in US. I will graduate in May next year. I have completed one internship in summer and I will be doing another internship this spring in one of the big semiconductor companies.

I honestly loved everything I learned in school and the internship was a great experience for me. But what I understand from applying for jobs is that analog/mixed signals design is a very tough field to join. All the job descriptions mention a minimum of 3 years of experience in a specialized circuit or a PhD. I have submitted a lot of job applications, but haven't heard anything from them. I recently had a chat with my professor, and he said that the kind of work given to Masters students is not great. Companies hire Masters student only if they cannot find a PhD, and then will only give them a non consequential block to work on or test someone else's circuits. I understand that making chips is very expensive and they will not give it to a new person, but my concern is that I will never be given an opportunity to design my own circuit. 

My next concern is related to a PhD. From the outside, it seems a great idea. I will be working on most important problems in my field, taking sole responsibility of some very high speed circuits. I will learn a lot and will be working in a very fast paced environment. I also did some research under the same professor and I had a mixed experience. Sometimes it was good (whenever I found a solution to the problem), but most of the time I was lost and had no one to answer my questions. Also from my interaction with other PhDs, I have come to understand that it is very hard and stressful. The 6 year duration of completing PhD is also a concern. The only reason that I am considering PhD is that my professor was happy with my research work and said that I would be good PhD student.

What I would like to know is how much different is the work for a PhD and a MS graduate. Is a PhD necessary to do good analog design or will a Masters graduate (with some years of experience) work on the same design? I would love to hear from people who have faced this situation can share their experience."

I am a student studying for a bachelor in Computer Science and have no prior experience in working as anything except working in a kitchen under stress.

I'm in my first year and we've barely brushed the surface of C++ and running compilers.

I've had an interest of my own and that is to fiddle with Windows and Debian-based Linux distros. Problem is that I don't think I'm qualified enough to start a junior position just yet. 

I barely know how to make powershell scripts and I've never tried making bash scripts (even though a quick tutorial shows they're mainly shell commands in a file just like in powershell).
I usually fiddle with VScode on Linux since MinGW doesn't like me on Windows.
I have a basic understanding of web servers, networking (fixing my router or using Google DNS on android), also flashing custom ROMs on Android and debugging any issues that may arise from my own fault. I also tend to switch back and forth between Mint and Windows 10 because I get tired from using one OS (I need a bigger SSD to dual boot), Oracle VM is kinda slow and annoys me. And I have knowledge in electronics and how they work (dad has worked as an electrician).

All of this is just some stuff I've done on my free time before I enrolled in University but I need advice because I don't think this is enough to start as a Junior Sys Admin. I generally want to improve and think that a job would definitely push me harder forcing me to advance faster. But most positions I found require some knowledge on MySQL, Oracle HTTP servers, Docker, Windows Server and etc.

My question in general is whether I should try for positions as of now or continue working on powershell, bash and maybe MySQL?

Edit:

To all who gave advice, thank you! I have applied to a few technical support jobs willing to teach noobs like me and also found an internship for server administration. 
I'll slowly but surely catch up to you guys so you best look forward to me returning more knowledgeable in a year."

I'm currently finishing up my degree, a B.S. in Applied Math with a minor in Electrical Engineering from the University of Nevada. As I approach graduation (in May) I find myself wanting to go on a real adventure and try and live abroad again for a while. I would LOVE to just leave and slum it and do whatever Workaways/odd jobs I can find buttttt I figure I should put some work in on building up my skillset while my degree is still fresh.

As for my experience and what I'm looking to do, I'll be coming out of school with a very high GPA (3.85 if I keep it up) and year's experience as a research assistant in an Electrical Engineering lab (should have one or maybe two papers with my name on them) as well as a semester's experience as a data analyst intern with a lawyer-client matching service (next semester). It's just an internship but it seems to me that I'll be really their only analyst and will have a lot of responsibilities/projects to build experience on. It's just for the semester though, so I'm really angling to get a job as a data analyst wherever I can for this summer so I can keep building that skillset. However, I would strongly consider anything that would take a recent math graduate as long as it would keep me moving in some direction career-wise.

As for where I'm looking to go: I'm a basic bitch and my top pick is Prague (or elsewhere in CZ). I lived there for 4 months already back in 2017 for a semester abroad so I know that I love the city and absolutely thrive there. I could move there today in the dead of the gross almost-winter and just be overjoyed. I've already applied to a position there seeking recent grads for a Data Analyst trainee position and been rejected, I assume because I'm from the US and would need a work permit (as the rejection came quite quickly, though I'm sure it's possible they just hated my resume haha). My one trouble with Prague (and likely anywhere) is finding somewhere that is willing to sponsor me to get my work permit. I worry that I'm just not a desirable enough candidate yet with my still-limited experience for that. If anyone has any tips in general on getting entry-level professional positions in places where you need a visa I'd really appreciate it.

Which is why I'm really open to anywhere. I'd really love to be somewhere in Europe since I think it would be an easier transition for me than elsewhere. Some of my favorite places include Germany, Bosnia, Albania, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Hungary if that's any help. I know some of these places are probably even harder to immigrate to than CZ but I'd love to live in any of them if there were a chance. Otherwise, if anyone knows of just like a perfect opportunity or something elsewhere in the world let me hear it! I'm completely open to new experiences so I'd love to see what options I have to consider.

Thanks for any advice."

The section I feel most uneasy about right now is my work experience section; when I applied for positions in the past, I would have a general resume (like this one) which I would then modify to best represent the skills I have that match the position requirements. Entering a completely new field almost feels worse than applying for positions with no experience, as I'm concerned about leaving the reader with the impression that I've tried to shoehorn as much of my previous experience into the resume as possible.

a4nu89,0,2018-12-09,My nearly 4 years of undergrad life in a nutshell !,vrajjshah,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/a4nu89/my_nearly_4_years_of_undergrad_life_in_a_nutshell/,"Bit of my background so you can give better advice 

I am in my final year (just completed 7th semester) of my undergrad ( computer Engineering) . 

I want to make a career in machine learning (AI). I know about Andrew NG's courses and fast.ai ( Jeremy Howard, and other books/resources. I am also interested in data science ( as I think I have good analytical ability and I like mathematics), also enrolled in Datacamp for the same. 

I did not know about programming in school(as it was not offered/taught + no one in my acquaintance [friends , relativies , family] knowing about it) , not until my 2nd year of college, although I had access to computers and Internet from around grade 5th. During my 8th grade I knew about torrents, and in 11th grade I knew about rooting, custom ROMs, and similar stuff). I used google whenever the need came but never thought of creating the softwares/websites I was using. But I always loved computers and Technology so I thought of doing something related to it after my schooling.

Because of not working hard in class 12th ( and also due to reservation in India + discrimination to my Board of education during admissions + my family can't afford costly private colleges or donations), so I did not go to a good college/university.

Now coming to my college life. I joined IEEE during my first year. Went to many events organised by IEEE in my country ( hackathons , national level conferences, summer schools, etc. ). I became Microsoft Student partner in my 5th semester and am till now. Started competitive programming in 6th semester ( mainly on Codechef).  Went to many college's Techfest and won in several events( I know it is nothing an achievement). Won a prize in hackathon , got selected as fast.ai international fellow, cleared Codechef Certified data structure and algorithms programme ( foundation level), current 3 star rating at Codechef. I was member of Google developer group ( Ahmedabad and Baroda).

As I did not know about programming in school I went to organise an Hour of Code session at my school,  encouraging my juniors to start working on competitive programming and mainly focus on concepts of core tech( any 1 programming language + operating system + computer networks + data structures and algorithms). I even conducted and co-ordinated several workshops and seminars for Students at my college and also at other, University.

I have experienced a lot more in my college life relationship, networking , dealing with people, increases my EQ, watched lots of movies and TV shows !

Now the confusions I have

A.

I got placed in a company called Zeus Learning ( Software Engineer role), that mainly focus on web frameworks and related stuff.
I can go there for internships or

1. I can practice and get AWS/Google cloud certifications
2. Practice Competitive Programming
3. Datacamp courses
4. Fast.ai and similar courses
5. Complete some specialization on edX / Coursea.

6. Do bit of everything ( what I always choose)

I know choosing one thing is very important but I can't finalize. I can do this all with the internship or without it.

I want to intern in a good company) startup(ML or Data science role) , but I can't get with my current profile.

 That's confusion no. A, what should I do?

B.

I want to go abroad ( Honestly settle there) for master's. I dream to work in Silicon Valley.  I am planning Canada for easy way of permanent residence. ( And if I have talent then I could get a job there afterwards)

I have heard it is GPA centric. I have 7.85 CPI and 7.61 CGPA ( till semester 6) . Also I do not have any great personal projects(till now to showcase on GitHub) nor any research work. My final year project is on machine learning ( QA system) . Can I get into a decent University with a great SOP or shall I wait to get into a good University. I can get into most colleges in Canada for a post graduate diploma!

What should I do here too!

University plays very important role , actually students play but great students generally go to top Universities. But I suppose I could now thrive there with the wisdom and experience I gained in my undergrad. And then I may do a second master's, a PhD or , executive MBA from a top university .
 

This is a bit of my story feel free to ask anything if you can't connect some dota. And I count on redditers to guide me

I am definitely planning to write a medium post to share my experience and advice for the sophomore undergrads.

If yes, why so?",jaffaKnx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a4obld/are_software_validation_engineers_valued_less/,"Software validation engineers, how do you like your job? Do you write a lot of code? Is it true that software test engineers aren't valued as much as software engineers or developers though they are considered an important part of the team? Someone told me that test engineers don't write a bunch of logic code and what not but don't test engineers develop test cases for instance which do include logic and maybe some algorithms (though I haven't used any in a span of about 2 months)?

I have always wanted to do development, but got offered a software test validation position. This was the only offer I got since I graduated and I didn't have enough luxury to rescind the offer. It's not that I didn't want to do testing, it's just I would have preferred a dev job instead but having graduated with no internship experience, I guess I wasn't left with any other option.

This being my first full-time engineering job, I have learned a lot in the past couple of months, in terms of the software development cycle and how to work in a team. So far I haven't quite written anything from scratch - it's been mainly maintaining the already existing tests and making some modifications based on the new requirements or so, though I'd like to take on more responsibilities but I guess it's a bit too early.

It's just sometimes I think how will this job change my career prospects in the future; not having any significant background in testing, what's the scope of it? Do a lot of test engineers end up switching to development eventually? Would I be able to switch to development in near future? How hard would be the switch?"

I recently graduated in May with a BS in computer engineering with a 2.9 gpa. I have yet to find a job in digital design, firmware, or embedded software engineering.

I would like to know what I should do in order to find a job. I have applied for hundreds of jobs at this point. I can’t apply to grad school directly because my gpa is too low to get accepted. I would need to take grad school courses to prove I can handle graduate work. I use Indeed, glassdoor, linkedin, and angel as job boards to search for jobs. 

Also, I never had a internship/co-op in digital design, firmware, or embedded software engineering. I had an extremely difficult time finding internships in those fields and understand that is the key to getting employment after graduation with your internship company. I learned that fact very late as a student and I can’t go back in time now. What can I do to gain employment in the fields I stated above? Thanks for your advice.

Are there any differences in the admission terms? My dream schools (for research-based master degree) offer Spring, Fall, Summer admission. 

I am wondering is it easier to get admitted for Fall than Summer? Since most of the applications are submitted for Fall entry, so I guess there might be more funding opportunities or available positions for Fall applicants? The reason why I am considering Summer entry is that I will graduate in Spring, so there will be 4 months interval if I apply for Fall entry and I prefer to go to grad school than travelling or intern. 

Please do correct me if am wrong. I do think it might depend on each university. I would love to hear any insights. 

Thanks! "
a4pizp,4,2018-12-09,Career Switching Question - Best way to gain experience?,LogicalArachnid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a4pizp/career_switching_question_best_way_to_gain/,"Hello Everyone,

I have a couple of questions for anyone on this sub who might have some relevant experience.

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and have been out of school for a few years. Besides a half year internship post graduation, for the past 2+ years I have been working at a very small engineering company. When I was first hired I imagined I would be doing mechanical engineering type work, however it turns out I have been working primarily with software. I have been working under a self taught developer, learning to use sql, javascript, and working with html to build our custom user interfaces and add some new features for a browser-based application. So now I want to advance my career into software development, and acquire more modern and relevant software engineering skills so I can eventually get a better job. Front end development is not really my main interest, even though I have some basic experience here from my current job.

So I have been considering applying to masters programs and bootcamp programs. I consider myself having pretty limited experience writing software, despite currently making a living from it. I did take a CS intro to java course while at university, as well as plenty of math courses for my engineering degree.

After doing some research, two programs that stood out to me were Northeastern University's CS Align program, and the App Academy bootcamp. Does anyone here have opinions about either of these programs or good program recommendations in general? The Align program seems pretty expensive and is a long time commitment, so I was sort of leaning towards a bootcamp. The App Academy bootcamp has some intro material that they sell you to get you up to speed before applying to the bootcamp. For someone with an engineering degree, would a bootcamp in general be a good investment? Or is the longer commitment of a masters program going to be more worth it in the long run?

Thanks, I appreciate any input and advice."

I’m almost 30 and stuck in a dead end job. What I do each day makes me unhappy, and I l just learned last week I’m going to be a dad, so I’d really like to find something that pays more. I’ve applied to a few places over the last year or so and haven’t heard back from any of them. After a bunch of reflection, I have 2 questions  (and 2 extra questions) for this sub that I think will help me further my career.

1. I’m stuck in a support job right now, and would love to move into a non-customer role. Based on my education / experience (which I’ll detail below) do you think I have a shot at a non-support role, OR should I try to get a support role at a different company (that needs more specialized positions) to get my foot in the door, and then move into a different role that way. (Part of me feels that the fact that I’m asking this is proof that I’m don’t have a shot)
2. Are their any certs or training I should be working on to make myself more hirable? 
3. Optional: Any resume for someone with my job, which is not project based and has no usable metrics that I can think of (e.g. I have no idea if I close more tickets than my peers, or resolve issues faster as none of that is tracked).
4. Optional: For those of you who started in support and moved to something else, how did you end up there? Did you always know you wanted to be a [job_title] or was it random?

**Current Job:** I’ve been at my current position for 5 years, which I feel is about 2 years too long. However, when I started I was still completing my college degree so at the time I was very thankful for the position. My job is provide support over the phone / through email for my company’s sales / gaming software. I help with any and all problems, and if I run into something I can’t solve, I then work with our developers directly to help them identify the issue. These are stand alone windows based systems that consist of a server and a couple workstations, along with many (sometimes 500+) player devices which operate on wifi. On one call I might help a 85 year old turn find and turn on their monitor. On the next, I might help someone reimage a server using a recovery disc, reinstall our software, and help them use the command line to reattach their SQL databases. Finally I might assist a network administrator in troubleshooting why our wireless traffic isn’t moving through their network and reaching our servers. At any given time I’m expected to be able to support over 100 different versions of our software that we have in the field. I have to be able to support anything from Server 2003 to 2016, and windows XP to 10. I feel like the job is fairly demanding, and much more than what I’ve heard most help desk / technical support positions do. However I don’t feel like it’s really good experience for another job as it’s so specialized to my company's software. For example, I use AD every day but only to change passwords or copy users. I can walk someone through dropping and reattaching SQL databases in CLI, but haven’t formed a join query on my own or modified anything in a table on my own for years. As a result I’m unsure that to list on my resume.  

The company I work for is quite small, only 30 or so employees in my office, and less than 100 total. I feel my job is a dead end as there are no other positions available. My department is less than 10 people, all with the same job title. Any other technical positions are all development or QA focused and located in a different country. I’ve taken on lots of little side projects, but nothing official which again gives me trouble on my resume. We use a wiki for our internal documentation and I’ve done around 90% of the edits. I also manage our ESXi sandboxes, and wrote out documentation on deploying our VMs for testing.

**Education:** I have a bachelor's degree in computer and network security, with a minor in systems administration which I finished about two and a half years ago. I felt that it was quite comprehensive but I’ve never had a chance to put most of it to use. Unfortunately I feel like there are a couple of disadvantages to my degree. One is that the school I got it from is a small school that focuses on technology degrees. Part of that focus on technology was to allow people to take courses online. I ended up switching to an online student early on and moving to another state. While the school is very respected in my home state, it’s unheard of here. When you put together the unknown school with a specialized degree I feel like often it is looked  over as a paid-for degree. In addition, as I was online I made no connections. Finally, as I was working while getting my degree I was not able to do any internships.  

**Certs:** My school stated many times that they felt like certs were not worth it for students, as they felt any company that required them would help you get them as part of on the job training. As a result I don’t have any certs, despite covering the contents of A+, Network+, Security+, and CCNA through my coursework. I’ve asked about getting some certs through work, but they refused as they said we don’t require them.

**Dream Job:** Honestly I don’t know. To be brutally honest, at this point in my life I’m looking for whatever will pay the most in the long run, and give me the most flexible schedule. I make 50k right now, which I think is actually pretty high for help desk / technical support in my area. (This is another reason I was looking for something other than support, I can’t afford a pay cut and ideally would like to get a raise). My current job offers 24/365 support, so I have to do a lot of on-call. I wouldn’t mind that except for the fact that our office is open normal business hours, but our customers are most active on nights, weekends and holidays, so getting calls on call isn’t an exception, it’s a rule. I’d love to find something in a market that operates in normal business hours, or a position that lets me leave my work at work though I know that is rare in IT. Alternatively, working from home would be great as well.

To talk about what I actually enjoy, the most satisfying thing for me is finding a preventing problems before they occur. I love spotting something wrong, and correcting it before it causes an issue. Even better would be improving things so they run smoother, even if the end user doesn’t notice it. I also enjoy being an “expert” in something. I know that in IT or even a specialization no one person will ever know anything, but I do enjoy knowing something well enough that I know how it all works, instead of just the parts I’m familiar with. However that’s all I really have experience with.

If you made it through all this, thank you. I know some of this is just a rant, but I think it's all important to my questions. 

EDIT: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone that has answered so far. After reading through these posts I'm feeling confident about getting out of the role I'm in now and applying for the jobs that sound more interesting to me. I also think this was just the boost I needed to get out and really start applying as well. 

I did actually think of one more question. I'm planning on posting my resume in the resume help thread, but this seems like a good place to put this text question. Before my current job, I've held a couple other support positions. They are a bit broken up, but I attended two different university's while pursuing my degree, and worked at the help desk at each. However my question is actually even further back. My high school was partnered with Cisco, and offered CCNA as a two year course. It was two periods a day, one was class, and for the other period we functioned as the schools help desk. They had no other technical staff other than our instructor / supervisor. Certain students were also asked to be employed by the school district and provide IT support for the whole district over the summer, which I participated in my junior year. Would any of that be worth putting on a resume, seeing as it's over a decade old at this point? "

I work for a company that started out as an internship but has now turned into a job waiting for me after I graduate. I live by myself with 2 bunnies who I love like they were my own children. I feel very successful and sure of myself except for one portion of my life, my dating life. 

I was in a 3 year relationship with a guy who begrudgingly decided to go to college. He got his associates degree and was out in the working world while I was still at college. The apartment I live in now was our apartment together. While he was working 9-5, Monday through Friday I was busy studying and trying to land the job I have now. What ended our relationship was that he said I didn’t have enough time for him and it was killing our relationship. So, I let him go. 

Not long after this break up I found a guy who I just adored so much and he told me he liked me just as much. We dated for two months before he came to me with the same problems my previous ex did. He said he wanted someone who was wife material. Someone he could have kids with. I told him I did want to get married and have kids in the future though. That’s when he proceeded to rip my self esteem down. 

He told me that I was too focused on my career. No man wants to date a woman like that let alone marry them. Of course just like with the first I guy I just let him go. What could I say in that moment to keep him? More than that I didn’t want to keep him. Someone will want to marry me one day. Right? 

I’ve asked my friends for advice. All my girl friends have said that guys are intimidated by me and it’s nothing to worry about because some guy out there isn’t going to give a crap about being too driven. However, when I asked my guy friends they gave me an answer that frightened the hell out of me. 

My guy friends have told me that no guy wants to date a girl like me. They don’t want to date a girl with a higher salary than them. They don’t want a girl who is so confident and dependent that they don’t need need a man to support them. 

That’s what’s brought me here to reddit. I’m worried about never finding the right guy for me. Has any other girl been in the same position as me? How did you navigate the dating world and find the right person for you? Are my worries even something to be worried about? "

a4qsys,2,2018-12-09,It's time to scream into the abyss again.,GhostAndReaper,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a4qsys/its_time_to_scream_into_the_abyss_again/,"Hi guys, it's me. You wouldn't now me because I use throwaways that I promptly forget the access data to, but I've already posted here a couple of times. I'm back. What does that say? That nothing changes and first of all, that nothing ever fucking helps. 

I have depression, the clinical kind, the kind where you were prescribed no less than eight different antidepressants and not a single one worked. Where you went to psychiatry, to multiple different therapists, to self-help groups and whatnot, and nothing did anything. If anything, my life got worse whenever someone tried to do something about it, be it myself or others. Going to psychiatry for half a year ripped my from the little social contacts I had, leaving me with no friends. The meds I were prescribed, the nonexistent exercise in psychiatry and the mental stress and the resulting overeating led me from 'slightly chubby' to 'at a serious risk for an obesity-induced heart attack at the ripe old age of 24'. When I moved out right after high school because I thought getting away from my dysfunctional family would help me, I only moved myself into several years of financial struggle and a relationship that has grown colder that I ever imagined. 

What do you even do if trying to change things always comes back to bite you in the ass? Well, I can only speak for myself, but right now, I am back to 'lying in bed in increasing discomfort and waiting for the day to pass' - a classic, isn't it. I am still attending university, I am way behind where I should be with my degree and I have lost all interest and joy I ever had in my subjects. I recently lost my part-time job, they told me they couln't keep all their employees for the new year, which is interesting since now, two weeks later, they have already put up ads searching for new people. Fuck you too, I guess. 

I keep noticing myself drifting away from reality. Besides the depression, I also have a condition by the name of Maladaptive Daydreaming, MD for short. It is not yet recognized as a standalone diagnosis as far as I am aware, but if it is one, then I have it, that's for sure. I always know that my depression is getting out of hand when my daydreaming issues increase in frequency, and currently it is frequent as it was only at one point in my life, the weeks leading up to my suicide attempt. I know where this road is headed. But what can I do? My family does not understand, they never did and they never even tried. My boyfriend is numb and disinterested concerning my mental health, which is unsurprising given that he's been putting up with this for 6 years now. I do not have friends, and even if I were to try to talk to a so-called professional, they would institutionalize me once I mention me being suicidal. I do not want that, and I can not afford to lose a semester at uni or half a year of work. Especially since I do not see the point. 

No one takes mental health patients seriously, especially not the people working in that area. When I was in psychiatry, I was handed crayons to 'express my feelings'. But no sharpeners, I could try to cut my wrists with it! I was a legal adult at that time, mind you. And they keep a straight face while they literally treat you like a fucking child.

They don't care about you. They pretend to care the very moment you have finally done it, the moment you have finally freed yourself from all this bullshit they'll come crawling out of their holes, shedding fake tears and uttering shit like ""If only they'd talked to someone"", ""It's okay to need help sometimes"" or posting suicide hotline numbers all over their dumb facebook pages. But if you TRY to talk? No one listens because no one cares. Maybe they'll even drop a classic like ""Well, if you were serious about suicide you'd just do it."" YEAH BITCH I MIGHT JUST DO THAT because all your phrases and all your so-called grief is empty narcisstic bullshit. There is no help. They do not care about you as long they cannot use your death to show of how much of a good and caring person they are. ""Oh, look, here's this number where an underpaid intern will try to talk to you about Jesus, that will help for sure, look how fucking great I am."" They do not care about you. 

I am sick and tired of all this bullshit. I just want to go. Why do they care about me dying when no one cares about me living, either? 

The vent for today. See you next time. Or not. Who knows. "
a4rbnw,5,2018-12-09,Software Engineering Internship or Beloved Summer Job,Peraclese,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a4rbnw/software_engineering_internship_or_beloved_summer/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions. I would love some advice from people that know more than me. I'm currently a Sophomore studying CS and am trying to figure out what my summer plans look like. The way I see it I basically have two options. One, I apply for and hopefully get a software engineering or similar internship and gain some industry experience. Two, I don't get an internship and instead return to my beloved summer job as a camp counselor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm totally torn on deciding what to do here. One one hand any internship I get would give me great experience and could potentially set me up for another job/internship opportunity down the road. Additionally, it would be so interesting to see CS in a professional/industry setting and I have no doubt it would make quite excited. On the other hand I could return to a job that I adore and spend another wonderful summer doing summer camp things which would make me ridiculously happy. I'm absolutely stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really excited about a job in CS but if I for sure only have one more summer where working as a counselor is viable, what should I do? I'm all mixed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a couple of questions for all you knowledgeable people and would love your advice/expertise. 

* How important is it to get an internship during your Sophomore summer?
* Would I be putting a dent in my future career potential by not pursuing an internship this summer? 
* Has anyone had any similar personal experiences?
* Any advice in general?

Anyway I'd love to hear what you have to say, and am open to any and all advice you can give me. Thanks in advance."

I worked for a start up for a few months learned a lot. Got an internship at a huge mega Corp company and learned and made even more money there. 

And just finishing up a different internship at what is my dream company. I’ve been wanting to work here since I was young.

I was brought up valuing the little things in life. So a giant salary never defined happiness for me. I’ve made a ton of money working, and that’s awesome. But I can’t help but feel like I peaked even before starting my career..

I guess maybe I don’t understand my own definition of “peaking”. But I feel like career wise, I experienced so much before even graduating, there’s nothing to look forward to, after I get my degree. Obviously I still have a lot to learn in almost all aspects of SWE I’m still a novice. But that’s just honing skills, not experiencing something new entirely. 

After that, I already worked at my dream company, sure I was a just an intern. Maybe striving for management or director roles.

I remember while studying in my freshman-junior years of college I put the idea of being a software engineer on a golden pedestal and I couldn’t wait to get a job and start working... now I have nothing to look forward too. 

Maybe I’m lacking something outside of work. But just curious if anyone is in a similar situation.

I reenlisted in the USAF for another four years, mostly because I didn't have a plan to get out. But I'm willing and ready to leave my military career behind and move to the Pacific Northwest, and live my life out with my SO and family as civilians. My military job requires a clearance (TS) but my AFSC is not in IT. I'm interested in jumping in, I've headed to EdX and am working through some cybersecurity classes seeking professional certificates. Soon I'll be getting into coding and hoping to get into earning professional certifications (Security+, etc.). I'm considering Palace Fronting into the ANG to get into a cyber job for experience, but my brother has convinced me to rethink my choice (mostly, telling me not to be afraid to pay for health insurance, and that certs are more important than dedicating another enlistment when I'd rather get out, even if it's part time, and that I can easily make a living without the military coddling me). I would rather not be a contractor but I suppose if it brings home the bacon and gets me experience, I will. I just want to be able to support my family while my SO goes to school. He gets out six months before I do.

I don't have a degree, but I have time to work towards it. Is that something I should do, or should I stick with building up certs? I haven't decided precisely what I want to do, since I'm only now dipping my toes into the water. I can/will do it all to have a life once I leave the military life. I've struggled to figure out what I want to do with my life after the Air Force, but as a linguist, I'm a career student, so I know I have the capability to learn. I just have to figure my shit out and make a plan. I also have the capital to go to school while I'm in as well as gather up certs until I get out. 

I do have the CompTIA IT cert flowchart, I've read through some other posts with some advice, but a lot of them ask how to get a clearance, etc. I just want to put my energy where it matters most since I'm unable to take on internships for the time being. 

TL;DR: Military service (10 years by the time I get out), TS clearance (though I would prefer private sector vice government/contracting), willing to get certs and/or a degree. What will make me the most marketable when I get out? Should I stick with the CompTIA flowchart and just build up those certifications? Should I also be getting a degree? What online degree programs are the most robust (though I am already working through EdX for certifications and will be heading to the base Education Center to test for other IT certs such as Security+)?

TYIA for all of the help. I'm sure you can tell, but I'm a planner. I just need to make one so I can feel comfortable moving on with my life. Working toward something while I'm serving is the best option, I think any vet would agree. Thanks again!"

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing this post today in hopes to get some direction as to how I should proceed with my career.  I am a fifth year senior graduating in April 2019 with a dual major in Bioengineering and Computer Engineering.  I guess my main question is: 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** **is there really any utility to my dual major or am I just an inexperienced COE/CS student.**

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I started in COE because I took some programming in high school and it came very natural to me and I had always been the engineering/ analytical type so I decided on COE.  Then after my first real year in COE (freshman year is just Gen sciences like physics and math) I got a summer coop at a company that does mechanical modeling software.  To be blunt: I pretty much hated it.  I hated the work environment (stiff, old), hated the 9-5 in a desk, hated working with mechanics, huge complex C# code base that I never really got to even remotely understand, manager was kind of a dick.  Because of this I somewhat panicked and switched to BIOE because I think the human body is fascinating and I thought it would be better than all the other engineers.  A year into switching I was told by my advisor that I had to stay 5 full years anyway so I decided to do the dual major. 

&amp;#x200B;

Education Difference:

I think that BIOE has definitely taught be a lot about biology, signals, systems, control, statics, thermodynamics, fluid motion etc that COE has not really taught me but at the same time I think that most of that list is very boring, hard and I would never really want to work with any of that.  Also I really envisioned working with medical devices but because I needed classes to overlap I needed to take signals classes which to me are not fun at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Career Concern:

 Because of the dual major I wasn't able to (maybe more accurately didn't make the time) to do any more internships or coop rotations because I have been taking classes every semester including summers.  I feel like my whole experience with this dual major is that I know a little about a lot of topics where as employers want people who know a lot about few topics.  I'm just confused because everyone at school (classmates, advisers, program directors) always say ""with the dual major you'll be very marketable!"" But I honestly have grown to feel like the opposite: that is I'll end up with a software job that doesn't require anything I've learned from BIOE and I'll functionally become a CS/COE graduate with minimal industry experience. I always envisioned that with my dual major I would do something along the lines of writing software for medical devices or something along these lines. Is there really such a niche or will I graduate basically as a COE?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** **In short- I feel like I traded internships/experience for BIOE.  Advisors call me ""marketable"" but I don't feel this is correct. Is there really any utility to my dual major or am I just an inexperienced COE/CS student.**

MS CS started (to get back on the software track - have a 3.8 GPA from a top 80 school)  
1 c++ internship (dev) - 3 months    
1 software engineering internship (working on message queue and transport layer analysis like flow control) - 2.5 months  
  
Throughout my professional experience, I did too many different things. During my Masters too, I focused on full stack development. So, other than some C++ and Java - I spent 2 semesters studying front end (MERN stack). I also studied DBMS for 2 semesters - indexing and transactions and complex SQL.   
  
**Here is the problem** - this breadth of knowledge has worn my knowledge thin. I either forget stuff due to constantly switching between concepts/languages - or I need a week or two to plug back into a particular stack/tech. Plus - because of the diversity, I lack depth in anything really. It feels like there is not a single topic/language I know in depth. I know C++ and have worked in it - but I do not know the really complex intricacies or many of the new C++ 14/17 features. I know Java - but cannot write complex multi-threaded programs or APIs. I studied and did projects on the MERN stack like an year back - so most of that has been forgotten too. Sure - I can pick things up quickly or understand large codebases efficiently - but that is not sufficing for the employers I met with so far.    
  
This is really hurting me because I do not know what to market myself as. I guess I had hoped to get into a generalist new grad software position (like the big companies), where they are language agnostic and pick it up from there. But that boat has sailed now (don't see many new grad positions anymore). I am decent at algorithms, but that alone is not getting me anywhere. I was barraged with in-depth language questions in my recent interviews and it made me realize how shallow my knowledge is.    
  
**Where to from here?** - this is the big question for me now. I want to take the next 2-3 weeks to get some ""depth"" in maybe just 1 concept or language/stack. How do I do it, and which one do I pick - front end or back end? I personally do not have a preference, because I do not have that much software engineering experience to know what I really want. I know I like to code and solve problems - that is about it. If I wanted to get some depth in a language/stack in 2-3 weeks - how do I find projects to work on?  
  
Please advice me, I am at the lowest point in my life and need direction. Oh also, I am here on a student visa, although that is not my biggest concern. I would go back to my country, but my career still needs direction.     

Please share your opinions and constructive criticism. If someone has been in a similar boat, please share your story and how you succeeded - it will really inspire me. :-)

**TLDR** - New grad with a breadth of experience/coursework and no depth. Keep forgetting things due to having studied a wide variety of concepts/languages and not always applying them (or maybe I have a serious memory problem).

Would I say I was the best employee? No, but towards the middle of the contract I felt like I really showed my potential in one of the aspects of my job. My main qualm with this position was that I felt bullied and belittled by my manager. There was a time he even snapped his fingers at me as a joke to a colleague to see if I would answer. He didn't treat me the same way he did the other people in my position. It didn't get much better and we butted heads all the time. I just knew he didn't like me much. With that being said it was obvious he wouldn't extend my contract. They hired a new person for my position and I essentially had to train them a bit before I had to leave myself.   


My main question with this thread is how I'm viewed by recruiters after having a 6-month contract to hire position that I didn't get extended or hired? I've been going for about 10 months without a position in my field and I'm worried. I've been applying non-stop but interviews are very rare and far between. I worked a retail job for a bit in between this time so I could at least make some money but I feel like that hurts me more than helps.   


I have too much experience for an internship but too little experience when people want 2 years+. I can't help but feel like recruiters look at me and are disinterested because they can tell it's a contract to hire position that I didn't continue on.

Has anyone been in this situation before? "

I learnt python and JavaScript basics on my own and grasped C from a Comp Sci course I had this semester. I'm currently dividing my time over 3 things: 
1) python data science libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.. 
2) node.js and mongoDB with an intention to extend this to learning Angular. (MEAN stack)
3) algorithms and data structures

Am I making a mistake by dividing my time over 3 things instead of concentrating on one of them (or at most 2 of them, I mean I can keep going with data structures and choose one of python DS libraries or MEAN. 
I don't feel confused when I switch between them because all three are nearly unrelated to each other. My main concern is whether it's better to take for instance ""X"" months and end mastering all 3 or take ""X/3"" months to master one of them then ""X/3"" months to master the next, etc..
 
side note: I need to have 4 internships to graduate, and my semesters are relatively flexible so I don't really care if my first internship isn't in Summer 2019 (not even expecting this) but if not, I must have an internship either in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020.

I got a call from my boss this afternoon, details are still coming out but it looks like he killed himself.

I had no clue that he would do something like this. He was a successful senior web developer with a wife and kid. By all accounts he had the life that I aspired to. He was an incredibly kind and helpful person, and we shared an office so we got to know each other fairly well in a short amount of time. We would talk about politics, music, hunting... I have been at this internship for only a few months but he has really helped me and made me realize that I know more than I think I do.

I go in to work tomorrow and I don't have a clue what the future holds... 

We are a small company and he was the only dev besides me (we had some recent turnover and hadn't hired a replacement yet). He was super smart and knew all of the systems and procedures inside and out. In contrast, I literally just got the hang of one of the many processes that we do.

I am worried I won't be able to help them as much as they need before they can hire a new dev. I don't think he is replaceable. We are a very close knit company, I'm sure everyone will be devastated tomorrow and I'm not sure I know how to handle that...

I'm currently in my 2nd year of an AAS in Computer Information Systems at CityTech in Brooklyn. I'm trying to figure out if I should stay on this track or transfer to a better school and get a BS in Computer Science. Here's some notes:

If I stay at CityTech and get my AAS there, the obvious next step is to get the BTech degree that they offer. However, my biggest worry is that employers in the future will see a BTech degree and get immediately turned off.

Pros: They offer 2 internships (one for the AAS degree, one for the BTech)
The BTech allows me to choose a field to specialize in (Database systems, networking and security, IT Operations, and Software Development)
I already know the school and it shouldn't take me too long to get both degrees.

Cons: CityTech is probably not a very ""reputable"" school.
Also, it takes me nearly an hour and 15 minutes to get there via train (and I hate taking the train for so long)
MAIN CON: Future employers may not like the BTech degree and would instead prefer a BS.

So, any advice?

* Co-president of CC Mu Alpha Theta (Math) Honors Society
* VP of Education of Gavel Club (means that I serve as president if the president isn't present for meetings and am second in order, since first is president and there are several VPs in Gavel Club)
* HOSA project manager
* CJSF/CSF member who will earn lifetime membership upon graduation

Awards/Honors:

* 4th Place &amp; Silver Medalist at CBS Bay Area Spelling Bee - Mar 2015

* Runs a tea account (like actual drinking tea)
* Several instances of DI: (attended Brown near You two times and met with AO on PLME committee, direct email contact with AOs, online campus tour, direct contact w/ Ask a Brown Student)
* Submitted two-minute video, my resume, polio project (100%) and op-ed for teacher pay (99.2%) to Brown

So people have told me that I'll be outright rejected from Brown because I'm not an ISEF or Siemens finalist and didn't do any research (it's super competitive to even perform research and much less land your name on a paper) and I focused more on leadership initiatives and doing the best with what I can do on hand. The most research I've done is get 3rd place at a county science fair and get a 100% on an interdisciplinary research project about polio and WWII. And while it would be awesome to hang out and do research, I do need that humanistic aspect and want an MPH, JD, MBA or teaching credential after pursuing my MD. Plus the # of people applying ED has risen (even though I'm the only one from my high school applying ED to Brown since everyone wants to go to NW, Stanford and Berkeley).

I really want to go to Brown, even if I get rejected from PLME. What I want for my college experience is basically what Brown offers and have attempted to give myself that experience of taking what I want while at Middle College. Am prepared for deferral/rejection but still nervous.

a51v20,0,2018-12-10,Please help me settle on a major/career?,monmonmonmonmonmonmo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a51v20/please_help_me_settle_on_a_majorcareer/,"So I'm pretty stuck at the moment. I'm currently a psychology major (B.A.), and planned to go to grad school for either I/O or Clinical. I heard I/O makes the best money but there don't seem to be many jobs available in this field in my area (LA), and surprisingly clinical psychologists here, according to job listings, make $80,000-$130,000, believe it or not. Not sure this could be false but .. that's that, and if it's true, it satisfies me the most in terms of career and salary

On the off chance they are lying or something however, I'm kind of stuck making very little money. The few I/O programs in my area (which I would like to stay in California in terms of school and career if possible) are maybe 3 at most, and like clinical, very competitive with what seems to be few job offers

Because of that, I am thinking about switching my major (or double majoring) in Information Systems: Business. I hear good things about this field, and see good offers for it near my area. However, I don't know if I'd be able to pull through.. it has quite a bit of math involved including business calculus, and that isn't something I look forward to at all 

I really want to make good money as a clinical psychologist because it truly interests me the most. But I don't know if I can. And if I happen not to, I planned on applying to law school. But I'm afraid these are bad ideas, as I heard horror stories of even Ph.D psych degrees making little, and that there are too many lawyers out there for jobs

I don't want to double major in both and burnout while risking my gpa to the point where I can't do anything at all even with a backup plan; no applying to law school, no applying to psych grad programs, nothing. But, I'm also too afraid of not taking the chance and leave behind opportunities for both things

So what do you think I should do? 
My options are: double major in psychology and information systems, and not have to give up either my interests or salary, only major in psych and go for my dream with what seems to be a promising salary in my area, major in psych and minor in information systems to go for a masters in I/O with a tech background, Major in Info systems with a psych minor since I already took psych courses and am interested in it, or only major in Info systems and hope I can get through the business calc, etc? 

I seriously cannot for the life of me decide and I have until junior year to do so

Please, share your experiences either double majoring, or working in clinical / I/O psych or info systems, the salaries, internships, how you got a job, and what you think would suit me the most based on my goals

Very much appreciated!"

In 2017 i was excluded from the university, and this was my wake up call. This lead me to turn my life around while out of school. I was able to reflect on my past decisions, appeal the exclusion, create a path with goals, landed an internship that will lead to a FT job once I graduate, i developed discipline and managed to lose over 40lbs quit drugs and alcohol without outside assistance.

With this being my first semester back, school was a lot more difficult than I remembered. I took my first programming class towards my new major, alongside precalc. I thought i did fairly well in each class until finals week came around and i my professor started releasing previous tests grads. I calculated my grade and i am making a C in programming and a D in calc. This is discouraging because this is the first semester since i started college i can actually say ive tried and it still wasn’t good enough. 

The thing is with being back from exclusion, i must make at least a C+ in each class. Or i am excluded from the university and any other university that will not accept people in my position(which is almost all). If excluded i also lose my job because it is under the agreement that i am in school, and the exclusion this time cannot be appealed. I have worked with my programming professor and completed extra credit to get me to a C+ but that means nothing without the other grade.

I cannot stop crying. Ive isolated myself, can’t leave the house, i cant have a conversation without lashing out, i cannot face my family this holiday season because school is always the topic and my graduation is well overdue. I know there are bigger problems in the world but this one just hurts me so bad. 

Ive scheduled a meeting with my calc professor to explain my situation, but being that ive only visited his office once before, and with it being one week after we took the final and me estimating my grade at a D, id be asking for a miracle to take me to a C+ to remain enrolled in the university. At this point i just dont know what to say to him. Im so ashamed and desparate i dont want to start crying in front of him but it’s inevitable. Ive completed online worksheets and emailed them to him earlier in the week to ask if they would be counted and possibly show him that i do grasp the material, im a terrible test taker.

I completed a web development internship but struggled to find a full time programming job which is all I'm asking for right now in terms of a career.

I really hate my job. I'm sorry to say, it but I hate dealing with people's petty computer problems. This wasn't what I had in mind when I went 35k in debt to get a degree. I hate the industry my company belongs to. I don't particularly care about any of the people.

Honestly the only reason I am still here is because my girlfriend lives here and doesn't want to move elsewhere. If I chose to move somewhere else it would probably mean the end of our relationship. I love and care about her a lot but honestly our relationship has been pretty messed up at times, and for complicated reasons she is afraid to tell her family about me, and it doesn't seem clear when she ever will. 

I've tried applying to other jobs around where I live, but after facing many rejections I just feel really demoralized. If I move back home I can possibly work where I interned or at least get a temporary job and live with family while I figure something out.

I just hate my current job a lot and I dont know how much longer I can last without going crazy. So Reddit, what do I do? Do I abandon my relationship to try and pursue something that wont make me miserable, or do I stick it out and hope that I'll find something better here?"

The catch is, I am working co-op for a local company over here.

My internship is at summers of 2019.

Co-op is for experience. I can graduate without co-op. Co-op is not that great. Software Engineer in Test, writing automated scripts to test (converting their old testing stuff to python) company's operating system.

Should I quit my co-op? How will it affect my resume for future employers?

Thing is, I originally planned to go to college after I finished my Internship but now, the place I go to for my Internship wants to hire me as an employee, and I need to make money before college. 

For me, It's a golden occasion to have my first full-time job. To make money to be more secure for college and etc. So, of course, I said ""yes, I want to be in the team"".

Here's the problem : Since I said all of this to my very protective mother. She was completely disagreeing with me. I decided to cancel my Winter Semester to work and I will go to college for Fall Semester. Now, she seems focused on forcing me to go to college instead of working.
She even turns what I think is a golden occasion for me in my life to something that might ruin my life when she tells family member about that.

I don't know what to do, mother is trying to
turn everyone I know to hate my decision. 

My mother is way too overprotective. She worries way too much about that. She's the kind of mother where her worrying about me do more harm to me than good.

TL;DR : I cancel my Winter Semester to make more money in a place where I think will be a golden opportunity for me, yet my overprotective mother tries to ruin it."

I'm 19 and attended a great private college prep school for high school and then went on to get into a solid University studying Cyber Security. Computers were always a passion of mine and I was always that skinny nerdy kid who loved programming and video games. I figured the path for me was already set by the time I was in 6th grade. I've been doing this forever and love it. However college is not all its cracked up to be. 


I found myself struggling to meet anyone I wanted to be friends with and was hit by a wave of depression stemming from classic family issues and isolation. I decided to get out of my mind and into my body and began a hardcore lifting regimen. I was going all week and resting on weekends, sometimes I would do cardio or something else on my off days just to blow off steam. For the first time in my life I was looking good and feeling good and it completely warped my perspective on things. 


I started volunteering and took the best internship I could've ever asked for. I'm now working as an intern at a major corporation doing IT work, for some reason this has been a dream of mine since I was little. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the thing though, I absolutely hate it. The work is tedious at best and although I don't deal with depression, this shit would make any normal person depressed. I had to relocate, have no friends here, do nothing all day, and am stuck in an empty suburban area, the only thing that keeps me going are the weekends. Leaving out details, today I fucked up and I let down my boss big time because of my complete apathy for the job. I feel awful about it.


I try to never let my personal problems get in the way of work and I'm very good at hiding my emotions, but I guess the boredom and anxiety just became too much and I made a mistake. It's nothing major but enough that it's EXTREMELY embarrassing and finally forced me to really revaluate what I'm doing. 

&amp;nbsp;

The trouble is that I have no idea what I want to do. I know I don't like this and I know I can't tolerate being in front of a computer screen 24/7, I feel like I'm watching life pass by. I love physical activity, more than I thought I ever would and I don't think IT is right for me anymore. I like to interact with people... I like the sunshine. I've been flirting with the idea of joining the military or becoming a history major for years now but both of those feel impossible. I also think about doing something physical like farming or becoming a mariner, I've even considered becoming a doctor. Just something that gets me out in the world and doing something that lets me go to bed feeling satisfied. 

I feel so stuck though because my parents have invested so much money into this education and I just can't see myself being happy like this. I don't even know what I want to do but I know it might not be a the white collar 6 figure job they want me to have. Money means nothing to me, ""success"" and power don't excite me. I don't want to move up a corporate ladder, I don't want to try to make millions with some app idea, I don't want to do any of this, I just want to feel fulfilled. 

What do I do here, how do I even find out what I want to do? I'm very anxious over this and get increasingly worse every month that passes because that is more tuition payments. "

A little about me. I have a Bachelor's degree (BA) in a social science. I have worked for the federal government since I was 18 years old, working my way up from a student intern, to the position I have now, which is a Federal Investigator (for a three letter agency). I've been an Investigator now going on 4.5 years.

For the sake of anonymity, generally speaking,  I enforce criminal, civil, and regulatory laws, interview/interrogate people/suspects, and pursue leads of fraud, theft, and many other types of cases. My investigations typically result in administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. I really enjoy what I do, however, I don't think I want to stay in the federal government for my entire career, and I'm looking for some guidance from my fellow redditors.

I want to break into investigative work for large companies such as Google, Nike, AirBNB, Facebook, etc... I see a lot of these companies have positions for both internal and external investigations, such as anti-money laundering, cyber-security, auditing, fraud, theft, etc...

What I'm curious to know is if anyone here knows what type of certification would help me obtain a position like the one I'm describing. I have been looking into Certified Fraud Examiner, Certified Internal Auditor, and Certified Anti-Money Laundering Certifications. Are any of these good options for me? If not, what else can I do to become more appealing to these larger companies? I know my investigative experience is relevant to said companies for many different reasons, but I think pairing it with some sort of relevant certification would make my resume that much stronger. Thoughts? Any questions for me?

I have a degree in mathematics from a liberal arts college, and I took a class called Financial Math during my senior year where I learned about hedging, budgeting, Black-Scholes option pricing, probability theory, and Geometric Brownian Motion. So I definitely have skills with analysis/calculation, etc. but I don’t really have much real life “experience” with finance. 

Nowadays, to educate myself further, I’ve begun to practice mastering MS Excel, trying to educate myself about the broad world of finance and its different factions, and reading the news pertaining to finance/business/politics/tech.

So far I’ve applied to many financial analyst positions and internships, mostly in NYC as I’m currently living in NJ and there are plenty of opportunities there. I haven’t had much luck, and I feel like I’m being overlooked by companies in favor of candidates with business degrees in finance, accounting, etc. I’ve also tried my alumni network, but have not had much luck with job or internship leads.

Then I took a look at this required class called ""Systems Programming"" that I'm going to have to take eventually and started wondering whether it might be a good idea to stack my schedule this Winter. 

It seems like it's being taught by some very good teachers this year and I just quit my job so I have a lot of time on my hands. This would make my semester insanely difficult. I'm not the best student but I just quit my job and I do have time on my hands. After all it's only going to get harder from here... right?

My biggest fear is that I would be learning Data Structures in C++ then C/Assembly in another class at the same time which could get really confusing. I also don't want to ruin my grades in the eyes of future internships for being too ambitious. It should also be noted that I find the material in Systems Programming very interesting.

a56a65,0,2018-12-11,New guy at work dominates every conversation,nedf765,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a56a65/new_guy_at_work_dominates_every_conversation/,"I have been working as an engineer for the last couple of years, but I am currently in the process of transitioning into a different engineering role that I am less familiar with.

There is a new guy a couple years younger than me where I work, who is also transitioning into the same role. Even though I have more experience overall, we have about the same level of experience with respect to this new role (which is just about 2 months of experience). He is actually currently an intern but will be starting full time in a couple of weeks once he gets his bachelors degree. He is 25, about 6'4, very attractive, and has a deep loud sexy voice. He is a very intelligent and hardworking guy, and he is a very quick learner - me and him have been learning this new role for the same amount of time, but I feel like he has learned significantly more than I have learned. And not just that, but he is extremely articulate and good at showing that he knows what he is talking about. Management absolutely loves him for this, and understandably so.

These are all good qualities he has. Here is the problem: It is impossible to keep up with him in group discussion. He is just so good at talking, and he just ends up dominating every group conversation. Normally I am able to contribute in group discussions, but not when this guy is in the room. Every time someone pauses when they speak the new guy is always the first one to start talking. Someone pauses, and I open my mouth to say something, but before I can say a word the new guy has already started talking. And the new guy never pauses when he speaks - he just keeps going and going, showing off his technical expertise and vision for how to do things. By the time I think of something to say, he has moved onto a different topic. 

Also it is not just his intelligence and quick thinking, but also his deep voice, alpha male mannerisms, and ""in control"" way of speaking that reinforce his dominance. He has the kind of voice where a regular guy can be talking, and then the new guy mumbles something trivial and all heads turn to him, because his voice is just so much louder and deeper than everyone else's. In the rare moments that someone else is talking, I hear two people: 1) The speaker, and 2) the new guy saying ""Yeah"" and ""Uh huh"" after every statement the speaker makes - that's how loud and deep his natural voice is. Every group discussion just feels like a 2-way conversation between the new guy and whoever the new guy is speaking to at the moment. 

I also feel like he is pretty bossy and often tells people what they should work on, and acts like the leader. He doesn't do it to try to be a dick, it's just his personality, but it's just frustrating to be ""told"" to work on something rather than to be asked that I work on something. Whenever I suggest for my coworkers to do something I am always very careful to be tactful about it so they don't feel like I am bossing them around, but this guy just says ""you work on this, I'll work on this"". Like I said, he's not doing it to be mean, he just has a leadership personality.


Me and the new guy were called to fix a problem for some scientists. I like to practice my conversational skills so I started explaining the problem and what went wrong. But after me saying a few words the new guy just took over the conversation, and the scientists stopped acknowledging me or looking at me when they would speak, and they would only speak to the new guy and made eye contact with only him. The new guy is the serious employee. He's the guy who knows what he's talking about. I, on the other hand, am just a joke."

Debating whether or not I should quit.,pottersherar,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/a56s0s/getting_worse_at_coding_debating_whether_or_not_i/,"Honestly I'm pretty sure this post is not gonna get any buzz since it's gonna be a long post and also I noticed that a lot of people have made posts such as these. I'm just writing this just so I can vent about it.

I graduated at a cs university this year and I'm unable to get a job (including freaking unpaid internships apparently) due to my lack of skill in coding. For the past 5 months I just spent my time in cafes learning (or rather trudge through) basic data structures and interview questions and I can say I manage to learn anything substantial really. This might be because I only manage to learn only 3 hours a day, and there are some days where I can't be bothered to study.

The reason why I'm forcing myself to do this is because I really want to make video games and because it's technically my only ""marketable skill"". I actually really enjoyed working on my final year thesis. A 5-level Unity 3D project and I thought that if I gonna get a job as a programmer, it's gonna be working in Unity, since that's where I'm the most skilled at. The obvious problem is that in Romania it was pretty difficult to find such a job, so I just focused on badly relearning programming basics.

Fast-forward to now and I was given this assignment from a local game company as a 2 part interview process. I'm supposed to make this simple number sorting game. For the past week I just struggled with making some basic GUI images drag and drop correctly. I still didn't manage to make it work really. This was after another Unity interview where the interviewer asked me to write an alternative to a mathf.clamp method. it took me a embarrassing 15 minutes to just write 2 if statements, I'm surprised they let me stay for that long.

So my Unity has gotten worse because I haven't worked on it for months, my data structures and algorithms are abysmal, and I don't know any technology enough so I can work in a professional level anywhere.

The worst part is that I really don't have the motivation to work on becoming a better coder. I'm so tired of going to a shit Starbucks cafe and only to work 3 hours and not see any progress because I know it's gonna take me a full year to learn to even be considered a ""junior coder"". I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do right now... it's not like I can just switch my career just like that.

However, I’m an art major trying to decide what I want to do first with my life once I get out of college. Here are a few options I’ve considered: 

* Graduate from UCSB at the end of my 3rd year and dedicate as much time as possible to study User Experience Design. I can easily graduate by the end of this year and if I were to stay another year, it would be credits that wouldn’t count toward anything since I would have already finished my major. If I did graduate this year, I’d plan to develop skills to either get an internship or pursue a Masters degree in the User Experience Design field and get a high level internship in the tech field (my family lives in Silicon Valley and has many connections if I wanted to get into tech). I have nearly zero experience with user experience design, but I think I would really enjoy it as I find passion in personally experiencing enjoyable and intuitive designs. My fear with this path is that I’d be cutting my college experience short and I may not actually like working in user experience design since I’ve never tried it. I’ve talked to numerous industry professionals in Silicon Valley who live extremely comfortable and love their job - I guess I’m just worried about the steep learning curve and whether I’d be good at it. 

* Attend UCSB for another year and utilize the opportunity as an art major to curate multiple gallery experiences by renting out the gallery on campus for free. I imagine this would give me the opportunity to develop creativity in spatial experience design, seeing what people like and what gallery experiences work most in terms of receiving positive visitor feedback. My fear with this path is it doesn’t offer much practical skill development to be marketable for a job right out of college. The ideal with this path would be to finish college with a creative portfolio that shows my ability to curate enjoyable spatial experiences and intern with a creative art collective such as teamLab, Adobe Creative Residency, Golf Media, Awge, etc. I think this environment of work is something I would enjoy the most, but I worry about the ability to make money in this field if I decide to pursue this (at least in comparison to the potential money I could make as a User Experience Designer in Silicon Valley). 

I think my anxieties of becoming successful in something I love stem from my older brothers success. He’s the oldest brother out of all of us and is ridiculously successful from the tech industry owning multiple homes in San Francisco and seemingly living the life. Everyone looks up to him and since he made it in life all on his own, I put a large sense of pressure on myself to reach the same level if not surpass his level of success since I have insane amounts of opportunities due to his connections in the tech field. I also feel as though the be taken seriously in the tech field if I choose that path, I’ve seen from my other brothers and their friends that the younger and more experienced you are in the work you do, the greater the chances you are at being placed in a startup with high probability of success. All my brothers extremely successful friends recommend I finish school as soon as possible and begin working so as to work my way up as quick as possible, but I guess I just don’t know whether I want to work in tech culture despite the potential money I could make or spend my time working in a more enjoyable field, creating interactive art experiences but likely never seeing the chance to make the same amounts of money my brothers and their friends make in Silicon Valley tech. 

Sorry for the rant, I just feel as though the decisions I make within the next 6 months of whether to graduate and start pursuing ux design or continue just making art and figure it out later will be crucial and I just don’t know what to do with my life lol I probably sound very spoiled and I acknowledge either option is extremely lucky and I’m so blessed to even have these options, just curious as to what other people might say. 

Thanks so much. "

Can someone tell me if this is a good back-up plan?,Clam-the-Clam,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a59t0p/not_confident_in_my_major_can_someone_tell_me_if/,"*This is going to be a bit long but thanks to anyone who's willing to read it*

I'm currently a Pharmacological Chemistry major at UCSD. I didn't transfer in from a CC - I got in straight out of high school by working extremely hard to maintain a good GPA.

It seems like all of that work is about to go to waste. My GPA right now is around the average for UCSD students in my major (~3.3), but even though I'm only in my second year, I seriously doubt that I'll be able to raise this to something competitive for a reputable grad school.

 It's not that my work ethic has been on a downward spiral - my aptitude seems to be the same as it was before. It's just that now I'm competing with other people that worked equally hard in high school to get in, and the standards for classes and curves have been raised as a result.

It seems like none of this is gonna work in my favor. From what I've read, grad schools don't take undergrad prestige/difficulty into account when assessing GPA. This puts me at a great disadvantage. I'm ironically being punished for my hard work in high school. I should've gone to an easier school with high grade inflation to counter this. A BS in Pharm Chem leads to nowhere - I'll maybe be looking at 35K starting salary as a lab slave in a city with a high CoL. All of that effort, just for that? Even when the major is known for it's difficulty?

Switching majors is also not an option at this point.

So I want to prepare a ""double-layered"" contingency plan to counter my likely low GPA in the future. I started working in a research lab a couple of months ago, and I love it. This experience extended through 3 years will help with grad school admissions. The ""first layer"".

The second layer would entail minoring in Computer Science. A minor at UCSD = 40 credit hours, so it should be enough to make a Masters in CS and/or a career in software engineering possible assuming I do side projects + an internship. Although it's a lot, I took a lot of credits my first year and have a ton of AP credit, so it should still be a smooth ride for me to graduate within 4 years if I take summer classes.

Does this plan sound like a good idea?

TL;DR  I'm not confident in my major (Pharm Chem) and I think minoring in computer science would be a good back up plan.

A recruiter at another unicorn reached out recently to start the interview process for a Software Engineer position (though she did not specify whether this was for an internship or new grad). I completed the coding challenge she sent and asked her what the term of the position would be , and she mentioned that it could either be new grad or an internship, depending on what I want.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my ""problem"": I plan on being a data scientist career-wise, and the places that I'm interviewing at for full-time would all be great places to work. However, I'd be potentially be able to do work around ranking or data engineering with the unicorn SWE position, 2 fields that I've always been fairly interested in trying, but never considered pursuing full-time. So, I'm considering trying for an internship with the unicorn, and taking one of the full-time data science offers that I'll (hopefully) get with the other places. My plan would be to do the internship in the summer before I start my new grad position, and I'd still get a month to just rest as it would be a 12-week internship.

**My background**:  About to get my Diploma in SE (5 year program) from NTUA,  Athens-Greece, (grade not that good - 7.9/10 with master thesis), work  experience \~7 mos Full Stack in a small company, \~3 mos Backend Dev  Intern in a startup.

**What I want**  in the long run: A high paying job at a big company, ideally involving  managerial/architectural roles, preferably in Embedded Systems, in a big  European city.

By finishing my studies, I have the option to either:

1. Start interviewing and jump into the industry right away,
2. **OR**  prepare for GRE and TOEFL/IELTS exams to apply for an MSc at a well  known university (Imperial, UCL, TU Delft, ETH, ..., which is \~3 months  of total prep, plus the cost, plus 1 or 2 years for the program, plus in  a foreign country, for knowledge I am pretty sure I already have, **BUT** I get a pretty good label in my CV)
3. **OR** I can apply at a smaller university (Heriot-Watt, University of Edinburgh, UVA, ...,  no GRE-TOEFL/IELTS prep, 1 year, **BUT** less value as a label).

I  actually want to start interviewing and start working right away  because after 62 courses and a thesis I just don't want to study anymore  or take the GRE test, but if an MSc is a good investment (mostly of  time), that can raise my chances for a better salary, I shall consider  it seriously.

I provided a lot of details to be as accurate as possible. What would you do in my position and why? Any relevant experiences?

I was always very close to my grandfather. Growing up without a dad wasn’t easy, but he always made sure to make it easier. He was my dad. 

So, as you can imagine, I was devastated when he died, after a year fighting brain cancer. I was 17 and not ready to lose him. Still, I was determined to make him proud. After a time of mourning, I got back on my feet and made sure to not let my grades drop; a few months later, all the hard work finally paid of: I got the letter. My grandfather’s biggest dream was for me to be accepted to Law School, and so I did, like I always had promised him. I was over the moon! 

I don’t believe in God and he knew it, but a few hours before he died he gave me a little cross to keep around my neck, “because he’d always be protecting me”, as he said. I wore that thing every damn day, and everytime I was in a sketchy situation or walked alone at night, I grabbed it tight. 

Fastforward a few years, it’s around 11pm and I’m leaving my internship office. I’m really tired and just want to get home (which I still have to walk to), so I try to walk as fast as possible, since it’s still a bit far and I can’t wait to get in bed and sleep the night away. 

I can’t remember well the next moments, but here’s what I remember:

He grabbed me and he smelled so much like alcohol. He was taller and stronger than me, so putting up a fight wasn’t much of a use. He pulled me into a dead end alley, and put my head against the wall, his whole body pressuring against mine and his breath making me want to vomit.

“Not a single scream, you understand sweetie?” He said, in his intoxicated voice. I felt tears run down my face as one of his hands covered my mouth and the other slid down my pants.

In this chaos, the only thing I thought off was praying. Praying to him. To the man who always swore to protect me, beyond the grave. 

And then, it stopped. The man stopped. He slowly walked back and removed his hands off my body, mouth hanging wide open, eyes not quite right. Something was wrong and I couldn’t figure out what. That’s when I saw it: the hole in his stomach. It had a hand right through it. Suddenly, I hear a whisper in my ear. 


“Close your eyes, sugar. It’ll be over soon.” 

So I did. I did because that was my grandfather’s voice. I leaned my back against the wall and I closed my eyes, and covered my ears, even though that wasn’t of much use. The man screamed so loud, it was unbearable. As soon as the screams stopped, I removed the hands off my ears and opened my eyes, and my grandfather was standing in front of me, smiling. 

“It’s over now, sugar.” 

“Wha-what are you doing here? How’s this possible?” I asked. I was shaken to the core, I could barely pronounce a sentence. 

“I promised bear, I promised I would always protect you. No matter what.” 




He disappeared after that. But the horrible sight of the man’s leftovers didn’t. He was.... scrambled eggs. His insides were everywhere, he had his hands twisted in an impossible way, and his eyes were nowhere to be seen. I vomited right in the place, thinking about what had just happened. It was a lot to take in.


I still can’t explain it to this the day, but the man never showed up on the news, nothing. The first few days were hard. I couldn’t get any decent sleep, the thought of the man’s insides didn’t let me eat and I was a wreck. 

I don’t believe in spirits, God or even an afterlife. Maybe you can help me figure this out.

I am currently rounding the corner of graduating and obtaining a degree in Computer Information Systems from a University. This is a Bachelors of Science degree from the college of business at my school.

Throughout school I have done 3 different internships. 1st at a large and well known Wealth Finance group where I learned a lot as it was my first IT gig. 2nd job was at a large Fortune 500 company where I got a lot of experience in a ""big business"" environment. 3rd and current job I am working as an IT Technician for a small MSP that does a lot of hands-on work with servers/desktops/hardware. All in all I have almost 3 years of experience in the ""Help Desk"" and ""IT Support"" roles through internships and experience.

I am about 6 months into my new job, and although I still enjoy it, I am starting to realize I am more of a ""business person"" rather than a ""techie"". At my first 2 internships, I was very involved in the company and went to meetings, was constantly meeting new faces, had to look and act professional, gained lots of friendly relationships and contacts...

I believe I have a gift of interacting with people and building relations rather than just be a ""break/fix"" guy that sits in the office. I really enjoyed my experiences at the business internships rather than my new position where I am kind of in a small office on the phone all day, with occasionally getting out in the field.

Since my degree is going to be technically a ""business"" degree... what types of roles should I be looking for the lean more on the business side of IT rather than the technical side. I believe all the internships with reputable companies in Help Desk related roles will help my resume pairing it with a BS in Computer Information Systems... it's just where to go from there. Sales? Analyst? Administration? Manager?

Anyone have a Computer Information Systems degree... or work more on the business side of IT?

Appreciate all input!"

a5boqj,52,2018-12-11,"Job seems too ""easy""?",EquivalentScore,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a5boqj/job_seems_too_easy/,"Some background: I got a job back in May as an engineer. I graduate this month, at which point I get promoted with a hefty raise that gives me about what a new grad not in a major tech hub can expect to get. Company is fairly laid back too.

Thing is, it may be too laid back. I often have no work to do because I finish everything on my plate for the sprint long before the sprint is over, usually because I’m getting bug fixes and small features (granted I’m the new guy who came in with no experience so I expect that). I do ask for more work but I rarely ever get it because this company is strict about only doing what work is assigned for a particular sprint and nothing else. Nice as it is having all that time to do whatever I want, it makes me feel like I’m going to get fired when I just spent an entire day on Reddit or learning some CS stuff completely unrelated to my job.

And I’m not sure how much I’m getting out of this job. People talk about their first jobs or even internships like they’re drinking from a firehose of knowledge, that they learned more in a month than all their years in college. Me? The biggest thing I’ve learned in 7 months is how to get work done in a mammoth codebase, SDLC stuff, and some design patterns/architectural stuff/best practices. Beyond that I feel like I haven’t learned much. For example, we use Spring and Marionette at work. If you asked me to build you a small Spring and Marionette app right now, I couldn’t. I wouldn’t know where to even start, because I haven’t had to. I get a bug or feature, I hop into my IDE and dev tools, quickly figure out where the code I need to change is, and get to work. If that code happens to/needs to make use of a framework, I just extrapolate based on what similar code is doing, what I know about the frameworks I’ve actually used from start to finish in personal and school projects, and/or google whatever it is I need to know and carry on. 

Is this normal? Should I find a new job even though it’s been less than a year? I just don’t want to wind up with a stunted career."

Told from her perspective. 

Begin story:

So I currently live in a 6-person suite on my college campus with 5 other girls. I like 4/5 of them, and I desire to maintain a relationship with them throughout this year and the next. We have options so we can live together next year, on campus. However, all of it options are limited to four people, two bedrooms where we double up. 

I like all of them and wouldn’t have a problem living with them either, except for one. I like her but she isn’t clean, and doesn’t have nice living standards. I’d be okay with not inviting her to live with us, but still talking to her through other means. 

The problem arises when her mom is very high up in a company that is relevant to my major. I’m good friends with her and I talked to her mom and she had agreed to help me get an internship at that company. She is in the process of doing so. I am *terrified* that if I don’t ask her to live with me/is, she’ll tell her mom and subsequently rescind my application and blacklist me. I know this is almost guaranteed because both her and her mom are very close with each other and extremely petty and spiteful. 

So my options are to either drop her for the four person housing and risk losing a very good job opportunity, or I can just bite the bullet and live with her next year. The only problem with that, however, is nobody else wants to live with her, I’m the only one who wants to live with her, but I don’t wanna *room* with her. I’d much rather make someone else live in the same room as her, I can handle the same apartment. 

Anywho, I know it’s a lot but I’m very confused and I don’t exactly know what to do. If anything is too confusing please let me know and I’ll clarify, I’m writing this just after I talked to my roommates so I’m kinda nervous. "

I am a 20 year old college student who studies and resides in NY state. Last spring break, a couple of my friends and I went to Daytona Beach Florida and used fake IDs to enter night clubs and bars. Although some venues were very light on admission, the police force was trying really hard to catch kids with fake IDs, like myself. 

After getting my ID taken away from a bouncer who handed it to a police officer, I was written a ticket and charged for a misdemeanor. Although using a fake ID is a felony in Florida the ticket clearly stated that I was being charged with a misdemeanor not a felony. The ticket stated "" attempting to disguise date of birth to enter a venue as 21 years old "" and nothing about a fake ID. 

Of course, for the sake of my future, my family hired a lawyer. The final decision by the judge was to put me on a 3 year conditional probation. The conditions being, I stay clear of any felonies, misdemeanors, or any alcohol related charges in my home town, Daytona beach, and the county in which I go to school. 

Since now I am at a point in my career where I need to start applying to professional internships and jobs that require background checks. Since I have not yet been charged with this misdemeanor, will this whole situation show up on a background check?

I’m really terrified because I’ve noticed that everyone sort of sets into their clicks in the beginning of college and never has any interest in expanding their friendship circle after that. I’m also not the best at making friends. I’m glad I made the 2 or 3 I had, but those took time to develop, and they’re all leaving.

I have picked Anthropology, Business, and Learning Technology.  I picked anthropology because upper level courses allow you get experience doing research. Most classes are doing research for a client or for the university along side learning about different types of anthropology. I picked Business because I wanted to pick up more technical skills such as MS access and get experience with excel. I also will be able to take some class that teach about business concepts. I picked Learning Technology because it is based on learning project management and learning how use different software other such as Photoshop as well offer many professional development class. I picked Technical Writing as a second major because it often more research experience with quantitative methods. Upper level classes for it also allow for student to work as a class on project for a company along side a teacher.  
	I plan to do internship during next summer and the summer after I graduate if I do not have a job by then. I am also working Google Analytics and other software certification during the winter and spring break. I volunteer a lot and I am currently a social media officer for a club. It is more work than it sounds. 
Is there anything else that I need to be doing to be more prepared for career? Is there any advice you can give me?"

Reading about other people's journeys on this forum has been so motivating. Knowing there are other people facing the same hurdles, and learning about how people approach similar challenges in different ways has been so helpful. 

I wasn't diagnosed as a child, because I am inattentive and never bothered anyone. I was smart enough to learn all of my schoolwork at home (last minute) instead of learning at school, so no one was ever bothered that I didn't pay attention in class. But when I got to university, the amount of work got too much to cram. I couldn't keep up. And I especially couldn't keep up when doing clinical work in hospital. I felt like I would never be able to graduate. 

I failed a year at university before being diagnosed with ADHD and I have been working so hard ever since, trying to unlearn all of my avoidant behaviour, getting used to taking my medication and studying hard to catch up to everyone else. I still cram sometimes, I still procrastinate. But now I can listen to things I'm being taught, and I can motivate myself to study. 

My relationships have improved significantly since starting treatment. I can also pay attention to hobbies and interests and exercise. Not all of the time, not everything at once. It's never easy. I am still working at being better and learning about my diagnosis every day.

But I'm just here to tell you: if I can become a doctor, you can do anything! It can be done. In your own way. At your own time. "

To give a brief background, I'm living in a city in China, but for the majority of my life I have been living abroad. Which means that I never picked up the language properly. I could easily get by with spoken and listening, but my reading and writing is basic to elementary. This has been a major obstacle in trying to find a job in my field (Communication and design) in the area. 

I have been to several interviews already, but most of them result in the same conversation. ""You need Chinese for this job."" It's really discouraging and I have been trying to study on my own and taking some night classes (about twice a week). I'm not really sure what path to take anymore, I could either take a Masters, not sure whether it is worth going for, or take an intensive language course in another city (my city doesn't have any). 

I have saved some funds for it, but my family doesn't really want me to take a Chinese course as they see it as a waste of time. They suggested that I should find any job that I can and from there study the language on my own. I could probably do that, but it would be so much harder to learn a language without the proper guidance and discipline. 

I've been looking for schools, but I'm worried that taking the this time off to learn a language will affect my resume. Not really sure what to do at this point. I wouldn't mind moving to another city and try my luck..."

I kinda annoyed the guys at r/learnprogramming at I think I should because I'm not really sure what to do. 

I simply can't get a job as a programmer, not even a proper internship and I'm just to unmotivated to learn coding for an entire year while being unemployed. 

I graduated a romanian cs university this year an I realized I don't know enough to work anywhere. I'm now trying to learn anything I don't know. I do interview questions and I try to learn data structures and algorithms but it's grueling and slow and really not enjoyable, not because I dislike it per se, but because I don't feel any progress in the 4 months of effort I put  in.

My database management skills are garbage so that's 6 months I need to focus on my Algo and data structures are below average, that's another 3 months, I have no knowledge of front-end development and it would take me 6 months to learn that as well and the only technology I'm comfortable with is C# related but it's not good enough to get a job apparently.   

The reason why I got into coding tbh is because I wanted to get into gaming. So I while I enjoy working with computers, I realized after 3 years of university and then discovering the demands of the job market that I'm not that passionate. However this is my only marketable skill technically.

Another problem is that if I work by myself I seem to be getting worse at it. I'm only motivated to work 3 hours a day only in the week days and that's definitely not enough. If only I could be in a work environment I could work better and for longer, but nobody wants to hire so I'm just stagnating and forget things I learned at university.

I'm not really sure what to do right now. I couldn't even get out of the house to work today because I know it's gonna be another 3 hours of dreadful work that doesn't show any small improvements. Any help would be perfect but right now things seem to look grim. Have a nice day! "

a5j5zn,2,2018-12-12,How concerned should I be about working hours and company rep?,stealthcoaster,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a5j5zn/how_concerned_should_i_be_about_working_hours_and/,"Some backstory: I'm 25 and have not had much luck with full-time positions due to the scarcity of field-specific jobs in my (small) country. I studied animation and illustration as it's been my dream since childhood, but have ended up doing a lot of short-term graphic design contract jobs and also jobs that are quite unrelated to my industry (eg admin). I also had to take most of this year off for physical and mental health (surgeries and rehab, as well as managing my mental health) but I'm feeling a lot of pressure to get a proper job.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are low-key pushing me to change industries as they think the creative/art industry isn't good (despite me having studied it since 2008) so I recently applied for an internship at an events firm in the hopes of satisfying them. Midway through the interview process I did some deep personal thinking, had a big change of heart and turned down the internship offer with the hopes of continuing to pursue my creative career just a little longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've received an opportunity that is the job scope I've been looking for, but the company itself has bad industry rep (due to the working environment) and the hours I've been quoted are not great. (50-55h a week and it's over an hour's public transport from my house) I used to work at a place easily over 1.5h by public transport one-way from home and it was really bad for my mental and emotional health, like, just personally it's not something I can handle well on top of actual work stress and it's important to me. Plus I don't know what the average working hours per week are in other countries, but it's 44h here and the 50-55h weekly hours is really scaring me.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that there are rumors (from friends) that the company will be shuttered, which just makes me more doubtful about the position. However I feel almost like I don't deserve to turn this down because I've been holding out for a job of this specific position for so long. And everyone I've asked for advice keeps saying ""just do it"". I would have jumped right on it if it wasn't an opening at this particular company, which I've been wary of for as long as I've been studying in this field.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being unreasonably concerned about the hours and company rep? They seem like red flags to me and I'm not really sold on the opportunity but I feel guilty not going for it because I need a job and I keep saying I want to work in this field. Thank you for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

(Sorry I can't be more specific. Small country + small industry = they might find me. I even made a new account to ask for advice here.)

I am a jr at Uni (statistics/computer science), and I ""interned"" doing some data entry at a medical practicing company in my metro area last summer. As suggested by the person who got me the job, I reached out to my supervisor to ask for a job shadow in the IT department. It seemed like a good idea, so why not?

He connected me with the IT manager, and we are emailing about a date to do the job shadow.

I've been getting into career preparation/development recently (as one should), but I never hear of people doing job shadows. Just applications, resume/CV/cover letters, interviews, informational interviews, LinkedIn stuff, etc...

Everything I find here regarding job shadows is usually tied in with an interview. My situation is a little different and I honestly don't know what to expect. Obviously, if an internship were an option for the company's IT department, I would do it in a heartbeat since I am desperate for experience (no internship/projects). Would it be inappropriate to ask about internship opportunities? What can I actually expect, besides learning about the job?

Cheers!

tl;dr: I am an undergrad and I got connected with an IT manager of a company I did data entry at this past summer. No idea if an internship opportunity would be available, never have done a job shadow before. What should I expect?

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not sure if I completely screwed my chances of getting a decent offer from a company. For some context, I graduated in May, and have been desperately trying to find a job since then. I've written and rewritten my resumes and cover letters after going to critiques through my university as well as other sessions. I've been to a few career fairs and talked to multiple companies who expressed interest. I've spent most days throwing application after application at the great white wall of indeed and similar websites. Sadly, this has resulted in a few prescreenings that received no response, a few denial emails, and complete silence from pretty much everyone else save this one company. I got an interview with them through a personal contact. I talked to their CEO in a behavioral interview and completed the technical challenge they sent me. I feel really good about my chances of getting an offer.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, in my initial interview with the CEO, he asked what I would want my starting salary to be. I gave him a number that (at that point) I thought was fair for me being a new grad. I do have one internship and a few independent studies on my resume, so I feel I have some quality experience. He replied that since they were a small company (&lt;10 people as far as I know) it may be a bit of a stretch for them to pay it. I said I understand, we could discuss more in the future as we moved forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the last couple of weeks rolled around. I decided I need to know more about what the average salaries are for someone with my skillset working in my area. It turns out the number I gave him is significantly less that new grads in my area are making as software engineers on average. about $20,000 a year less. I still understand that, since they are a very small company, they may not match the average salary exactly, but if they give me an offer that's even smaller than my initial number, then I feel like I will have royally screwed the pooch as I won't be offered nearly as much as I now know my degree and experience are worth. I really hope I don't sound entitled saying that, but I've always been told not to settle for less than what I think I'm worth.

&amp;#x200B;

They emailed recently and said they'd be in touch with me before the end of the year. They're the only company so far that I have even come close to getting an offer from, and honestly, I feel pretty desperate to get a job. But I don't want to settle for a job that will pay me so much less than what my peers in my area are making. From what I've read, this could have serious ramifications for my future.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is this: Is there any way to try and negotiate a more reasonable number for this offer? (assuming I do in fact get an offer at all) Or should this just serve as a good lesson in why I should know my shit when talking salary and try not to be the one to offer a number first when interviewing?

Now I am applying for long term positions but I can't decide if I should apply as a \`2019 new grad\` or a \`software engineer\` general role. This probably doesn't make a difference and maybe I am just paranoid but I want to be sure about this before I begin applying for places.

a5n758,1,2018-12-12,Ecommerce or Enterprise solution job,Rivao,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/a5n758/ecommerce_or_enterprise_solution_job/,"Hey, reddit!

The situation is as follows:

I am working for an enterprise web based system as a full stack developer for a year. I started my career in programming a year before as an intern. Right now I am facing a difficult choice - whether to stay and work in the enterprise or go work for a ecommerce/digital marketing focused company.

Decision is really difficult. I do not want to go into details, but, basically, my current company really wants me to stay and is very forth-coming, made an interesting offer that kind of puts in the middle of both companies.

If I go away, I would need to switch from .NET to PHP, but that doesn't scare me. I know PHP a bit, but I am always open to new learning opportunities. I think that staying with .NET would be the wiser career move, but I am not planning on making a career for myself. I am also interested in digital marketing and want to do my own thing some day. And this is where, as I believe, the better choice would be to go with ecommerce, because I would be much closer to the business side of things (developers are very close with clients there) and I would be able to do more different things and have much more responsibility, which in turn would help in the long run. Also, I like the fact that the company has more like a startup environment, because it is not that huge.  


I would value your opinion on this matter.

Also, I would like to hear how happy are developers working on ecommerce? Have you ever made the switch from enterprise solutions to ecommerce or the other way around? What was your experience? 

Thank you! "

Help!,applejuice_43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/a5nexl/did_my_boss_hire_me_out_of_sympathy_help/,"About one year ago I finished my bachelor of business and started an internship in an innovation department for an international company. Three months in my supervisor told me that they really liked my work and were considering taking me on permanently. However, when my internship ended my boss approached me and told me they could only offer me a part time position. I accepted reluctantly since I was weighing options to do a masters but i was hoping the part time offer could be a pathway into full time work. After 6 months I was still on part time work and it looked like there wasn’t a position coming up so I applied to university and got into my dream school. When I quit my boss told me that they really didn’t want me to go and made my part time position full time. When I asked if there really was enough workload for me to come on full time she told me they would take on this new project and make me the project manager so I accepted. However since I went on full time 3 months ago I was barely given enough work to fill 8hrs a day. My manager gets me to draw up concepts for the project but when I present them I find out she already decided how to progress and just used my concept to challenge her and check if I worked out sth she overlooked. It also turns out she was in charge of project management all along and barely shares the responsibility with me. When I ask to be brought along meetings she always says „oh it’s okay I’ll fill you in“ and when I ask how I will progress in my role she always avoids the topic. I’m starting to get a feeling she wants me around for some reason but there just isn’t really a proper position for me it’s almost like she claimed to need a project manager just to keep me on. Im increasingly frustrated since I gave up a spot at my dream Business School to stay on her team. Why is she keeping me there? How could I address this? Or should I just move on? "

I have 3 semesters left until I graduate, which I’m hoping I will be able to find a full time job or have one lined up for me after. 

I started looking for internships earlier this semester, and I applied to almost all of them in my area. I only got contacted by one company, which I interviewed with and they offered me the position, which I accepted. My pay rate is $15 an hour (which I’m unsure if that’s fair, more on that later).

For some background, my main focus in school has been programming in languages such as python, c++, and java. I’ve taken data structures already, and am taking software engineering next semester along with assembly. I took a networking class, but don’t have too much personal experience as far as networking goes.

The position I took is “IT support specialist”. The job is mostly help desk tickets, server maintenance, and typically IT work without any programming. There is a heavier workload in the networking aspect. I made them aware that my knowledge in networking is limited to what I have learned in my networking course, and they were okay with that. I was told that the person I am training with is moving on from the job, and that it could potentially be mine if they liked me enough. I started earlier this week, and so far am unsure of how I feel. The environment is a typical office job, a quiet and small building with about 150 employees. The management is mostly laid back, and the job doesn’t seem stressful in any way. 

I have mostly done help desk tickets, done a little bit of server maintenance, ordered some printer toner, really basic stuff. 

I guess my question is, am I underselling myself? I feel as if my knowledge and skills aren’t being fully utilized, and I’m unsure if what I’m being paid is currently fair (I have done research on pay for my position, but have not found much). Most internships in my area pay more in the area of $20, but those are more of software engineering internships. Should I continue for the experience or continue looking for a software engineering internship? The people are great, it’s mostly the job I’m unsure of. My concern too is that if I’m unsure of it now, how could I take it as a full time job one day? I know it’s only been a week, but I am just unsure if this is what I want. 

Any serious advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated, and I apologize if my post is a little confusing or out of order. If you need any clarification on anything, I will provide it. Thank you in advance for any advice you are willing to give. Thank you!"

Quick intro about me: I'm a junior in college, however, I am finishing my first year in the Cyber Sec major (originally BME). 

Long story short, I haven't been in the field very long. In all honesty, I've been in the program for less than a year. To try to make up for lack of classes, I spent a lot of time self-studying and have obtained the Security+, CEH, and OSWP certs this past year. All of my past job searches haven't really turned out well, so I'm hoping for some advice.

I've been to many cyber sec job fairs, however, it was apparent my lack of experience was turning them away (also, they didn't seem to offer internships, just full-time positions). I'm also a member of several orgs suchs as ISSA, ISSS, and ATX2600. However, they don't seem to offer internships in their job search programs. 

I've been told to go and find help desk jobs for the summer, but I would honestly much prefer an internship that has more correlation with my career. Any advice would be great. "
a5p0ra,165,2018-12-12,Pre Decision Day Thoughts,PessimisticPointer,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a5p0ra/pre_decision_day_thoughts/,"This morning, because my luck is trash, I found out from my friend that, get this, two of my school's probable top 10 students are both ED-ing to the same school I am. Those kids are NUTS. Like 'internship at MIT and cured brain cancer' nuts. Man, I was really banking on them applying to HYPSM or whatever.

Nonetheless, I thought I should do some reflecting. Besides, where better to reflect than on A2C, where I've spent wayyy too much time procrastinating?

Over the past 4 years, I've wasted time on stupid decisions (will taking AP Bio instead of AP Lang get me into HARVARD?!), ignored logic, and been a huge idiot. Through all of my (many) cringe-filled, embarrassing moments, I've learned three important lessons.

1. You shouldn't listen to random people's unfounded judgements of you and take it as a valid criticism of your character. I no longer listen to that douche at a trivia tournament who thinks I'm a moron for messing up a single statistic. And I'm also no longer caring about what a panel of strangers 2,000 miles away has to say about me from one folder of highlights. Neither should you.
2. Great people aren't great because they have attended great schools. Great schools are great only because they have admitted great people. And there are way more great people than there are spots at great schools. To a degree, it all boils down to luck, and being unlucky doesn't make you an inferior person. Do you think that whoever didn't win the Powerball lottery is a failure for life because of it? I doubt it.
3. You've got to be your own cheerleader. Sort of like my first point, if you wait for other people to validate your success, you'll be waiting a long time. I'm proud of my accomplishments. Am I the most accomplished person ever? No. But I tried my hardest with what I got. At the end of the day, that's what life is all about.

After the whole incident this morning, I went back to re-read my essays. Once I looked past how I used the word ""curriculum"" 3 times in 4 sentences, I realized how proud I am of my progress. My essays aren't perfect, but they're pretty damn good. I don't have an elaborate metaphor or a Shakespearean tragedy to tell, but I do have an honest, passionate account of what motivates me to succeed. If the AOs reading my application can't see that, it's fine. I see it, and that's what matters.

So with T minus 21 hours until decisions come out, I've decided that whether I receive a ""Congratulations"" or a ""Thank you for applying,"" I'm going to keep growing as a person. I'm going to go to college somewhere, learn life lessons, make more friends, and hopefully kick some butt along the way. And I share all of this with y'all because I'm absolutely, 100% sure that no matter what happens tomorrow, you can too.

Good luck, everyone!"

I’ve been trying to figure out what I would like to do though. My friend (who’s at the top of our class and is very smart) just got an internship at an engineering company. He basically is going to get paid to learn to engineer. Apparently he’s the company’s first intern, so I’m not really sure how often employers are willing to have internships with high school students. 

I really didn’t feel like I belonged at that grocery store. Since then I’ve been thinking of working at a small ice cream store or something like that. I would think it would be easy and I’m assuming I could do stuff like homework in the back when it’s not busy (I’m not sure what most employers’ policies on this are). If not that I was thinking about working for UPS as a package carrier or something but that seems a little too strenuous. I’m a little awkward and I don’t think I’d be good at dealing with huge rushes of people, so I think I’d rather stick to a smaller place or somewhere where I don’t have to deal with customers non stop, all day.

My parents were always there and loved me growing up, same with the rest of my family. Never had a difficult time with any of that. Except for a divorce when I was ten. But now everyone gets along. 

I’m even in a good place physically. I go to a good school in a good program. Had an amazing internship last summer. I get decently high grades, was #8 in my class ranked by GPA for the internship. By no means is my life shitty. 

I am gay however. Most people at school and other friends know. I’ve been accepted with mostly open arms. There are a few people that still make jokes and threaten to out me to by family. Should probably mention that I’m not out to my family or and close family friends. It’s not that they wouldn’t accept me either. It’s just that I don’t want it to be a huge deal. 

That makes me feel bad because I know there are thousands of people out there who are either scared for their lives to come out or their family won’t accept them for who they are and that’s by no means what I am going through. 

I grew up mostly a loner. Few friends here and there but no super close friends who I was always over at their house having sleepovers or hanging out after school. I mostly kept to myself. Same thing in college. I have a couple people but I am in no means a social butterfly. Never go to parties or out with the guys. 

Besides all of this I still manage to feel down in the dumps at least daily. And it will go from having a great time laughing to being sad within 15-30 minutes. Sometimes it’s feeling bad for myself. Or just that I regret missing out on everything or whatever. I get this out feeling in my stomach and I feel like I’m under an insane amount of stress but nothing should be stressful. 

To complicate matters, I am in an industry where you need a license and a health form filled out by a doctor and one of the boxes talks about depression, bipolar and other things. I’m scared that if I go seek help that it will negatively impact my future career path.

I’m kinda stuck and don’t know what to do or whether or not I’m just being a whiny person or if I should go talk to someone. Sorry for the long post.

**-**

Before I go into the details, to describe the person is that the person is ambitious, successful, master of networking, and has done an internship at a well-known, household-name company during the summer. The person is very inclusive with their social life and only act friendly with a few people. My friends and I suspect that person may be clinically narcissistic with pandering to only teachers and professionals by changed their personality right there believing that they have something that person wants and having them only pay attention to themself, but at the same time, we agree that person is doing something right for their career goals. I personaly see that as what I should be without the narcissism, which made me look up to that person, but after the shunning, I'm starting to believe that I may have been wrong about the person. I dislike the factual belief that there are some people that just don't do well with other people, but I believe that I accidently pushed the limit too much which actually made things worse than it should be naturally. 

**-**

I recently experienced a tragic loss of my mom, and the loss was very sudden. I was panicking HARD, and to help cope on the first day, I called my friends. I made the choice of contacting that casual friend for the first five people I contacted on that same day. I didn't have this person's number at first, so I sent the person my own number after the person agreed to talk with me so that it doesn't seem like I'm attempting to get that person's phone number suspiciously. After telling that person what happened, that person did reassure me that it's not my fault and that whatever happens, I wasn't a bad person that had anything to do with the loss of my mom. After a few weeks, I was mentally sound enough to go back to college and work. I made the effort to find that person and thanked that person for talking with me. We were okay with each other, not the best of friends, but as fellow students who help each other working hard for our future.

I arrived back during the finals week, so the pressure was beating on me so much. The funeral, the memorial, the pain was new and unbearable, and having to do my finals wasn't helping. Luckily for myeslf, I was able to finish strong, and I finally have a chance to rest easy to cope, but before going into summer, there was my school's program showcase to show off what our program has done for the Spring semester. Before the showcase has started, the program head annouced that a professor has recently passed away (coincidently the same way my mom passed away) which shocked everyone in the theater. I walked out angrily since I now have experienced two deaths, and with enduring the finals and the funeral with no help available to me, I let my emotions control my actions. Most people, including some friends and that person saw me storming out. I did come back during the break after the annoucement, but I was struggling to keep myself together (I'll get back to how this event is significant with that person).

Summer started, and I have nothing to do. Both my Dad and sister works, so I'm left alone at home the majority of the time during the first weeks of summer. At first I thought it's good that I have the time for myself to be alone and properly cope without pressure, but being alone was actually the worst experience I have going through my mom's death. I had the photo albums in my reach and my mom's old things all over the place. Going insane with seeing my mom's mementos, I was struggling to move from day to day, doing nothing and being a walking drone. My friends live far away from me, so I was only able to contact them quickly through the phone or through messaging. I mostly did FB's Messenger. Aside from my best friends, I wanted to contact that person (who was in the valuable internship during summer). Objectively, I did give that person a chance to back out since they are busy with their imporatnt internship talking to me on helping me cope, but that person did make the decision to message me throughout summer. I essentially wanted to ask on their opinion on how to overcome grief and loss since I did look up to that person, being the best in the program and making a lot of attention in the industry. I naively assumed that succeessful people know ""everything"", from preparing against dark realities to having natural luck with their success, which is what I think why I contacted that person, but I recently, finally, learned that was a terrible belief (I'll get back to this).

The memorial for the recently-passed professor started later. I attended out of respect for him; I never had a class with him, but I was about to for next semester since I heard fantastic things from his instruction. During the ending of the memorial, I witness a few people, and some of them were classmates of the professor, were playing around, high-fiving people and telling people to smile for pictures. I was extremely disgusted seeing how people were trying to have fun in a memorial, a memorial for a professor who passed away in the most tragic way too. I told me friends that I'm leaving as calmly as possible, and left angry. I contacted that person again, telling them what happened at that memorial. Those people who were messing around are friends of that person also. Reading back my messages, I was livid against those people, but was cool enough that I won't confront any of them anytime. That person attempted to explain that different people cope differently, and I agreed with that, and that some people would rather lift spirits than to keep themselves sad, which I sort of agreed with, and then ended with saying that no matter how a person passes away, ideally or tragically, we should focus on their lives than their death, which, by experience, I didn't agree with. I'm honestly proud that I messaged back very politely that I can see that people think this way, but by my experience, I can't agree with that. 

That person respected my opinion, but then I went off that if I was going crazy, if I was surrounded by people who are either too comfortable with death, or have never experienced death, or don't take death seriously enough in the college program I'm still in. I believe I spooked that person and they said that I should find professional help, and that person didn't want to see me spiral down. I did take that person's advice, and after 23 attempts being waitlisted at various places, I found a good place to go to around the end of summer. I thanked that person for the help. That person, based off from the message, appreciated that, but mentioned that they are not a therapist despite helping. I personally knew that, and responded that I knew, but wanted to talk with that person as person who experienced a tragic event, and wanting help from a fellow student.

Another semester has started, and that is when I noticed that person starting shunning me. In our program, we actually study performance and acting, and that person shunning me is, imo, very obvious based on that person's body language.  Never turned toward my direction, looking away at black walls when walking by, hand gestures over mouth and face, very obvious stuff. I was planning to meet with that person and talk, but the person kept on avoiding me, and still to this day. I have asked friends on what's that person's problem, and I started to realize how much of a native, pandering, abusing shithead I was acting as. 

The native part was believing that person was a good friend to talk to about serious stuff. Why that person is successful is because they avoid a lot of troubling topics to focus a lot on their work. Me forcing answers from them was not helping, making me a representation of what that person wants to avoid. Also, because I looked up to them on what to be, I mistakenly put that person on a higher pedestal that the general people (friends &amp; family) that genuinely cared about me. 

The pandering part was the fact that I was basically forcing myself and that person on having conversations with. Before the craziness, we were just casual student friends who don't really have much to say to each other. We didn't hate or dislike each other, just saying hi to each other and that was it. I still wanted to be that person's friend honestly since that person was doing something right getting connections and networking with important people, and I wanted to know how. 

The abusing part was that I was technically forcing that person on talking with me during that person's summer internship. Even though I did tell that person that they can refuse helping me since they are busy, but with the heavy situation I experience, I ""used"" my experience of loss to force answers out of the person. It's like the scenario that people make other people feel sorry/pity for them and they feel like they need to help, whether out of kindness or that it's socially acceptable. I was talking with my best friends, and they admitted that person contacted them on the side that they don't want to talk to me anymore since they don't know what to say. My friend did say that person's message was worryed-sounding than annoyed-sounding, but the fact that I was forcing someone who didn't want to talk to me and only helped out of pity make me realise I've done something what a sick abuser would do. 

And the shithead part was that I didn't contact the people who genuinely cared about me and my mental health, and prioritized that person over them just because of that person's success than personal connection with me. It was SO obvious that there was other people to talk to. People who experienced death, people who are thoughtful, people who have time, people who want to help with anything they can because they want to. I was so stupid to fool myself that person was a ""better friend"" over my true friends, and that I made that casual-relationship with that people so worse than it had to be. Luckily the friends I have are very understanding and have shown that they really care about me with what I do and who I am, and that they want me to improve on myself with moving forward. We are still the best friends we ever have, and I'm happy and proud that I am friends with them.

I may have answered the question I have, like I should have stayed away from that person from the beginning; I did have early suspicions that person had narcissism issues, but that person's success made me overlook that fact. I genuinely wanted to be friends with that people because of their vigor and effort, and offered files of valuable tutorials I found online for free (I offered the same files for other people who needed it and who were close friends of mine, so it's not like I only focused on that person all the time), but I can see that I was stupid to not realize that I was being taken advantage of, and I stupidly tricked myself that I was a friend to that person, and that I shared too much to that person which led to that person shunning me. I'm so deep in this complication. 

I'm asking if there is a way to deal with this situation. The program is small, so I always pass by that person at least once a week, and everytime that person appears, I feel embarrassed and sad. Sometimes I have to be in a certain place, and with the small program, that person has to be there too. Next semester is going to be that person's last semester before graduating, so it's a good chance that I'll never see that person again in a long time. And if anyone (still reading) is willing to roast on me on what I should of done, I implore on doing that too so I don't make this mistake again in the near future. Hopefully, I'm lucky on noticing this early since I haven't graduated yet, and that I still have time to learn how to act and think with certain people whether in a company or in public in the near future. I seem to have this rooted belief that I ""should"" value merit more than personality, but after this situation, I believe that I'm uprooting that belief out of my mind for good.

a5v67t,335,2018-12-13,Final Exam Stress,nerdrium,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/a5v67t/final_exam_stress/,"Happy children of the future--

I came to school here in 1987 after attending a large suburban (of Chicago) high school. In high school we had a lot of opportunities, like AP classes and such. My senior year we were offered AP Calculus ""AB"" and AP Calculus ""BC."" AB was basically Calc 1 taught over a whole year, and BC was Calc 1 first semester and Calc 2 second semester. I took BC. I did not do well on the AP test and did not get college credit.

So I still had to take a calculus class here on campus, and my sophomore year I signed up for Calc 1, which was Math 120 at that time. I already took Calc 1 and Calc 2 in high school, so it should be easy peasy, right? The long and short of it is I got a D. And a D in Biol 110. And a D in Chem 102B. I dropped out of college for a bit, ran a bar, got married, and went back to school and completed my degree. Then I got another bachelor's degree. Now I also have a Master's in Computer Science. And a kick-ass job. And a great wife and family. Why am I telling you all of this?

I \*know\* finals are stressful. I \*know\* there is lots of pressure to get good grades. I \*know\* you want to do well for your parents. I \*know\* you want to get a good job, or internship, or go to graduate school. 

But ten years from now it won't matter. It will matter even less 20 years from now.

So please, do your best over the next 8 days, but don't beat yourselves up too much. And if you need to talk to someone please call the counseling center -- 333-3704. Or if it is after hours call the crisis line at 359-4141. And if you feel like you want to harm yourself, please call 911. There are people out there that are there to help YOU. It gets better. I PROMISE. Even if you get a D in Calc 1. 

Best of luck to you all, and have a wonderful holiday break! "

I dropped out junior year after getting kicked out of private school for low grades, and then started attending public school to finish Junior year, but was so depressed I just gave up and took my GED.  I thought maybe I should go into community college right after dropping out so I did, for two semesters, in which I left with a 0.0 gpa (no, thats not a typo).  I dropped of course and then I eventually found a great job to get me started out in life. A restaurant job. I started out at the bottom working part time as a host, and over several years worked my way into part time management and bartending.  I was fed up with it though at that point. I didn't want to spend my 20s working in a restaurant and then getting drunk at the bar next door. I wanted to do something and have a more predictable career (also wanted to get as far away from an ex gf but thats a different story for another time).  

I moved back in with my parents and started attending community college again. I chose Computer Information Technology w/ concentration on programming. It's not a traditional CS, It's more like a bootcamp, but with accreditation and my credits will transfer to most in state universities. 

My first semester was... average.  I passed and that was just a big enough milestone as it is.  

My next semester was my first successful semester. I didn't get below a B.  From then I knew I could do this, and started taking school very seriously

The following semesters till now I've taken rigorous schedules in order to repair my GPA.  

As of now, my GPA stands at a 2.97, and if my last class I'm waiting on ends up being an A (Which it should be) I'll break the 3.00 threshold, the highest GPA I've ever held in school ever.

But even better news, I just received my first internship offer! I'll be interning at a company I've always dreamed of working at.  I'll be doing software development. The company is no google or facebook, but you've heard of them.  

It's been a journey and a half.  I have one more semester plus this internship and I can make the decision to transfer to a 4 year (already accepted to the school I want to go too) or start with full time employment.  I'm leaning more towards FTE as it is right now as I really need to get working. But just having these options in my life is just amazing. "

The thing is that the manager kinda offhandedly told me that I might be sideloaded into other teams as a software engineer and I'd essentially be working on two teams, in two roles, at the same time. Now I'm actually happy about this since I wanted to switch into a SWE role sooner or later, but 70k feels like way too little if I'm working two roles. They haven't sent me the physical offer yet (only a verbal confirmation), but I do want to negotiate to market value, or at least about 80k. How I should follow up with them?

The app got a demo fairly early on that was received well. I then spent the next few months making it much more robust and extendable but unfortunately it never got used or even a second demo and I was put on building a web app that basically did the same thing.

Now I'm applying to jobs and I get asked  asked about my previous internship in interviews because it's the most recent and technical (SRE). This hasn't happened so far but I'm afraid someone will ask me why I didn't just continue? And this could imply/insinuate incompetence. And I don't know how to deal with it if that happens...

2. There is absolutely no diversity and I dont even mean black white asian hispanic. Everyone is literally a graduate from Stanfart, MITtens, Carnival Mellon, Barkley, they all spend their time playing league of legends after work and giggling over stupidest shit.

4. Constant status quo. Even though there are a million ways to approach a problem, people look down on you if you dont have a minilaptop and youre constantly coding every where you go

What that means is that as far as college has been for me, I've been able to code full stack applications to a ""good enough"" level. I'm not in a REAL computer science program, but I excel at the minor which tries to teach general level coding to all majors. I have a general understanding of data structures and algorithms and can do LeetCode questions up to medium, albeit a lot of struggle. I just completed a SWE internship and in my final evals, my manager told me that my coding skills were weak but they still wanted to keep me on the team. My manager explained it to me as them taking a huge risk on hiring me and getting backlash from higher ups due to my hiring (woops). Over the past semester, I've passed coding challenges and gotten to the first rounds for big-Ns and reached the final rounds for SWE positions here and there. I didn't get a single offer throughout all of new grad recruiting except for my return offer. My return offer has a slightly below average salary for the area and is at a financial services corporation where the teams are much older and the projects are less ""exciting"". Not a bad offer at all and one that I am very grateful for having. But I want more out of my post grad life, a lot more.

I'm very much considering going to a boot camp after I graduate - preferably one that may be in a tech hub like NYC or SF/West Coast in general. They're my dream cities to be post grad (I've become bored of my home state - Texas). However, I'm unsure if doing a bootcamp is the best idea because I already have a pretty decent coding background and experience already. Should I fork over $17k to get the connections and job placement assistance so I can achieve a high salary, big prestige, tech company, etc. -OR- should I take the slow pace and learn on my own and hope for something better over time?"
a60zuf,1,2018-12-13,Need advice deciding between two internship choices. Thanks in advance!,SeeTheWorld12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a60zuf/need_advice_deciding_between_two_internship/,"Hi all. First time posting on this sub, but want to say thanks in advance for any advice. To preface, I am a senior biomedical engineering major (computer science minor) who is planning to complete a 1-year MS in computer science the following year. I want to look into software engineering positions and gain internship experience, as I've only had research experience in prior summers. I hope that this would prepare me well for a full-time recruitment during the following year, after obtaining my MS in CS.


Right now, I have 2 offers I am deciding between.


Company A is a in a low CoL city, and I have already accepted their offer given that it was from earlier this recruiting cycle and I didn't have anything else at the time. The role is not specifically software engineering, and it sounds more of an internal consultant role that coordinates between development teams (so maybe PM-ish?). The company is a well known credit card company, and their internship is pretty good from what I've heard, but it's likely not possible for me to switch into another team if I want to do something software related.


Company B I just received an offer from. They are located in a higher CoL city, and they gave me the option to pick between several teams in their technologies department. They are also a big company, but in the biomedical industry. I think this place may be a better fit for me, since it would combine my biomedical experience with software, and it would be cool to explore a new city for a summer.


Both total compensations are the same, but the CoL is significantly higher for Company B.

TLDR:
Company A: accepted already, low CoL, familiar with city, not software engineering role

Company B: offered a position, high CoL, new city, software engineering role (possibly better for future)

Compensation is not the biggest factor for me, but rather good experience and meaningful work that sets me up for better career options in the following years.

I’ve been an intern for this company for the past three months, and will start as a full time employee next week. The plan when I was hired in September was to hire me as an intern, then bring me on full time after I graduate. 

I had the full time transition talk with two of my bosses today, and while mostly everything went as expected, I was really discouraged when they informed me that I would remain at my current pay as an intern. I know junior developers in my area start out around 55k-60k a year, and with my current wage I might earn about 40k. 

To be honest, over the past three months I haven’t exactly been a “rock star” developer, but I felt that I’ve learned enough to warrant some kind of increase in pay. I’m certain I’ve made a few mistakes that pissed off some of the other devs, but I always do my best. What really has me upset is that I kind of view this as a reality check, like I’m worth even less to the company than I think I am. 

I really love this company, and I would very much like to stay here. We’re a very small shop (fewer than a dozen people) and I’ve really enjoyed my time with this company over the past three months.

Do you think it’s reasonable for a new grad to expect some kind of pay increase when becoming a full time employee? These are good people, but I feel hurt by their decision to not regard me as a real full time employee. I’m not sure what to do, and I’m curious if anyone else has ever been in this situation.

Thanks everybody"

I purposely chose a school 3000 miles away from them and it's the only reason I haven't transferred out of this school I'm miserable at. My parents believe that because I'm their daughter, my life belongs to them. They pay for my schooling and I live at home. I really, really want to get a well paid job but my parents push me to get unpaid internships since they think it'll lead me to a better future. If I go out and get a job, they will verbally bash me and shame me out of that decision. 

They always require my phone location (Find My Friends) and if I stop sharing it, whether because I chose to or because of bad reception, I get increasingly angry texts which are followed by phone calls.

My parents will yell at me when I do anything that is upsetting to them. They yell at me to the point where I think it's easier to end my life than to actually put up with them. They've caused me so much self hate and shame and doubt. They think they're the best thing to ever happen to me.

I really enjoy being away from home while at college so I don't need to talk to them. I don't try to talk to them because the phone calls always end stressful. But I'm going home in a week for winter break. I would stay on campus and work, but my long distance boyfriend is at home. He's probably the only reason I go home. I'm getting so miserable thinking about having to live under their roof while writing this.

I want to threaten that they will never meet their grandchildren and they will hardly get to see me once I move out, but my parents and brothers are the only family I have in the states. But they're also unreasonably strict with where I am, who I'm with, and when I come home. I've tried to stand up to them and tell them how they make me feel - yes I've told them that their verbal abuse has made me suicidal - but all that has resulted from those conversations is being shamed for being a bad, ungrateful daughter because they're ""perfect"" parents.

I had showed up the day earlier to make sure I didn't go wrong. it has happened before, so while it may seem a bit overly cautious it makes total sense to be extra prepared. I was turned away by the dorr admissions guy.  He was not at all security, but kind of, in the role. I then found a back door in and just walked the halls to see how the school were. I don't think I was noticed, but some students definately looked at me. not sure if weirdly or just because I was overdressed in a suit. Difficult to tell. I would get two days impression out of it. an off-staged view. cool thing right?

On the next day,

When I got to the door initially, I was asked to hand in my passport. I found it and handed it in. I was told to wait in the canteen upstairs.  I asked the secretary on the  canteen floor ""when I would get my passport back"", because I knew that this kind of things was illegal as hell. The secretary had to walk me downstairs and ask the admissions manager to hand in my passport. apparently, I was the only one who was asked that. adn all the other students were waiting in that hallway. It seemed like he was trying to prevent me from attending.   


finally we were escorted to a small classroom. With a path down the middle between tables.I stoo there for a while wondering where to sit. I sat down on the right front row, just next to the path. some 18 people arrived, and no one sat down on my row. idk maybe it was the naturally pathing. maybe I looked like an intern.

&amp;#x200B;

the teacher told me that ""I looked older"". And I was a bit surprised, but unknowningly told him I was 26. 

he commented that most students started at age 19. or 18.   


NO ONE told me in my life that there was an age restriction on bachelors degree admisions. ever. and all I have heard in the media is the dream stories where a 40-year old mom gets admitted into law and passed. or the 52 year old guy studying electronic engineering. and especially here in Denmark, there is a culture for taking 1-2 gap years. 

&amp;#x200B;

so afterwards there was a tour witha student. I was a bout to get a tour from a young italian girl, when the femal student admissions manger told me there was a girl who spoke danish and asked me if I wanted to get a tour in danish. I looked perplexed and asked, half-wittingly "" can I have both?"". 

at the time it was funny, but in retrospect it seemed a little like a pervert. idk. I don't know what to think. 

&amp;#x200B;

at the end I asked to speak specifically with  a student aadmissions councellor. the one I had made an appoitnment with. apparently she had gone home!

so I got to speak with the guy who gave the initial presentations and told me I looked older. 

I showed him my papers, untranslated. he asked me where I wanted to be. I told him in the city, and maybe for one of the bigger investment or accounting firms. he told me I needed to be clearer. know where I was going. I named some companies. but he told me that because the companies look for interns who are no older than 25 upon graduation, I was too old. 

technically he might have been true. But that would mean I would be too old for every education ever. and I refuse to believe that.

&amp;#x200B;

a year later, I went to the capital to talk with a masters admissions manager. they also had brochures and was expanding. again, I had asked to meet in person a bit before.

when I got to the hotel, my stupid brain made me ask the door man. he said he would call her up. it semed like a fine hotel and I thought the presenters stayed there for the fair/conference. I went to the bathroom. no one were waiting for me. so I asked at the hotel desk. who guided me to the people who handled the fair. for some reason the fairs registration process had issues. I had to register all over. and I told them I had an appointment. The two young women IGNORED ME and guided me into a small hall where a panel was answering questions. I didn't want to cause a rucus so I just sat dwon and emalied the woman with whom I had an appointment with.   


overall, I have made bad first impressions with everyone I talked with at the university. and while I could have avoided some of it, there are thigns I did not foresee. when do you ever need to hand in a passport?  I WAS ON THE LIST. why didnt the admissions manager at the copenhagen hotel name specifically where at the hotel she would be?

and why did I dress up in a black suit? why did I not just call the admissions manager? f\*\*k!

I genuinly wanted to make a good impression at this university but I feel super defeated. Like I hosuld just give up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get it. I am a tall white male. with perfume and styled hair. on the second time I was wearing some very light makeup to cover red spots on my face. I had plucked eyebrows, wrote out english resumes for this international university.

what did I do wrong?"

I am graduating in April, and have been applying for jobs recently for engineering positions.  I have \~2 years full time work experience repairing mechanical equipment (but never had an actual ""engineering intern"" position, due to financial reasons).  I have a 3.7 GPA (out of 4), worked part-time throughout my degree, and have held multiple leadership roles on student engineering design teams and within student groups.

While applying for jobs to hopefully have something lined up by May, I have stumbled upon a few postings that are for engineering positions in remote, rural areas.  I grew up in a town of 1500 people, and hated every minute of it.  However, as I have never held an engineering intern position, I am wondering if applying to these places would be my only chance at landing a job.

I still hope to find a job in a city, but I was wondering, in your opinion, is it worth it spend the time to apply to the rural area (and hate my daily lifestyle for 3-5 years) in order to get experience in the workforce?  I was just wondering if anyone moved to a location for work that they thought they would hate, and it ended up not being so bad?  Or did you utterly regret your decision and count down the days until you got to leave?

Overall, I would be more than willing to relocate to any town/city with &gt;10,000 people, but am hesitant to purposefully fall back into the lifestyle that I hated for the majority of my life.  At the same time, I am also nervous that my desire to stay in a larger population centre will prevent me from getting an engineering job due to lack of ""direct"" experience.  

Would appreciate any thoughts/experiences! :)"

I am a younger employee in my late 20s - slightly above entry level. I work for a small company and was hired to do creative work for the marketing team. However, a week or two after starting, I was informed that the office assistant recently quit and that I’d be taking on her tasks until a new one could be hired. They don’t have any good prospects for this position, so it could be months until the new person comes on. I’ll also be responsible for training the new person.

The problem is:
 I have no  real experience doing admin work. As I mentioned, I’m in the creative side of marketing, not the business side, so I ’ve never been a marketing coordinator or anything. 
Sure, I’ve done stuff like this as an intern... but at this point in my career, I haven’t been an intern in several years. I am at the point where I’d like to be taken more seriously and now have the knowledge and experience to actually contribute to the company. I don’t want to get the defacto role of intern. 

Additionally, the number of admin tasks that I have seems to be growing exponentially. It’s starting to eat into my time to do my actual work. It’s almost like doing two jobs... but also, I’m only being paid to do one. 
I also smell a whiff of sexism about this whole situation (I work in tech and there are very few other women in my office...and I am the youngest)...but I digress.

Anyways, Im okay with filling in for a bit until the new person is brought on, but I want to set some boundaries. I also don’t want to come across as someone who “thinks their too good” [to do admin work] ...I just don’t want to get boxed into a role that I didn’t sign up for and that I don’t think is really a good match for my skill set.

Any advice on how best to go about this?

TL;DR: basically asked to take on a “second job” within my job with no pay increase. How do I set some boundaries without ruffling any feathers?"

I've been in the IT field for more than 15 years, with a BS in computer systems engineering. Most of my jobs have been from Helpdesk to IT support, then the last 8 years as System/network administrator.

A few years ago I took a step back and a pay cut and decided to move into the  education system, to gain extra time but while stil doing all the  sys admin task (from 7 to 3pm plus Summers off). Then I also went back to get my Masters in science of IT and got interested in a couple of subjects like Machine learning, cloud computing (AWS), and digital forensics because of that. 

As a hobby I've been playing with arduinos and 3D printing and that developed my interest in robotics... but even when I understand most of the programming concepts I was never fully invested in any programming language (I do the occasional bash/batch script for the job and some basic Arduino) but coding is not my forte. 

Here lays my dilemma, I had the plan to look for a position as an IT director for a school district and my master was the key to get one but now I see there's ton of possibilities that I'm interested ( ML, Cloud computing and even robotics) all of them uses tons of programming (someone recommended  me to get sharp in Python) but I'm not sure I enjoy coding as much as I enjoy the hardware part at least with arduinos .

I enjoy the sys admin task, troubleshooting, creating technology plans and develop them.
This is my question, Is there any specific field or position (even internships as I still will have next summer off) that I could do to gain experience in programming, hardware robotics but that the company values my previous experience? What would the name of such position be? Do you have any examples? How do you recommend I should utilize the extra time I have ?  My perfect plan would be to find a new job that will pay similar to a sys admin but with the hopes that will transition into something related to robotics. I hope you get the main idea of my question... Where to go now without being in a Jr position.

As soon as I started in February I met a student that got me interested in web development. I was super passionate about learning to make web applications connected to database that would be useful. We made a web application to manage book lending to students in PHP and MySQL.

I found a job as an intern at a company that wanted someone that could move their data to an SQL database. I applied and took the job, noting that that company has no other programmers. I ended up making a bunch of python scripts that upload data from various sources/computers to a database hosted on Azure ,first cleaning the data,making necessary summarizations/calculations then uploading it to Azure SQL/Blob Storage. I then created a web application hosted in Azure that I coded in PHP. That automates reports and lets them keep track of processes going on in the business and lets them visualize their data / combine data for analysis using google charts and such.

Given that I have a break of a month for school, and will have free time on the weekends because of it, I am trying to decide if I should transition my entire project to C# as i want to be competent in developing enterprise applications and because I think the PHP language doesn't have enough rules like c++ or java, OR if I should instead focus on refactoring all my PHP code to make it easily maintainable, should I try using a PHP framework to use MVC principles. As I am self-taught I am sure my code is not maintainable to anyone else but me but I may be wrong as I have no one to review my code.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Im planning to specialize in software security (have no education before what so ever) and just finished my math studies (pretty basic shit but enough for my education). 
I've always liked computers and solve problems, I'm not hard core at all but I think it's fun. 
My problem is that I'm not really good at math and I wonder how much math the job require? 
Will it be like any other Job; learning by doing or will it be like taking every math class all over again everyday? 

I know math can be part of the job but exactly how much of it? I'm think about getting an internship or something just to get some knowledge but until then, some advice please. 

Does anyone here work with high security?

Originally background was chemical engineering, and got an undergraduate degree. After that, I got a graduate degree from cs. Degree didn't help me to land a cs job, and because of my chemical background, I found a job in a clinic. After a year working in that clinic, I found I love coding better than talking to people diagnosing. So I quitted. But when I went back to the market and tried to find a cs job, I found a new obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot apply for new grad position jobs and it is hard to apply for entry-level jobs as well!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Because I have left school for over a year so that I cannot be categorized as a newly graduate anymore, so new grad jobs are NOs. And most of the entry-level position that I saw asked for typically 1-year experience, of course, I don't have(actually I did intern during my last semester when I was at school, and I did have 3-4 months experience). I saw some junior positions that asked for the same work experience as entry-level positions.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to change my situation here and work in cs field. I did some research and found I can go to the so-called consulting company, and they 'polish' your resume and send you to work as a contractor. Or do I go back to school and apply for those internships again and try to convert them into full time?"

&amp;#x200B;

* Isn't cutthroat
* Is in a good area, lots of things to do, good restaurants, etc..
* Like Rice, has good student policies which reflect an administration that cares about its students (closed-door policy, residential colleges)
* Facilitates networking, lots of internships, especially in tech fields
* Has a diverse student body that isn't solely focused on academics (no Georgia Tech)
* Decent/good name recognition for employers
* Not horrible dorms, I really like the Rice suite system that they have in their residential colleges, for example

Right now I am looking at a lot of schools, including UCLA, UCSD, UMN Twin Cities (already accepted), Case Western, UWash, and UWash St. Louis, but I don't really know enough about any of these schools to get a good idea of where I want to go. I understand that no matter where I go, I should make the most of it, but I would like to find a good fit for me. Thanks!

I've just been offered a junior analyst position and am wondering about the average salaries for this kind of position. I just finished a master's in data science and have extensive research experience but no corporate experience. I initially applied to their paid data analyst intern position (\~17$/hr) but the junior analyst position became vacant less than a week ago so they instead offered that to me considering my educational level. Anyways, as I studied in Europe and have not worked in my field state side yet, I need some guidance on what type of yearly salary I should be aiming for. This would be a purely data-based job in the automotive industry if that can be of any help for recommendations.

Presently, I have two choices:

1. I am wondering if I should extend my research period to 8 months and leave the summer intern. This would supplement goal is to do quality research before the application period comes (for admission to grad school). 

2. Or if I should continue with my current plan. A software dev intern would give me a chance to be a better programmer which is also important for CS research.

My end goal is to be a Data Scientist (eventually).

I’ve got a 3.5+ GPA and have done some CS work (UI building &amp; text data mining) in a biology lab. I didn’t get around to doing a summer internship, opting to take summer classes instead.

I’ll be attempting to apply to a graduate program for Data Analytics with a software focus beginning in Spring 2019; advertised 100% job placement following its completion. It’s a short, 1-2 year program at a credible university. I’m confident I’ll be able to get in, however I have some concerns:

-Is it likely or possible to obtain a summer internship even after I’ve graduated with a B.S.? (Yes, I am applying aggressively and tracking applications via a spreadsheet)

-How can I boost my application towards a summer internship? Would developing a mobile app help me in a relevant manner?

-Generally speaking, would it be better to have 2+ years of work experience prior to pursuing a master’s program?

-Will a lack of job experience reflect poorly on a grad school application?

For the job I want as a a data scientist, applicants typically have a master’s or Ph. D. A grad program is therefore allegedly a must. I was planning on completing the grad program and spending a few years as a data analyst (less freedom, more redundancy, less developing novel solutions than the scientist) prior to applying for my coveted role. ANY insight into the path I’m attempting to lay out would be phenomenal.

a6hxc6,202,2018-12-15,My laptop doesn't need an airbag,MarkTheCiscoGod,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/a6hxc6/my_laptop_doesnt_need_an_airbag/,"Hello everybody. This is my first post on this forum and i have been reading it for the last 2 days.

I did know that this forum existed but didnt really take my time to read it. Now that i'm in the same situation as you guys i will share more stories when something happens. 

I have been working in techsupport for about 10 months now and loving it so far. First i was an intern there for my study but now im working there parttime next to my new study. The work is not frustrating because the systems we have work reliably and good so we dont have alot of issues with that. its also quite varied because of it. Aside from helping people with issues all day we also setup some new stuff or try to make things even better for the employees. This is why it doesnt get repetive for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So let me first declare my PHP variables because otherwise i will get flamed by you guys ;).

$me = me ofcourse duh...

$employee = the employee in question

&amp;#x200B;

Alright now that i got that out of the way let me get to the story at hand.

So my day started like every normal day with looking at new problems that occured. Then i got called by one of the employees

&amp;#x200B;

$me: Good morning how can i help you?

$employee: Hi could i come by the IT department so you guys can take a look at my laptop battery. It doesnt charge anymore. Also something in my laptop got swollen and i dont need an airbag in my laptop so i already fixed that.

$me: Yeah sure you can come by. I'll have a look at it and in worst case i can always replace the battery. But how did you actually fix that swollen part

$employee: Great that i can come by. So the part where the touchpad is located got swollen and it got so bad that i couldnt close the lid of my laptop anymore. At that point i opened up the laptop and saw 3 small things swollen that pushed the touchpad up. I didnt need an airbag in my laptop so i grabed a knife and sticked it in there to try to fix the swelling. The first one went good but with the second one some liquid came out and some air. the liquid kinda burned on my hand but the swelling went away so i was happy. Then when i put it back together my battery didnt charge so that i why i call you.

$me: OK right well that thing where you sticked the knife in is the battery and that liquid is battery acid. So that is the reason why it doesnt charge. That burning is because there is battery acid in a battery which is toxic and also quite flammable.  So the next time this happens just swing by the IT department and we'll replace the battery for you. You can come now and i'll see you in a bit.

$employee: Oh that is why it burned. Well i didnt know that was the battery and i thought i had fixed it myself. I'll come by in around 5 min.

$me alright i'll see you then.

$employee: later

$me: later

&amp;#x200B;

When i hung up the phone i was laughing a bit and said to a collegua: ""This guy is something really. i'll tell you later"".

&amp;#x200B;

After 5 minutes the person in question came in and showed me the laptop. I could see that it was a little bit damaged because of the swelling but it was in good shape, He also told me that the laptop has been to another support store one time when he was in Manilla ( philippines ) for a bussiness trip. 

When i busy with opening the laptop i noticed that it had 12 torque screws. those very small ones. unfortantely 2 of them where exhausted which sucked. The employee was standing next to me and said ""Oh i have a have something for that"". He went away and 5 minutes later he was back with a drill.  ""If the screw doesnt want to work we'll force him"" and he drilled those 2 tiny screws with a big drill. Maybe i should have stoped him at that point but he seemed handy enough with that and was very nice and humble. after 10 seconds both of them where out and i could replace the battery. When i closed it again and turned it on the laptop was working fine again. He said thank you and went away. I was kinda baffled and had to laugh about what just happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was my story for this time. Let me know your toughts on it and maybe i will make more posts from now on.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a computer engineering student that graduates in a year (meaning I will be a senior starting next semester).

So I applied to a few internships a little before last summer and I could not land any. I have a portfolio with projects (I'm building another project this winter to spruce up my resume) and I am now realizing that I really need to land a job by the time I graduate it. The thought of being unemployed after all that work freaks me out. Unfortunately, I don't have any experience directly related to engineering (mostly retail and customer service jobs, although I have worked at electronic stores), so I am little worried about finding something by the time I graduate.


During this winter break, I'll have a lot of free time. Should I apply for internships now ? Or will my application be buried because it is the holiday season ? Should I wait until Spring to do this so the ""timing"" is better ?


Should I apply to jobs instead of internships ? As most of us know, internships are extremely competitive, more so than jobs (yes, it does really feel like this, and frankly I think I am correct). Should I apply to jobs only instead of internships? I am looking to be employed by the summer or my last semester (will have 2-3 classes in my last semester).


Any advice is appreciated. Thank you

Though my GPA is a bit low, I was hoping the rest of my application would compensate. I have done CV/ML research throughout all of my undergraduate years with a very well known advisor in CV. My first author publications include 1 ICML conference paper and 1 CVPR workshop. My non-first author pubs include 2 CVPR conference papers and 2 NIPS workshops. All-in-all 3 conf papers and 3 workshops, but only 1 first author conference work :/ . Hopefully not bad. I have completed 3 ML/CV/NLP research engineering internships (including one in high school) at top 5 tech companies (e.g. Facebook) and recently my Junior year Summer, an ML research internship (hard to get as an undergrad, this was a PhD position at a top 5 company).

What I'm mostly hoping for is that my connections and publication record pull me through. I will have 1 strong rec from academia (my well-known CV advisor) and 1 strong rec from industry (my research manager). I will also probably submit another academia recommendation, but it will be weaker than these two. I know a decent number of professors holding joint positions at university and industry labs (e.g. Jitendra Malik at FAIR), and am hoping that this may give me an advantage in some admissions committees.

Is my GPA high enough to still be considered by these top programs? Are my connections enough to pull me through? Do admissions committees care about research internships?

How do I know the choices I am making in my college/career life will help me or truly reflect what I enjoy (versus what I think I should enjoy)? 

I am a senior in college and I am majoring in public health and minoring in Biology. I'll introduce little timeline of majors/internships I've had to give you an idea of what I've explored in college: 

1st Yr- Biochemistry, got average grades. Mental health was terrible, lost alot of weight.

1st Summer: Worked in prestigious lab, great opportunity but I hated it.

 2nd Yr- Cont'd with Biology- took orgo, passed...but it was too difficult...too damaging to my mental health -&gt; figured I should explore healthcare, switched to Public Health on a pre-nursing track 2nd semester of 2nd year.

2nd Summer: Worked as a Phlebotomy tech.. felt I wasn't challenged enough mentally...it was just all technical/procedural stuff, so I got bored of it. Also noticed my technical skills sucked, anxiety was reflected in my tremors.

3rd Yr: Still PH and finished Biology minor, took science courses I loved...genetics/microbiology and stuck with the nursing path 

3rd Summer/now: worked as an ED scribe amongst NPs/PAs/Doctors and I love it. 

4th Year: Almost done with my major but after working more in the ED, I've seen how nurses get treated and the tension they are always under and I'm regretting not exploring other careers. I also realized just how high-risk medical careers and am I'm not sure if I can handle the pressure of hurting someone by mistake. As much as I want to help, I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to be a nurse. 

I got an amazing internship coming up in healthcare management at one of the best hospitals in the country next semester, but my fears now are holding me back. I just want to figure out my plan now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been really upset with myself the past 2 months because I've seen my college peers grow within their majors from freshmen year and they absolutely love it and enjoyed their internships. However, I could not tell you where I see myself 5, 10 years from now. I thought about teaching science because out of all the classes I took in college, the biological sciences were my absolute favorite. I also loved tutoring people in microbio and genetics. However, I do enjoy learning healthcare and being in that setting. I wish there was just the perfect job for me. Anyways, I've been on this pre-nursing track for two years and I was so sure I wanted to be a nurse up until now, half way through my senior year :/ despite this, I have heard that the hospital I will be working in offers their interns full time offers afterwards and my professor told me they will pay for most of your Master's in areas like MBA/MHA/MPH for you to succeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm contemplating about doing this prospectively without the intention of knowing what I want to do. The closer I get to graduation, the more anxious I get. I grew up in a household where everyone seemed to know what they wanted to do leaving high-school and stuck with it (Engineers, Pharmacists, Financial Analysts), which always put a pressure on me to stick to one path. My greatest strengths are logical thinking and helping people; I love a career that is very rewarding. My question is......how do I come to find what I want to do in life? How do I know the choices I am making will help me or truly reflect what I enjoy (versus what I think I should enjoy)? Redditors: How did you find what you wanted to do in life? Did you switch majors/careers or have regrets along the way? Thank you for reading this."

I knew that my main goal was to major in computer science but that was about it. I didn't really have any guidance other than my guidance counselor in high school because nobody in my family or friends had ever attended college. When I talk to my advisors at my University it seems they'd rather me leave their office quicker then get me to understand what exactly I'm striving for. 

Essentially I currently am a junior but still have until fall of 2020 to make an impact somewhere, which is when I would expectedly get my bachelor's degree. Maybe later if needed. I only have an overall GPA of 3.2 up from 2.98 from last semester. My major GPA is a 3.0, up from a 2.61 from last semester. To get admitted into the accelerated program for getting a masters degree, I would have to have an overall of 3.3 and a major GPA of 3.5. Ideally I would have these GPAs by Spring of 2020 so I can get admitted in time. I believe these are achievable as long as I kick my behind like I did this semester. However, I'm not too sure if that's all I have to do. One thing I've never really understood was internships and research opportunities. 

Say if I wanted to continue on and get my doctoral degree or just be a better candidate for this accelerated Masters program. Maybe even go somewhere else afterwards. How exactly do I go about getting research opportunities or interning somewhere? Wouldn't those extend my expected graduation date? Our site has a section for research but it really is confusing to me what exactly it means to 'research'. Is it a class? Is it time you don't do classes and only research?

Any knowledge would be extremely helpful. Thank you."

Despite this, I am tasked with getting an internship for the upcoming summer and despite applying to many internship programs at various companies, I have been having trouble landing one. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most frustrating part is that I have a lot of experience programming in Java (2 years), C++ (1 year), Go and Python (3 years) but I have trouble getting my resume to reflect this. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. What are some things that would immediately jump out to a potential employer?
2. What activities could help boost my resume most efficiently?
3. Would getting a Python certificate help (In Data Science or Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence)?
4. How can I best express my experience (with personal projects) in my resume?
5. As someone who is starting a year late (kinda), what is the best way to impress a potential employer?"

Before the job offer (I am a senior currently, did the internship this past summer and got a return offer), I would be constantly doing leetcode/CTCI/side projects/learning new languages/frameworks and acing my classes. But after the return offer, I have rather changed a lot (failed a course, no curiosity in tech). No more burning desire to ""succeed.""

I have also changed in that I no longer like the idea of sitting alone and coding in peace. I have become much more extroverted/outgoing since the confidence boost from the job offer and a bunch of other things this summer. 

My goal originally was to be a software engineer at a big 4 company but after that, now I don't know what I want. I figured senior SDE / principal SDE but neither really give me that same all consuming burning desire to succeed like younger me and the big 4 goal.

a6qnch,4,2018-12-16,Advice on taking a leave of absence or sticking through an extended program,Ritsler,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/a6qnch/advice_on_taking_a_leave_of_absence_or_sticking/,"Hey all,

I'm in a doctoral program for clinical psych in my third year (2.5 years of training) and recently I did not defend my proposal for my dissertation which means that I have to extend the program by a full year, meaning this year basically gets cancelled out. My program is 5 years, with 4 years of class and training and 1 year of internship, so I would basically repeat the third year just working twice a week and working on my proposal/dissertation as opposed to doing all that in conjunction with classes, which would basically be like a break of its own in a way.

Basically my motivation all semester long has been completely shot and I've just felt chronically depressed. I guess it's also worth adding that I've developed a subtle eye twitch (called myokymia) from all the added stress, fatigue, and poor sleep, lol. It shouldn't be permanent, but it's definitely been annoying me. I've been doing well academically but behaviorally have had a lot of shortcomings, mostly related to the fact that I'm not sure if this is really what I want to do with my life anymore. I've realized that I don't like doing therapy all that much, and I'm a lot less passionate than my peers when it comes to their dedication and interest in issues. It's also a real burden to take on the mental well-being of others when you yourself are depressed. I mean, I just hear about the worst things humans are capable of doing to each other on a routine basis.

I have basically been doing the bare minimum to get by, but am decent enough at what I do that I've passed all the benchmarks so far (except for my prospectus defense because I didn't finish it in time).

Taking a leave of absence for two semesters sounds nice, but I would also be moving everything back home (I go to school about 3 hours away) since my apartment lease expires soon, and my concern is that I will be continuing to place myself in a state of limbo in regards to staying in or leaving the program. 

I've been ambivalent about my program the entire time I've been in it, since day one with orientation. I received a late offer after being rejected, and had a hard time deciding to accept it or continue working an okay job with low future prospects. I also was thinking that if I didn't accept the offer, I would never know if clinical psych was the career for me after graduating from college and struggling to find a way to use my BA.

I think the sunken cost fallacy has really come to consume me, where all the time and money invested has prevented me from deciding to leave. I do think there is something else I would be happier doing, but a doctorate in clinical psych would provide a way to earn a living, even if I don't enjoy the work much, and that living may be better than anything else I could do.

However, my program also is not free, meaning I don't get a full ride or anything which makes the decision harder. To finish I would be looking at a continued sizable investment for something I no longer feel a passion for, and may never truly have felt passionate about in the first place. But maybe I'm just being idealistic; when I finish, I could be making $70k starting out, and my back-up plan would basically be looking into Zoology (I've always loved animals) or creative writing (so I can work as a minimum wage barista, lol).

I have met with my advisors, supervisors, and several professors, but it all comes down to whether or not I can see myself wanting to finish the program out, and whether or not I would actually use my degree. The assistant dean told me how she had gone to law school and hated it, but decided to finish in order to use her degree to get somewhere else which worked for her. Having this doctorate would open several doors to me, but it's up for debate about whether those doors are ones I still TRULY want to go through. Being burned out and depressed has also made it difficult to be objective about the whole situation, and part of me has thought that if I'm this depressed about all of it maybe this just isn't the field for me.

I said I was available to switch roles for those two days and that was that.

My fiancee and I have also been planning for months to go out with our friends to this specific gay dance party that happens once every month with our friends. Every month since we've moved here someone had to work or our friends had the kids until this month when it seemed like everyone was free!

Except I didn't realize until the other day that that was the night I had committed to do this other thing.

Because I'm an intern and wasn't getting paid any more to do this thing out of my normal job description it didn't seem like a big deal to try to find someone else to do it. Until it became a massive deal.

My fiancee is so rightfully upset with me for double booking myself on this night she was so so so looking forward to and my coworkers, while they are helping me, are starting to get annoyed.

As I move further into adulthood these mistakes are starting to happen less but it feels like when they do they're a bigger deal. I feel like such a failure both in my professional and personal life and I just want it all to stop. "

I need some advice.,namarino41,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a6tmye/should_i_accept_this_job_offer_or_not_i_need_some/,"Hi everyone. So I'm a senior in college majoring in computer science. I'm in my last semester. Last summer I got my first job in industry, an internship at one of the defense contractors as a Java developer. They work on signals intelligence and are building these systems that aggregate radio frequency sensor results. I continued working there part-time through my first semester this year. Overall, I think I have really struggled. I work very slow and have a lot of trouble understanding the systems we were working with. I ask a ton of questions in order to try to understand my tasks and the systems that are involved, but I feel like I never have a good understanding of what was going on. I sit down every day at my desk and read the code I'm working with, trying to understand where to implement the solution to my task, trying to understand what the system is doing, but just feeling totally overwhelmed and absolutely stupid. I was never assigned any mentor or anything. The very first day, we (the other intern and I) were assigned a task and asked to just go and complete it. I feel like I was just thrown straight into the fire. I try to ask as many questions as I can, but I get the sense I'm interrupting more than anything. And I feel like they often answer my questions in such a way that assumes a certain knowledge of the systems that I just don't have. I come home everyday feeling totally and utterly incompetent. I dread going into work everyday because I feel like everyone is really just questioning why I'm there because I'm definitely the weakest link. It takes me weeks to complete a single task that would take another member of the team a few days, tops.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the summer, the manager told me I struggled. I asked if I could work during the semester so that I could continue gaining experience. At one point, I completed a task that I understood pretty well and he came and told me he wanted to hire me. I was given an offer with a salary of $81k and I have until January 7th to accept it. I don't deserve that. Not in a million years. I've done nothing to deserve such a generous offer. The other intern I was hired with was a rockstar. He completed every task quickly and with no issues. I don't understand why the hell they would offer me something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I know I'm at least somewhat competent. I complete all my school work just fine. I've done some personal projects and I have a lot of fun with them. I sit down, I research, I play with things and I figure it out. But I feel like right now, I'm barely able to focus on the actual code because don't have enough knowledge of the system to even know what the problem is. Pretty much everything is proprietary and I can't figure it out just by Googling it. I have to ask someone. And when I ask, I'll be perceived as being incompetent. And most likely, their answers won't even help because they'll require too many follow up questions.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do? I don't know if this is a problem with me or a problem with the work I'm doing. They are offering really good money here which will be a great way to save over the next year and get off to a really strong start financially for my future family. But I don't know that I'll ever understand what the hell is going on here. And I don't want to be miserable and feel like a total piece of shit every day after work. Should I pass it up and look for something else? If I do, I don't know if I'll find another job that offers that much right now. I'd really appreciate some advice. I don't really have anyone in the industry who I can speak with about these things. Thank you so much."

During my freshman year, I experienced a very intense bout of depression that was quite debilitating. Aside from going to class, I couldn't muster the energy to do anything. I did very little with all of the wonderful opportunities that were around me because I simply didn't have the energy, motivation, etc. necessary.

Anyway, skip to midway through this semester, I've started taking medication for my depression and have regained all of my drive, energy and motivation. Unfortunately, for the past year and a half, I have done pretty much no school extracurriculars (I do have some experience in startups from an internship this past summer) and unfortunately, I can't communicate that through my resume. I really would like to do asset management as it is something I have been interested in and involved with since freshman year of high school. In fact, one of the reasons I came to the school I'm at is because of the incredible opportunities that are offered with regards to clubs, competitions, etc. 

Considering that recruiting for summer 2020 internships starts early next semester, I can't really develop a meaningful involvement in something before then. That said, does anyone have any advice for recruiting with very few extracurriculars and limited finance experience? My GPA is decent, but not high enough to justify having no clubs or anything on my resume. For anyone that's had a similar experience or recruited with few extracurriculars, what did you try to highlight in interviews? A friend of mine who went through recruiting a few years back said that I should try to meet with the recruiter and tell them my story so that they can understand where I'm coming from. I'm considering this because I think that honesty is key in many situations, but I don't want it to come off as if I'm making an excuse."

2. Opportunities - Research, jobs, internships, etc
3. Curriculum and course syllabus
4. What is a doable GPA and what is a good one?
5. If I didn't enjoy the hardware/physics aspect of computer engineering, how difficult would it be to transfer to Computer Science?"

A little background: I am a first-year undergrad and have been trying to cold email looking for a local internship w some pwm firms. In the email I think I made it clear I was looking for an internship op.
 
Well, a partner at a smaller firm got back to me and said he would be “happy to talk to me” and asked if I would send over my resume. I told him my availability and we set a date. 

Now I know it’s important to network meet people in the industry, but as the date is approaching I fear I might drive an hour, show up in a suit ready to interview and be told he thought I was just looking to ask him some basic questions. 

I’m thinking about reaching out to him again to touch base on what really this is going to be. Am I overthinking this? Will I come off as presumptuous if I show up ready to interview for a position? I think I made it pretty clear I was looking for an internship, I even had employment opportunity in my subject lol. 

Thanks "

I'm always eager to come home and see my parents because my school work is stressful, but within hours I already want to go back to my real home away from them. All my parents do is fight and complain about money. Mom drinks and is mean to my dad and makes herself the victim, Dad smokes weed and is apathetic. My parent's house is also tiny. And my mom won't get rid of stuff. She still has a Piano out in the living room that has pretty much turned into a coat rack. You can barely walk into my brother's old room; it has all his old shit in there and my mom refuses to throw it out because ""he might want it one day"". My parent's house is in a pretty big city, so my friends from home always tell me how they want to visit this big city and my house but I'd be too embarrassed to show them my childhood home. My parent's work at grocery stores and don't make a lot of money; they never went to college but always mention how they had so much fun during their 20's and 30's and traveled everywhere and partied with rock stars but it just pisses me off. I wish they had their head screwed on right and created a career for themselves so they wouldn't have to struggle so much. I have 3 siblings and I'm the only one who went to college. 

In my major, our very last semester we have to go out on internship. Your internship can be anywhere in the US. Before I thought I would just move back into my parents so I wouldn't have to pay rent but I'm really starting to think twice about that. I don't know if I could do that because I'd literally go crazy. My supervisor mentioned to me about paid internships in rural communities in my state and I am soooo tempted to just do that so I don't have to be with my parents. The only problem is I'd live in a small town where I knew no one away from all my friends and boyfriend. I hate this. I wish I had money and could go anywhere like most of my peers but I can't. I just want to get on with my life. I feel guilty for even being mad at my parents because they have helped me as much as they could throughout the years. Then I hate the fact that money dictates my life like this. ugh. Just needed to get that off my chest."

I'm a first-year undergraduate student at a target university who has been pursuing a career in finance for a while now. I've always been good at math and other analytical sciences, and I'm taking an upper-level computer science class this upcoming semester in hopes of furthering my marketability for potential career options. My personality is fairly outgoing and I enjoy working in teams.

My question for you guys is this: anticipating a career in financial engineering (aspiring to work at a Quant HF of some sort, potentially even running my own in the far future), what should I be doing as of right now and in the near future? I'm currently in three clubs: one volunteering/outreach-based, one investment and technical analysis club, and the club baseball team at my school. I also have an internship lined up this summer to work at a moderately-sized firm near me in a computer science/finance role, mainly for the experience and training. I've been doing a lot of research and plenty of sites have been recommending tapping into my school's alumni database to form connections ahead of competing for 3rd year internships, but is it too early for me to be doing this? 

Also, I'm really confused about what my life will look like after I graduate from undergrad here. Would it benefit me most to be getting some work experience (perhaps in an IB setting if possible) for a couple years before going back to school for a Masters in Financial Engineering or something?

I know I'm pretty ahead of myself, I'm a Type A person who is constantly looking to plan for the future. Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!"

* What is everyday life like?
* How is the food?
* How much time do you get with professors?
* What is the workload like for a CS Major?
* How are the internship opportunities for CS Majors?

a6xgsp,1,2018-12-17,Tuition Debt and Finishing College Help,Fruitypuff,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a6xgsp/tuition_debt_and_finishing_college_help/,"Greetings Everyone, 

This is a good life example and a cautionary tale for those of you in my situation. I was not a very smart decision making kid when I was 17. I wanted to go to college but my mother objected to it, she thought I wouldnt amount to anything and was better off working (I come from an immigrant family). I started applications to universities but ultimately applied to one State Uni that sponsored my HS. I wanted to get away from home and be independent. I took on 5 AP courses by the end of my HS career. I had a 94.8 gpa with honors and AP courses by junior yr and 88 GPA by senior year. Overall I decided to be independent and prove I could do it. I got a 95% full ride to college. Tuition was 50k a year. 

As soon as I got in college I treated it like HS. I did the average required amount of work. I partied. I crammed before exams. I basically got by barely. First time I had trouble catching up by the end, I got hit early on with the fact that in college you have to more or less teach yourself. I barely studied and thus the final exams caught up to me. I withdrew from my major : Engineering.

Transferred to Computer Science: Repeat same as before except this time I had family problems. Parents going through a near divorce. I fell into depression, anxiety, I began to get under the influence to cope with everything. Repeat as before. I transferred to Neuroscience. 

Same as before but this time early in the year I thought my FAFSA had gone through. Get to find out I was missing some paperwork. Continue with Studies even though my college bill hasnt been paid. Continued the school year. Things got worse. I became more and more frustrated with courses. I was already at my junior year. I realized I chose majors based on what would ""pay"" more and etc but I couldnt figure out what I wanted to achieve with my degree. 

I finally withdrew from some courses. Failed to meet the 12 minimum credits for the aemester. Get letter of suspension and letter of overdue bill. 14k in fed loans(havent defaulted and I am paying off). Got back home. Feeling like utter trash. Disappointed in my self. I sent an appeal letter to the dean and honestly reading it years later on, it was incoherent and completely missed the honest part where I basically didnt admit to my own wrong doings. It was denied and rightfully so.

Have been avoiding tuition debt (not federal loans) collections for years and finally, I found inspiration from my younger brother. He is hard working, before college he borrowed my old Java text book and self taught programming. Attends meet ups and reaches out to clubs. Always networking and doing internships. He did everything I completely neglected. He has come out of the system debt free and with actual savings. Was able to pay off his own Mac Book pro on his own, honestly I'm proud. At his age I couldnt even buy myself a pc.

But in this situation I have realized that in the end dont take on a degree, because you think it just pays well. There is a lot that you have to put your part in. Networking, effort, internships and a goal. 

Following in his steps I have started teaching myself coding again. I want to finish my degree, but my first barrier is my tuition debt. While I havent defaulted on my fed loans. I cant continue college without my transcripts, I make 19 an hour and even that isnt enough in the long term. I somehow found a job in corporate but it isnt what I want to keep doing in life. 

I have reached out to my old college to see what can be done. There is no other way around the withholding of transcripts. This time I would rather attend a CC and climb back to a 4 yr college but that lack of transcripts will hold me back. Technically i can do 12 credits in a cc and return to my old college but im still in debt 27k + 5k from collection feed*. Overall learn from my life. What matters might not be your degree (some could beg to differ) but what matters is your outlook, your effort, preparation, and being active in a community, networking, making friends who might help you start your career. Overall I'm in this struggle now, I gave up at one point but the fire has been reignited. Anything else I can do to help my situation?"
a6y5nd,4,2018-12-17,Have i ruined my chances of success? what can i do to reverse bad habits? [a bit of vent as well],dopaminesdontbemean,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/a6y5nd/have_i_ruined_my_chances_of_success_what_can_i_do/,"I recently got diagnosed as an adult (24) and im feeling very frustrated it has taken this long to be diagnosed. Ive had many ADHD symptoms growing up but my parents arnt the type who believe  in the existence of ADHD, and i wasnt either until i did my own research. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The issue is being diagnosed so late ive formed bad habits either because of my ADHD or in response to me ADHD. Ive also formed unhealthy ways of dealing with side affects of ADHD. all this has made really burnt into me that internet quote,  ""Someone once told me the definition of** ***Hell*****: The last day you have on earth, the person you became will** ***meet the person you could*** **have become.” and i feel as though i have really fucked over my potential and success.** 

&amp;#x200B;

examples: i was always very switched on as a kid, to the point i couldnt really switch off this lead to me always exercising and doing physical activity to tire myself out. i have nagging injuries that stem from over training, and i never stuck with any physio work because i simply got bored before they actually worked.

with this i never ate, i either forgot to eat lunch that was packed, or i would forgo cooking because either id get too angsty waiting for something to cook, or forget i was cooking something nearly burning down the house. Thus despite my parents both being tall im barley 5'8. what if good eating and healthy exercise habits were introduced to me? would i not over train until i tear ligaments? would i be taller, stronger? healthier? through actually eating more than 1000cals a day during puberty?

&amp;#x200B;

because i was so switched on and energetic as a kid i would get in trouble alot, this wasnt a huge problem until i went into highschool. going to a private school where my parents sacrificed alot to send me there getting in trouble alot put alot of pressure on my family. further, being energetic and switched on isnt 'cool' in highschool. being nonchalant, brooding and mellow is. from social and family pressures i did would do things to suppress my ADHD. Over training was one of them, but also going to bed late was another. i was chill when i was tired. i was a better person when i was chill. it was therefore logical to live on the cusp of sleep deprivation. But, in suppressing my normal switched on energetic self, i caused my self alot of anxiety, its hard to bottle up all that energy ya know. i also think i was anxious because the pressure of doing things that i felt i wanted to do vs what i knew i shouldnt do

&amp;#x200B;

As i got slightly older i got better at switching off.  the problem was now, it was hard to swtich back on, i feel as though i essentially exacerbated the ADD part in my ADHD. i became very introverted and a 'space cadet.'  if i was switched on i had alot of problems with anxiety, doing things specifically, controlling emotions, BUT i could think faster, clearer, i could if i was interested enough write essays in a night and get good marks. If i was switched off though i was chilled, could control my emotions better, didnt have anxiety as much could do things i was told, but also i couldnt think straight it was like i was watching my life through a lens. 

&amp;#x200B;

as i got older i essentially jsut wanted to be switched off i feel. being switched on when i was a adolescent 16-19 only ever lead to problems. whilst i was smarter i also had many of the control and authority issues associated with adhd. I did things like alcohol and drug addiction to swtich off. I distracted myself with computer games and porn and anyhting esle really. and when i came time at university to switch on, i either could do so last minute and scrape by with a pass or, i couldnt switch on and i would fail. the constant battling with myself, and failing, and failing in many of the goals i set out in my adolescents lead me to perceive myself as a failure. i essentially gave up on life and spiraled into depressive episodes.  

&amp;#x200B;

Im 24 now, and just got diagnosed. im in my last year of uni with a really bad GPA. ive almost been kicked out of uni cuz of my failure multiple times and its taken 7 years so far to do a 5 year degree. the degree im doing is also highly competitive (law) and with my marks ive wasted alot of time and money. I often think if i was diagnosed earlier maybe id have a better GPA. Maybe i wouldn't have failed the goals i set out like getting an internship. Maybe i wouldnt have beaten myself up into anxiety and depression leaving me unmotivated. Maybe i would have been able to form good sleep or eating habits. Maybe i wouldnt have fucked my developing brain with drugs and alcohol in order to hide what i was. I think the real kicker is that the diagnosis seem just a little too late. Like if i was diagnosed 2-3 years earlier i could of rounded out my degree with better marks, i could have formed better habits, maybe i wouldnt of had to spend  months crawling out of depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So my issue is this, i feel as though im past the point in my life where managing and understanding my adhd might help me be more successful. Instead i feel lost going into the world having wasted years of my life. Do i try and run it back now? go back to uni and aim to manage and improve myself the right with in regards to ADHD. if i do, isnt that a bit late? Do i go into any job i can find and try improve myself on the side? after giving up so many times and now having a frail ego and motivation as well as lacking in healthy life skills where do i start in fixing myself? through counseling? recommended books? Has anyone else been diagnosed late in/ their life and managed to reach a potential they feel as though they could have when they were younger?**

Granted, I feel I'm a little over my head since the only websites I've made were simple, and I spent more time reading than doing. Now the tables are turned and I have to make something of value, and I have to do it reasonably fast, so no time to dabble with the latest tech stacks, all while being paid, so I already feel as I am in debt.

While confident in my ability to learn, the one I call my boss doesn't know a thing about what-to-do, and I don't have teammates, so I'm on my own as usual. Although last year I used to intern for a small web dev company who I'm hoping is willing to help me out here and there.

When boss told me he wanted a website to beat all competitors (which we looked at, and that won't be hard, as they're all the same) I originally advised him to consider a professional web-dev company and not a high-school kid, but he insisted and I volunteered. I think he wanted it cheap, but doesn't realize hiring someone who hasn't done this before require them to learn on the job. This is where I ask myself if I should have been more to point, and said maybe you shouldn't hire me and instead hire a professional -- but then again, opportunities are to be taken aren't they?

So to the question, I'm afraid I don't learn the business process of building a website as fast as I should -- after all, this project is all mine and *I* am in charge, honestly that terrifies me. What do? Reach out to the previously mentioned web dev company, definitely. Meanwhile, have anyone here gone through anything similar? What did you do and what do you regret not doing?

I want to make this and I certainly want to do it well; but what the hell, I'm being trusted with flexible hours and the ability to work from home? That reminds me, I have an eerie feeling about the validity of this arrangement. Payment is discussed and agreed upon, but I don't have a contract, and I was asked if I wanted cash or salary transferred to my account -- why cash? So I (but implicitly neither of us) don't pay taxes. That sounds strange, but it looks like such an arrangement is legal under certain circumstances here, and this could fall under one of them since I am not an employed professional. Perhaps that's why he didn't want to hire a web development company to do the work.

Primary goal is building a brand and improving our SEO; We're going to design a book, and so I suggested we make a blog and post articles from said book there to improve our rating."

I recently took a look at few job sites, and found there to be not many Junior positions, only some advanced ones (Front-end Dev + Senior Front-End Dev). 

My initial question is, what are the chances of someone who self-taught how to code with a portfolio against someone with a degree in computer science/software development course? is that a huge deal-breaker? (I have masters, just in different field).

Second question, is what's the best way to break through? Leave your CV with an agency? Simply bombard the companies with an application even when they do not have any positions open?

I don't know if I just didn't study enough or had really bad test anxiety due to freaking myself about transferring. I legitimately couldn't think during the last minutes of one of my finals. I won't be able to transfer now as I'll be right below the gpa cutoff. Is there any possibility to switch still? The thing is, I don't like my major. Not that there's anything wrong with bioengineering but I don't think it's what I want to do and I've fallen in love with computer science and the EECS community at Berkeley. I honestly regret finding out about cs so late lol. I don't really know what to do. I'm worried that my GPA is too low now as a bioengineer and I'm worried that I've fallen a little behind in bioe trying to transfer out. I was going to apply to internships this break for the summer but now I don't know what to apply to since I don't know what major I am and I haven't focused on bioengineering at all.

Is it crazy to keep trying next semester at the risk of falling more behind? I need an A or A- in 61B while possibly taking two other techs. But I feel like I can do better as I messed up a lot this semester. Any advice would help as I have no clue on what to do now.

I recently lost my job at a big tech company and well, I'm sort of floundering to figure out what jobs I even qualify for. I worked in software development and test with agile practices, as well as software lifecycle development. I used company specific languages and tools. I took some CS classes, mainly in C++, and have a concentration in CS/Math. I did take calculus, linear algebra, physics, etc. Just only CS 1 &amp; 2 with C++. I haven't touched that language in about three years though.

  
I have some experience with the open source labs at my college, but I didn't do too much and it was a while ago. I'm currently working on learning python and JS to make myself more marketable. I also like working with computers over people— with regard to sales/customer service. I do enjoy working in teams and with mentors.

  
Speaking of people, my degree is in Political Science. I have experience interning in HS as well as working for Gov't Relations for my college in college. I also won an award for my internship of out 200+ students while working for the New York State Assembly. I really enjoyed the fast pace and running around.   


So I have been marketing myself as software development, but I don't know what I'm really doing. My skills are in some familiarity with Linux and programming. I'm very sufficient in Microsoft/Microsoft Office and Excel. I'm working on two projects in python and JS to learn more. I can adapt to languages quickly enough (as per learning my companies tools/languages) and I am sufficient at research and writing. I'm an active writer and proofreader in my role-playing community, and have even critiqued some resumes in the past for free.  


So I would ask, what career paths are open to me in IT? How can I market my skills to get into the field more? I'm interested in learning as I work as well as on my own time. I just feel very useless with my skills being so specific to one company. I enjoy planning and development more than actual coding itself, but I do enjoy working on projects and writing my own code when the need arises. "

I didn't have as much time to study as I would have liked, and math has always been somewhat of an uphill battle for me. I felt very comfortable during my practice sessions, but the questions on the test were either completely different or tested the concepts in a way that caught me off-guard. My background is otherwise pretty strong: 4.0 undergrad GPA, multiple internships that are relevant to the program, strong recommendations from professors and professionals in the field, etc.

I'm applying to a few well regarded IR programs that aren't all that quant-oriented, but I'm worried that the discrepancy in my GRE scores might drag my application down. None of the schools ask for minimum scores, but they do post averages from the previous semester's admitted class -- my Verbal is a few points above, but my Quant is about 5 points below. It isn't feasible to retake the test at this point, so I guess what I'm looking for is reassurance from people who were in a similar situation and still got into their desired programs.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Solstice (extra point if you get the reference). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to vent and possibly get some advice on my next step regarding my education. I currently am in limbo about finishing my graduate program (Masters). So some background, I stopped working full time in a job that I got immediately after finishing my Bachelor's degree to attend graduate school. I spent almost 1.5 years in the first job as it was something I really enjoyed, but I wanted to specialize in something else within the general area that I had gone to school for. I felt like it would provide some more training and experience in the field. I chose to go to a certain school based on recommendations from former professors, friends, and work colleagues. So I left my job and took an internship in a company that specializes in what I was going to graduate school for and started working on my graduate work. This program really interested me as they had classes in the field that I wanted to learn about and enjoyed. The program touted themselves as the best place to get knowledge in that specific subject. So I took all the classes required in the program as well as the specialization that I went for in the first place. I finished all the classes, even though they were hard and really pushed me to some extremes.

So here is the kicker. The masters program has two options: 1) A thesis if you know you will go the PhD route; 2) A professional project if you will enter the workforce. I chose option 2 as I found out that academia isn't my thing. So I finished all the classes required and started my project, but never finished it. It is the only thing keeping me from being officially done. It was cool to be at school and I learned a lot, but the situation is that school should provide you/me with skills that the job markets is in demand for. One of my goals that I set myself in 2017 for January 2018 was to start applying for jobs so that I would have a career after graduation. So I did. I worked hard at it and I milked every connection I had as well as I used networking opportunities to get some interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been 11 months and 16 days and about 200 job applications and NO JOB to show for it. I have had 17 in person interviews and about 40 phone interviews. I have had plenty of emails and phone calls to let me know they weren't interested. This has been the most demoralizing career experience ever.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a tough year because I want to get ahead in life and focus on what I went to school for. I feel lied to. I went to this specific program to learn specific skills and I can't get a job in the field I went to school for. I have reached out to plenty of school resources to practice interviews skills and to spoof up my resume. But what really killed me was when I reached out to a HR representative for a company I really wanted to work for, they mentioned I did not have the skills or the education for that one position. I died inside. Why? Because I had spent 2 years and $28,000 in loans to go to a program that taught me those required skills, only to have the job market tell me that is wasn't enough. I just couldn't anymore. I reached out to several professors and program directors about my situation and they have all answered the same thing: we promise that if you finish your project, you will find employment. The department has been having inter-academic conflicts for a while that I still hear of rumors and issue within the staff. They recently fired one professor, placed another on leave and then sent another one on ""forced"" sabbatical. These professors taught the majority of the required first year classes that ""make or break"" first year students. Now they are having to outsource their classes to other graduate school programs at the university to make sure students don't fall behind.

So ya, I feel lied to and betrayed by my department and the education I received. I had high hopes for myself that I could land at least one career type job to start building up. But the job market has responded otherwise. Most of my colleagues have obtained good careers and I've asked a good portion of them for job referrals, but all to no avail. So now, what should I do? I have this one project that is keeping me from being ""officially done"" with my masters and professors promising that if I finish it, I will have jobs lined up. I just can't agree with that. I took all the same classes as everyone else. I should have been at least offered something. I've been mostly living off the gig economy, which provides the necessities, but I have to start making student loan payments soon and would like to put into practice what I went to school for. Is it worth spending more money on finishing this degree/project when an entire year of job searching has resulted in nothing?"

It's really the only time I have a chance to do it since I am so dependent on my desktop for school(CS student about to start my Senior year). I can't risk losing data or ruining my development environment for my classes, so I either do it now or this summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 4690k seems to be a pretty massive bottleneck for my gtx 1070 in most games, even when playing at 2560x01440. I'm pretty sick of it, and I can hardly play Hitman 2 it's so bad. However, I can't totally validate what I'm seeing with regards to performance. Is anyone else having older generation processors, especially quad cores, bottleneck their games?

&amp;#x200B;

If I do decide to upgrade, it looks like the 9700k is the way to go. It's a little pricey, but the 8 physical cores seems like a necessity for upcoming titles. I swear my i5 is causing frame timing issues, and since modern game engines are programmed for 8 physical cores it seems like it could be causing it. Therefore I'm against getting the 6 core i5, especially after hearing it was causing frame timing issues in Far Cry 5. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though, it is going to be an expensive upgrade. I have the money, especially with a summer internship looking likely, so I'm not against spending around $750 to upgrade my hardware. I'm struggling to find a motherboard for the 9700k. The best motherboards seem to be coming from Gigabyte with their Auros lineup. I'm looking at the Pro wifi model, especially because it comes with a 12 + 1 phase VRM. Can anyone confirm that this is an okay choice?

Sorry this is kind of long - I’m very thankful to anyone who reads and/or comments!

I just finished my bachelors degree in information technology with a certificate in web design and development. I took my courses online and found this to be beneficial and detrimental to my learning. I learned that I can teach myself a lot of concepts and that was very rewarding. Having any kind of mentorship, the ability to ask questions/have a dialogue about topics and concepts, group projects, and exposure the field were pretty non-existent. I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript skills. I took some classes in C and Visual Basic, and I have a basic understanding of SQL, Python, ColdFusion and Ruby.

I don't feel confident in my skills or knowledge to get a junior developer position. I haven't used any of the frameworks and honestly a lot of it is still so abstract to me. I feel like I don't really even understand what a developer job looks like; I feel so far behind even though I just finished my degree. And it doesn't seem like many junior positions are open to teaching you - it seems like you need so much experience to get those jobs.

I'm not partial to web, but I do like it. I really enjoyed my C classes but that could have just been the instructor I had. I like being able to be creative, which is what lead me to add the certificate to my coursework.

I took my courses online to be able to keep my job full time. I currently work on a web team at smallish company, but my job requires almost no coding and is more of a marketing position. I write blog posts, run our social media, film and edit youtube videos, keep our internal product database updated, and add/remove content from our website. I make almost no money and I am very eager to leave this job - but as you can see not much relevant work experience for becoming a developer.

Anyway. My real question is should I enroll in a bootcamp to get more practical experience actually building functional sites and applications or should I just try to get a job? Maybe just look at internships (although most of the internships I see require you to still be in school)? I don't really know what kinds of jobs to even look for.

If anyone has any input or suggestions I so appreciate it. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I don't have any friends in the field and I don't have any resources from the university I attended. There isn't any career support for their online students, plus I am out of state anyway. I'm just scared I'm too under-qualified still.

Thank you!"

Math Teacher: 10th grade BC and 11th grade multivariable calc teacher, he gave me the multivariable award at our school and told me that his rec was glowing. We have the same dry sense of humor, and I love this man to death. Our school needs to triple his salary. 

English teacher: 11th grade American Lit. She's the most fun-loving free spirit I know. I loved getting to know her opinions on political topics, and we debated endlessly on if pineapple belongs on pizza. (It does BTW). 

**Interview:** 

I absolutely gained so much insight about Yale through the interview. Loved every minute of it. My interviewer told me that I was the best interview he's ever had out of the dozens of interviews and ran out of space on the upload sheet because he had so much to talk about. We talked for an hour and a half about everything from Otto von Bismarck's real politik to Yale's School of Forestry. I'm hoping every single day at Yale ends up feeling like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to complete an IT related internship to earn my Bachelors in IST in which I landed a paid internship at a fortune 500 company as a Desktop Support Specialist Intern. I was 1 of 3 interns hire and the other 2 interns were fire. After 9 months I left the corporate world because they wanted to make the most out of cheap labor. However, I gained a vast amount of skills under my belt and the following month I was working at a University as a IT Tech Associate. After 9 months I ended up resigning from the position and took a 3 month hiatus from the work force. Fast Forward now I was offered a position as a End User Computer Admin and the duties and responsibilities are similar to help desk roles.  At the moment I have approximately 18 months of professional experience under my belt as well as a Bachelors Degree and no IT Certifications. Unlike my previous position this will be a full time position plus I find myself thinking it will look good to have ""Admin"" added to my job title. Having said that feel free to respond."

Or graduate spring 21, with a lighter course load more spread out. Possibly an internship over summer 2020 and if I get lucky summer 2019 although I haven't applied yet but will soon.

One year extra is possibly better grades, less stress, more time to relax, workout etc.

A bit about me - I'm 23 years old and the youngest full-time employee at my current company, PrivCo, which is a VC-Backed Fintech company in NYC (25+ Employees). I'm also managing a team of full-time analysts and interns - I'm the only employee in a management role outside of senior-management. I'm only looking at part-time programs in NYC, and I'm hoping for NYU or Columbia. I imagine I'll have very good letters of recommendation, one from a professor whom I'm very close with and one from my supervisor (10+ years in financial services and holds a CFA charter). 

* Work experience: Data Analyst (July 2017 - Nov 2018) | Data Manager (Nov 2018 - Present). Both roles are very quant-heavy and deal in financial data. 
* Undergrad school/major: BSBA at Boston University, graduated 2017 - 2.79 GPA (\~3.3 final year - I was in Engineering for two years, which contributed to the poor overall performance) 
* Other education/coursework: Microsoft Office Specialist Excel 2016
* Race/nationality: Middle Eastern (US Citizen)
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): I'm expecting mid-700s. I took the LSAT (was pre-law for a time) and scored top 5% - I performed very well in the logical reasoning and less-well in the reading comp. From my research, the GMAT has a more difficult logic section and easier reading section. I also have very strong arithmetic skills (800 SAT Math)
* Undergrad GPA: 2.79 (3.3 Final Year - Something around a 3.0-3.1 for Major GPA)

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: Learn how to more effectively manage a team and run a company. I'd like to start my own company after gaining enough experience working in a startup first. 
* Target schools: NYU &amp; Columbia (part time for both)

Some background on the company I work for - PrivCo is a leading provider in financial data on private companies. My role(s) largely requires me to crawl or research for private company revenues, employees, and KPIs and model some information as well. I have significant experience using Microsoft Excel and in process automation and web crawling.

a7b8qt,1,2018-12-18,"Always been passionate about computers, but now I'm scared to work in this field",calle-calle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a7b8qt/always_been_passionate_about_computers_but_now_im/,"Ever since I was a child, I've always been interested in computers and tech. I tried programming, networking, web design and web development, server management, working with Arduino and similars... A bit of everything, because I was curious and interested, and actually I still am, I have some projects and ideas and even if I'm procrastinating, I often still think about them and look for useful info that I could use.  
  
Now I'm 19, and on September I started going to the university (CS), but a couple weeks ago I dropped out because I couldn't find any motivation to study. I'm not someone who likes to study on books, and in particular I dislike theoretical studies. I want to get my hands on stuff and learn during the process, it's the method that works the best for me. I don't regret trying, in fact I think I'd have regretted not even trying.  
  
During the last two years of high school, I did an internship with a company, and I refined some of the knowledge I already had. The boss liked me, so after I made my decision, I contacted him, we met, and long story short the next month I'll start working with them.  
Thing is, now that everything is settled and I basically have a job, I'm starting to think that yes, I do love computers and working with them, but I want to keep it for myself, like an hobby. I don't like the idea of spending 8-9 hours on a workplace, in front of a computer, thinking about problems and writing code to solve them. I don't dislike doing it as an hobby for a couple hours at home and to bring some of my ideas to life, but I can't see myself doing any kind of job like this for a living. I think I want to be around people, have the chance to get to know more people and eventually travel a bit, even if just occasionally and not for long periods. I'm an introvert, and yet I need to both stay with people and by myself to feel good.  
  
I like writing, music and photography (and a bit of cooking), and even though (for now, I hope) I'm not particularly good at doing these things, especially if you consider that I can't play an instrument yet, I want to try dedicating myself to my passions, and see if I can make a living out of them. I think I'll get the job and do it for a few years, in order to save some money, but I don't think I'd like to do it forever, especially because here in Italy programmers don't get a very high salary, under 2000 euros for high experienced seniors, and around 1000 for juniors.  

Do you have any advice for someone like me? In the end I think the problem is that I don't really know what I want to do with my life, and I may or may not have the answer. Living as an artist is not easy and can have ups and downs, so I can't dedicate myself to it until I reach a certain level of quality and I'm sure it's going well enough."
a7bhfs,10,2018-12-18,"Strategies, tips, and tools for improving project management skills",sgrindy,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/a7bhfs/strategies_tips_and_tools_for_improving_project/,"Hi r/AskAcademia, I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for improving project management skills.

I'm currently a postdoc (sciences/engineering), and I'd like to improve my management skills. I've had a bit of experience informally managing interns and techs, as well as being a part of team-based research and I've noticed a few issues:

1. Underestimating how long a particular task/project will take, aka the [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy).
2. Sub-optimally allocating my time when bringing a new lab member up to speed on a project, especially interns. Usually, they need more hands-on time than I had originally expected. (this is definitely related to #1)
3. Maintaining a record of which tasks are supposed to be completed by whom has proven difficult. I take notes at meetings, but they aren't always convenient and I'm not 100% satisfied with that solution.

After talking to a few colleagues, I found that I'm not alone. So I wanted to put the question out to you - what strategies have you found that help you manage the projects you're working on? What other issues have you had beyond what I listed above, and how did you address them? 

I think this would be most helpful to everyone if we keep things open-ended - anything from strategies, software/apps,  books - whatever you've got!"
a7c5rp,62,2018-12-18,Stressed? Anxious? Overwhelmed? Depressed? This is for you.,ScholarGrade,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a7c5rp/stressed_anxious_overwhelmed_depressed_this_is/,"TL:DR – Life is long.  You can make mistakes and come back from them.  College is just one small part of life, so don't stress too much over it. Focus on who you are, the skills you cultivate, the relationships you build, and the things you love.

1.  **You probably feel like no one understands what you're going through.**  People outside of the /r/A2C demographic are usually pretty unaware and out of touch with the issues students here are dealing with.  It is tragic that so many of you feel that several of the most important relationships in your life are defined or impacted by college admissions.  Parents who love their kids and want the best for them try to nudge them to do their best, but often they do it by bludgeoning them with pressure, doubt, insecurity, and even derision.  Friends who loved each other through thick and thin find themselves adversaries fighting for one hypothetical spot at their dream school.  So many of you lie awake at night worrying and wondering.  Your days are a hamster wheel and your true free time, ferociously earned or stolen through dereliction, is spent on coping mechanisms.  It's hard for anyone outside of this to even understand at all how challenging and consuming it can be.  You aren't alone in feeling this way.  And you're going to make it.

2.  **You might feel judged or weak for being so stressed, and that's ok.**  Many people outside of college admissions wonder how these struggles can be real.  It is all real because it is real in your life, and for many of you it has become real in the core of who you are.  This is why some of you even suggest writing your essays about college admissions (please don't!).  Others go through a Stockholm syndrome metamorphosis and fall in love with it.  If you're struggling and feel like you have no hope, hang in there.

3.  **Don't do anything that could mess up the rest of your life permanently**. Life is long, and your time dealing with your current set of problems and stressors is coming to an end soon. When you go to college almost everything in your life can change and you can change with it.  You don't need to feel trapped, hemmed in, or limited by disappointment in who you are and what you currently struggle with.  Even if everything doesn't improve in college, you get another chance to ""reboot"" when you graduate and enter the workforce.  There are so few things in life that are permanent and once you establish independence as an adult you will be shocked by how much freedom you have to change things or do things differently.

4.  **Grades and test scores aren't everything.** I know many, many successful people who didn't manage a 3.0+ in high school OR college. All of them got jobs and are off to solid careers. You'll be fine if you can make it to college. I know people who did not make a 1000 on the SAT, but still went to college and now have successful careers.

5.  **Failure is a part of life, so never let one or two failures derail you**. Most successful entrepreneurs aren't very successful with their 1st or even 2nd and 3rd attempts to start a company. Most students get rejected from some colleges or internships. Well qualified and even over qualified candidates get rejected for jobs all the time. Researchers find ideas that don't work after years of pursuing them.  It's part of being human. Don't let failure or rejection bring you down or defeat you. Just remember, you can only go to one college, so it only takes one college to accept you. You only have one job or summer internship, so you only have to get one offer.

6.  **Once you go to college and establish your independence, it won't matter as much what other people think**. You will at some point be able to define for yourself what success means to you.  For most of you, success is being defined for you right now, but that isn't going to be true for much longer. Once you're in college or out on your own, you determine that for yourself.  In college, you can absolutely get a great support network between friends, roommates, professors, advisors, and teammates. Once you graduate you will have other opportunities to find supportive people in your life. If your existing relationships are terrible or toxic, remember that they aren't going to be as significant of a factor in your life once you head off to college.  Not even close. Hang in there and you'll be fine.

7.  **If you don't get in to your top choice, don't let it bother you**. There are tons of incredibly successful people who went to safety schools. Success isn't a one-time thing either. Graduating as valedictorian certainly helps you get a leg up on admissions to college, scholarships, etc. But it's not going to make you any friends, and no one is going to care once you start college. Even employers don't care about high school stats once you go to college. Once your career is off and running, your college GPA and performance won't matter as much either.  So stop panicking and obsessing over it and focus instead on living your life.

8.  **To be successful, you have to have good habits, work ethic, skills/talents/abilities, etc. You can't just succeed at one thing one time and declare yourself a success**. That's why your habits and steady state behaviors make a bigger impact than your one time accomplishments (like getting into your top choice, graduating #1, etc). If you're doing the right things, building skills and using them, and working hard, you'll be fine. Often, failing helps you hone those behaviors and skills much better than success does. A lot of successful people see failures as ""paying tuition"" to learn how things work or don't work.  Here's my point - Larry Page was an ok guy but he wasn't anything special in 1997. He went to Michigan for undergrad, and hadn't accomplished anything that remarkable. Sergey Brin was the same way - he went to Maryland (where his dad was a prof). But they started Google together and are now two of the richest and most successful people in history. Their careers at Google are riddled with mistakes and ""failures"" too. But they learned from it, and continued to work hard and get better.  Getting in to your dream school might feel like the pinnacle of existence right now, but it's far from the end goal.  Keep your focus on your own end goals and remember that going to college is just a step in that journey.  There are many paths to success, and going to any one specific college isn't going to make or break anything.

9. **Try to relax**.  Remind yourself that life is long and you can still be crazy successful even if you don't get into your dream school.  Take a break.  Go for a walk.  Call a friend and talk about sports or celebrities or Fortnite or anything but college.  Get some exercise.  Read a book just for fun.  Plan some time in advance for you to spend unwinding.  If that means you have to work harder for a few days leading up to it so you have the bandwidth, then do it.

10.  **Don't worry so much about where you go to college**. There are so many things that matter more than that in life. Your success in life will be far more dependent on the skills you build, the personal &amp; professional relationships you curate, and how you perform wherever you end up. But more importantly, you need to worry about you right now too. Specifically, the habits you form, how you handle stress &amp; anxiety, how you manage your mental health, what coping mechanisms you pursue, how you balance long term and short term goals, and even how you define success in the first place.  It may surprise you, but [most of the top 1% of students **by any measure** do not attend an Ivy League school](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7yprmn/most_of_the_top_1_of_students_nationally_by_any/).  The entire top 40 of colleges represents just ~3% of all students.  You can be in the top 5% of students nationally (again, *by any measure*) and still not attend a T40.  The take away here is that you should focus on yourself and who you want to be, not on a specific college or sub set of colleges.  There are tons of colleges where you could go get a world-class education and be successful.

11.  **Don't give up**.  Once April rolls around, you'll be glad you stuck with it. After your first job out of college, no one will care what your GPA was, what your test scores were, or even where you went to school. Who you are, the work ethic you build, the habits you have, and the relationships you form will have a bigger impact on your future than your SAT, GPA, or really anything from high school or college.  Life is long and being successful in high school and going to college is not a one-shot, winner-take-all, do-or-die affair. If you don't get accepted at ANY of your top schools, or you have a 500 SAT, or a 1.4 GPA, or someone royally screwed you over somehow, or whatever - you can still have a successful life. Almost any failure or circumstance can be overcome later. You almost always have another opportunity to succeed.


12.  **If you're feeling overwhelmed by deadlines, relax**. They will come and go. You'll get your stuff done or you won't. But there will be many other chances to figure things out. 


13.  **You have options**.  There are over 4600 degree granting colleges in the United States. Many hundreds of these are great schools offering a world class education and pre-professional training. You might have a list of ~10. Guess what? Even if you go 0-10, you can still go to a great college. There are good colleges with later deadlines or rolling admissions. You can take a gap year. ED/EA is not your only shot at an amazing college.  RD is not your only chance either.


14.  **Life is so long. You will have many, many chances to make mistakes and come back from them**. Tons of ridiculously successful people didn't get into their first choice college. Tons of them didn't even go to college. It's hard to have perspective on this right now, but there are really only a handful of things that could really adversely impact your life 10 years from now. Hang in there and everything will be ok.


15.  **No, you don't have to go to a top 20 school to be successful, in fact even if you can, it might not be the best option for you**.  The rankings aren't that valuable or reliable anyway because of how and why they are produced and what they mean. After college, no one uses the rankings. Employers hire people, not undergraduate brands.  It's a controversial bomb to drop, but it's the truth. Sure if you want to be on the Supreme Court someday, you probably need a law degree from a top school. But for most of us, mind-blowing levels of success are very attainable almost no matter where we get our education.

16.  **If it helps, the sensation that you aren't good enough and that you don't know how to handle the pressure and expectations being foisted upon you never really goes away**. Imposter syndrome is real and you need to have reasonable expectations for yourself to keep things in perspective both in college and in your career.  No matter what company you go to after graduation, someone will be way more successful than you. If you start your own business, there will be other business owners who are way more successful and distinguished. I'll put it this way - if you think this sub is bad, wait until you become a working professional and get on LinkedIn.  At some point, you have to just set some goals for yourself and define success on your own terms. Then work to achieve what you want out of life without obsessing over what other people are doing. You will be surprised how much better you feel about yourself if you work on yourself for yourself rather than constantly comparing yourself to people who are better than you. (And there is always someone better than you - richer, taller, younger, smarter, sexier, more successful, more accomplished, more talented, more athletic, etc.) But the comparisons do you no good whatsoever. Set your own goals, then go be you.

17.  **Relax**.  You don't have to go to a top college to get a great education or have an incredibly rewarding life and career.  FAR more than where you go, it will matter what skills you cultivate, what relationships you build, and what you personally achieve and learn.  Life is stressful enough - don't pile on by worrying about some ""perfect"" trajectory or micromanaging the steps to attain some lofty goals.  Things rarely go according to plan.  They also rarely end with you destitute and living under a bridge.  No matter what happens in the next year or five, you will probably be fine.  In all honesty, the biggest risk in your life is not that you fail at the things you're working toward.  It's that you handle the stress poorly - turning to unhealthy eating, drugs, thrill-seeking, or whatever else to deal with it, battling depression &amp; its repercussions, etc.  

18.  **Take care of your mental health and recognize that little steps can get you on the right track quickly**.  Life is long.  You *will* make mistakes and suffer failures - that's life.  But you also get **so. many. chances.** to come back from them.  It's never too late.  Ray Kroc started McDonalds at age 59.  Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote ""Little House in the Big Woods"" at age 65.  You could literally fail out of high school, spend a year in trade school, and be making $75k as a corporate welder in a low cost of living area by age 19 (this happened to a friend of mine who finished high school with a 1.9 GPA).  You could write a hit book like Stephanie Meyer (who started writing Twilight at age 30).  You could start your own successful business like a friend of mine who just retired with a lake house and a beach house (after being fired or laid off from his first 3 jobs).

a7ci3v,3,2018-12-18,Working a Project Management job as a current CS student,HeyItsKrispy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a7ci3v/working_a_project_management_job_as_a_current_cs/,"Hi everybody! 

I have a couple of questions related to the topic, but first a  little background on my situation. 

I am a junior in University, working towards my bachelor's in CS. I am currently working an internship at a web development company, part-time. I am also working as an IT technician at another job, part-time.

At my internship, a Project Management position has opened up and the Senior PM recently approached me to ask if I was interested in applying, and told me that he would heavily consider me for the position if I applied. However, one of the full-time software developers is leaving soon, so his role will be open. There have been talks of the devs wanting to pick up one of the interns, but there will be more competition for that role.

So my question is this: Would working a job as a Project Manager benefit me in my eventual goal to work as a software developer? 

Is this an opportunity that I should consider, from the perspective of somebody trying to gain traction in this industry?

It's pretty clear to me that working one job that pays better, has benefits, and is full-time is far preferable to working two part-time jobs, but I want to know if this is a wise decision in the long-term, or if I should consider holding out for the development position.

Sorry if the formatting is funky, I don't post too often and this is also on mobile.

Thank you for your time!"

a7d903,7,2018-12-18,How exactly do I get into grad school? [X-Post from r/college],Gamerhead,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/a7d903/how_exactly_do_i_get_into_grad_school_xpost_from/,"I honestly stumbled my way into college on my own. I knew that my main goal was to major in computer science but that was about it. I didn't really have any guidance other than my guidance counselor in high school because nobody in my family or friends had ever attended college. When I talk to my advisors at my University it seems they'd rather me leave their office quicker then get me to understand what exactly I'm striving for. 

Essentially I currently am a junior but still have until fall of 2020 to make an impact somewhere, which is when I would expectedly get my bachelor's degree. Maybe later if needed. I only have an overall GPA of 3.2 up from 2.98 from last semester. My major GPA is a 3.0, up from a 2.61 from last semester. To get admitted into the accelerated program for getting a masters degree, I would have to have an overall of 3.3 and a major GPA of 3.5. Ideally I would have these GPAs by Spring of 2020 so I can get admitted in time. I believe these are achievable as long as I kick my behind like I did this semester. However, I'm not too sure if that's all I have to do. One thing I've never really understood was internships and research opportunities. 

Say if I wanted to continue on and get my doctoral degree or just be a better candidate for this accelerated Masters program. Maybe even go somewhere else afterwards. How exactly do I go about getting research opportunities or interning somewhere? Wouldn't those extend my expected graduation date? Our site has a section for research but it really is confusing to me what exactly it means to 'research'. Is it a class? Is it time you don't do classes and only research?

I'm essentially afraid that if I want to pursue a grad degree, I'm not going to have the background to back me up.

Any knowledge would be extremely helpful. Thank you."

Could use some guidance!,dwoooood,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/a7dvlo/recent_advertising_graduate_changing_career_path/,"Hello everyone. To make a long story somewhat short, I’m a 25 year old male that graduated in 2017 with a BA in Advertising Management. Since graduating, I’ve noticed the only jobs really available for me are sales jobs, and I despise sales. Hell, I never really enjoyed marketing or advertising either. I have always been tech-savvy, and a huge computer nerd. I was the guy that everyone went to when they had computer/iOS/WiFi/internet issues. I’ve always had a passion for tech and understand and solving tech related issues.

So I’m going after what I love, and that is switching over to IT. There’s one big issue: I don’t have any experience what so ever.

I could really use some guidance on where to go from here. My current plan is to pursue some IT certifications, such as CCNA or MCSA, as well as find a help-desk internship that may not require previous experience.

Are there specific certifications I should pursue? What kind of jobs are there where I can build experience with no previous experience?

Thanks for the help everyone. Also, I would love to connect with anyone in the field personally and develop relationships in the industry. I am very excited and ready to get to work.

I have applied to over 60 internship positions for summer 2019, and I’ve only gotten one interview so far with Atlassian. I don’t know why I am not getting any interviews (not to sound condescending) because I’ve had three Software Engineering internships, and two of them were at Google; I did EP then SWE. The reason why I did not want to go back to Google for my last internship is because I want to try somewhere new, since I’ve only really worked at Google as a full time intern (ther other was part time during the school year) to see if I absolutely want to work there full time. 

Are there any ideas on why I am not getting any internship interviews? I was supposed to graduate May 2019, however, I took a medical leave this semester and now I’m graduating December 2019. Do you think employers see this as a warning sign that I’m graduating a semester late with no indication of work or study abroad at that time? Maybe I’m just being paranoid.

Western Governors University is appealing because of the price, and I'm very close to signing up - but because it doesn't have a traditional GPA, or campus location I fear it will hurt me if I pursue internships and limits any type of connections I could make for jobs after graduation.

Should I still apply to these research internships and REUs despite having a really shitty GPA?

a7f607,19,2018-12-18,What are my options for advancement as an administrative assistant?,devonair320,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a7f607/what_are_my_options_for_advancement_as_an/,"Hi! I'm 24F, just started my first big girl job in July this year. I'm very ambitious, though, and I'm not intending to stay at $37K very long, so I'm making sure that I'm focused on my career path and future advancement as I go forward. A little backstory: I work at an insurance company, a regional office, serving three bosses but mostly the main one who is a Marketing exec. I've gotten nothing besides glowing feedback on my performance from everyone, which is great especially for yearly reviews and such, and for future references when the time comes. I'm an English major (I know, try not to kill me) with an editorial internship from a small publishing house and some social media marketing experience. In my current position, I mostly work with Excel, running daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly reports; I do office management including mail, supply orders, general organization; event management including company meetings/meals in all our territories across 3 states, as well as smaller in-office events each month. For a while, I helped my boss with his social media presence as well, though that fell by the wayside in favor of more important things, but I'm considering pursuing it again because (and one of my main points):

I'M BORED. All of my work gets done within the first two hours of my shift, and then I spend the rest of my time browsing YouTube or writing my own projects. My boss has always been concerned with giving me enough to do, and I appreciate it, but there's only so much I can do within my position, and I've basically done it all (short of busy work, which I am about to dive into because of boredom). My pay is good, especially for my position and location (and age and major), but I'm not trying to keep making less $50K for the forseeable future. I want to start saving for my future, after all, instead of the endless paycheck-to-paycheck.

I guess I just really wish I had some guidance, and some idea of what to expect. I'm intending to stay at this place for about 2 years since that's what was lowkey agreed upon when I was hired, and since that's the minimum time I should stay at a place without being accused of job hopping too hard. I'm hoping to move from this to Executive Assistant, which would easily double my salary based on some of the postings I've seen in my area, which I would be MUCH more satisfied with for the longer term.

But realistically -- I've heard that administrative work can be a serious black hole. It's hard to get out of, and usually underpaid and underappreciated. I don't care much about who appreciates me so long as the pay is good, but since I'm new to the corporate world and am pretty green, I just want to know if my hopes are remotely realistic. I feel like I'd really succeed at a higher position, but there's no way I'd be considered with so little experience, so I've got to just let the years go by until I can make a case for myself (and in the meantime collect as much praise as I can from my superiors for future job opportunities).

So, specifically people with administrative backgrounds -- how are you doing? How are you advancing? If you've moved out of administration, what have to gone to, and how, and why? For someone who is trying to move up as quickly as (realistically) possible, what would you advise? Thank you for any help!"

As some of you may remember from my previous story, I worked at an agency with networked offices in many countries where our users would go do whatever it is that users do. Almost all of those offices were remotely managed aided by an on-site skeleton crew in North America and Europe.
This is the story where one of my colleagues accidentally the entirety of Italy.

$me = myself

$commsguy = sole telecommunications tech in the office

You guys remember the heatwave in Europe this summer ? Turns out it started messing with our poorly ventilated ""server room"" in $ItalianCity. However, we didn't know the issues were caused by heat when users started complaining about intermittent network outages and sluggish internet. 

As an intern, I couldn't do anything to identify the problem due to a lack of access so I took the numerous tickets, collated them into one nice delicious ticket and brought it to the attention of $commsguy. Seeing an opportunity to teach me something, he gracefully offered to show me how to access a remote network stack and do basic troubleshooting. I'm not too shabby when it comes to that, but I always like to learn new things, so I agreed to assist him.

As I sit next to him in his office, he fires up $monitoringsoftware and we see that the router is throwing up errors about dropped packets, but is still somewhat functional. I'll cut out the long-winded troubleshooting process for brevity's sake. After connecting to the router and snooping around in $monitoringsoftware, we eventually figured out that it was indeed overheating.

Now comes an impressive series of poor decisions in quick succession that lead to him accidentally wiping Italy off of our network.

*Commsguy : ""Alright, I'll just reboot the network stack and hopefully it will solve some of the issues. It shouldn't bother anyone since everyone has left the office in $ItalianCity"".*

I assumed he meant restarting the machines in the network stack but I wasn't sure how that would fix the overheating issues. 

**Poor decision number 1**

*Commsguy : ""You ever seen a networked power-strip ? I'll just reboot that and it will restart everything at once.""*

Since I'm fairly new to the world of IT, I admit to him that I've never seen one. However, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to just pull the plug on everything at once. Especially since it's the power-strip providing power to the entire network stack.

**Poor decision number 2**

*Commsguy : ""Alright, check this out"".*

I watch inquisitively as $commsguy starts typing a command in the power-strip console :

    &gt;shutdown /t 0

He had sent a shutdown command instead of a restart command. Not so much of an issue when you're close to the machines, much more of an issue when you're separated by an ocean.

**Poor decision number 3**

*Commsguy (after a few seconds) : ""Uh-oh"".*

We watch in horror as the entire Italian region turns red in $monitoringsoftware.


The following hour was spent desperately trying to contact someone with the server room key in $ItalianCity just so they could go inside the server room and flip a switch. Needless to say, the boss wasn't happy.

I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student studying data science and computer science at the University of Western Ontario. I would say I still have a long way to go before having all the tools and skills needed to become a data scientist. I do have knowledge/experience in r/Python/SQL through my schooling.  This summer I have an option to return to the company I worked for last summer. They are a design-build an infrastructure construction company out of Windsor, Ontario. Last summer, I helped aid in the implementation of their new ERP software, Vista by Viewpoint. I believe this summer I will be able to approach them with a mini-project that they would let me perform in order to improve the company as a whole. I would love to do some sort of data analysis using regression, however, I am not too sure what I could do to help improve this company.

Does anyone have any analysis suggestions or ideas for an undergraduate data science student to perform during his/her summer internship? Thank you and I appreciate your advice and responses!"
a7foae,7,2018-12-18,Is this depression/Help me,NotAThrowaway_Kappa,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/a7foae/is_this_depressionhelp_me/,"I'll start off with saying, I've never said ""I have depression"", of course I've had days where I felt sad, sometimes with a reason behind it, sometimes without, but i just brushed it off because in my eyes depression is/was a mental issue, and just because you've had a shit week or day, doesn't mean you have depression. Quite a few people that i knew IRL, tweeted or posted on Instagram about them having depression, and this self-diagnosed depression due to getting a bit more homework at grade 10 pissed me off, so my mindset always has been ""You're just having a shit day/week/month""

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my story, i guess..

&amp;#x200B;

Starting university, and the first 3 semesters (ish) of it I had the same mental state as far as I remember, my life wasn't exciting or anything, but i thought i felt good. Studies were not too big of a fuss, went to my lectures, did my homework, and enjoyed the rest of my free time gaming.

&amp;#x200B;

After this time period, I met 3 friends online, soon after that i found a niche way to make money online, being able to skip a few lectures a week because of my previous knowledge of the subjects, I was happy, most of the time spent home, talking with the previously mentioned friends, gaming, and earning money whilst doing so (I never had much money of my own before this, which I guess is not abnormal for someone studying). I understood that i was not happy before, i wasn't unhappy either, i just was.

&amp;#x200B;

Again we fast forward a bit, and life is okay. Out of the 3 previously mentioned friends, one found a significant other, one became really busy with life, but we still talk on and off, the 3rd friend in the list decided to leave this group, according to him, because of something I did, but, thinking over the situation, they just needed someone to blame, as I think i did nothing wrong. Whilst I would have no problem ""forgiving"" them, if they wish to move on, thats their choice, and I'm okay with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue why i typed the previous 3 paragraphs, I don't feel like they add much to this post, but, might as well..

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it starts going down hill, around the end of my 5th semester of Uni, i started hating it. I skipped subjects where I knew i was no good at, I didn't do assignments, I just hated everything about it, but with a few encouraging words from my friend, and me getting in the mindset of ""I've wasted nearly 2 and a half years on this, you need to finish it, even if you hate it"", I powered through it. The 6th semester I don't remember much of, I guess it was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Now starts the real downfall, for university, since its a professional bachelors degree, you have to do an internship of 3 months, and with my country being in the state it is, odds were that you were going to find an unpaid one. So far the past 2 and a half months ish, I've had a daily schedule of, wake up at 8:15, get ready, be at the internship until 5 pm, get home, eat, work (previously mentioned online niche) till around 2 am to fund gas and food for the internship. The first few days were okay, i was learning new stuff, and got decent at it quick, even though i had no free time, i thought to myself ""Oh this won't be so bad"", but after day 3, it just went downhill, the internship became me repeating the same task over and over, bringing this small company quite decent profit, and after that, tired, I had to work to fund gas to get there and food to eat whilst i was there???, when I made mistakes i felt like i was treated like a moron, like this tone of voice that just looking down on me, even though I was an intern, my mistakes (that were few) were frowned upon, but when the person i was working with made mistakes (bricked SD cards) the customer was charged for the new ones, and my ""college"" just said ""Oh everyone makes mistakes"", I AM NOT OKAY with them scamming customers, but I needed this internship to finish uni, so I didn't say anything, just to be done with it, there have even been times when I was called by this college of mine for consult, he's calling the intern to help with the problem he's meant to tutor???. But okay, I'm nearly done with it, only the bachelors thesis and project, and ill be done with uni! Right? NO! 

&amp;#x200B;

In the group chat of my degree university students someone mentioned a 2nd internship, I had heard of it before, but i thought everyone meant the 2 week one we had in the 2nd year, but it turns out ( I admit, this is my fault, not looking into it more), theres another 3 month internship. And now I've been in shambles ever since I found out, I've spent the last 3 months of my life being miserable, forcing myself out of bed, just to work for almost the entire time i was awake, every day i just became more and more miserable. Now that I know i have to do another 3 months of this, I honestly am thinking of dropping out just to save myself from doing something stupid. How am i going to have these nearly 16 hour work days, and write the bachelors thesis and make the project on the side? The idea of this just has me broken, I don't do anything anymore, I have dropped my Income, pretty much just lay in bed all day and night unless I'm at the internship, at nights i feel so down, knowing that if i fall asleep I'll have to go back to the internship as soon as the alarm goes off..

&amp;#x200B;

(tl;dr)

&amp;#x200B;

My ""professional"" life has me in shambles, it makes me miserable, i hate everything about it, and its about to get worse, the idea of it just puts me in a state where I'm considering dropping out of uni with only 3 months of it left, to stop myself from doing something incredibly stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the 16 hour work days, I have pretty much no time for personal life. And even then, whilst I'm okay with the state of it, I'm not sure i should be. What has brightened my mood in the past is: I got my sister a gift for Christmas last year that made her happy even though she had been down the entire day, a few months back my sister got married, that day i felt ""up"", seeing my previously mentioned friend happy because of their significant other, seeing my other friend do well in life, succeeding. Recently I watched a youtube video by Jaiden Animations and this one line hit me really hard ""I want to exist for other people, I don't really care about myself"", thats exactly how i feel about my personal life, whilst I'm okay with it, should I be? Are 4 moments of happiness in the past 2 ish years enough? 

I'll probably end up deleting this as I'm just rambling, but I hope posting this publicly or a reply from someone will somehow lighten up my days."

So I was looking to go another path, IT. I've always been the IT person for my family and friends but I never had a job in the field.

I've been applying since then for entry-level jobs like help desk, IT support but had only a few interviews. My first interview was with the CEO of a hot tub manufacturer of an IT Helpdesk role and he told me I was enthusiastic during the interview and would have hired me if I had the experience, but I can't get any if no one will hire me. I'm not sure if it's because my degree is not specific in IT and a game development degree. I've tried looking for internships in IT but there are rarely any here and you have to be a current student.

I've been using all resources available to me, like my school's career services, LinkedIn, this subreddit to edit my resume but no luck still. I'm tired of getting this in my email ""Unfortunately, we will not be moving you forward in the interview process at this time."" And I'm not sure exactly what I should be doing at this point than just keep on applying. I just don't understand what's going on, bigger companies in Boston have contacted me for phone interviews but I can't really get any and almost always denied locally here in South Coast Massachusetts. If a smaller and more entry-level job here locally won't take me why would a major one in Boston be interested and take me?

If you are still in the same position that I am please tell me your story. If anyone would like to give input on what I should be doing now since it's been over 6 months that I graduated, I would greatly appreciate any help. Questions I have: Should I try to continue to find work in my field that I went to school for instead, game development? There's really one opening I qualify for QA testing but it's so super competitive and only a few openings if any in Boston. I'm 29 and went back to school after working low paying jobs hoping to change my career, I'm not sure if more schooling will help when I can't even get the most entry-level jobs. Is more schooling going to change my situation? 

Am I just not qualified based on my resume posted below or is it just no experience? I was told to edit my resume by higher up people in the field to make it seem that I worked for myself, ""consulting"". This is how I really gained my experience with troubleshooting, computers, etc. over the years by helping family and friends. Still do it today, don't really make anything from it though, I do it for free mostly. Is this not helping me, having it on my resume? My school's career services says you need to show how you learned those skills on my resume. 

If you are a recruiter or someone who owns a business in my area near Providence and up in Boston, I would greatly appreciate if you could help me or give and an interview or connect on LinkedIn to find potential work. I don't want to be still out of work in 2019. If anybody has any ideas or they can assist me at all I would greatly appreciate that too. Thanks

Another assignment was to design a book for a woman, my boss said it would be my project and that I could take as much time as i wanted. Today a colleague came to me and told me that she would be finishing it, and she passed it over to another intern. When I comfronted my boss about it he told me that he will be giving me different assignments (Which makes me feel like i'm not qualified enough for it)

My academic peers were befuddled about how all of his information could vanish from the entire World Wide Web.

I will post the interview in 3 parts, with this entry being Part 1.-Peter Harrington------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-**Interview Part 1**

P: Why don't you start from the beginning.

T: Ok, look you're a young guy, they shouldn't have you do this.P: I know, I know but we are understaffed. They treat me like I am a doctor.

T: Ok.\*At this point, he started breathing heavily and went into what seemed to be a panic attack. A nurse came in to handle the situation.

\*T. Sorry about that, I just… I can't get it out of my mind.

P: Take your time.

T. No I'm ready.

I had recently published a paper on neurofibromatosis which got a lot of acclaim from my colleagues. They had been encouraging me to write another book in the same bane as “Strange People” so I decided to take a sabbatical and work on this next piece. I had several interesting chapters at this point. One on what is called “tree man” syndrome, more commonly referred to as epidermodysplasia verruciformis. There was another chapter on people called “pinheads” though that term is no longer politically correct. The correct terminology is Microcephaly.

The book was not going well but the process was enjoyable. Several weeks into the sabbatical I received a call from my secretary at work telling me someone wanted to call upon my services. I told my secretary to send them away unless it was a completely unique case and they said it was. I set up a meeting for the following day quite reluctantly. I needed more material for my book.

I met the individual at my now vacant office at around 10 am. He was an odd looking fellow. He appeared to descend from inbreeding. His eyes were oddly shaped and his ears stuck out like two mushrooms. I was polite and began the session promptly to see if this weirdo was wasting my time.

He sensed my condescension and said to me. “Dr. Aaron, I know you have lots of loonies come to you, trying to get cheap treatment for mild developmental diseases. If I were one of those I completely understand how busy you are and would let my self out. But I come to you with something that no specialist has been able to identify or understand. Are you familiar with the country of Mauritania?”

I replied and told him that I was unfamiliar with the country except for generally knowing its location in Africa.“Well, I work for the Exodus Corporation, an international corporation that, well… let us just say we allow a billion heirs to escape the burdens of heavy American taxes. One of our headquarters is located far in the desert ”I told him I understood because I was somewhat of a tax evader myself. I'm not a rich cunt but I have my motivations for avoiding the feds.

“We hold large galas for our patrons in remote undisclosed locations such as this so the United States government doesn't breathe down our back. Have you ever seen the film Eyes wide shut?”I caught his drift pretty easily. I joked and asked him if the riches sacrificed goats to Cthulu or weird shit like that.He laughed and said to me “Sacrificing goats isn't quite what we do. We deal more with, well, financial issues. I assume you know why I am telling you this.”

I told him that I was being recruited to work for this organization. No amount of money was gonna persuade me to sell my soul in such a way, but I told him I was thankful for the offer.“No no.” He said to me. “This is not a monetary proposal. You will be compensated greatly of course, but this is an academic venture. We know that you are fascinated with these disorders, and need a breakthrough in your research. And we have come across a case that has never been seen before by man.”

I paused and asked him If I was to go to one of their goat sacrificing gatherings and dissect one of their strange genetically mutated children jokingly.“No no, What we have down in Mauritania is more of what you would call a “freak show”. I know that you are the expert in such matters.”

I gulped and paused for a moment. I asked him if they really still existed.“Only for our patrons. You see these people whom I work for are not your average billion heirs. They don't show up in your typical Forbes magazine and I dare say they have stock in a much larger pool. People like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are new money, But my employers are old money. Very old money. Roman money.”

I sat again in silence.

“In our freak show, we continue the tradition of the gladiator. Bread, and circus if you will. We find you beloved “freaks” and put them into battle against one another.”That’s sick! I told the man that I refused to partake in such a horrible practice.

“Don't make up your mind until I tell you about what we’ve found. Deep in a Lithuanian forest, we came across a freak that was like nothing we had seen before. It had the qualities of a monster and had been terrorizing a local rural village. He was completely pale, with thick dark hair and the eyes of a dead man.  We instantly brought him to our headquarters and It has been destroying its competition. The only problem is in recent weeks, it has become sick, and in need of medical treatment. We propose a trade off with you. If you can treat our best fighter, we will give you access to our facilities for your research. We will even pay for your research, get you into all of the best publications and make you a star. Dr. Aaron, we are in Dire straights, please. It will benefit both of us.”

I thought of this discovery. This would be my breakthrough. A human such as this with an unidentified disorder would be my path to research glory. There is no way I could refuse. I told the man I accept. A decision I now regret.“Good, we will give you enough time to get your affairs in order for the trip. How long will it take you until you can spend a good 3 to 4 months away from here.”

I told him I was on sabbatical, we could leave as soon as possible.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My sister whose in Highschool was involved in an altercation with another student after school (off School grounds) This student has been bullying her for quite sometime now. My mom reported it to the school several times, however, the school did little to nothing to address the problem. The student approached my sister; she tried to walk away, however, the student followed her, cornered her (according to the School Resource Officer) and punched my sister in the face. My sister tussled with the student to avoid being punched again. The RO took my sister back to the school (the other student ran off) — my sister was subsequently suspended for 3-days for “fighting” and“safety.” The school also claims self defense is not permitted, per the school’s policy.
 
They also claimed they have jurisdiction to consider the fight a school-related incident — even though the incident occurred off school grounds (0.3 miles to be exact) and off school property. 

After the incident my sister couldn’t find her iPhone. Her friend said she picked up my sisters phone. Her friend claims she gave my sisters phone to someone but didn’t who she gave it — she claims person because she just happened to be looking away when the person in question grabbed the phone from her hand. 

My questions: 

1. Do school’s have jurisdiction for Incidents off school grounds, consider this a school - related incident, and take disciplinary action? 
2. Can school’s prevent students from protecting themselves (no exceptions made for self defense) if they are being attacked? 
3. How does this work interns of state laws (which do not allow self defense or justifiable). 
4. Regarding my sisters phone: is her friend liable/negligent for losing her phone? The circumstances of how she lost my sisters phone seems odd. My mom feels my sisters friend still has her phone. Would this be considered theft?

I am in the IT major. My counselor has given us the option to take half-day classes and the rest of the day internships, and I am very much interested in doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing! I asked the counselors for help step-by-step but ended up receiving general information like you need a resume, cover letter, etc. But I was never told or taught how to go through with the process of obtaining an actual internship. It sucks, as I am going to be the first person in my family to be able to graduate  high school due to my parents being foreign, unable to get education, and a younger brother in elementary school. There isn't really any help they can provide at all as they haven't done it themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, the school has a policy where I can only find internships strictly related to my major and in this case, IT so like networking or hardware, etc.

I instantly thought of Micro Center as I really love building PCs and technology and it'll jackpot if I can get into it, but I don't really know where to start, like who to contact and where to get the information (maybe contact store info?)

I have been trying to get an internship for the last couple of years. I am currently a Junior in undergrad and I’ve taken some pretty involved CS courses. I’ve had my software basics, and this past semester I took a systems and network programming course. I have good grades, I’ve been involved in student organizations in the past and last spring I even did some research with a professor. 

This past fall I applied to a ton of internships for both the spring and summer and all of them declined me in the application phase.

I’ve reviewed my resume several times with a college career advisor and I’ve shown a passion for what it is that I want to do. I’m not picky about where I intern at either , I just want some experience. Because I know a lot of very big time internships require other internship experience, but other than that I am not seeing what I am lacking.

Can anyone give me some advice on what companies are looking for in intern positions that I don’t have? 

I know a lot of big companies are competitive, but what are the real factors that I’m not keying in on well enough? "

Could use some guidance",throwaway-v4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a7j6cq/24_yo_cs_dropout_sobering_up_with_a_spotty/,"I dropped out after roughly two years towards a CS degree, and officially have been out of school since January 2017. Education started out well, 3.6x GPA, TAed and had a couple internships, but I sabotaged myself with alcoholism and a host of other poor decisions. After losing my last job (a hospitality gig I only kept for three months) due to more of the same, I admitted myself to outpatient rehab and have since cut alcohol and hard drugs out of my life. 

Returning to school is currently not an option. I'm just looking to re-enter the workforce in any capacity, and I realize I'll be doing some non-CS grunt work to begin with. My plan is to build a portfolio on the side and do some volunteering/coaching to bolster my resume in hopes of landing a summer internship and see where that takes me. I have some questions about what that should look like and how I should address my minefield of a resume.

1. Does this seem feasible time-wise? I live in Seattle, so there are a LOT of tech companies looking for young blood, but I know internships get scooped up quickly. It's okay if not, I just want to have reasonable goals to set for myself.

2. Any recommendations for what I should focus my work on/any resources of great use? Would potential employers rather see courses completed on sites like Coursera, Udacity, etc., or should I focus more on personal projects? I never got far enough in my education/career to specialize in any particular sub-field.

3. How should I address the holes in my employment, my lack of recent technical employment or recs, the whole not-graduating thing, etc.? The truth is I abused alcohol until my life became unmanageable, but I doubt that's a heartening thing to read in an applicant's cover letter.

Thanks in advance."

a7kqt1,106,2018-12-19,Having a Drug Problem on Campus,drugsThrowawaygt,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/a7kqt1/having_a_drug_problem_on_campus/,"Hey guys. Not actually 100% sure why I'm making this post; mostly to vent, I guess, but also to ask for advice. Pardon the wall of text.

Full disclosure: I consider alcohol be a drug. Some people disagree with this but put simply: if it's a substance you consume recreationally that alters your mental state, it's a drug.

*Just a heads up - the following gets a bit dark...*

I'm currently a 4th year in the COE (and not that it matters, but I have a pretty damn good GPA and am pretty involved in a couple orgs here on campus - so I'd consider myself a pretty high-functioning addict). I've struggled with ""mild"" substance abuse for most of my adult life. This is a very trimmed down version of my story.

It all started with trying alcohol in my freshman year having never drank before college. I loved the feeling of being buzzed a little too much. Whenever I managed to get my hands on alcohol, I would go through it pretty quickly. My second semester here, I got a fifth right before finals and spent almost 100% of finals week (including 1 or 2 exams) buzzed or drunk. My drinking contained itself to occasional binges until the start of my sophomore year, at which point I started hanging out with a lot of 21+ folks; I could get alcohol a lot easier, and boy did I. I started drinking lightly most days after class and blacking out every weekend. 

During this time, for a myriad of reasons, I started getting extremely depressed and starting down what was, in hindsight, a very steep downward spiral. My drinking and depression continued to get worse and worse, and at the start of my 4th semester I was at an all time low. I got really drunk and attempted suicide by hanging, but couldn't get myself to go through with it. Still feeling empty and worthless, I started self harming. After several bouts of hurting myself I started to get really scared that I was going to attempt suicide again so I went to the Counseling Center. I told them what was happening and their advice was (and I shit you not): ""If you start getting emotionally overwhelmed and thinking about killing yourself - try going to a quiet place and counting to 10 to calm down. If things get bad, call a help line"" (paraphrased and condensed a bit - but long story long I felt they offered me pretty canned and bullshit advice; I'm not making the advice about counting to 10 up...). I was still drinking every day (would put 2-3 shots in my coffee before classes and drink more when I got home) and still spiraling deeper and deeper. A week after the visit to the counseling center I was on the verge of self harming again, knife out ready to go, when I snapped and started having a mental breakdown. I managed to get myself to Stamps Psychiatry and asked to see someone immediately because at that moment I just needed to talk to someone about what I was going through and saw the counseling center as inadequate. Within 3 minutes of setting foot in the office of a psychiatrist I was informed I was being sent to Ridgeview. That hellhole is a story for another time, but I finally got the diagnosis of Major Depression.

After my hospitalization, I managed to get my alcohol use in check and stopped drinking every day.  I got put on meds but after a month with no positive effects I stopped taking them. It was at this point that I was introduced to Marijuana and instantly fell in love. I liked the ability to ""shut my brain off"" and block out my internal self deprecating monologue and feelings of helplessness in a way no anti-depressant could. For the rest of my sophomore year I would smoke occasionally, maybe once or twice a month, and was doing a lot better mentally but still felt overwhelmingly empty inside. I had decided at that point that I wasn't going to kill myself or self harm again, but nevertheless I felt like my life was meaningless and often fantasized about somehow dying peacefully in my sleep and leaving the world behind. At the start of my Junior year, I finally found a reliable dealer and slowly started smoking more and more often. Likewise, my depression started getting worse again. I quickly found myself in a similar state of empty worthlessness and unfortunately attempted suicide for the second time, but this time by self-strangulation. This time I was, regretfully, nearly successful. I managed to cut the rope from around my neck while my face was a shade of purple-blue I still sometimes have nightmares about; I had to wear makeup and collared shirts for a week to hide the bruises. I realized from this attempt that I didn't really want to die, but I also still felt like I didn't want to live either and basically existed as a husk of a person. I decided that I needed to take a break from campus, and took a Spring internship offer in California. I also continued increasing my marijuana consumption and by the end of the semester I was getting high every day after classes and slowly started to become more and more reclusive and began to abandon my friendships in favor of weed.

In January of 2018 I moved across the country and started work on the west coast where, surprise surprise, I got myself a medical card. Work was fun and engaging (albeit incredibly stressful at times) but I still felt dead inside. I rapidly settled into a rut where I would wake up, go to work, do my job in a brain fog, come home, get high, then wash rinse and repeat. I would spend most weekends getting unimaginably baked and laying around eating In-n-out and watching Netflix. I abandoned trying to be social, and ignored most of the other interns. While working, I also picked up cigarettes as well and they became yet another crutch to get me through the day. I was somehow performing well enough at work that they extended my position into the summer, and I continued to repeat the same cycle of constantly getting high until my internship ended in August.

I came back to Tech this Fall with the intention of turning over a new leaf and being clean, but that lasted less than a week. I started experimenting with more and more substances, and started moderately abusing Kratom and LSD, along with continued daily Marijuana use. This semester is when I finally started to realize that I have a real problem. I did most of my homework this semester high, starting showing up to class stoned more often than I'd like to admit, and started smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. Most of my weekends can be described as ""Benders"" and I could often be found on any given Saturday or Sunday either tripping balls or zonked out in bed on a combo of Weed, Alcohol, and Kratom. I've lost interest in all my hobbies, and I feel like I've lost my sense of purpose here and in life. 

Grand total - I've been completely sober for only 16 days out of 2018. 0 days if we count caffeine. I have a problem, and I need to stop. I was barely able to hold my academics together this semester and nearly failed one of my classes. I feel like shit all the time and I know deep down that I need to cut drugs out of my life or at the very least learn to fucking control myself. I feel like my mind and body are a bottomless pit I continually attempt to fill with narcotics in some twisted search for meaning.

End rant. Sorry if that was a hard to follow and jumbled mess. Good metaphor for my life, I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with similar shit and could share ways and strategies they used to kick or moderate their drug use? Also, is there a stigma against people with substance abuse issues that seek help with on-campus resources? 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

TL;DR: not-so-brief introduction into my descent into depression and daily substance use."

Not to sell myself short, I do have a more fulfilling resume than many of my peers who are in the same position, however I do not feel that my experiences resonates the duties that Will be required of me as a legitimate full time engineer. To clarify, I’ve currently been an intern for a small startup for 6 months, however I only work 10 hours a week. The quality of work that I was provided with, doesn’t reflect the time I’ve been there. The internship experience has provided me with some exposure to both the backend and front end tasks, however not enough to the point that I would feel confident in my own skills. I’ve performed some research from another company, where I programmed the logic code for a demo peer-peer blockchain network, but that’s all That I was able accomplish, before funding ran out. I am the Vice President of the cyber security club, which had drastically improved my soft skills, but only provided me with some exposure to cyber security, and not something that I would feel confident performing in. I also helped organize and host a hackathon on campus with a group of students.  Lastly, I’ve had some volunteer tutoring experience of a child’s version of an Arduino. The only area in my resume that I seem to be lacking is that I do not have an amazing personal project that I could present, and have to rely on a project that I completed for a homework assignment. My biggest concern is that I know I do terrible in technical-based questions, which I believe is the result of my lack of understanding of basic concepts that I had simply not retained. Despite my exposure towards the entire software development process, I do not think I can program efficiently to save my life. Most of my accomplishments were the result of figuring stuff out using google, rather than my own problem-solving abilities. I am currently taking a data structures course to familiarize myself with older concepts, but I was wondering if there is anything that I should focus on within the next few months to improve myself as a programmer, and a potentially efficient software engineer ?

My past 3 years between schooling (2017 grad) has all been in this field. I am not very good at programming but have lots of experience in agile development and working on small teams, tech collaboration, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Not surprising it didn't work out, and with about 1.5 years of being a full hire and 2 summer internships with this company I'm now unemployed. I feel like getting into the tech field with such specific knowledge but very little practical coding skills is a huge mistake— but I do like the working environment. I'm just not passionate about it.  


I am still very passionate about politics and history, and generally have kept up even while working. I have some internship experience in which I won an award in politics (2014) and my major is in politics. What sort of fields could I get into entry level to work in something that would apply my more analytical/tech skills and my love of research, writing, and reporting? I've been working on my resume and trying to find positions in NYC or DC. I am in NY and can easily move/commute to NYC over DC, but I find the current political atmosphere just too interesting to not try to get involved with.

&amp;#x200B;

I should say I have a political leaning, but I've worked for a republican and a democrat, and don't mind putting my beliefs on hold to get valuable experience. "

I was fired in 2014 because my performance sucked, which was a result of serious psychiatric issues (PTSD, depression, anxiety, undiagnosed ADHD, undiagnosed narcolepsy, among others.)  Like I said I worked odd jobs here and there but I'm only now starting to actually put my life back together.  I was actually homeless for several months in 2016.  Which, by the way, is a good way to discover who your real friends are... but I'm getting off track.

I'm in much better shape now, luckily the VA in my area is fantastic.  I also haven't been holding still re: my skills.  I've taken some classes at Harvard's Extension School and done some work through EdX.  But professionally I've done nothing in IT since 2014.  Also, the stuff I've been studying is pretty low level.  For example I took a compiler class and wrote a compiler for C, which was awesome but nobody's going to hire me to write compilers.  Everyone wants cloud architects and big data stuff.  I feel like an old man (heh) yelling at a cloud, but this shit's new to me.

And it shows.  I recently had an interview at my dream job, and I feel like I did well during the non-technical part of the interview (the recruiter specifically said I should apply again when I was turned down) but when I spoke to the hiring manager and the team lead, I really bungled the technical questions.  Now, part of this is because -- I'll admit -- I lied on my resume and said I've been doing ""contract work"" since 2014.  I haven't.

But I don't know what to put for that period of time.  ""Unemployed and homeless"" is not a hot seller.  ""Student at Harvard"" is great but, guys, I don't want to take an internship.  I'm 40 years old.  I'm not saying I deserve a plum position as a senior sysadmin just because I'm old and experienced, but I'm overqualified for entry level positions, and if ""Student"" is at the top of my resume, that's what people are going to think.

Any advice would really be appreciated.  I'm ready to get back to work, and I know I can learn the cloud stuff fast enough (I actually have been looking at EdX classes to get a baseline skill level in cloud stuff) but no matter what I learn, the employment gap on my resume isn't going away.  What's the best way to deal with that?"

This year I went to a resume workshop and changed mine to look a lot nicer, but so far there really haven't been any substantial results (still getting lots of rejections, but I have heard back from one company).

The closest thing I have to relevant work experience is a scale operator position where I managed the company database, but I was cautioned against removing the other jobs I've had from the resume because it would make it look like I had only one summer of work experience instead of 4+ years.

Also, how can I make my education section look better? I tried to emphasize the projects that I've done and showcase the critical classes that people are looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03862](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03862)

This paper was joint work with a faculty in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. The work was communicated to AAAI 2018 where it was rejected largely due to a complicated and antiquated writing style. The work was also signed as a qualifying project towards the completion of the PhD program.

In a personal conversation with the faculty, he had also told me that in most of his first paper communication, he took the lead in writing papers since it caters to his style of writing. He had done the same for another of his current student. That paper was also initially rejected and re-communicated to other venues where it was later accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

We had parted ways as student and advisors  due to unnatural communication between me and this faculty i.e., I was unnaturally told to think about a project at the intersection of causal inference and bandits, and within a span of another 3 days the faculty refused to continue working with me. I wanted to explore more modern ML methods and find meaningful intersections of these areas with Causal Inference i.e, Deep learning, optimization, theoretical computer science etc.

&amp;#x200B;

When the paper was initially rejected, in a personal email the faculty said that it should be re-communicated to UAI 2018 and that he would later ping me regarding this. However, I never heard back from him.

&amp;#x200B;

I  later found out that the theoretical sections of our work was communicated and  published in UAI 2018 co- authored with another student  who was not even admitted during the time of the initial paper communication. A lot of these ideas were jointly developed through discussions in the faculty's office hours.

[http://auai.org/uai2018/proceedings/papers/198.pdf](http://auai.org/uai2018/proceedings/papers/198.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the unnatural parting with this faculty, a number of concerns were raised and a large number of faculty members in Hopkins who were working on modern machine learning areas refused to work with me.

There were two other faculty members whom I wanted to work with. I later found out that they were internally warned not to work with me since I was in odds with this guy.  My network activities were monitored by the information security institute and some other powerful groups in Johns Hopkins University. This guy even suggested that I don't work with faculty members of my choice and pointed me out to another faculty member who possibly had more funding. One such faculty,  even remarked ""I don't hire students from India"".

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the urgency of finding an advisor I even had to visit groups who were not a remote match with my background just because they had financial support. However, they refused to come forward. I latter learned that I was internally mapped to some group in which I had no interest in working with and in which I wouldn't be able to contribute much.

&amp;#x200B;

The student co-authored in UAI 2018 paper even indirectly used abusive language about me in a Town Hall meeting in Computer Science department

I was harassed in the Malone Center of Healthcare by a concerted efforts of staffs, faculty and students who even stole personal information from my computer in my absence. I was also blatantly asked to relocate seats a number of times and a staff had the audacity to bark at me due to reasons partly related to this matter. When I sought help from this faculty (since he was my advisor at that time), regarding distracting events in my workplace, he chickened out and refused to come forth. The departmental chair and director did nothing about this matter. When I made protesting remarks at an institutional level, I was also dragged to medical facilities and administered with intravenous medications. Needless to say, that healthcare in Hopkins is a billion dollar business. They get extremely good endorsements. Bulk of students working in the MCEH are well-funded and are accustomed to doing very cheap quality research. However if you make a word of protest, they'll make you suffer like anything. Student's wont cooperate with you. You'd be left alienated.

&amp;#x200B;

Incidentally when I raised concerns about research misconduct, plagiarism and incidents of harassment, I found that this faculty was being backed by bureaucrats in the university particularly in the health-care, computational biology and some other groups (CLSP, AMS)

Despite producing substantial evidence about this event of research misconduct, the chair of the CS department, the dean of education and the dean of research misconduct closed this matter. I even escalated the matter to UAI chairs where the response was similar.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I protested against the university policy, I was personally harassed in my workplace and kept under constant surveillance regarding people I've been trying to reach initially for finding new collaboration and later  to expose this dirty act of misconduct. My network activities were all monitored, my accounts were hacked. The JHU information security institute and also CS has leading experts in hacking systems.  I had also protested vehemently regarding some old and archaic policy in the university and the department which prohibits students to make progress in academia. It should also be noted that Johns Hopkins (particularly the CS department)  is a very rich institution and pays their faculty very well. Its precisely because of this reason, a lot of faculty member who would've otherwise gone to other institutes for a better academic environment stays here even without tenure track positions. Also a number of faculty members who wanted joint-appointment in CS  radically took advantage of this situation. They would ask me to come and meet them again and again without confirming

&amp;#x200B;

This is a fact. JHU CS has very few faculty members who're working on core-ML areas. The quality of teaching and curriculum design is extremely poor and not in conformity to modern ways. A lot of faculty members have industrial collaboration and help students to find internship positions. Unfortunately the chairs and directors of the department still live in the stone-age concepts. There are cheap cliques among faculty members. A lot of groups can't tolerate others.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an international student of Indian origin . My credibility as a researcher has already been jeopardized due to this unnatural event.

I've been urgently seeking legal help regarding this matter. My immigration and financial status is also compromised.

I had also escalated the matter to conference chairs and NIH which funded this research but they closed the case saying that these things are handled at an institutional level.

&amp;#x200B;

I  am personally aware of a large number of  papers being published in academia (including Hopkins) in which students do the lions share of work while advisors take credit. I am also aware of instances in which only some student do the major part of the work while others are given credit since they made substantial participation or are in goodwill of the authors. There are other instances in which students simply have external collaborators who do the major challenging part of the work while other students are given free credit. I have enough evidence of a large number of such instances. In one such case, a faculty had also commented, "" Instead of exposing this acts to the world, why don't you simply get a recommendation from me and go find a job"". This dirty business is endorsed by some students who wants to stay in the good-will of faculty members and are seeking faculty positions themselves. Exposing these acts would also indirectly jeopardize their career.

&amp;#x200B;

In this case our work was simply stolen and given away to a guy who doesn't have any contribution to the paper (was not even admitted during this time).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also aware of a clique of researcher in academia who work politically. I don't have any collaborators in the US who worked in advanced topics. A large number of such joint works being published are due to major contribution OR good-will of a senior researcher who has high credibility in academic venues.

&amp;#x200B;

Johns Hopkins university boasts itself to be the first research institution in the US which gets billions of dollars endorsement! Under the veils of superficial glory, the real picture in various parts are insanely gloomy and even inhuman.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish to raise mass-awareness and request cooperation regarding this matter.

**First some info about my situation (tldr below).**

I'm 29 years old and I'm about to get into the industry (internship) and do what I truly love. I've been doing fun personal projects since 2011 mainly in Java, and I've been pretty serious in learning (lots of reading, frameworks, industry tools like git etc). I have fiddled with other languages but mainly Java.

&amp;#x200B;

These last years I paused my school studying (Computer Science) due to various problems of economic nature. I moved back to my hometown and worked for 3 years in an advertising company, which helped my communication/soft skills immensely. But as time went on, I found myself itching more and more to get into the industry, as I felt I was wasting time on something that I didn't truly like. Now I'm about to leave and start my internship, plus wrapping up school!

&amp;#x200B;

**So to my actual question.**

All these years programming I found out that I really love everything that has to do with **Graphics**, be it game development, science research, so I'm thinking of combining that with the recent trend in **AI** , which I'm interested in as well. Like visualizing data of sorts.

For that, I find Python to be a good medium for the above. Should I ""ditch"" Java and look into Python? Is the internship choice so significant? How ""ambitious"" can I be with that choice of a field?

Also, any further advice for starting out (especially at my age) would be most welcome! :)

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**

Java programmer about to get into the industry (internship). Should I go for Python for Graphics + AI? Does internship choice matter that much?

&amp;nbsp;

Started okay Freshmen year, but Sophomore year went awful. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2 semesters on Probation**, GPA dropped more than an entire point in one year. 

&amp;nbsp;

But Guess what? I still got an internship, took time to fix the issues I was having, tried to find new motivation to do well and bounced back. 

&amp;nbsp;

2 years and another internship later and I an now just 1 semester away from graduating, my GPA is almost back to normal, I have a _job offer_ upon graduation, and I am able to (for the most part) relax and enjoy break. 

&amp;nbsp;

***IT GETS BETTER*** ^If you stick with it

&amp;nbsp;

If you're struggling mentally, see ***CAPS***, there is no shame in getting help and it can save you from letting things get worse and getting dropped. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you are struggling Academically, Work with friends in the classes, see your professors, ask for help, and most of all... ***STUDY!!!*** It sounds silly and obvious but staying consistent and up to date on what is going on can save you from playing catchup and falling behind. Go to class! Turn in your homework! And actively listen to the Prof, they will often tell you EXACTLY what to study to help you succeed. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you are worrying that your major isn't right for you, Take a look at other options. Your Academic Advisor and the COO are great resources to help you find what you will enjoy and excel at. If you are in Engineering, check out Engineering Tech, especially if you are doing well in the labs but struggling on exams and classwork. (Guess what? They get almost identical opportunities, jobs, and pay in the real world)

&amp;nbsp;

Most of all, don't stress about the 4 year plan. Only about 40% of students graduate in 4 years, and that's OKAY! College is not a race, and retaining knowledge is going to be much more important than how quickly you finish. I chose to only do 12 credit hours my last 2 years so that I could focus and capitalize on those classes, and it has helped my GPA and information retention a ton. 

&amp;nbsp;

So if you didn't get the GPA or the Grades you wanted this semester, its not the end of the world. You can come back from this. Enjoy your break and hit the ground running in January. 

Happy Holidays, and BOILER the FUCK UP!"

Edit 2: The tl;dr's in bold now. Hopefully that makes it easier to find. Sorry. (There's also always ctrl+f if you're using a computer.)

Hi, I'm new here and wasn't sure if this was the right place to post after reading the rules, but in the end I still think this would be the most suitable place to talk about what's been bothering me for a while and maybe even ask for advice.

So somehow I graduated college with a degree in CS.

The punchline is that I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life, so I kind of coasted, but not in a good way, and now I know nothing and have nothing to show for my ""achievements"" other than the degree that I don't think I deserve.

So when did this all go wrong for me?

Well I passed my intro courses which went over basic programming and simple data structures and algorithms, but I don't think I ever really understood it completely and didn't put in the work to make sure the material stuck.

It was mostly my instructors guiding me on what to type in my IDE and me not paying attention enough when they were explaining concepts.

(I don't remember what other courses I took at the beginning of my college years other than my gen eds.)

This eventually came back to haunt me.

Fast forward to next semester and I'm suddenly taking a higher level data structures course and am getting destroyed by it.

I got a D and had to retake it.

Barely passed my computer architecture course that I was taking then too, but I'm sure that only happened because the instructor rounded me up since I never skipped class and at least tried to do the homework (even though most of the answers were wrong).

And then I got another D in the data structures course I had to retake the semester after.

(This one was taught by a different instructor, and the material that was used was a lot different from the last one I took, so I didn't benefit much from looking at old coding assignments and tests that I didn't even understand to begin with.)

I asked the instructor of that course for help a little, but didn't really understand what he was saying so I ended up nodding my head and pretended that I understood, which was a bad call.

After getting my second D in data structures, I went to see my adviser, who was also the department chair at the time (don't know if he is now) to see what I could do.

I didn't know how hard I was going to try, but I really didn't want to just give up.

Instead of retaking data structures a third time though, he decided to ""override"" my D so I didn't have to take it again.

(I didn't ask him to override my grades, he just said that he would do so, and I didn't have the nerve to say anything about it because I was afraid of either failing out of college or staying stuck in it for many more years, both leading to a seemingly darker future. Dropping out didn't seem much better either.)

So fast forward and I'm now taking two wireless networking courses, a database course, and a course about using XML and other things that I don't remember covering.

And I got a D in every course except for the XML course and one of the networking courses.

And my adviser decided to override my D's for that semester too.

So fast forward a little more and I get to my final semester of college, and I'm in a capstone project.

I was put in a team where we were supposed to make a web app (but really it looked more like a web site since we still used our browsers to look at the contents), and I'm in charge of making it look nice using Bootstrap.

Except I have no idea what Bootstrap is or how to use it (is Bootstrap even meant to make web pages look nice?).

In the end I used nothing but HTML and CSS to make the pages look good.

And then my adviser managed to let me take a course during winter break in January before the real semester started.

This was the last course that I had to take, and the requirements was for me to keep working on the web app as much as I could and send it to my team to finish it up for the semester where I didn't have to take any more courses. 

I also had to write a report and make a powerpoint presentation of what I learned.

The web app was looking a little better at this point, but that didn't mean it stopped looking horrible.

I tried to be as honest as I could in the report and the presentation without admitting that I basically didn't know anything or didn't really help the project at all (yeah I know, really honest of me).

Though honestly I feel like the instructor and even the team members already knew and rolled with it.

Fortunately the team was able to pick up after my slack and pass the class too (bless them, they're great people for doing so).

And now I have my degree.

But if you're still with me after reading all this, then I'd like to say that I don't think I deserve my degree.

At all.

I don't even want to put it on my resume, but then I feel like it'd be a waste since I already have it.

And I'm certainly not proud of what I did (or didn't do, I guess, which was get my act together and actually learn the material).

But the degree's still here with me.

I was so ashamed of myself that I didn't even walk in for graduation.

I had already moved back home.

I think it was also my shame that held me back from asking for help sooner, since I didn't think I deserved any.

And now here I am, still trying to find out what to do with my life.

I wanted to explain how my years in college went so people could understand how I got myself into this mess.

I made a lot of mistakes, and I've been trying to own up to them, but I think it's starting to become too difficult for me to handle on my own, especially when I don't even know what I'm really doing and am too afraid to tackle cs again.

In the end I still don't know what I want to do, but I think I'm starting to understand that while I don't love cs as much as I had hoped, I am still interested.

It makes me jealous when people talk about compilers, debuggers, etc and actually know what they're saying.

I also sometimes picture what life would be like if I was actually good at cs, but I've never made the effort to try again for real.

I hear there's this concept called ""top-down"" where you break a huge problem into smaller problems.

I tried doing that when I was trying to re-learn cs by looking at basic code after reading about the simpler data structures and algorithm concepts beforehand, but I'm still not sure I understand how people come up with the implementations or the logic behind them.

In other words I'm still interested in cs, but I hardly know anything about it, and am not sure if I can even get a relevant job if I wanted to.

I thought of getting into IT, but I feel like I'd have to know just as much as a software dev would, and the idea of having to learn even more than what I was already expected to know seems daunting.

I tried learning some web development, and honestly it was probably what saved me from not doing anything at all during my capstone course (because I was in the middle of learning it and that was how I even thought of using HTML and CSS in the first place), but I haven't had the desire to learn at a deeper level or use it to make any projects.

I've also been really interested in visual novels, and I wanted to see if I could hack their game engines, but apparently there are so many kinds of engines that I'd have to learn how they all worked if it was what I wanted to do.

(Right now this is what interests me the most, but I don't know if this would actually benefit me in terms of getting a job related to cs.)

Speaking of jobs, I've been failing the interviews that I was already lucky to have (big surprise right?).

I don't think I need to say how the whiteboard interviews went.

Some of the interviewers didn't even give me a whiteboard interview and just asked if I would be comfortable doing the job they described, but since I was basically bad at everything I tried in college, I was worried I wouldn't be able to do the job, and told them that I wouldn't be comfortable which led to me not getting hired.

I could've told them that I could do it, but I didn't want to lie anymore.

Doing badly in classes also discouraged me from finding internships in school, so I never got one.

I applied to a few, but I didn't get a response from any of them, and eventually just stopped looking altogether.

I was really overwhelmed in classes, and I guess I got terrified of looking at a lot of things that I thought would be cs related ever again.

I can't even remember the last time I launched my IDE.

I don't even know what an IDE really is or all of the things it can do besides opening up the command prompt and showing me what I made it output.

I guess this was more of a confession of how I ruined my life.

But I don't really want to give up.

And that's why I'm here.



**tl;dr** (questions are at the end) - I managed to graduate college with a degree in cs without having to actually do well in my classes.

I know nothing about cs and only have bad grades, no experience, and a degree that I don't deserve to show for it.

I realized that I don't love cs, but I am still interested.

Is it still possible for me to get a job related to cs if I wanted to?

If the answer is yes, then how would I go about doing it with the way things are now?

If the answer is no, how can I get good enough at cs to the point where I can get a job related to the field? (I'm aware that I will have to work really hard)

And how can I work hard to learn cs without getting burnt out or intimidated by it? I try to take baby steps but even that seems terrifying, and I don't know how I could break things down any smaller.

(Thanks for taking the time to read this.)

Edit 3: Thanks for all the comments so far. Some of them were pretty funny and it cheered me up a bit. The others were really helpful. I got a bit of a wake-up call/reality check, and I'm starting to get an idea of what I can do as well as what I should do. I made this post because I wanted to see what other people had to say, and I'm grateful to those who did say something. I guess I took advantage of this a little too much though and ended up talking about what was nearly as long as my life story. I didn't mean to make the post so long, but I thought leaving an empty line after every paragraph would at least make things easier to read. Sorry for the wall of text. And thanks again for reading."

After looking online, it seems that many new grads had to wait several months to find a software job, and I can’t go that long without income. 

Some context: I managed to get a 4.0 in my degree but it’s not exactly from a great CS school. I haven’t had an internship but I do have a lot of experience due to several fairly serious side projects. I’ve made several small video games while in school and some of them have been featured in art galleries. So, naturally, the job most related to my experience would be a gaming industry job, but there’s not much like that near me and the crazy crunch time scares me. I also have some iOS and Android experience but not much. I guess, with this sort of resume, how long should I roughly expect to wait for a software job?"
a7rhoy,2,2018-12-19,Unemployment Benefits Frustration,zombiexmuffins,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a7rhoy/unemployment_benefits_frustration/,"So, backstory: I lived in Florida for 2017 doing a paid internship. My contract ended, I moved back home to CT. I got a job that is seasonal, meaning we have two temporary shutdowns during the year (one in Summer, one in Winter.) On June 29th, I worked my last shift before shutdown. July 3rd, HR mailed me my pink slip to claim unemployment. I filed immediately. I got an email notification from the CT DOL website informing me I would have hearing forms in the mail to fill out pertaining to my claim. I received those papers July 10th and mailed them out right away.

Cue 20 days later, no word back from the state and I have now been unemployed for a month. I had to go to the job center since CT does not have a customer service phone line anymore due to budget cuts (thanks, Malloy!) The unemployment rep informs me a claim was opened in my name in FL. He gives me the contact information, and thus begins my turmoil:

July 30th- I call and speak to an agent about my plight. They put me on hold. They return with a fax number to their payment issues unit which will close the claim, processing takes about 22 days. I fax the information the same day.

August 7th: I call and try to find out more information on the claim. Another customer service rep tells me the same as before. I get frustrated and call the fraud line, and I speak to an agent who informs me that it isn't fraud and that the state of CT opened the claim in my name, and that the state of CT also should've mailed me a form to decide which state I wanted to claim in. I also find out that the claim in FL was opened on July 11th and denied in CT July 12th. Hmm..suspicious?

August 10th: mail out another letter incase the first one didn't go through. Also speak to a CT DOL rep online, and they informed me they did NOT open the claim and until wages are restored I will be unable to collect. Once they are restored by FL I can apply for back pay.

I then wait two weeks, hoping after the 22 days I'll call and have the claim closed.

August 21st: customer service rep is confused when I ask if the claim is closed, she puts me on hold, informs me she sent an email over letting them know I need an answer so I can collect back pay.

August 28th: rep sees that I've been calling since July 30th for an answer. She asks for my phone number, informs me she will call me if she gets an email from the payment issues unit. No response.

September 4th: Another clueless rep, she puts me on hold, tells me she sent an email asking about the status. No update.

September 13th: I speak to a rep who asks me if this is fraud. I tell her everything that has happened up to this point. I get put on hold. She tells me another email has been sent (where are they going???)

September 20th: I speak to a rep who realizes I have no employment information in the system and no driver's license. I explain to her my problem. She places me on hold, she tells me to fax a letter to the payment issues unit. I explain to her I have done that twice. She tells me the state of CT filed the claim to prove I wasn't already collecting. She also told me to check my status on the FL DOL website (which I do not have.)

At some point a rep in the FL DOL got frustrated with me and put in contact with an identity theft expert. I had a letter notarized and sent him copies of my SS card and my driver's license to prove I do NOT live in Florida nor did I open the claim to begin with.

This is when things get dicey..

I sent the information and got a call back from the rep saying everything was okay. I also was contacted by an office manager by the name of Michelle who promised the claim would be invalidated so I could file for my backpay owed to me from July 3rd until September 9th, 2018. I call the day before Halloween to verify through their customer service the claim has been closed and speak to a rude rep who is assuming I am being fraudulent when I explain to her why I am calling. She gets frustrated and tells me the claim is closed.

I drive to my DOL and find out from them the claim is NOT. CLOSED. and they still cannot fathom why it is open and until I provide proof they won't help me. So I have a breakdown and call the FL DOL customer service line again and speak to a rep who tries to argue with me that I'm acting fraudulent until I start mentioning names of people who I've talked too that are listed on my file. She gets a supervisor involved who is shocked this has been ongoing for three months at this point and he e-mails every single customer service rep and every manager I've spoken to to ask why nothing has been done. He also reached out to their payment claims department to ask why they never honored the two letters I faxed. I ask them to provide me with a letter, the rep tells me they cannot provide me with a letter because my mailing address is not in the system. They tell me to call back and check on the claim, so I do. I get put in touch with a woman by the name of Essie. For the past month I've tried getting in contact with her, only to find out today that they can't withdraw the claim in Florida because Connecticut filed TWO claims, one they blocked me from and the other one they filed in Florida in my name. Florida now cannot withdraw the claim because their system recognizes it as an out-of-state claim, as it should, because it is..I never filed in FL, I only filed in CT. Apparently they have their ""programming"" department working on it. I asked her if there was a way to get in contact with the CT DOL for me because today was my last day of work as I am now laid-off for my second seasonal shutdown until March 04. She informed me they tried to manually submit the information but CT refused to accept it manually because they don't want to pay overpayment, which they are inevitably going to owe me money anyway from my backpay from my previous shutdown, and the claim was never initially filed in the right  state to begin with.  I have been in contact with a Congressman's office in my area who is investigating the CT DOL, but when I have tried to reach out for legal advice elsewhere I am hearing it is either a Florida issue or a CT issue and no one seems to know what to do.

So..now I'm at my breaking point. CT is denying involvement in this and FL is saying they are the ones responsible.

So, smart people of Reddit, please help me. I cannot find any similar issues as this with solid advice.

I know this is a long shot since no one knows how to handle this situation or help me. Any guidance on what to do from here would be great. I appreciate you.

TL;DR: somehow a claim got opened in my name in a different state that I didn't open myself. No one knows what is going on, both states have conflicting information."

a7rm2v,445,2018-12-19,My boyfriend saved a life and it nearly ruined ours,darpachief,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a7rm2v/my_boyfriend_saved_a_life_and_it_nearly_ruined/,"About a year ago, I got the job offer of a lifetime. The one I’ve been dreaming of since I was 16. I work in a creative field, so it was a hard few years of wondering if my work would ever pay off.

This job offer required a move across the country. My boyfriend of 5 years—we’ll call him James—was so incredibly happy for me; seeing him break down in tears when I told him the news was maybe even better than the job offer itself. We met during a turbulent time in both of our lives, but we were so compatible that it never seemed like a chore. I met my best friend when I met him. 

In our old city, James was also pursuing a creative career, not his dream job, but a decent job. He had no qualms about leaving it all behind for me. I was so grateful.

James and I both grew up really poor, so he decided to cut off the feeling of panic of searching for the right job and picked  up a bartending job in the meantime (he bartended for years while pursuing his passion) so that he had some money coming in during our transition. 

Life was good. My dream job was BETTER than I imagined. I fit in, made friends and my relationship with James was also great, despite the 3000 mile move and the general chaos. He didn’t love bartending, he was having trouble finding a good fit at a day job, and his coworkers were all hard partying bar lifer types, which James is most certainly not. In retrospect, I see he didn’t really make any friends, and his job search was continuing to be fruitless.

After 8 months of living in our new city, in the summer of 2018, James worked a close at his bar shift, and after finishing up and leaving work around 2:45AM, he walked home the usual way (this is typically a driving city, but James is from the east coast and hates driving). During his walk, as he told me and later the police, he heard what sounded like ripping fabric and muffled screams coming from a nearby park (mini park, or parklet, I guess, basically just a refurbished lot), so he went to investigate. 

What he saw was a late 20’s male, beating and attempting to sexually assault a female, who we’ll call Kerry. 

James is not a big guy, about 5’10” and 175, but as he said to me “I’m from Philly,” and he immediately lunged after the guy, who thankfully was not armed. We found out later the guy was severely mentally ill and a combat veteran, just a generally sad situation if still fucking disgusting. Kerry said she and this man had been strangers. He committed suicide in prison before the trial date. 

He detained the man and had Kerry call the police. Thankfully another bystander happened by after a few minutes and helped detain the man.

He called me during this time as well, but I was asleep. When I woke up at 7am for work, he was finishing up at the police station and on his way home, as he had been texting me giving periodic updates via text. I called immediately and reached him—he picked up just as he walked in the door. We hugged and I burst into tears. I was proud, sure, and angry at him, but James has always marched to the beat of his own drum, and has a good heart. His coworkers threw him a party and a couple local businesses gave him an assortment of cash and gift cards, which he was uncomfortable with, but accepted at my urging. 

And then Kerry came back into our lives.

As summer drew to a close, James received a very long and sincere text from Kerry, who got his phone number from the responding detective. She asked, at her therapist’s insistence, that they meet for coffee. James, despite his seeming reluctance during his party and subsequent gifts, seemed VERY excited to meet Kerry again.  I was apprehensive, but told him to do it. He suggested I come, but we eventually settled on me waiting nearby while they met for coffee, so that we could do a postmortem right afterwards. 

They met for 90 minutes, about an hour longer than i had assumed. When James met up with me after, his eyes were red and it looked like he had been crying. He brought Kerry with him and we for some reason tearfully embraced each other as well. I guess I got caught up in the residual emotion of it all. I didn’t register until she walked away that Kerry was GORGEOUS. 

I thought they got closure, but Kerry started popping up more and more. It started with the texts. She would check in with James a couple times a week, innocuous at first, wishing him well, then they started just...talking. Connecting. I saw these early texts and while they weren’t flirty or sexual (despite her occasionally swimming right up to the line), they both shared thoughts and feelings about things unrelated to the incident. In short, they became...pretty much best friends.

Without trying to seem jealous or judgmental, I asked James, “Do you think it’s a good idea to stay in her life when she should be focusing on healing?”

He said that he felt like the incident had bonded them in a way that he couldn’t really understand, but that he felt extremely protective of her. He suggested that we all meet again. Kerry got my number from him and specifically invited the two of us to a Halloween party she was throwing. I thought that was nice, and the party was great. Kerry was incredibly nice and welcoming, and we learned about each other as well. Kerry’s apartment was HUGE, a condo, really, and she had no roommates. 

This continued, the 3 of us meeting up in a while to socialize, while they continued to text. One day James asked if I was cool with the two of them grabbing lunch alone, and I didn’t even balk, I just said to have fun.

The night after they went to lunch, Kerry texted me and asked me for drinks. I was feeling spontaneous, so I said yes. We went out and got pretty tipsy, and had some fun. We ended up stopping by James’ bar and then when he got off work, we went jack to Kerry’s place. 

One thing led to another, and the three of us ended up sleeping together. The drinks curbed some of my jealousy (her body was perfect) and James was a good sport about showering me with plenty of attention during. 

After we slept together. Kerry went downstairs to fix us a snack and James hopped in her shower. I’ve always been a curious sort, so I snooped idly around Kerry’s room. On a cork board, I saw an old picture of a man and a woman. They were probably mid-30’s, wearing clothing that placed them sometime in the 1990’s. The woman shared a resemblance to Kerry. Her mother. The man, I assumed, was her father. James came back first and I pointed out the picture to him (Kerry’s mom was beautiful too, thought he’d get a kick out of it). 

James went white as a ghost. “That’s him.” 

Kerry came back in the room. James and I have been best friends for 5 years. We know each other inside and out. I knew something was wrong.

“James got sick in the shower,” I said. Kerry asked if we didn’t want to sleep over, but I said it’s best if we headed home.

We were silent the whole ride, and the minute we got inside, James told me in no uncertain terms that the man in the picture and the man that attacked Kerry looked exactly the same.

Instead of speculating, James and I started investigating. We knew, from Kerry, that her father died young. Younger than the man in the picture, and that after her mom remarried to an awful man, Kerry cut them out of her life.

 I went through her Instagram and searched the profiles she followed. One of them turned out to be a cousin with the same last name. That cousin happened to follow Kerry’s mom on Instagram (Kerry didn’t), so we got her full name—let’s call her Carol—and did some more digging. I searched through court documents and found a civil case involving Kerry’s mom on some land deal. On the paperwork, there was another name, let’s say Fred. Fred was Kerry’s mom’s husband. A later document revealed that they had divorced. So, if we’re keeping track, Carol was married twice, once to Kerry’s father, and once to Fred.

Fred had a large trail on the internet. He was probably the complete opposite of the man Kerry described. Well respected in a financial field, a volunteer, a donor. Plenty of grandbabies he was always in a photo with. 

So we finally posed the question we were too weirded out to say out loud: Was the attacker Kerry’s stepbrother? And if he was, why didn’t she mention it?

We weren’t sure what to do next. The case was closed, for all intents and purposes. The detective never answered our calls. 

Kerry noticed when he became distance. Her texts only doubled in size, tripled in quantity. She could feel him pulling away. 

James would reply tersely or not at all, all the whole second guessing himself about the man in the picture and the attacker. Slowly, things, went sort of back to normal for James. But I knew him better than he knew himself. James has impeccable intuition, and I think his bond with Kerry was clouding his judgment.

I knew this couldn’t go on forever, so one day when James was at work I took a dive and called Carol, Kerry’s mother, from a number I found in a reverse lookup. 

Unbeknownst to me, Kerry was frantically texting James. “I can’t deal with the trauma anymore,” she texted him. “I’m sorry.” He left work and practically ran to her house. 

I started by talking about the incident, and then the picture. Carol sobbed on the phone. She told me that Kerry had always been different. She manipulated people, used her beauty to get what she wanted. Threw tantrums at will. As she went through puberty, her deviousness became more apparent. Her plans intensified. The family dog peed on her bed, and a week later it “ran away.” One summer, when Kerry was just 16, her stepbrother, 18—we’ll call him Glen— received an offer for an extremely competitive pre-college summer internship. It was unpaid, which meant that he’d need to pay for room and board, as the internship was in a different city. This money had been promised to Kerry for a used car. She was not just upset, she was apoplectic.

Kerry sent the internship a letter accusing Glen of sexual assault. They cancelled the offer, and referred the letter to the authorities and his college. Glen’s early acceptance was withdrawn, and Glen was briefly arrested before the DA decided not to press charges. The crux of the dismissal, Carol told me, is that Glen was a gay man. This sent shockwaves through their already hurting family—these people were conservative Christians. (Kerry herself mentioned quite often she was an atheist. We are too, but I definitely thought it was strange that she brought it up so often apropos of nothing). 

The doubt from the accusation ruined their family. Kerry left at 18 with an older boyfriend, and Glen left home immediately, never to return. They heard that he moved to a big city, spiraled with drugs, and they didn’t hear from him again. Carol and Fred has already divorced. Carol learned from me that Glen was dead. 

I called James, who didn’t answer, which I didn’t find strange as he was at work. I went by the bar because I just couldn’t  keep it in, but his coworkers told me he was gone.

I called again and he finally picked up and told me where he was. He had stumbled onto quite a scene at Kerry’s: what looked like an elaborate suicide setup, complete with pills, liquor, an open notepad, all spread over her bed. He was busy consoling her. I was too afraid to tell him anything over the phone, and he said he couldn’t leave, so I told him I was coming over. 

I rushed there. When I got to the door, my heart was beating out of my chest. I rang the doorbell, to no answer. I started pounding on the door. Finally, Kerry answered.

Her face was calm. Serene. She welcomed me in. 

There was James—my James, my world—seated at the foot of her bed. He saw me and saw something was wrong. 

“We have to go,” I said.

James knew me. He knew what this meant.

There was no epic confrontation. I was nearly paralyzed; it felt like being pulled in a thousand directions at once. 

James didn’t linger. Kerry wished us a good night and we went straight to a hotel. 

We changed our phone numbers. James quit his bar job via text. As I write this, my dream job generously offered me an extra week off before we were to shut down for the holiday anyway. We broke our lease, and moved in with a coworker of mine who temporarily had a spare bedroom. We’re back in our old city right now, visiting with family, unsure of whether I should go back to the same job in the new year. 

So we know the man attacking her was her stepbrother, but how did he find her? Was it chance? Was she the one looking for him? 

I was reminded of something today, which prompted me to write the whole mess down. The night we regrettably had a threesome, when Kerry and I were alone, she told me about the summer after her junior year of high school. 

She’d gotten a used car that summer and took a road trip along the California coast. It was the best summer of her life, she told me. "

I don't want to commute an hour and half one-way to college. I don't want to have a three hour gap between my classes. I don't want my whole day to be gone. I know I sound like a whiny baby, and that's why I am asking for help. I just feel so miserable about all of this, and I feel like I shouldn't be. I just want to be fine with all of this. It just feels so shitty. All of it. School. Work. Job. Student loans. Commuting. Global Warming. Etc. It seems like everything in this world is so miserable. I want to be the opposite and be optimistic, but I really don't know how to be? How do I change? I have a girlfriend who is completely the opposite of me, and I want to be like her. "

a7sw0u,1,2018-12-19,I don't know if I should take a job offer I just received.,quitoreditthrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a7sw0u/i_dont_know_if_i_should_take_a_job_offer_i_just/,"I have until 2pm Friday to make my decision. Just want some more people to weigh in. Throwaway because I'm a paranoid fuck. Long-ass post because I'm an anxious fuck.

**My current job:** Entry level sales development. Read: cold calling and email campaigns. All day. My boss is remote, the only other guy doing my job is remote, and I'm a shit salesperson. The part of the job I enjoy most is serving as an administrative assistant to my boss, because it's not cold calling. The culture of the company is decent, but I do not fit in at all with the sales team and don't feel challenged by the work. I took the job because I was led to believe I could explore other parts of the start-up (product team, services, etc - it's a software company) but my boss said after I asked 2 months into the role that that type of exploration will have to wait until I've been in the role for a year. Daily, I am bored, isolated, and unproductive. Because I plan to quit in 3-6 months (see below), this job has nothing else to offer me except the salary.

**The job I've been offered**: It's with a small media/entertainment company I interned at last year, as their content editor. The position would involve a lot of writing, which I like and am decent at, as well as editing copy, managing a team of freelancers, and doing some analytics/content planning. As an intern I found the culture to be not overly collaborative, but pretty fun and laid-back. I think I'd be challenged by this role and get to learn a lot as well as do some fun stuff and work in a cool industry. It's a 25% pay cut from my current job, and the commute is twice as long at least (which does matter to me a great deal - I hate sitting in traffic. I'd probably take the bus but regardless would be adding over an hour of commuting to my day). It would also be more work, because at present in my current job I'm kind of getting away with not doing much. But historically I've thrived in challenging environments and I think I'd appreciate feeling more utilized &amp; useful. I also enjoyed interning under the person who would be my boss.

**The hang-ups that make this not a no-brainer:**  I want to go to grad school (for interaction/UI/UX design) this coming fall. I'm working on applications right now. There are no guarantees I'll get in or be able to afford to go, but that is my long-term plan. I said as much in my editor interview, and thought I had shot myself in the foot by doing so. I guess not - they still offered me the job, and didn't say anything about grad school in the offer. So, if I take this editor job, I will hopefully be quitting in the summer to go back to school. It would be a six-month gig, more or less.

My plan before getting this offer was to work the shitty job until March, then quit and ""chill"" (tutor/wait tables/work part-time) until grad school. I'd been looking forward to using that time to relax, seek help for my depression (possibly brought on in part by current job), exercise, network, work on design-related side projects, travel on the cheap...just be young and semi-employed. So I kind of hate the idea of losing that. Although 6 months is a long time to ""chill"", especially with pending grad tuition. And if I took the editor job, I would still plan on quitting in June to give myself time to travel a bit and recharge before reentering academia.

&amp;#x200B;

//r/advice, what do you think? Do I take the pay cut and the more engaging job in a 'more fun' field I plan on leaving in 6 months, or stay in the higher-paying job I can't stand for 3 months, and then quit to relax? I can't decide if the grind of learning a new role at a new company, as well as a longer commute and less money, would be worth it to me. All I know is that if I didn't take this offer, I'll still be quitting my current job in a few months, because my mental health cannot stand being there for 40 hours a week.

I know it's my choice to make, but WWYD?"

a7sz3n,0,2018-12-19,Job application form tips and tricks,worldjobtrends,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/a7sz3n/job_application_form_tips_and_tricks/,"You’ve found a job you want to go for, but the thought of filling out an application form fills you with dread. Where do you start? The trick is to break the process into bitesize tasks to make it much more manageable.

What is a job application?

The job or employment application is the official form that employers ask all applicants for a position to fill out. ... The job application is a legally defensible listing of your job applicant's employment history, educational background, degrees, qualifications, references, and more.

Some companies require you to fill in an application form (or even several) to apply for a job. They do this is to find out whether you’re legally permitted to do the job, to get your contact details and to find out if you’re right for their company.

After that, as the applicant, it gives you the opportunity to outline your education history, any skills you have that are relevant to the job and your experience. This includes voluntary work, previous jobs and your current employment.

Application forms often require you to write a few hundred words, giving the employer the chance to see your literacy and written communication skills. As such applications may take more time than just firing off a CV. But, by filling one out you show the employer that you’re serious about wanting the job.

When do you need to fill it in?

Many job applications are long, so don’t leave it too close to the deadline before getting started. Give yourself time so you don’t have to rush.

What do they involve?

Most application forms include the following sections:

1. Personal details

This is the most straightforward part. Make sure you include all the relevant information in the correct sections – that includes your name, email address and phone number.

2. Education

You will need to fill in all your qualifications from secondary school (often including grades) up to degree level and beyond, if relevant. However, if you’re a more seasoned professional and are applying for senior positions, you can summarise your school achievements in a short sentence.

It’s important that you have the minimum educational requirements outlined for the job – many companies now use applicant tracking systems(ATSs), so if you don’t meet the asking grades, your application may be instantly rejected.

Interestingly, ATSs are often the reason for filling out an application form in addition to sending in your CV. The ATSs scan your application to ensure you’re a relevant fit for the role, and if you’re successful, a human recruiter will read your CV.

3. Employment history

It’s important to include your complete employment history, starting with your most recent job and working backwards – not forgetting any internships, voluntary or unpaid jobs and even holiday jobs.

If you have taken a gap year, make sure you include the details, outlining what you did and where you went, what jobs or volunteer work you undertook during that time and any skills you acquired along the way.

4. Activities and interests

When it comes to your personal interests and hobbies, include only those that may be relevant to the job you’re applying for – but remember to think outside the box. If you’re a member of a local amateur dramatics society, for example, and are applying for a job that requires any level of public speaking, ensure you demonstrate how one can benefit the other.

5. References

Ideally, you should have two references. One should be from your current employer, the other can be from a different employer, or a character reference from a current colleague.

If that’s not applicable – or possible – make sure you include someone who has worked with you in a permanent position, or someone who worked with you during a volunteering stint or internship.

6. Personal statement

Some application forms require you to write a personal, or supporting, statement. This is where you need to outline your reasons for applying for the job and how you meet the required criteria. Take time to put this together – it will allow you to demonstrate your suitability for the job.

Include what made you apply for the job, how your experience and skills make you the ideal candidate for this role and how your personality would make you an asset to the company. You should also provide examples from your current or previous employment to support your case.

Finally, don’t forget to include why this job would be a good move for your career and your long-term goals – but keep this part brief. The main aim of your personal statement it to showcase your suitability for the role and show how you can bring value to the employer.

7. Competency questions

These questions outline common work-based situations and ask how you would resolve them, using examples from your experience. It may be as straightforward as demonstrating when you worked as part of a team and what part you played in it. However, competency-based questions can occasionally be a bit trickier – they may involve describing a situation in which you implemented change, for example, and ask you to link it back to a time when you used certain key skills.

Top tips for completing an application form

When completing your application form, there are a few key actions you need to take:

Research the company and the job

Make sure all your employment dates are correct

Proofread thoroughly for spelling and grammar errors

Re-read it to ensure you are clear at all times

Always be truthful

Common job application mistakes

It can be easy to make mistakes, especially if you’re rushing through an application. Take your time and avoid making any of these blunders:

Spelling and grammar errors

Addressing the application to the wrong person

Not following instructions on the form

Not tailoring the application form to fit the job you are applying for

Leaving gaps in your employment history

Missing the deadline

Remember to keep these tips in mind when making your job application the best it can be.

A popular science writer was found in a psychotic state in the Sahara desert by the US embassy.  He was sent to my facility to be interviewed. The first part of the interview was posted [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a7hrjf/strange_people_an_interview_with_a_mad_doctor/) yesterday. 

\-Peter Harrington

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interview Part II**

Several days later he and I had arranged to meet up to talk logistics. I was to take a plane from JFK to London. Then from London to Cairo. Then from Cairo, I was to take a smaller plane to Nouakchott Mauritania. There I would need a private car that would allow me to travel all the way to the final destination. I was guaranteed first-class airfare the whole way. 

I left early on that Tuesday morning for my journey. I met the same odd-looking man, whose name still escapes me, and he told me he would not be able to join me on my trip there. I was greeted by what would be my two bodyguards. They were two tall men, almost identical. They were stereotypically wearing sunglasses and black suits. Harry and Jacob were their names, and they were not gifted in the art of conversation. Nonetheless, they led me to my plane at JFK and we set off. 

I slept most of the way to London and had the same luck on my way to Cairo. From Cairo to Mauritania The plane was smaller and bumpier as we flew over the Sahara desert so I got less sleep. I had never seen a sky so blue. What would have been a rather tedious journey was quite comfortable. In fact, the first class seating was more comfortable than many hotel rooms I have been in. 

The plane arrived at Mauritania and we were greeted on the runway with a desert jeep. The driver did not speak English but Harry did and talked about my travel logistics. The driver gave me a bottle of ice cold water and my bodyguards changed from suits to light clothing for the desert weather. We set off with a full tank of gas for a  drive in the Sahara desert. 

Jacob told me it's not a far drive, only about 33 miles outside of civilization. The desert plane was a surreal place. In the distance, I saw a valley of cliffs. As we drove, these cliffs got larger and larger like some great creature was pushing up structures from the ground. These sand cliffs looked like UFO’s and stood like volcanos against the blue desert sky. We spent about an Hour in this valley at a very slow pace and finally made our way into a flat part of the desert. The desert hills were immense, and our tactful driver made his way smoothly over these hills as I had never seen. He was a true master at his craft. Suddenly in the distance, my destination came into view. 

I could decipher the outline of a great architectural structure. A glass skyscraper was blending into the blue sky. It was an immense building and almost resembled some sort of las vegas casino. It was divided into three main sections. There was a central dome which stretched at least 30 stories into the sky and was about 4 times as long vertically. The other two structures were identical cylinders that stood at either end of the great dome. They were almost as tall as the dome but significantly skinnier. 

This must be the center of what goes on in the world, where the evildoers who pull the strings meet to discuss their plans for world domination. I thought this jokingly.

This structure remained in our horizon for what seemed to be an eternity until finally, the building appeared before our feet. Outside of the dome, there was a team of men waiting for our arrival. There were seven of them all wearing a matching white uniform. 

“Hello, Dr. Aaron.” Said the one in the middle with a mustache. “We have been waiting for you. Please follow me. These men will get your bags to your living quarters. We have a show to attend.” 

My bodyguards and I followed the man in the middle into a large set of glass doors at the main dome and I entered with a gasp. The place was dark, with very little natural light. The room I was in was filled with men carrying guns, television screens with news from across the world. Surveillance videos of politicians and celebrities, military tanks, aircraft and all sorts of expensive machinery. Near the end of this large room, I saw many sets of doors and windows leading god knows what kind of bunkers. 

“Please keep up Dr. Aaron, we will have plenty of time for a tour when after the show is complete.” I followed the man with a mustache until we reached the fall wall and entered a door. This door leads us down a long corridor lit by lights on the floor. At the end of the corridor, I heard circus music. But as opposed to being in a happy key, it was in an out of tune minor key. 

We entered the next room to find a large coliseum filled with about 200 individual booths. I was guided to my own which looked down into a large pit with flashing strobe lights. I sat down apprehensively in my booth thinking about how stupid I was to go on this trip. My booth was for a party of four, with leather chairs to sit in. There was a bar behind me with an array of alcohol and a bartender from a foreign land. My guide with the mustache had left me with my bodyguards and I felt alone in a strange land with no hope of escape. The room was dark except for the strobe lights and the faint glow from the other booths. I could tell whatever kind of people were in this room with me were eviler than I had perceived. Sacrificing goats? What kind of place did I think this was? Nothing is as scary in thought than in practice. As I sat in anxiety the arena lit up completely. Suddenly, a voice came from the loudspeaker and the man with the mustache returned. “From the left corner, we have our first competitor, The Giant Machabra.” 

A large man walked out of the door and entered the arena. He was a regular looking man, perhaps of Russian descent except he was about 8 feet tall. Nothing about him was odd except for his large body. 

“And from the right corner, we have a new competitor, Spritzee the Pinhead.”

Suddenly someone with Microcephaly walked out of the gate, short and helpless. I almost got sick to my stomach. “Let the fight begin.” 

The tall man from the left corner ran at the poor innocent victim and started pounding him in the face. Within a few minutes, the poor pinhead was beaten to a pulp, almost unrecognizable as a human. The brains were gushing on the floor and I could hear the sound of the skull-crunching. The poor thing let our a noise like the whimper of a dog but was soon silenced by the final blows. The giant man began to screech in delight as the audience around me began to clap in a slow ominous way. 

The pit below my booth went dark again for several seconds until the announcer announced of the next competitor. He called the next competitor Parcelo the Dwarf. As he entered the arena I saw that it was just a little person who was going to face off against this giant. He was equipped with a sword to fight, but I don't know what use this would be. The fight began and the same damn outcome was reached. The poor little person was beaten to the point of no return, a pile of bones guts and stench. 

The announcer spoke once again, “And now, the competitor you have all been waiting for. You may know it as the Ice dancer, or the white night, but we know it as The Thing from Lithuania. Get ready to witness, the fiercest thing that has ever walked this earth.”

The giant man looked up with fear. I held onto my seat anticipating what sort of madness I was about to encounter. From the right corner, a shadow came out of the door into view. Below me in the pit below was something that was not human. This creature was how the man who recruited me described, pale and lanky. It walked like a tiger on all fours though it had the limbs of a primate. The long black hair on the top of its head covered its face, but I could barely make out its eyes. They were the eyes of a dead man. 

The giant man stood up for several seconds and then lunged at the thing crawling on the ground. The thing leaped up and bit the giant on the neck. The giant threw it to the ground and tried to tackle it. The thing maneuvered itself out of the giants reached and climbed on the giant, devouring his neck. The giant man screamed in agony and began pounding on the thing. The thing bit off the fingers of the giant and started ripping its flesh. The giant then was silent and soon became the mangled pile of flesh that was the fate of his former victims. The thing screamed out into the arena and started dancing. It waved its arms in the air and sang a song in a voice that sounded both like the screech of a hyena and laughter of a man. Its dance was the most horrific ritualistic movement my eyes had ever witnessed. . .

This was my patient.

a7tjc8,1,2018-12-19,Possible career in Public Health?,diamondrosegold,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/a7tjc8/possible_career_in_public_health/,"Hey all, would appreciate some advice and guidance as I try to go forward and put together a career path. Also feeling a bit down recently being 23 and seeing my peers going off the grad/medical school while I'm still trying to figure out where I want to go in life:

- I have a BA in Psychology, graduated top of my class. Enjoyed the theory and science behind it.
-Recently got certified in medical coding (apprentice) 
-Worked in HR for a year, hated it
-Currently an office assistant in a medical office, struggling, overworked, been here little over a year.
-Studying to take the GRE, the issue is what to get my Master's degree in.
-Was also interested in biology in high school 
-The work experience I have is basically insurance claims, medical coding and recruiting (Human Resources) 

I was considering a Master's in Psychology; however, I interviewed and trained for a day with a place that teaches autistic kids, turned down the job offer and felt that it wasn't for me. Also not interested in one on one counselling.

What I toke away with my undergrad in psychology was a passion and love for research... literature reviews, surveys, qtesting, data analysis, report writing, finding trends, statistics...all of it. Also it's pretty much why i approached medical coding as it deals with health data. However, medical coding is something I went after to experiment in and I don't see myself making a career out of it.

Basically what I have decided on was finding a career path that helps people make better choices to enhance their overall well being , while involving research and data.

Using the background I have, I'm considering Public Health, either specializing in social sciences or biostatistics. Perhaps working as a health plan coordinator or in epidimeology.

However some of the road blocks I'm having is that the field as well as research on the whole is very underveloped in my country (I live in the Caribbean) and it's difficult to find mentors or peers to network with on the topic as well as research opportunities. 

My main steps towards working toward a degree in Public Health are:
- Currently working on studying for the GRE
-Looking for courses to do online in data analysis
-Reaching out to public health ministry for information or internships (difficult while working full time) 

It's what I could put together with the limited resources but I'm open to any advice on how to tighten my plan or to hear from those in the Public Health field and how they got there.

Thanks so much in advance!"
a7tlk8,0,2018-12-19,How long did it take for you to burn out? I lasted 3 years.,Ithrewmycareeraway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a7tlk8/how_long_did_it_take_for_you_to_burn_out_i_lasted/,"I just wanted to share some of my experience. I didn't know what I wanted to do specifically after college. I bounced through 3-4 majors before I realized I liked computers, programming was relatively straightforward, and money was really nice to have. I settled on an IT major (so business information systems) because I had been taking business courses. I wanted to graduate in 4 years and nothing more, so I did. I had 1 java course, some ABAP programming, a couple SQL, and a couple VB courses. 

I loved my internship I had before my senior year. I worked on a team that was doing some really cool things and a lot of work I did was used in something that they are selling on the market today to retrofit vehicles with wifi. Everything was awesome and it confirmed that I was in the right major. 

Then I went back. I had a green manager and was doing garbage work. He didn't know what to do with me but wouldn't let me do work for other things. I got put in a project management role over interns (right I was less than a year out of college and PMing already). When they left I was still the PM on a project that no longer had the support of most of the previous people. That lack of meaningful work and lack of support with the same expectations of output made me leave that company. 

I found a company with a team I really liked. But the work was rough. It didn't help that the team was barely 50/50 outside consultants and actual employees. And had only been around for a year before I got there.

I was writing SQL all day everyday working to validate data. Some point in here I went through some personal issues and let one item fall behind. I couldn't figure this one thing out and it sat with me for 3 months as a low priority. I had more pressing work and this one item to update an SQL query got put on the farthest of far-back burners for me. 

In this time my manager also switched. The problem with that was my previous manager thought I was working too slow. And on that one single thing, I was. But instead of getting a clean start with the new manager, my old one told her what her opinions were of me. I had already talked with my previous manager and addressed the issue and had taken corrective steps. I got my act together and fixed my pace. But old manager never saw it because I was no longer reporting to them. 

The 2 of them blindsided me one day in a meeting that was supposed to be a one on one with ""We think you need to work faster &amp; better."" My new boss didn't say a word. I had a counter argument for their specific issues and neither wanted to hear it. I collected figures on my work pace showing it was increasing and I was closing more tasks. Neither wanted to see it. I hated working for this company and I think they knew that I wasn't drinking the koolaid. I decided I wanted to be happy so this week I quit IT. "

Just to prove to myself that it was possible before developing it, I POSTed some sample entries with specific geometry (x and y values going up to six decimal places, well within map boundaries) to the feature layer through the relevant 'Add API' service URL. 

These entries were accepted and are visible on the feature layer's table of entries. They were assigned ObjectIDs and GlobalIDs. But when I scour the map, I find they are not visible as points.

Is there some specification that I have to make in the JSON POST to set them as points? Is there a flag for visibility that I have to set? Do I have to add more decimals to my longitude and latitude?

I snagged an internship this Winter at a local mill for IT-Computer Science in an office building (White collar, I'm not actual in the mill but in a cubicle).

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the technologies are older, i.e. **Mainframe** and **COBOL** coding w/ **JCL** (jobs)**, IMS, DB2,** databases and that's the *group* I currently was put in (although they do have newer technologies like Java/ASP.net in other groups). I would also like to add , the average age there is much older, like 40yo+ with only a few people (probably just me) between 20-30yo.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what is the best thing I can do to make the most of this experience? I would obviously rather program in Python, C++, Java since that's what I used in University. Can I:

1. Is it too early to switch to another group or ask, will that make me look bad? (i'm doing the mainframe stuff b/c there was shortage at the moment)
2. I wrote small programs and way more complex stuff with electrical/computer engineering at University... is it bad to be getting seemingly ""trivial"" tasks currently as an intern? I don't want to come off as cocky, but doing trivial things (like maintaining or editing small bits of COBOL code) seems super basic and I feel like I have so much more potential.... is this just the reality I need to accept?
3. How do I deal with my coworkers? A lot of people seemed introverted (cubicle setting) and some people are incredibly helpful, while others I get the vibe they feel threatened by me because I'm younger and more fast/witty, while they are at the end of their careers and don't even know Java or stuff like that , because all they have done is Mainframe stuff. I find it hard to balance letting them know I'm confident/competent without coming off as a cocky sometimes.
4. Either way, will this experience boost my resume? It's my first IT/CS/programming internship, so I'm hoping it does. I'm doing a lot of meetings, training, and have my own cubicle, so I feel like I have been learning alot. Though going to a bigger city working with newer technologies would be more ideal

Thank you for any input! "

I have been in the industry for about1.5 yrs. Unfortunately, my first job had a really bad culture and I only stayed there close to a year (\~11 months or so) This was an entry level starting at 65k.

When I switched companies I received a better offer and went from 65k to 73k(3k sign on bonus) however the position was an entry level as well. I started around March this year and one of my goals was to move up to the next level but after getting my final review I seem to not be ready yet and just received a yearly raise. Feedback I received is by mid next year or the end of the year I should be up to the ""standard"" of a mid.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I really don't feel encouraged to pursue a promotion and just jump ship (once my 2 years are up) which sucks b/c I like the company where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

any advice?

thanks guys.

I am a first-year CoE student. I did pretty well last semester (ended up with a high gpa), but I've only taken classes from the core requirements (eg. linear algebra, physics, chem, english, cs1301, etc) and will be taking the first major-related class next semester. Outside of class, I joined a few organizations/clubs but was only a general member. Plus, I'm thinking about stop going next semester as I did not like them much. I guess I am still figuring out what my interests are. Should I even try applying for summer 2019 internship? I don't think I am outstanding or competitive in any way (academic-wise or engagement-wise) and I don't believe any company will even look at my resume. Should I just wait for another semester and take more classes in my major and be involved in some organizations I like and apply as a sophomore next fall? I feel so bad and anxious as some of my first-year friends already got offers. I came from a small high school in a not-so-good neighborhood, and the student body at tech is so competitive that it made me lose confidence in myself entirely. 

Did you guys do any serious internship after your first year? If so, did you find it through careerbuzz? What are some websites that are helpful when it comes to looking for internships? How to make the most of the career fair? I attended the one in fall but did not get much out of it (I talked to a few and was told to check their websites for qualifications and apply online). 

Thank you for helping a desperate first-year student out in advance. "

I have already taken an Intro to C++, advanced c++, and intro to java courses. As well as a variety of other Gen Eds. 

Unfortunately, I learned that none of my programming classes would transfer, so I would have to repeat them. This lands me at 30.5 units that they’re allowing me to transfer in. That basically 1 year of work, so technically i am a semester behind even though I’m a sophomore standing for the spring. (I just turned 20 If that helps )

Honestly, I am not complaining that i have to redo my programming classes because my instructor pretty much just made us copy what she wrote on the projector. I gathered some information but I lack any real concept of how computer science actually works. A metaphor i can try to explain this is , “I have learned some letters in the alphabet. But i have no idea how these letters arrange to make words and what these words mean”

I am assuming that my first order of business will be to focus on getting an internship. What should i focus on now, even though I am pretty much starting this degree from the beginning, to be a better programmer. I’ve never been a university student before.

Also feeling a bit down recently being 23 and seeing my peers going off the grad/medical school while I'm still trying to figure out where I want to go in life:

- I have a BA in Psychology, graduated top of my class. Enjoyed the theory and science behind it.
-Recently got certified in medical coding (apprentice) 
-Worked in HR for a year, hated it
-Currently an office assistant in a medical office, struggling, overworked, been here little over a year.
-Studying to take the GRE, the issue is what to get my Master's degree in.
-Was also interested in biology in high school 
-The work experience I have is basically insurance claims, medical coding and recruiting (Human Resources) 

I was considering a Master's in Psychology; however, I interviewed and trained for a day with a place that teaches autistic kids, turned down the job offer and felt that it wasn't for me. Also not interested in one on one counselling.

What I toke away with my undergrad in psychology was a passion and love for research... literature reviews, surveys, qtesting, data analysis, report writing, finding trends, statistics...all of it. Also it's pretty much why i approached medical coding as it deals with health data. However, medical coding is something I went after to experiment in and I don't see myself making a career out of it.

Basically what I have decided on was finding a career path that helps people make better choices to enhance their overall well being , while involving research and data.

Using the background I have, I'm considering Public Health, either specializing in social sciences or biostatistics. Perhaps working as a health plan coordinator or in epidimeology.

However some of the road blocks I'm having is that the field as well as research on the whole is very underveloped in my country (I live in the Caribbean) and it's difficult to find mentors or peers to network with on the topic as well as research opportunities. 

My main steps towards working toward a degree in Public Health are:
- Currently working on studying for the GRE
-Looking for courses to do online in data analysis
-Reaching out to public health ministry for information or internships (difficult while working full time) 

It's what I could put together with the limited resources but I'm open to any advice on how to tighten my plan or to hear from those in the Public Health field and how they got there.

Thanks so much in advance!"

I'm really sorry if it isn't!)

tldr Does failing the first round phone screens for companies come back to bite you in the butt when you reapply next year?

Edit: sorry, I should clarify that these first rounds I failed were completely technical, no behavioral at all.

I'm a shitty coder, no sugarcoating that. I've heard back from most of the Big N's regarding my application and failed every one of their phone screens- even ones regarded as commonly easy. I know this is a problem with my coding skills, and it's my own fault for not studying harder, I'm not complaining about failing because I know it's a me problem.

What I'm worried about is if it will affect my future applications to those companies. It's embarrassing (for me, at least) to have failed super easy questions in the very first round of coding- which are designed to weed out those who suck, like me. I understand/know that most companies have a mindset that a candidate has room to grow- but is that only applicable if a candidate failed at an interview that wasn't the very first one? Does a candidate, like me, who fails in the very first round and doesn't make it through get on some sort of blacklist that we're really shitty definite no-hires, even for the future? I also applied to these companies for internships, if that's relevant, although I'm a junior right now and next time I apply will be for full-time positions.

I'm worried because I recently heard back from the last big N who hadn't contacted me yet- and I've been putting off completing their first interview because I know I'll bomb horribly. Even if by some miracle I make it past the first round, I'm definitely getting rejected in later rounds. 

I've often heard that you miss all the shots you don't take, but I know for a fact I'm most definitely failing the first round of this company, and I really don't want to go through with it if it'll harm me later down the road.

Thanks for reading! I would really appreciate any insight into this, since I've heard different things from my friends (some say the companies understand you'll grow, some say they never heard back from companies they reapplied to after bombing the first round a year earlier, etc.). I'm pretty worried, seeing as I've screwed up the first rounds for several top companies already and this is one of the last top companies where I haven't made a fool of myself yet.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much for all the responses, guys!! It's definitely made me feel a lot better and a LOT less worried, haha! I might as well just go for that last Big N interview then, and get that 4/4 track record on failed Big N first rounds :'D Going to practice like mad for the entire year so that if I ever hear back from them again next year, I'll be a lot more prepared."

I was not fired, but I decided to leave in hopes of landing somewhere with a much more normal and friendly work environment.  I have been on the hunt for a job for the past 5 months now, with the usual dance of applications, interviews, and rejection. It's yielded nothing but discouragement and I am starting to run low on my savings. 

To give some perspective, I'm holding a Bachelors of Science degree so I have been trying to make the change into a STEM field. But switching industries has proven to be extremely difficult. It's not like I have no experience. I've got 10 years working with the public, the state, and some lab experience. Just nothing too far in any of those directions.

Recently, the place of employment that I had left has been offering to take me back, and believe me when I say, to me, that would be a huge insult to myself and the sign of utter failure. However, I am not entirely in the financial position now to pick and choose. So i guess my question is should I just swallow my pride and go back to the worst place on earth and take the damn check? Or Should i seek out unemployment/low income plans until I can find something that wont leave me hating myself and the world every day. I just need some insight from someone who may have been in a similar situation. 

I know many of you may probably say something along the lines of ""a job is a job/you don't have to like your job blah blah"" I get that, and I know that feeling. But I am talking an environment with fighting escalating to a near-physical level, people going out of their way to make sure another employee makes little to nothing for pay and actual sociopathic coworkers. It is NOT a good place. But what choice do i have at this point? I have to make rent, and provide for my family so some shitty internship or 14/hr job is out of the question.

Most of them say I lack experience for the position ( from recruiter email ) which I feel like during my interviews im not doing a good job at really highlighting everything that I am capable of doing in my jobs. The questions where I feel I couldve done better at explaining or atleast feel like my answers werent the right ones, 

""How did you handle an aggressive enduser?"" 

""What is the most difficult challenge you faced in IT and how did you address it?""

""What is the OSI model?""

""What are the advantages and disadvantages of Cloud?""

""What do you do in Active directory?""

I am getting discouraged because I am more than confident to handle a Tier 1 Support job, I feel like the employers  are really looking for an overqualified candidate rather than a new graduate which hinders my leverage. I would not mind looking for internships but most of them arent until the summer or fall of 2019. I am in need of immediate work since my current company is shutting doors. Of course as of right now I am still applying to many as jobs as I can every morning on Indeed.

By next year I am in progress finishing my CCNA. However, in the IT industry I am more interested in going InfoSec and completing Security+ then CISSP. I am applying to those jobs right now because thats what are available around my area and its work I can confidently do which Ill use as a gateway to gain more experience and hopefully be promoted or move towards new positions and finish my certs.

I have been involved in CS more or less for two years now. My degree is in digital media (from the communications college), however after graduating, I became more and more interested in tech.

To get my foot in the door, I went to a bootcamp, developed a product over the course of a year, and since then have been working at an internship at a start-up as a full-stack dev.

I have been applying for new positions as the start-up I am at has been taking their time in offering me a full time position and, as a foreign citizen, I need to come up with a solution rather quickly from a visa point of view.

I received a job offer for a back-end position at another start-up, however not in paper. I took the day off of work, went to their office, and the CTO offered me 36,000 euros and I accepted. However, over the past few weeks he/their HR department seemingly have backed out. They say I need more experience and if I can prove that to them (through projects on github, writing to them weekly, etc.) they will offer me a job in February. 

To be honest, it would be a great opportunity, but I am a bit hurt that they offered me the job initially and have later told me that it is not a possibility with my experience (which has only improved since then). I also am weary that they will retract their offer again.

I am nervous that I will keep running into companies that will take advantage of the fact that I have no formal training in CS. So for now, I am considering going back to school. My main question for you all is if you think it would be better to go for a masters (in product design?) or to get a former bachelors degree in CS.

Thanks for reading.

TLDR; studied something unrelated to CS and now am wondering if I should pursue a masters or bachelors."

I previously applied for an internship there and wasn't given one, and the interviewer asked why I didn't land one. I told her that my resume might have indicated that I was an embedded systems developer, because I had a few C projects. She disagreed, but didn't indicate what she thought it was. So obviously something isn't working out, and I'm wondering if maybe Computer Science isn't for me? Does anyone have any signs that they experienced (if they still hang out around this subreddit) that told them that maybe CS isn't for them? I have one quarter left of school, but I feel like this is a big sign that maybe its not something I'm cut out for, and I'm considering finishing my degree then changing majors to something I might fit in more with. Any ideas of majors I can switch into would be a huge help too."

This is my first post and I’m on mobile so apologies in advance.

Im a STEM major in my last year of undergraduate and I’ve been trying to secure any sort of internship for the last 3 years and have gotten nowhere. 

It doesn't help that I basically failed my 3rd out of 4 years (due to mental health issues) and had to move to a ‘low-tier’ university to continue my undergraduate degree.
Im in my last year now and Im doing well and getting good grades. 

But for every available internship I have applied to I have been met with rejection.

Im just wondering how I would be able to secure some sort of internship in STEM or just get my foot in the door so I have more experience once I graduate this upcoming summer.

Thanks!"

Problem is, I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing! I asked the counselors for help step-by-step but ended up receiving general information like you need a resume, cover letter, etc. But I was never told or taught how to go through with the process of obtaining an actual internship. It sucks, as I am going to be the first person in my family to be able to graduate high school due to my parents being foreign, unable to get education, and a younger brother in elementary school. There isn't really any help they can provide at all as they haven't done it themselves.

As of right now, the school has a policy where I can only find internships strictly related to my major and in this case, IT so like networking or hardware, etc.

I instantly thought of Micro Center as I really love building PCs and technology and it'll jackpot if I can get into it, but I don't really know where to start, like who to contact and where to get the information (maybe contact store info? for any company)

I’m in my second year of a BS in Math and CS; I have a FAANG internship, but a 2.8-2.9 GPA.

Normally, this wouldn’t worry me that much if I’m selective for jobs after anyway, but I used to seriously consider grad school in CS/math as a career path before realizing how much I hated classes and academia. 

The thing is, while I do dislike the state of academia in my school, I do really love parts of both math and CS. I don’t particularly want to transition off to management in my career, and would rather do something deeply specialized and technical for a majority of my career instead.

My favorite languages by far are C++ and Rust (not necessarily in that order - the latter is more exciting, but less stable,) and I also really like Haskell, OCaml and things like that. I considered trying to HFT, but was turned off by the fact that most quants are PhDs, and that there seems to be no other reliable way to break in.

What are my options? As I mentioned, I really don’t want to transition off into something I’d find non-intellectual compared to my preferred low-level/functional programming and discrete math like frontend web-development. I do mostly well in classes that require a lot of C code, excelling in projects that might involve a simple multithreaded C server or a multi-processed file reader, and this is what got me interested in C++ and Rust. 

Is it possible for me to do something that’s low-level or even something involving mathematical rigor with just a BS, or do I have to bite the bullet and figure out how to circumvent my GPA and distaste for most classes in order to get an MS/PhD?"

I’m a bit confused as to what career options there are for someone like me and am hoping that someone would be able to clarify.
From what I can tell, the options seem to go along the lines of being a developer of some sort or doing research orientated work. My impression is that developers work at a high level(?) and people who conduct research in the field of computer science work at a low level (usually) in a narrow part of the field.
I usually find myself very interested in how something works and the math behind it. This leads me to think that I would work better at a lower level in doing research orientated work, but I’m not sure.
Particularly I am concerned about the financial aspects too, since from what I gather _____ developers seem to make very good money, so is going to grad school for a masters or (more likely) a PHD worth it to do research, which I think doesn’t pay as well compared to _____ developers?
I know to go through a PHD in any field, especially computer science requires strong motivation. I really love the field so far, and it seems that this won’t go away anytime soon, so I’d like to think I have that motivation, but the financial aspect of it is making me question if it’s really a good idea.
And what does the research career path look like? For software developers it seems to be learning and doing personal projects, finding internships, etc. So far I’ve just been doing projects and learning stuff that seems fun but am not really sure what the “correct” path is (if one exists”.

Anyways,

I don’t have any internship experience or even interview experience as this is my first interview related to CS. 

Is the “difficulty” of the university graduate full time interview the same as a regular full time SWE interview at Google? 

Also when I took intro and data structures like 2 years ago, I learned it in C++ but have since forgotten some of its quirks and features. I decided to do my snapshot in Java because I felt it was easier. What are some Java things that I must know? 


What kinds of questions can I expect at the phone interview? What are some tips you have? What should I study?

I spent an entire year doing case competitions, interned at a large govt agency, took a business school course, served in student government, and did consulting for small businesses. I had tangible accomplishments in all of these endeavors and thought I’d be a shoo-in for a redo on interviews. Well, I didn’t get another first round at any of MBB.

I thought, no problem. I got to final rounds in one of the most competitive interview processes. I have degrees from top 10 universities. I have non-academic experience now. I’ll surely get a shot somewhere as something. I took online courses in Tableau, Python, and data science.

Five months of networking and applying later, I have had one phone interview. I’ve lost track of how many jobs I’ve applied to, but it is over 100. I’ve had 65 informational interviews and nearly everyone has said something will surely work out. At least 1/3 if them have also reviewed my resume and had no suggestions. Several people have referred me to other consulting firms, but I have been rejected before an interview. My cover letter clearly describes how my skills are transferable and what motivated me to leave academia.

I’m applying very widely- in consulting, analyst, and communications roles. These are in business, non-profits, govt. I’ve applied for both entry level and experienced roles. I’m 7 years out of undergrad, but I don’t expect to start out where many of my peers who went into the private sector are now. Grad students get paid 30K- I would be happy with anything more than that. 

This is a shot in the dark, but does anyone have any thoughts on what I can do to be employable? Or have the humanities degrees doomed me? Should I say I was in a coma for 7 years instead?

a8eh2v,6,2018-12-21,Relief at Last,electrical-badass,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/a8eh2v/relief_at_last/,"I have been stressing out hardcore for the last two-three months about submitting an application to pursue a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the current university I’m at. I’ve talked it to death with the head of EE at my school and for the most part been pretty certain about applying, he’s given me some really good advice, and overall has expressed enthusiasm about me being in the program. 

I’ve had the application filled out since October but haven’t had the heart to submit it (the application is due January 10th). I open it up once or twice a week, make sure the information is correct and all the appropriate documents are uploaded. But, every time I got to the submit page I totally panicked and closed out. 

I have been experiencing imposter syndrome pretty badly. Every day I feel like I’m a complete idiot and have no business going to graduate school and I don’t actually know anything about Electrical Engineering but somehow tricked everyone into getting this far (haven’t received anything lower than an A- since sophomore year). The biggest catalyst of this is I received a few C’s early on and my cumulative gpa is only okay (3.4). 

Today I had a moment of clarity. I realized that even if I don’t get into the graduate program, I’m only one senior project away from graduating, have had an internship at a National Lab for the last two years, and no matter what happens I will be okay. 

With this in mind, I hit the submit button, paid the exorbitant application fee, and finally feel a huge sense of relief! 

Anyway, I just wanted to share in case anyone else was experiencing some application blues. 

I’m hoping after my Master’s to pursue a Ph.D. in signal processing and telecommunications, but that’s a worry for another day. 

In the meantime, I’m going to enjoy my winter holiday, and I hope you all do too!"

Right after high school I enrolled in computer science as I was always fond of tech. However, the first term was 99% maths/algebra and I felt like an alien in regards to my peers, whom satisfied the cliché of the nerd who doesn't know how a shower works. I decided that this is not what I wanted and changed to Philosophy. Now I'm not from the US and where I'm from the job market is cool with social sciences. Nevertheless, I felt like I need to get some work experience and managed to get an internship as a business development intern for a tech startup (SaaS). After the internship, I then landed a part-time role as a sales rep for another software company. I don't mind talking to people and despite the stressful nature of sales it was not too bad work. The only problem I had was that I felt unstimulated in intellectual ways. I already dabbled into programming (MIT intro to comp sci with Python) and I quite enjoyed it, but I don't want to be a developer sitting 9-5 in front of a computer. My dilemma is, I neither want to do a job that doesnt stimulate me intellectually (sales), nor do I fit into the picture of a ""pure"" developer. I'm nerdy as in I like literature, philosophy, anime, video games but I'm also outgoing and know how to comb my hair. I feel like I'm something inbetween introverted and extroverted. I looked into Project Management but this also does not sound too exciting. So far I am eyeing with becoming a Scrum Master, however, it looks hard to break into without a comp sci degree."

a8gpjy,1,2018-12-21,Using sex for power and control.. help!,Exoticgurllll,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a8gpjy/using_sex_for_power_and_control_help/,"(I am posting this here hoping to get some responses)

I met a married man, who was 13 years older, in 2015 when I was unhappy with my then-relationship and had an on-and-off two years affair with him till 2017. The way he made me feel was nothing I had experienced before- in short, he made me feel wanted and desired.

Eventually, I broke off the relationship with my then-boyfriend in 2016 and left the married man to start a new life in a new country. Before I left, I had a string of meaningless hookups, with the exception of one guy whom I fell hard for but he married someone else because I was just a hook-up buddy.

The biggest mistake I made when I was alone in a new country was I hooked up with a guy 8 years younger than me at campus party (he is the 21 years old undergrad and I am the graduate student). HE IS TOTALLY MY TYPE. I instantly did the love bombing (something I picked up from the married man I was with)- showering him with attention/ affection/ compliments to keep him coming back because he seemed like an easy target due to his age and I wanted to keep him around for as long as I could for my selfish needs. I relished everytime he showed his neediness or his emotions of missing me/ not wanting to lose me. The sex was crazily good because I knew how to make it good. Anyway, I had been exclusively hooking up with him for one year. Four month ago we had to stop our arrangement because he had to be away for some school internship. He will be back in less than two weeks.

Obviously I liked him as a person, that was why I kept seeing him and no one else. We bonded and shit, but nothing (no drinks or movies) outside of the bedroom. I also knew it was not meant to be serious as nothing good would come out of it. So I was relieved that he went away because I would get the space and time to move on. However, we keep in contact throughout the past four months.. he got exasperated when he sensed that I was pulling away (i.e. stopped responding to his messages, taking longer time than usual to reply, or plain ignoring him). To be frank, he could be such an ass to me due to his emotional immaturity and sense of entitlement so he deserved such treatment. That was when we started having some ""serious"" talks. He was quoted saying ""so you don't want to have anything to do with me?"" ""but I want to have something to do with you."" ""I want to continue whatever we are having as long as it is sensible and practical."" He kept saying he wanted to see me because he misses me, I am unique, I am not like anyone he has slept with and he does not want to lose that, I was sexy as hell and sex with me was nothing like sex with somebody else blablabla. I told him that was not possible as I want something more and better for myself (i.e. relationship and commitment). Eventually, the answers I got from him was ""I am not serious about you or anything."" ""I/ my body is yours only when I am with yours.""

I never slept with anyone other than him in the past one year. In his absence over the past four months, I just couldn't bring myself to meet new people or sleep with strangers. I am also aware that I am not in a good place for a relationship or anything. Truthfully, at this point that it is best to have no contact and move on, which I did try but I always cave in and unblock him after two weeks because I miss talking to him.

Sometimes I don't really care about him (I do get attached to him and shit) but I care more about how he makes me feel. I was happy when I knew I had him totally wrapped around my finger. But he is someone with his own mind, a strong one.. I lost my power and control the moment I cared so much and it is obvious I am losing the entire game because he only wanted me for sex and nothing more. The sex was great because I made it great! But all these men want me around for sex and sentimental values but none of them considers marrying me, it hurts my ego and pride badly.

Obviously, I need help but the appointment with my counselor is not happening anytime soon. I WANT TO SEE HIM WHEN HE IS BACK. He is talking about seeing me as soon as he is back and I know I am weak at the thought of having him again. I am burning with desire :( Plus, I still want to play the game even though I am losing.

Someone please analyse and knock some sense into me. :( Any pills I can take to erase memories of past one year with him?"

Those that have applied to thousands of internships, gone through hundreds of interviews, have even made it to final on-sites a few times, but still haven't been able to land an offer.

Edit: I'm not really looking to be told that I'm doing something wrong. I've done everything, mock ups, had my resume reviewed by as many people I could find, hacker rank, leet code, cracking the coding interview, etc. I've overanalyzed every interview and every response.

My grades are decent but I am by no means a passionate computer scientist.  My GitHub is fairly dead no hackathons, no research projects nothing like that at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Come summer 2018  I was worried I would be behind the curve, so I grinded leetcode, cracking the coding interview and elements of programming interviews. It was a stressful time, everyday I felt like I had to practice more and more or else I wouldn't get a job. It felt like I was studying for an exam that had no real end date.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the best CV I could, stacked it with as much information as possible and sent it out to as many places as I could for fear of failing the interviews in many places.

&amp;#x200B;

The reality of the situation surprised me though. I received \*many\* interview offers, from decent companies as well. Vodafone, Three, Deloitte, PWC, Accenture, Microsoft, Fidelity, JP morgan. To my surprise, the interview emphasis was not data structure and algorithims heavy. Sure Microsoft had a tiny bit (find LCA of two nodes in a BST), the rest had \*none\*, Fidelitys programming test was literally FizzBuzz question.  Came to the point where I was even declining interviews because I had so much choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Thetakeaway from this post is just to advise people to set your expectations for the job you want. If you don't want to work in Big N right now, or even if you do but you're happy to settle for a job with a lesser known company, the pressure isn't on as hard. I could have studied no algorithms, just prepared a nice CV and I would have had many jobs offers. I have aided my friends in getting interviews at some of the listed companies above and the interviews are very gameable.  Don't get me wrong, the job seeking mode is stressful, but dont compare your workload to another person who is going for Google if you are happy with a job is a non Big N company.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Data structure and Algorithm practice is only required for a few companies. Prepare a solid CV. Apply early. Interviews don't change much, glassdoor is powerful. Im very average, spend very little time programming at home, have tried to learn some things (web design, react)in the past but never stuck at it and I have been inundated with offers.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I am from Dublin, Ireland so the game may be different across the pond but I imagine the companies I listed above have similar interviewing styles around the globe.

EDIT 2: I got offers from all but microsoft. The offer I accepted is not big N but the salary is in the 95th percentile for all graduates in my country

a8lhjn,1,2018-12-22,Which job in the travel industry would be a good match with my profile?,Cedrinho,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a8lhjn/which_job_in_the_travel_industry_would_be_a_good/,"The reason for this question is that I would like to not overlook any options..

My profile? 33 years old, studied Arts and Archaeology for 2 years, then moved on to get a bachelor's degree in Sports Management. Since then, I've worked as event manager/coordinator, worked in HR (handling contracts) and worked on communication (press, social media, website). Note: I have never been fired, just been on temporary contracts and did some jobs as a freelancer/volunteer on the side. After that, I decided to travel as I wanted to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life and actually find myself a career path to fully commit to. I lived, travelled and worked in Australia for two years. I have now been back home for over a year.

In the year since I came back, I first spent a few months depressed as I found myself back at square one: No job, living at home again, no clue what to do. But then, as I got back on my feet, I realised the travel industry could be perfect for me. I love to travel, I love to meet people and learn about their cultures and histories, I love to be inspired and passing what I've learnt on to other people. I also have many different experiences and interests. When travelling, I just as much love going on a hike as visiting a museum or spending a day at the beach or going to a festival. I doubt there is a country in the world I'd mind visiting.

The only issue was that my actual experience working in the travel industry was limited to working in one of Sydney's most popular hostels for 6 months, while I don't have a degree in travel or tourism and don't have a proper network in that area. So that's why I decided to get a bachelor's degree in travel and tourism. I am following that education right now, I'm nearly halfway and things are going really well! If all goes according to plan, I will have finished the education next summer, after which I would have to get myself an internship to complete it and get my second bachelor's degree, in tourism and travel this time, by the end of next year.

But then what?

The kind of jobs I am now considering are these:

* Working for a travel agency that puts together and organises holidays in ""exotic"" destinations (Australia and the Pacific, South East Asia, Africa, South America, US &amp; Canada, ...), especially if I could help putting them together and maybe even guide the people who go on those trips. I think my wide variety of interests would be a massive asset for this.
* Working on shore excursions for a cruise line, which would combine my love for travel with checking out excursions, guiding people, looking up and trying out things to do, learning about different destinations, ...
* Working in a travel agency that organises trips to major sports events, or big events in general.
* Being a travel writer.. I love to write, have kept a blog on my travels (amongst writing a few columns, just for me), have always dreamt of one day writing a book. Just no idea how to start this, might start working on this as a 'side project' once I've got a job.

But maybe I am forgetting a few possible options. So that's why I'm turning to you guys here.. Is there any other job in the world of travel and tourism that I should consider?"

I am a bit stressed out too because I don't know what to expect. I checked the review of Ultimate Software online and it seems like a really good place to work for. I spent all of my life preparing for technical interviews, and never thought about what would happen if I get an offer.... need advice :0 !!"
a8mxxl,19,2018-12-22,Confused about final project,thelust123,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/a8mxxl/confused_about_final_project/,"I'm in my final year of getting my grade in ""Industrial Electronics and Automation"", and this  I just started an internship in ""Embedded Software"". I was asked to do my final project which I will have to present in the future.

My problem is that I don't know what I'm expected to do for the project, usually if you do it in the university and choose a professor to help you it can be a fairly simple prototype of a certain technology (for example, using arduino to make a simple IoT project). So yeah, It wouldn't be a problem if I simply did it with a professor, but since I have this internship I have to come to an agreement with the company on my project.

I simply don't know if what  I decide to do has to have be somewhat directly applicable to their industrial products or systems (they are an industrial weighing and tagging company) or if it can be done with simpler systems (like arduino)

That said, since I'm an electronics engineer grad, I simply don't have much knowledge about concepts you would learn in a computer science grade (which I'm learning while I'm in this internship), and embedded pretty much requires knowledge in both fields. So coming up with projects that require deep knowledge on programming and such isn't something I really know.

The stuff I know that could be complex enough to be ""industrial"" would be for example the design of digital controllers for motors using app notes from TI and freescale and other research papers, but this is because it is something we did in one of the classes I had. But I don't know if that is something they want since it's mostly control and not embedded software (even though you can then implement it in an MCU)  
What i'm saying is that if i'm expected to do something applicable to the company in an industrial level I just don't know where to look for something that would be at the same level as the PID control design.  


Something I've been looking at is the whole IoT thing and the LoraWAN network thing, but again, not sure if that's something they can use for their products."

As of now the country I live in(Denmark, Copenhagen) is mostly outsourcing engineers at least ones with lower experience. To build my experience I did ~10 frontend freelance gigs and from all I got positive feedbacks. Along frontend I have also build accounting software and few backend applications using python. From August untill now I applied on literally every open position an never really got any feedback. Talking with people in IT they say that I need to do internship first. Which I sadly can't do because they are unpaid and mostly full or half-time. As I am working along my studies it is impossible to incorporate anything like that in my schedule. Do you know what can I do along open source projects that I'm lookin into now to increase my chances in finding the job.

I've always been the scapegoat to them, or the target of their anger or disappointment. I don't even know if I love them anymore.


Long rant ahead. Skip to the end for the tldr.
--------------


I'm starting my first computer science internship at a well known company this winter. They threatened to cut all contact and financial support because I told them I'd accept this offer. (This happened early December, the start of exam season.) Later on, they told me that they'd support my decision even if they didn't agree with it. 
Our relationship seemed ok then. Later I found out that they were still complaining about it and talking shit about me from my sister. Then again, that seems like the status quo. The disappointment and talking behind my back, I mean.


Fast forward to now. Not sure if I should go home now, because they're furious again because I didn't go home after exams like they've asked. (My mother was going to have a surgery on her leg on the 20th.) My exams ended Dec 18th at 10pm. I told them weeks in advance that I'd come on the 20th because I wanted to have some time to decompress with friends and such. They were furious and told me to come on the 19th so that I would be there to help my mother after the surgery, to cook and clean and such.  

They sent me texts like how I value friends over family, and how I'm not family, and not to come home, and stuff like that. My sister tells me that they're still angry at me back home.  I haven't come back yet because I know that they'll hold this situation above my head, and I'll be miserable back home. I've been miserable with them my whole life, so I know that as fact.


**TLDR**: Not sure if I should go home for Christmas because my parents are unreasonable and always shit on me, and I really, really dislike them.But if I don't come home, they'll interpret it as if I don't want any part in a relationship with them."

Just seeking out some scheduling advice from CS majors. First, I am most likely going to be taking 3410 (as opposed to the 2300-3420 sequence). Second, I would like to have Algo, 3110, and 3410 completed by the end of my junior fall (I am currently a sophomore) as I believe having those classes completed would improve my internship prospects for the following summer.

My question is, is it better to take 3110 and Algo together or 3410 and Algo together (assuming the rest of my schedule would be VERY light). Also, if 3110/Algo is a better combination, is it better to take them together in the spring or fall? Thanks in advance!

a8or4e,2,2018-12-22,Need help getting out of the job search mindset,melancholymelanie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a8or4e/need_help_getting_out_of_the_job_search_mindset/,"Hi, cscareerquestions, I could use some advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been programming for about 2 years now, one year as a self taught hobbyist and one year of bootcamp -&gt; internship -&gt; current job. It's been a lot of change and a lot of hustle to get to where I am right now, and I've basically been in a state of constant fear and uncertainty since I was laid off from my part time shop labor job last October. It's been exhausting, but somehow it all worked out and my current job is amazing.  


I'm currently a QA engineer at a large local tech company that does vacation rentals. I was a bit nervous, taking this job, that I'd get trapped in manual QA and not get to touch much code, but that hasn't been the case at all. I've been writing test suites and CI/CD pipeline stuff, and there's a project coming up in the new year where I might get to write a test framework if I'm not happy with existing tools for what we want to do. There's manual QA too, but I don't mind, it helps me learn what I want to automate and get intimately familiar with the existing system that we're replacing.   


The company I work for is amazing. They've been treating me super well, I'm being paid well, the QA team lead has even brought up in meetings about future hires that he's open to hiring people without much experience if they turn out like me. There's unlimited PTO, but instead of it being a manipulative tactic, team leads actively convince us to take more time off. I've worked late/come back online to work from home in the evenings a few times when the stakes were high, but mostly we all work around 40hrs a week, and the office gets a little bit dead by 4:30 on Fridays. On top of all that, my team lead is amazing. He's been actively mentoring me, making sure I get interesting projects, and I think he's more worried about automating away the manual QA aspects of my job than I am. He's told me straight up that if I want to move into software engineering in the future, there will be opportunities, but I should consider carefully if I want that, or to move towards SDET, or more infrastructure related roles, or even management. (Blows my mind, I'm 3 months into this new career).   


Anyway, I should be able to relax now, right? The more I work for this company, and the more I hear about other people's experiences elsewhere, the more I feel lucky. I want to be here at least a few years. I could see myself staying even longer, even though I know it's normal to job-hop every few years. I want to be focused right now on being good at my job, and an asset to my team. I want to settle in for a rate of growth and change that's measured in years, not months or even weeks. But I can't. I'm helping another bootcamp grad job hunt right now, and I keep seeing postings and thinking ""I could do that"" or ""In a year at my current role, I could totally be there"" even though I don't need a job right now, and I would prefer my current company to whatever place posted that role. When I learn new skills, I automatically think of how to spin things in interviews. I keep thinking of people I meet at various meetups and how I might maintain that contact for networking. I've been anxious and in job-search mode for so long now, that I don't know how to turn it off. 

  
If someone offered me a SWE role at a good company with a pay bump right now I don't think I'd take it. I really don't want to leave any time soon. I don't want to start over with new people, a new code base, different expectations. I want to spend some time having health insurance and only coding on the weekend when I feel like it. For those of you who've been through this... Once you've made it, how do you turn off job-search mode and settle down for a few years?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am a sophomore at a well known CS college and have just accepted an offer to be a Morgan Stanley Summer Tech Analyst for this upcoming summer, as a software engineer. I'm not sure which team within MS I will be a software engineer on yet (live trading applications, enterprise engineering, etc).

Overall, I am very happy with my decision- not many sophomores are able to get into the analyst program, and I have always been interested in FinTech (and have had a previous internship at a FinTech startup). What I don't know, however, is what to really expect from this internship. Has anyone here done the MS summer tech analyst internship or a comparable one at a big bank in NYC (I know JPM and Goldman have well-known tech analyst positions)? If so, how was the experience?

Question:
I graduate Spring 2021. Can someone help me get some clarity on how to get an internship?

Background:
My GPA is currently a 3.2. I had a really rough start to my collegiate career. I was assaulted twice, and spent 2 years struggling. I’m in a much better place now, and just finished taking 9 credits with all A’s! I’m confident I can graduate with a 3.6+. 

I recently declared my major as Information Science (IT), so I don’t have ANY experience formal or otherwise with the field. By the start of summer I will have completed a class on Python, and I may be able to teach myself SQL by then, as well. Other than that I’m fresh to the field. 

Main Concerns/Questions:
1. Is it possible with my limited experience to get an internship, a research position, a job, or something this summer that can help me get hired after graduation?
2. If so, what are some tips for how to market myself despite my limited experience? What to put on my resume?
3. If not, what should I focus on doing to push that goal along (personal projects, if so what kind)?
4. If internships are crucial to getting hired, should I defer my graduation a semester (Fall 2021) to ensure I have the ability to do at least two?

Any insight is greatly appreciated as I’m freaking out about my future state of employment!"

This summer, I accepted an internship at a small tech company in my city where I made $10 per hour and worked about 20 hours a week. It's a great staff and working environment, although it's not necessarily in a field (or city) I'm looking to stay in. At the end of the summer they were pleased with my work and asked me to stay on during my semester, which I agreed to, working 12 hours a week on top of being a full time student. They have increased my responsibilities, I've become very close with the staff, and my bosses frequently talk about what I'll be doing ""next year,"" strongly implying that I'll get a full time job offer from them. 

I have a meeting with my boss in about a week to check in on my progress, where I'm sure she'll ask me to stay on the team next semester. That's great and I plan on accepting, but there's a little more that I'd like to get out of the meeting. I currently have 2 objectives: 

1. Get a raise. I'm a college student, so every dollar counts. I worked at a CVS before this and earned $11, and I believe that with my increased responsibilities I am definitely worth more than I was when I was first hired. 

2. Get a recommendation. I need to start taking an active role in my job search, and the best thing I have going for me is my success at my internship and the relationships I've built with my co-workers. Even if I do end up accepting an offer from this company, I still want to test my worth on the job market and I will need their support to gain competitive offers. 

While I personally think that these are both very reasonable requests, not only have I never asked for a raise before, but I realize that they're slightly contrasting ideas. I feel a little weird asking for a company to invest more in me as an employee while also asking them to help me find opportunities elsewhere. How do I go about achieving both of these goals while also ensuring that I'm not losing the job offer they will likely offer me?

TL;DR: I intern at a company that will likely hire me when I graduate, but I'm not sure I want to work there. How do ask for a raise and get recommendations from my company while also not pushing them away?

&amp;#x200B;

I have done a long internship in semiconductor circuit design, doing verification, working with layouts, schematics, timing models, running DRC, LVS, static timing analysis etc. I found out that i enjoy this verification work but NOT schematic design (like design a schematic for PLL, ADC, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in my final year, i had taken analog circuit design, cmos mixed signal circuit design, and low power digital circuit design. Overall this covered analog amplifiers, PLL, ADC, logic  gates and transition times, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 remaining courses in electronics that i could take RF circuits (LNAs, mixers, etc), and VLSI (ESD protection, pre emphasis, clock and data recovery, etc). There are also other courses that i find interest in: Real time computer control systems, and multimedia systems (jpeg compression, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I am also thinking of doing a course based master of engineering a few years after working. Courses offered would be a LOT of VLSI courses, RF, etc. which would be repetitive of my undergrad courses if take VLSI and RF in my final year.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is this: I do not know for sure i will do a masters. I like the VLSI field (verification and analysis, not schematic design). But i also want to explore multimedia and intelligent systems. So my dilemma is, I've already taken 3 circuit courses mentioned above. For my final term, i have to pick 2 from: VLSI, RF, real time comp control, multimedia systems. If i do not take VLSI and RF for once, and never do a masters and end up never taking these courses, will i miss out anything on the job? 

&amp;#x200B;

right now, my final term courses:

1. intelligent systems (neural networks etc)
2. system on chip design with SystemC
3. and 4. pick two from: (VLSI, RF, multimedia systems, real time comp control)

any feedback appreciated"

I was a remote intern for 9 months there and had quit in December 2017. After quitting my job, I wrote a paper about the work that I learned in my internship. Apparently, that work is something which they can argue as their intellectual property. I didn't pay much heed while I was in college (at the time of publishing). However, now I am afraid of repercussions. I am so much afraid for my career that I am unable to sleep.  The start-up is from experienced personalities with 10-years experience under their belt.

The reason why I published the paper is that I needed publications to get admissions in top-rated colleges for masters. Me being a fool asked a temporary senior member(my project manager) that if I could use the start-up's data to write a paper. He readily agreed while forbidding me to post any code of the related work. I don't have a written record of this conversation.  After my internship finished, I wrote the paper detailing a process that the start-up might already have a patent of. I had completely forgotten about this matter as I had to focus on the current job. But recently the paper has been published in one of the most prestigious conferences.

I come from an extremely poor background and that might just explain my stupidity of making a quick gain. However, I am not sure of the legality of the issue as no one from the aforementioned company has contacted me about this. I am in some serious trouble with no apparent means to escape it. I now have insomnia due to this.

Advice on my next steps?,Juice_Campbell,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a8s7mp/earned_a_bachelors_degree_3_years_ago_currently/,"I turned 26 this year. I spent my high school and undergrad years not knowing what I wanted to do with my life. It wasn't until I earned my B.S. in political science and stumbled into an internship with a youth advocate program that I figured out that I wanted to work in child welfare.

I was lucky in getting that internship. The position had been open for a year and they pretty much told me that nobody applied for it and they were ready to bring on just about anybody to help out. By the end of the internship, they told me they made the right decision in bringing me on and didn't expect me to be so passionate about what I was doing. It wasn't in their budget to hire any new workers, so I had to take a job at a call center once the summer was over and I'd earned my last college credit. I keep in touch with the organization, donate to them, and even try to work with them to this day.

Fast forward about a year, and I was fired from my job as a legal assistant at a local law firm. My supervisor from that internship gave me a glowing recommendation for a job as a youth advocate at the state's department of health and human resources. I got the job and I've been there for a year. I love it, but I don't know where to go next.

The pay is very low (28k a year, not including overtime) and the turnover rate is astronomical. I've become a senior worker in just one year because people keep quitting. Our staffing is at an all time low, which has led to me picking up extra hours and extra responsibilities. My supervisor told me to get ready to start working 50-60 hour weeks next year because they'll need the extra help. I'm already at 45 hour weeks. It's starting to wear on me but I love my job. I'm great with my clients, and they give my supervisor good feedback all the time.

I'm only a provisionally licensed social worker. My job will pay for me to get a master's degree in social work, but I'd have to work there for three years AFTER earning the degree. Hardly anybody takes advantage of this at my office. If I stay there for four years, I'll earn a regular social work license that I can take anywhere. I could look for work in another state and make a lot more money, but the competition would be heavy and most likely I'd be up against people who are more qualified than I am. That could potentially mean less job security. But I still have the passion for this, the passion I realized three years ago.

I feel like I'm in a rut. I live in a state with a very low cost of living (West Virginia) but I still earn a pretty low wage for my area. And I don't want to be at this job for the rest of my life. I'm happy enough that I know the field I want to work in...but I feel like the cards are stacked against me because I figured it out this late in the game. I have a family and live comfortably, in fact, I'm looking to buy a house in two years, but I feel like I'm beginning to outgrow the shoes I'm wearing, if that makes sense. I can't afford to go back to school, and even if my job pays for it, I'll be locked in until I'm in my 30s, and even then I'll have to make serious sacrifices. My work takes enough out of me as it is...I couldn't imagine piling on more.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Then, I found renewable energy is a very cool area to do hence I think doing Electrical Engineering would provide me with the skillset. I ended up not really liking the stuffs except for power system courses that they taught and I found that I am actually not a very hands-on person in terms of tinkering with electronics.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also not very good academically (had 70+ CR WAM or near 3.0 GPA), but I still persevere through all the courses (being agreeably the most difficult engineering degree compared to my other mates) though I can say I survive through rote memorization and not actually understanding the fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be specialising in power engineering in my final year. While I still aspire to be an Electrical Engineer especially in Renewable Energy, I am just not sure whether I will thrive being a good engineer in this field who is actually clueless about Electromagnetism (I tried reviewing this topic but it just doesn't really stick) and doesn't really like being hands-on with electronics. I hate it when people expect me to know how to wire things on the panel while that's the job of an electrician! (people seems doesn't get this bit - it's the biggest misconception of being an Electrical Engineer! - plus I don't think I want to do that stuff)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I have also developed an interest in high-level programming (found out I don't enjoy dealing with hardware level). Being a software engineer is actually one of the other degrees that I wanted to do before I started university. I have tried coding in C and actually like it though only being an average on it. I have chosen EE because I reason that I can always transfer to Software Engineering from EE but not the other way around. Looking at the jobs opportunity out there for software engineers are just insane, they have flexible hours, higher pay, better work culture, more reputable company and startups, cooler project, etc. compared to EE. Currently doing my EE internship at a power plant, but on the side, I am building my skills through online courses in Python, Tableau and AutoCAD. Because by the end of my degree (in a year), I want to equip myself with skills that are high on demand.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is I don't really know which direction should I steer myself at this point in my life. Ideally, I would love to have a career with the intersection of renewable energy and data analytics/software. But if that didn't work out, I think I would better align myself as a Software Engineer/Data Analyst rather than being an Electrical Engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone relate to this feeling? If you had the same experience, could you kindly share and give some suggestions to me?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently an undergraduate from a very good university in Canada. I really fucked up this recruiting cycle, way over estimated my leetcode capabilities and bombed interviews at Google, Microsoft (I honestly don't know how I didn't get this, I felt really confident in my answers and they were all leetcode easy), Facebook *and* Amazon. Four fucking interviews down the drain, let alone the myriad of other interviews I failed with startups in cali. Meanwhile, 3 of my friends are going to Google, 2 are going to Amazon and one is going to Microsoft.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a math undergraduate, so I don't code at all for my classes. I'm currently doing stuff with machine learning, leveraging my good math foundation. My goal is to go to grad school in machine learning so I pour a lot of my time into my studies, and I am currently doing research with a professor to hopefully get a second author paper out before graduate studies. I work at a very well funded machine learning startup in the city right now part time, and they have extended an offer with no deadline for working there this summer. My Kaggle has 0 in the money, 1 gold, 4 silver and 3 bronze competition medals, making me a Kaggle Competitions Master (top 2% of competitors, at least). I have a schedule which I follow to a tee, and at the end of the day I leave 2 hours for reddit, video games, catching up with everyone on messenger, etc. I also spend time working out, cooking and general house activities. I end up fitting around 4-6 hours of good studying into my day, and I am very happy with how my life is right now. I really didn't want to sacrifice my leisure time or self care time to do leetcode, but I feel an immense amount of regret for not doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried really, *really* hard to ignore this feeling of inadequacy within my friend group; every single day they talk about their internships, cali, meeting up and etc and it eats me alive that I won't be able to do these things with them. They are some of the most important people in my life and it feels like I've missed the boat that everyone else was on. I can't stop but feeling like I'm total shit; when I was younger and I was trying very hard to get into art school, I leaned heavily on Stoicism to deal with my failures but now that everyone else is getting the things I thought I would have had for sure, I feel like I have missed my opportunity. I used to think I was very strong at leetcode, and I was able to solve mediums within half an hour most of the time after a good amount of practice, but I feel like I am extremely rusty. I am working to rectify this now, but I am afraid it is too late. What do I do? I am getting software engineering interviews but I can't seem to get any data science interviews, which I think is because I am not currently a PhD student, so it seems like there's no way to avoid the leetcode hump.

&amp;#x200B;

It's an absolutely ridiculous way to feel, as I think overall I'm pretty okay for this far in my career. But every single day I wake up and I just feel awful, because everyone I've talked to daily for over 2 years now has been able to do what I can't do, despite me being proclaimed to be strong at what I'm failing at. Really, that's one of the first things I feel when I wake up, and it's really taking a toll on me; I don't see it getting better as they are all gone, and any pipe dreams of me being able to actually work in cali would disintegrate. I'm not sure what to do. Any suggestions?"

On the other hand, I enjoy my coursework and am considering getting a PhD later down the line, for which I think a BS would be helpful, along with the fact that I would be doing a senior thesis if I decided to stay the 4th year. This, along with a summer internship, would give me some idea of whether or not I would want to go towards industry or academia.

I do not care too much about money at this point, but big N would be pretty good on my resume. However, graduating early would leave me a with a BA, so I'm thinking it would make it a little more difficult to get into a PhD program, and I would then probably get a master's degree before going into a PhD, so I know which field to focus on.

All input appreciated."

They are:

* Imperial: MSc Applied Computational Science and Engineering
* TCD: MSc High Performance Computing

I'm from China and I want an IT related job in either Ireland or UK. I really envy the work-life balance here. In China, software developers literally do 9am-9pm, six days a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Is it wise to trade Imperial and 6-moth UK work permit for a 24-month Ireland post-study work permit if I graduate from TCD?

&amp;#x200B;

Any information and thoughts are appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

~~I want to know the IT related job opportunities here in Ireland. I've heard that Ireland is the tech hub of Europe with several giant IT companies setting their headquarters. I flipped through this subreddit and found many news regarding IT companies' new offices. However, because of Brexit, I assume UK is a sinking ship for jobs.~~ ~~How are the IT job opportunities in Ireland compared to UK?~~ ~~Did I miss some important information?~~

&amp;#x200B;

I planned to email the TCD course director asking the job opportunities in Ireland and I will attend the Imperial open day in February.

&amp;#x200B;

PS1: I know both of my prospective MSc degrees don't really count as a computer science degree. I'm expected to graduate with a MSc degree in Sep 2020 (about 1.5 years from now). I hope an IT related degree with several MOOC certificates and some cool Github projects will help me pass through 50%ish CV screening to the interview stage. I will try my best to find a transition internship next summer.

PS2: Why not directly apply for a computer science degree?

It's a long story. My undergraduate degree is Atmospheric Science. I made the decision for switching to IT during my summer internship (about atmospheric science) in August. I found jobs in atmospheric science is significant less paid with heavy workload in China. Computational/computing science masters are the most closely related IT degrees to atmospheric science. I wish I did my homework before entering university but now here is another critical decision point.

a8w4kg,3,2018-12-23,Hit rock bottom at work : Suspecting I might have ADD Inattentive subtype,kyanewest,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/a8w4kg/hit_rock_bottom_at_work_suspecting_i_might_have/,"Ive started a new internship which lasts 12 months and it helps pay school. Im an assistant advertising manager. I work for magazines and basically my manager sells advertisements to brands (if that makes any sense).

My previous internship I was more into digital communication which I really loved, but i decided to do something more ""global"" and less digital so that employers don't think i'm only 100% digital.

Boy was I wrong to pick this internship.

I have been living pure hell, the tasks are very redundant, a lot of paper work, have to manage invoices, count how many magazines we received, answer emails, do excel tablesheet, phone books, send letters at the post office, deal with accounting anything than advertisement. But i'm an assistant I get it, those are the tasks that they put on their job offer, I cannot complain, I chose this!

I thought at first I could just force myself to do this bcs so many other people did it, but boy was I wrong again.

I've been yelled at by the boss and manager so many times I've lost count and it's always because of the same thing

* Forgetfulness
* Lack of attention to details
* Cannot prioritize
* Taking too much time for one simple task
* Cannot multitask
* Doesn't listen properly when somebody talks to me

So I tried my hardest until I would tell them ""Maybe I should quit and look for something else"", they told me ""No stay, you are here to learn and you will learn how to be more efficient""

Except that being yelled at doesn't make me learn better and definitely not with a team. So I tend to work on my own a lot (which I was criticized about), for fear of being yelled at but it makes it worse and guarantees that i'll be yelled at.

I tried to change my organizing skills, I got a notebook, one colleague gave me a to-do list which caused very little difference. Right now my to-do list is so full that I cannot even look at it and cannot know where to start, I procrastinate or forget to read it a lot.

My manager has told me during these 4 months in that internship many many times that I need to be more motivated, more focused, more present, and care much more about my work. It was partly true, I was not motivated and I've been feeling very depressed bcs of how much I hate what I do and how BORED i am, that's the main problem, I AM BORED.

I've been having erratic moments where I would call my school and say ""I'm going to quit"" they attempted to stop me and brought me back to my senses. Basically: I cannot quit, I've spent too much time there and won't find anything else, and then i'll have to pay school but most importantly won't validate my diploma.

So then I thought, ok, let's face this problem straight on. I took some rhodiola (a plant) which helps with anxiety and concentration, thinking i'm just depressed and it causes less focus. But here I was last week, sitting at my desk with suicidal thoughts, extreme psychological pain at the fact that I am bored out of my mind and cannot sit there no longer doing this routine shit. I have mental fog, moments where I don't remember doing a task Ive done for 4 months everyday... suddenly I know nothing, I have to think fast and intensely to remember how Ive done it.. I cannot remember names, I daydream while doing something which causes a lot of futile mistakes in my work (always details which matter a lot in this company). I do stupid stuff where I forget where I put my pen, or an important object that I need to complete my task, which wastes a lot of time.

Last week, it was that moment where I realized that something is inherently wrong with my brain. I know I already got OCD, depression but I felt like this was none of that, it's something else... I was yelled at again by my boss who asked me when that damn phone book she asked me to do will be finished, it took a month for it, she told me the deadline is Jan 2nd, imagine the stress... Scared out of my mind I won't be able to complete it well.

Then my manager yelled at me bcs I forgot to do something she said was very important. She was in disbelief, tht in 4 months she has been saying the same thing to me over and over and yet i'm still forgetting things, not paying attention, unmotivated and CANNOT PRIORTIZE even with the to-do list they did for me. She judged me and said im a ""millenial"" whos obsessed about ""digital"" maybe its the reason why ""you're so unmotivated"".

It made me cry, and I cried in front of these two colleagues out of mental exhaustion. I felt like a fool, a kid, a dumb low IQ person who cannot complete the simplest of tasks... and I cried out of pity for myself bcs I tried really hard that week and yet still the same shit happens... The manager even said ""I feel like you tried... thats what scares me...""

I've never felt more stupid than right now. I then googled that problem and ADD showed up, and then i started thinking these symptoms match a lot, and then i remembered during childhood that teachers would complain about my daydreaming, me talking too much during class, or me stuck in my bubble, that i would forget my bag before going to school, the keys... my parents always make fun of me to this day about the damn keys, that i always always forget. Since little they tell me to ""open up ur eyes and pay attention more to what I do and where I leave things"".

I took an appointment to a psychologist to get it tested... but in the meantime what can I do to do better. My manager told me that once christmas is over i need to be different and do better.. this scares me, there is no doubt in my mind I have ADD inattentive subtype... will i ruin my whole internship?

Also the instructions they give me are very VAGUE which makes it SOOO hard for me to complete a task. 

Whats crazy to me is that I can be super focused while learning guitar or writing a book, or painting (I love anything creative) but when it comes to something as SIMPLE AS MAKING AN EXCEL SHEET i cannot do. I feel so lost, so desperate"

I am a fourth year mechanical engineering student who is scheduled to graduate in December 2019. I have a good amount experience with projects and an internship under my belt. However, I’m starting to believe I majored in the wrong engineering discipline. I noticed that my interests lean more towards EE or CS. For example, for class group projects or project teams, I always volunteer to do the programming and electronics. For my past internship, my favorite tasks were working with data analysis and hardware in the ESD lab. I’ve also been working in research for over a year where I’ve where I’m learning Python and OpenCV. I really like the work I’m doing but anytime I look for internships or entry-level jobs with these skills or with keywords like “motion planning” or “robotics”, the position is always looking for a EE or CS person. Of course reading this sub I know it’s not impossible to transition, but I feel like it’s harder as a student. All the mechanical positions are looking for people to work in design (which I really dislike). I understand I don’t have the necessary academic background, but I was hoping my out-of-classroom experience would help. What can I do as a student?

I'm having a lot ot trouble with the Android Development and Framework Application Development subjects. I will be in an internship from February to July and I plan to finish the course and the referred subjects after that.

I've made countless academic projects (a lot of PHP, JS, Android Studio, game development with C#...). Front-end and back-end development. Despite the academic projects I've made and I'm currently doing I use Udemy a lot to try to fill in the gaps. I'm always hungry to learn more from this fantastic world :)

TL;DR: All my projects are on GitHub and I use it on a regular basis. I plan to develop a portfolio when I start my job searching but I want to know if a GitHub account full of repos is just overrated or could impress possible employers. Also, I live in Portugal and developers here are not given the value they deserve from what I see.

The time has come for me to start working on my portfolio, and eventually apply and try my luck at getting an internship, or even a junior (entry) level position as a front-end developer in some company. I am being self-taught, so that probably changes things a bit. But as the title says, I need some advices about creating one, like:

\- Should it be simple, clean and concise, or should I try and make it to look similar to one of those high-end portfolios that we had the luck to see here in this reddit (although I might not yet be at that level)? Or would over-designing and ""over-engineering"" send the ""opposite"" message from what I'd like to send to potential employers?- Should I only include some little information about me, a resume, technologies that I use and projects that I currently have, or more than that?- Will html/css/js be ""good enough"" for creating my portfolio site, or should I use a JS framework for creating it, to look ""more experienced"" ?

And some other topics / areas that I probably missed mentioning. Also, I am fully aware that I might be far from actually getting a job since I have yet to start learning a javascript framework, and the projects that I have so far use only HTML/SCSS/JS, and on some ""minor"" projects I was messing around with bootstrap, webpack and babel. But, could anyone of you spare a few minutes, looking at my GitHub [account](https://github.com/pecko95), and tell me are those projects (at least the pinned ones) good enough so far (maybe for an internship?)

I found myself really struggling sometimes with implementation, and coming up with solutions tends to take some time for me, which worries me for my interviews.  I plan to continue practicing and improving, of course.  

Currently, I'm preparing by doing some exercises from the book ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, as well as reviewing algorithms and other code I've written.   I know a personal project would be of great help, and was thinking of working on something during the upcoming semester so I have something to present come spring interviews, but I will obviously be putting my classes first so that will just come in my spare time ( I don't anticipate to have much of that).  Apart from this, does anyone have any other recommendations for my preparation?  Any other concepts employers tend to target during interviews besides data structures?  It seems like everyone I've spoken to just tells me that's basically the meat of my interview.

However, just recently, I was notified that I received an offer from a Big N company in the west coast. The salary is the pretty much the same (a little shy of 8k/month + housing stipend), but I feel like having the Big N company on my resume would be a lot better for my career goals.

Bank A - Full time, Software Engineer

This bank is a well known international bank that has a good starting salary, $80k, the role is working with mobile apps and other software development projects in teams that run like startups. There doesn't seem to be much opportunity for rotation, but the prestige of this bank might look good on my resume, I am also doing a cloud computing course at uni  since i will start later at this role. This bank does sound exciting to work at, but I have never worked as a developer before so i don't know.

Bank B - Intern, Cloud Engineer

This bank is smaller than Bank A, and is not international. Its starting salary is for interns, $54k, but I will be joining as one of 70 new interns where we spend a year migrating old bank tech onto the cloud. There is an opportunity to go into full time work after I finish university. I like the culture of this bank, its progressive and apparently all the new interns get to join events such as hackathons throughout the year. I will be AWS certified, but unable to do my cloud computing course at uni.

Anyways Both banks know that I have been offered a role by one another, and I am in the process of making a decision since the deadline is this Friday. It sounds like I have to decide between (Big Salary) vs (Internship Experience). End of the day my goal is to make the most out of becoming a better developer enough to make it to the one of the big 4 tech companies. Conveniently both offices are right across the street from each-other so location isn't a problem.

I have until Friday to make a decision so I got to make a choice urgently! This is made even harder since Bank A made the offer during the Christmas week."

When she asked if I was eligible, I told her that I wasn't sure and would have to check with my co-op coordinator, which admittedly was maybe a mistake. I told her I had already secured an internship for the winter (Jan-May) and that I had one 4-month internship left in my sequence.

I know the coordinator wouldn't allow it (I can't have more than two work terms in a row), but I figured I could just quit co-op and do the internship anyway, so I asked if the position was open exclusively to co-op students, and she said no. But I think she took my reply to mean I wasn't available since she said ""We are looking for candidates to be available for the full 8-months - perhaps we can connect at a later time when you are looking for another internship!""

I've been getting a few other inmails like these but never from such a big company, so I don't want to pass up an opportunity.

I would *technically* be available, but it would be cutting it close with the end of my other internship in May (which I am hoping might get extended for a second term) + it would be a bit of a hassle to drop out of the co-op program, and if I were to take the internship, I would be out of school for a whole year, delaying my graduation by 1 semester (and I'm already behind in my whole sequence as it is).

Should I go through with the process anyway and see what happens? Or better to keep that contact for the future? I will be at an internship, working full-time, in another country during the interviewing process, so I don't know if it's worth it?"

Wishing everyone safe and happy holidays. I am grateful for some words of wisdom or advice by peers or those settled in engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

**Details:**

I'm finishing up my master's in mechanical engineering in Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my masters I had experience leading research, working on industrial projects, and also have side projects to show (both directly in and outside of mechanical engineering). This all ultimately pushed my thesis work to the side for a couple of years as I worked on these projects concurrently but I was happy to learn and explore a variety of fields and technical research.

&amp;#x200B;

During a small internship at a large company, I managed work which was subject to a patent and major ideas being generated for follow-on work. I was later contacted to join the company but ultimately after various negotiations, the salary I was offered was on the very low-end of the scale. In effect, aligning with a bachelors with less than 1 year of experience. Eventually those discussions fell apart. While I haven't formally started to apply, once again, I was contacted by an old internship workplace and received a salary offer around the same ballpark.

&amp;#x200B;

This had a bit of an impact on my perspective. I really felt companies that had seen potential would not try to low-ball. But perhaps my expectations have become skewed. In reflection, it seems that master's, regardless of the countless experience it comes with, is not considered very significant within Canada. I suppose I'm having trouble navigating if I'm really just an entry-level candidate at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

Do I just need to snap up the first low-ball opportunity that I get in my area? Should I pack up and go somewhere else? In general, it seems there is really not much variability in the engineering pay scale if cost of living are taken into account across the board and that always seems to dissuade me to look outside of my current city.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks very much,

John

I wanted some advice focusing on the Indian CS industry, but the India specific version of this subreddit r/desicscareerquestions is not quite active, so I am posting here as well. I'll be glad if I could get a bit of general advice here, defrag my mind if you will. My aim right now is to get into a decent software product company after (or during the final year) my graduation, good enough that I get started with really good chances of growth, meaning I do not prefer the large consultancy companies like TCS, Infosys and the like. I am not abandoning the idea entirely, if there is no choice, I will take the best out of whatever I get.

1. As I do not have the tag of a good school brand behind me, I decided that self-study and motivation is my only way of learning, so I picked up Python in the beginning, followed by Java. Aside from making a few simple projects I did not do much, I did not do much in the second year due to health issues, and I wanted to learn Android but did not have a good machine then. So in August 2018, I upgraded to a slightly more powerful computer, and learnt native Android and built a couple of project apps and scored an unpaid Internship within 3 months, doing it at the moment.
2. I am starting to experience some major lag in Android Studio now, so the idea of continuing to make Android apps on my machine does not feel that productive for the moment. I feel like I should learn something else to make projects in. I am not particularly confined to any technology as I am only starting, I am willing to pick up and learn anything that is required.
3. Aside from coding, I have interests in UI/UX Design as well, as I really enjoy typography, colors, prototyping and all that stuff. I do use Adobe XD occasionally and make mockups with it. I am not making it my selling point because I am not aware of its value and salary in the Indian context.
4. I am thinking of learning some modern web concepts, so I could learn an employable skill and make projects with it. I feel under-confident about my coding skills, as I do not know Algorithms and Data Structures. I understand a basic level of optimization and the like, but nothing specific beyond that.

I know that I must focus on them both, improve coding, and learn a good technology stack, but how to approach starting it in a few months, what to pick first, choosing resources etc is causing a lot of unnecessary confusion and anxiety. I hope you suggest a good course of action, and clear some of the naivety. I will more than happy to listen to your advice and suggestions.

**TL;DR:** Not sure what to learn next, underconfident about coding skill, wants to be employable.

Thanks a lot and have a nice day :)

PS: Also, some advice on how to find mentors and networking online would be nice :)"

Starting Over?,TheNoLifeKing,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a972nq/fixing_a_bad_gpa_new_school_starting_over/,"I'm planning on going back to school soon, and I've got a very bad GPA (Below 3). I only fished my Associates, I went to school for around 6 years, messed around and left for full time work This was around 4 or 5 years ago. 

I'd like to go back to school for computer science, and eventually attend grad school - however my past GPA would seem to limit not only the possibility to get internships while I peruse my degree, but hurt my possibility of getting into grad school. 

Good news (?) is I live in a different state now, and if I went back to school I would almost be starting over from scratch as I would be attending a different Community College to get started. I don't think many, if any at all, of my old credits would transfer over. It might not even be worth doing. Has anyone done something similar?

If I don't transfer over any old of old credits, and started from scratch at a community college, when it comes time to apply to grad school, would I still need to send over my transcripts from my previous schools? "

I had an internship in software engineering and actually enjoyed it, but now I’m at my first job as a sales engineer for a few months. I thought sales engineer would be a better fit with my majors/interest. But Im not enjoying it as much as I would like to because I haven’t seen myself making any valuable outcomes yet. I know this is my first job and should probably just chill out but I’m worried that this is not the right path to go down. 

Is sales engineering something I will enjoy later on? 

What are the pros and cons for sales vs software engineering? 

Should I go back and try to find a job to building my technical skills first?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Situation :** 21 y.o graduating in Computer Science in May 2019. I finish my courses, I will be completing my last coop internship from January to May.
* **Debt :** $11 000 in total (10 000 in Student Debt + 2 Credits Card 900$ in total)
* **TFSA :** $1500 (managed by a friend of mine who works for I.A, invested mostly in Mackenzie Diversified alternatives fund).
* **RRSP :** $450 at National Bank (part of my employers benefit)
* **Earnings :** make about 30 000 $ / year (interns + part time job + small designs contracts).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I got **2 questions** :

1.  I thought that my employer would match my RRSP contributions (up to 3% of salary) but after reading the papers, they just gonna match the DPSP (what is that, waiting for the HR people to give me an answer). I make around 17000$ at this call centre. If they don't match my RRSP, can I withdraw it and pay for my CCs as I've never declared it yet (started in January 2018).
2. Does a $600 RRSP make any changes for a student in terms of tax credits/returns ? More generally is it interesting for a student to get a RRSP ?

&amp;#x200B;

**Planning :** 

* Opened a wealthsimple acct to get a security fund (none yet).
* I bought 10 stocks for organigram + 5 Hive Stocks + few cryptocurrencies througout the year =&gt; wants to start trading.
* With my tax return, I want to reduce a lot of my debts and start saving/investing a lot.
* Want to subscribe to a life insurance now as I am young and it's cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

**Third question :** any additional advice I can take ?

I'm a 3rd and final year CS student at a good university. (Not from US).

I feel like my coding skills aren't good enough to start working at a good place. I had good success at 1st year courses who touched programming - I got an A at Software course which focused on OOP and Java, and also A on Intro to CS which focused on Python and many aspects of CS. However, the coding in these courses assignments weren't huge and the main difficulty was on how to solve the given problem.

When I got into more advanced courses which involved projects in pairs or groups, I was having an hard time to write code and build fundementals for these larger scaled assignments. Most of the time the strongest person in the group took most of the responsibility on himself. Even though I eventually got good grades, I feel like I had more success on the more abstract courses.

Now I almost finished my degree and I feel like I can't handle large scale codes. I can prepare well for interview questions and I know a lot of abstract subjects but I'm anxious for the moment I actually start working and expected to be independent.

By now, a lot of my friends are either working or applying for jobs. Some are finding success and work as interns in places like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and some have less success.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it normal for a CS student to feel like that? It might be worth mentioning I didn't have previous experience before university."
a99ejf,1,2018-12-24,"I wish I could restart this year... Any-who, can y'all help me through a decision?",guzzo9000,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a99ejf/i_wish_i_could_restart_this_year_anywho_can_yall/,"So I applied to like 7 schools of which most I care about accepted me. There is one, UT Austin, which hasn't decided on me yet. Here is the thing, I think my credentials allow me to apply to more difficult schools, but I didn't. The only school I wouldn't call a safety school on my list is UT Austin, which I don't think I would even attend if they accepted me, for various reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my dilemma. I am torn between 3 schools: A&amp;M University, UT Dallas, or Embry Riddle in Prescott, AZ. 

&amp;#x200B;

For A&amp;M, I am in love with that school. I even paid for one of them 100 dollar A&amp;M jackets. I love their spirit, their alumni, their program, their history. Everything about that school is just amazing. Being an aggie would be great because of the Aggie Network and the recognizably of the school in general. If someone hears that I went to A&amp;M, they will know that the program was good, not amazing like an ivie, but still pretty damn good. The thing is that they probably won't give me money because everyone and their mother wants to attend A&amp;M, especially in Houston, where I live. Essentially, going here would be the most enjoyable for me as well as the option with the best alumni/connections. I am sure they also provide a shit ton of internship opportunities. 

&amp;#x200B;

For UT Dallas, they gave me a full tuition scholarship along with a 2k yearly stipend... That is hella nice. The school has a program comparable to A&amp;M, but the school life or alumni would be lacking. It isn't as recognizable and I have heard that they have some management problems with things like the dorms and the cafeteria. I also heard that they have a shit ton of graduate students, which may or may not be beneficial. Also, they have a fast track program, so I can get my Masters in 5 years, 4 of which will be free, aside from room and board, which everyone technically pays for whether or not they are going to college XD. This scholarship definitely makes this school an option for me. My parents are only going to pay for my dorm, so I need to pay for food/transportation/tuition/books/everything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

My last option is Embry Riddle. This is a weird one, and may be the least likely. I applied here because last year I had a strange desire to go into aerospace engineering, and still kind of do, so I applied for aerospace engineering at Embry Riddle(aka aeronautical heaven) as an option if I were to ever go for this route. They accepted me, yay, and gave me 16k a year in scholarships. This is nice, but that is only about half tuition. :(

The thing that makes this competitive is how I am pretty much guaranteed a job if I go here. They apparently have a 96 percent success rate(96 percent land jobs pertaining to their major or go into graduate school, or something like that). If I want to succeed in the aeronautical industry, this is the place to do it. 

Another thing to consider is that when you go into engineering at A&amp;M, you choose your major after year one(every freshman engineering student is in general engineering), so I could still do aerospace engineering at A&amp;M... And I heard their aerospace engineering is top quality as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are my current options. If UT Austin accepts me, then yay, but they probably won't XD. If they accept me, then they will also be an option that I can be torn over. IDK... 

ps. I applied for computer engineering at UTD and A&amp;M. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do y'all think?

What will I do with my life? the world may never know. "
a9a0lk,5,2018-12-24,Applying to art schools and trying to figure out specific focus,sarahmichaelll,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a9a0lk/applying_to_art_schools_and_trying_to_figure_out/,"Hello humans of Reddit! Just like any other anxious senior in high school, I am under severe stress stemming from college related decisions! As you can tell by the title, I am planning on pursuing an art-related career and am still trying to figure out exactly what I want to do. Right now, I have settled with the idea of animation but am open to other options. I have an SAT score of 1370, ACT score of 29, and a 4.2 GPA on the 5-point scale. I am planning on applying to 9 schools in total. I have applied to 8 schools with the Common App and, under that list, have submitted a portfolio to 3 of those schools (the other 3 do not require a portfolio upfront and one I have yet to submit a portfolio to). These 8 schools are UNC Charlotte[accepted], Virginia Commonwealth University[accepted], SCAD [accepted], Appalachian State University[accepted], NC State University[awaiting decision], University of Southern California[awaiting decision], Ringling College of Art and Design[common app submitted, portfolio not submitted yet], and RISD[common app submitted, portfolio not submitted yet]. The one school I have left to apply to is the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. 

Now that I have given a bit of background, lets get deep into my thoughts and concerns. It’s gonna be lot of information from here on out so prepare yourselves, lol.

Concerning the major I have applied to upfront, which is typically animation focused at each school, I am honestly unsure of this decision. I have kind of just settled with animation knowing of the demand of jobs and ability to visually storytell in detail. If I were to select a dream job at this very moment... it would be working as an animator (stop-motion animator) at LAIKA Studios (I absolutely LOVE stop-motion animation!!!).  For context, LAIKA studios combines stop-motion and CGI animation to create feature films. I absolutely love the style of their movies! Now, you may notice that the majority of animation related majors are focused in digital rather than physical art or film related things. This is where my dilemma arises... my current style of art right now is all physical. I don’t specialize in one specific medium and enjoy experimenting with and combining different mediums. I would say the most common medium I work with is pencil/graphite illustration but I also paint and, every now and then, weave or mix 3D elements into my 2D pieces. As for digital art, I have VERY little experience and am worried that, once I get into a major focused in digital art, I will realize I don’t enjoy it/ am not good at it and start to miss what I used to work with more often!!! Plus, my main style of work isn’t very correlated with typical animation styles (character design, etc.). Most of the work I do is in a hyper-realistic style and is typically heavily concept-oriented (this is a very poor explanation but oh well). The meaning behind my work and the way it is conveyed is extremely important to me. To conclude this with a generalized explanation of my college major concerns, I am worried that my main style of art and what I like to do would be more fitting for another major and that I should leave the idea of pursuing animation behind me and consider other art-related careers.

Now onto the next phase of this post: the right college for me. As I am one of the few artistic friends out of all my other friends who are more science-math oriented, the idea of attending a large university is very appealing to me. My high school has 3,300 students attending so going to a university with a large student population would be best suited to my needs. I am also involved in athletics and am interested in joining a club team and, all-in-all, becoming involved with things not art-related within the school as well. Lastly, I am interested in possibly double-majoring or minoring (if I can even find the time outside of art, lol) in either Psychology, Social Work, or Computer Science. Because of all the reasons listed above, I believe the environment and diversity of educational opportunities at a large university would be great for me! However, although I would be getting a larger variety of educational opportunities at a large university, I would be losing the superb quality of art-related education at purely art-based college. I know a lot of large universitites have great art programs but are limited to only a few focuses. Within a purely art-based schools, I would be around motivated students similar to me and have a greater access to an interdisciplinary arts education. But, I would be losing the university “feel” because of smaller student population, athletics and other extracurriculars not as present, and less diversity in types of people). Lastly, I am concerned about location as well and internship opportunities for myself. I applied to a school out in Los Angeles knowing of the types of opportunities that will be available to me. I don’t have much to say about this aspect other than that so I am hoping someone can give me a bit more insight on this aspect. I hope these explanations make some sense! 

Alright, I think this is enough information to go off of. Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!"
a9b6q3,2,2018-12-24,Streaming Programming on GitHub for both Twitch and CS Portfolio. Thoughts?,LastWulfStanding,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a9b6q3/streaming_programming_on_github_for_both_twitch/," Hello there, I’m posting this to hear other people’s thoughts on how viable it would be to stream myself contributing to GitHub projects or other projects outside of GitHub to work on both my CS resume and my Twitch presence if I can’t land a CS job when I graduate (and of course I’ll apply to CS positions while streaming).

The main pitfalls I see that get in the way of a definite “yes” would be:

* Keeping a level of anonymity while still being credited for the work. I’m planning on having a separate GitHub for all my stream projects and the rest goes to my personal GitHub, which I’ll then put both GitHub links in my resume. However, I’m unsure if employers would accept the work I put under my pen name valid.
* The possibility of my work under my pen name not being taken seriously or detriment the rest of my portfolio, though this is an unlikely scenario (I hope), I’m wary of the association of “streaming” and “Twitch” (not the internship) in my resume would render my work less meaningful than Hackathons projects and whatnot.
* Contributions on projects regarding games and mods wouldn’t be viewed as highly. Perhaps you are not aware, I enjoy playing games and interested in making one, though this issue doesn’t directly apply to the topic, I believe that I’m going be asking if I should work on a game or mod sooner or later.

Feel free to list any more possible pitfalls or things I should watch out for, and I thank you in advance for any suggestions and/or criticisms in what I’m planning on doing."

It feels as though everyone I talk to in my major do not want to extend the relationship past the class and those in the RSO's have their friend groups set and not willing to open up to new people.

Background about me: a junior student with a 4.0 gpa, strong leadership experience on campus and a popular Frat, 2 internships (one in private accounting and one in financial services). I know my background sounds really strong but unfortunately, I go to a non-target school which is the deal breaker. The only reason i chose this school was bc of the full ride scholarship they offered me.

Last summer I reached out to a ton of Big4 recruiters from Linkedin. Well, as you might guess, I didn’t get a lot of responses and also bc I didn’t know the right person to talk to in the Southeast. One super nice recruiter from EY responded back and was with me throughout applying but while she told me to reach out back in September, all the audit intern positions were filled by Sep. Needless to say, I was super upset bc I worked so hard to be where I am today and noone even cared to recruit me. The EY recruiter told me to reach out next year to apply for FT bc it is less competitive (again, she is super nice) but I don’t want to get my hopes up just to lose them like last time. I also got in touch (only through emails again like last time) with the PwC office in Birmingham and hopefully got on their system by applying to the SLP. There are also not a lot of alumni from my school either that I can reach out to.

I know lots of people will tell me to go for the regional firms, but for me it is challenging work and opportunities to grow within the Big4 that really interest me.

So, does anyone have any advice on what I should do, especially how to maintain relationships with those 2 specific people so that I can get a chance with the next upcoming opportunities? It is really upsetting that I work so hard and hold these many leadership roles but still fail within my big4 recruitment endeavours.

Thank you so much and Merry Christmas to everyone!!!"

&amp;#x200B;

It was during my final exams during the fall semester in college and I decided to immediately apply for internships. During this time, I got three interviews; two which are content review jobs and the other is the supposed, ""marketing"" internship position. So at this time, I got an interview with the supposed, ""marketing"" and ""management training"" internship and I did not know that it was just selling Direct TV in Costco scamming people by signing them up.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got accepted for an interview with the other content jobs and passed the first round. However, I cancelled it because I felt like the promises of the other business was much better: I get to work part time and that I get to be sent out of state to ""start my own business"". However, I found out that their promises is a pyramid scheme hidden in disguise. I found out that with each Direct TV, I don't get the commission but rather the manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw this during my childhood and even now. When my brother swallowed a piece of hard candy whole without chewing it and had some throat discomfort (luckily, he didn't choke), my mom was like ""don't cause problems for us,"" even though he was like, what, four years old and probably didn't mean to?

Also, when I got an A- or a B on a math or science test in 3rd grade, my mom was like, ""this is fucking horrible. I sacrificed my lunch break to pick you up and you get an 88? How could you?""

At the time, I felt really bad for not doing well, but looking back, I just feel so annoyed. Like, yes, an 88 isn't the best grade possible, but I don't see how getting a 22/25 on a freaking 3rd grade test (way before high school, where grades actually start to matter and shape your future) means that you're a dumb, lazy asshole with no future. 

It just so happens that I missed 3 questions and just because you missed lunch break gives me no permission to mess up a few more questions than you wanted me to? LOL. 

Also, the brother I mentioned earlier later died of terminal childhood brain cancer, and the aftermath was just a huge emotional mess for my family. Like all Asian families, we never expressed ""vulnerable emotions"" like pride in children, love, or hugs, or any sort of physical or emotional comfort, so it was just a sad and awkward time. 

I was going into 7th grade after he died, and at my middle school, we had a choice between a musical (band or chorus) elective or a more class-like elective (life management). Most people went with music even if they weren't musically talented because it was more fun and you get to go to Disneyland or Knotts (lol in 7th grade that is a huge deal). 

I chose chorus because I liked (and still do like singing). However, my mom and dad thought life management was the superior elective, and when my schedule came out with ""chorus"" instead of LM, they were so pissed, said that they now had no hope in their lives (as they were devastated over losing my brother) because I chose chorus over a true class (LM), and made me change it. 

Lmao. Jesus. Really? How is your daughter's life going to be shaped by ONE ELECTIVE class taken in SEVENTH GRADE???!!!! I fail to see how taking chorus would ruin my life lmao. Yes, I'm not Mariah Carey or like Jordin Sparks or whomever, and will never be a famous singer, but that's not the point of a middle school music class. It's just for fun and enrichment.

More recently, I took a leave of absence from my undergraduate college for mental health reasons. I finished a year of college beforehand.

That was a really rocky time (well, before I got a job + internship and signed up for CC classes), because they were like ""you just lost us 4k"" and like ""if you don't go back and graduate how will you take care of us in the future?"" while mentioning that they weren't rich, had X and Y health problem, all while contrasting it with my cousin, who graduated from the same college and now makes 80k as a consultant. 

As in he was the good, responsible kid, who sucked it up and made it through and helped his family financially whereas I just burdened them financially.

But anyway, back to the book. 

Amy's Caucasian husband, Jed, said that parents choose to have kids and that by consequence, parents are responsible for their kids' needs and not vice-versa.

So my question(s) are:

0) Is 75-89k for a family of 3 like poverty-level status? I know it isn't rich but like my parents initially said that I was going to put them onto the streets and shit after leaving mid-semester. 

1) Which mindset is ""right,"" or should there be a blend? Like, kids don't owe their parents anything until the parents are too old and/or unable to care for themselves, in which case the kids should take care of their parents themselves or pay a nursing home to take care of the parents. 

2) And if kids do owe their parents anything, what exactly do they owe them? Academic achievement? Getting into a good undergraduate college/grad school? Financial success (so that they can take care of the parents later)? A prestigious, high paying job? Love? Respect? A listening ear? Like why do parents even have kids lol?

3) Where does the Asian mindset of the kids owing them anything even come from? Like, are kids like financial investments for the parents' old age or some shit?"

I just moved from another state and I felt alone and isolated. I didn’t know what I wanted to do at all which caused me a lot of problems my first few semesters. The first few years my family made it difficult to get employment and talked me down any time I tried to get a job they felt was too beneath me. It was confusing because they also wouldn’t give me a lot of money to go out with friends. They can be quite condescending and manipulative. Sometimes I’m flat out ignored when I’m in the house or asking a question which really got to me for awhile. Eventually the lack of income and friends forced me into a spiraling depression and destroyed a lot of my self esteem. 

I’ve gotten much better since then. Told them that they can’t force me to not work and I did get my own money. I did get a full-tuition scholarship to complete my masters degree. I’ve done 3 paid internships and I completed a study abroad and internship overseas recently. I also have friends and a gf too. 

I’m very proud of what I’ve done. I can’t sit here and say that living on my own would’ve made my quality of life better going to grad school, but I think it would’ve given me the independence I desperately wanted. If there is any advice that I would give someone living with family for school is to hold on to who you are. People will try to shame you for all kinds of nonsense when you live with your parents, including your parents. Family can also be some of the biggest enemies you have. They know your buttons and sometimes will press them just for effect. Finally, your parents and family don’t always know what’s best for you. Don’t be so quick to tell them all of your thoughts and life plans cause 9/10 they don’t actually care as much as they think they do. Make a date for leaving the nest, get out and don’t look back. There is a life waiting for you that doesn’t revolve around them. 

I’m looking for a full-time position now with the hopes of moving out right after graduation in May. I’m leaving this all behind in 2018. Good riddance. Hope you all have a happy holidays. "

I've had particular struggles in my personal life, and even though I just graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from a top 20 engineering university, I feel totally unprepared for my job search. 

Nothing ever grabbed my attention when I was in school. Cryptography and web development were the most interesting, so what I'm doing now is just studying web development. Even though I have a degree, my grades were never great (3.2 GPA) and I wasn't able to apply myself like the other students. I feel like I somehow slipped through the cracks and just obtained a degree through a fluke. 

I feel overwhelmed because I don't know how to even approach learning enough about the industry to focus my preparation, and figure which jobs I should even be applying for. My skills are extremely lacking for technical interviews. I know I can improve my skills over time, but I don't even know right now how to figure out which area to focus on. 

I don't have any internship experience or any projects I've created.

I could really use some help.

I recently moved to another team (Voluntarily) to pursue some new skill set which apparently let me down all the ways. I didn't get the enough chance to work with my core skills due to back and forth meetings and project deliverable deadlines and it is an functional testing with lead tasks.

I am stuck in this company for more than 8+ years and pay is very decent. But, my only scary part is next level of engagement. My current position is one level down to manager  / architect. I am not sure, promotion will happen very soon. (Minimum 2+ years to attain my next level) 

I thought of draw down few options which could eventually fulfil (Guess so) my next level of career.

**Path 1:**

Acquire Technical Certification: OCP &amp; MCSD (C#) Certification, ISTQB / QAI Based Certificate (3 Months down the line)

Hunt jobs with newly acquired certification

**Path 2:**

Acquire PMP or PRINCE2 Or Any management based certificate and stay in the current organisation and wait for promotion.

**Path 3: (Switching Career)**

Learn Python / Data Science / Machine Leaning 

Learn about function testing and automation of data science field / do internship / GitHub Projects / Community Projects

Hunt for jobs with newly acquired skill set

I will have to submit my FYP by the end of August, which would be the end of my degree. So, in two more semesters, I will be graduating from my Computer Science course. However, my FYP revolves around the use of microcontrollers, which are electronics-based and I have zero experience in them. Thus, I would have to spend some time to learn about it to ultimately complete my project.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next semester, which is on January, I will be starting my internship programme (which is a compulsory module for students to graduate) which spans 12 weeks, ending late March. For my internship, I will have to learn to use the company's development tools, and have plans to do my FYP during the evenings after my work shift in the morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, a friend of mine suggested a potential client who requested a web system to be built for them. It uses the same framework as what I've created so far with my FYP. I thought heck, why not just take it on? After going through a number of meetings to clarify their requirements, it seems to be a pretty heavy system. It also doesn't help that the deadline given is by the end of February. I then started to have doubts about whether I can actually put myself under the immense pressure of juggling so many things within such a short amount of time.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is, is it realistic to try and juggle so many things at once? I believe this is doable but I would have little to no social life by cramping every single day trying to complete all three things at once. The pay of the job opportunity is lucrative, but it would mean risking the progress of both my internship and FYP. I once thought that by putting myself under this kind of condition, I would learn to adapt and progress better to deal with a heavy workload.

I opened a TFSA account (BMO SelectTrust Balanced Portfolio) about 9 months ago and as of now it has only decreased and keeps doing so. Should I talk with an advisor or just leave the money there and hope it goes up with time or even invest more in the TFSA since the price per share is low as of now. 

I have also obtained a BMO SPC Cashback credit card 9 months ago and was wondering if I could get a new credit card with higher benefits. I am sincerely lost on which credit card to go for. I am 19 and unsure of how my yearly income is calculated as I am currently an intern. There was never a late payment and my credit card balance has always been paid in full each month. I spend on average 1000~1250 monthly for diverse purchases, mostly restaurants, gas, transport, recurring bills and online shopping for clothes and electronics. I feel that there is a better credit card choice for my spending habits.

Here would be the answers to the command !CCTrigger:

1. Looking for any kind of benefits cash back is preferred but travel could be an option to save up for future usage. 
2. Purchases are mostly for restaurants, online shopping for clothes and electronics, transport, recurring bills, and gas. They are in order of high spending to lower spending. 
3. Average spending monthly: 1000~1250$ CAD
4. I do not know my credit score (have tried ratehub creditkarma but without success to obtain my credit score)
5. My income would be around 0~25k as I am interning at the moment and could be more if I find a part-time job after the internship while pursuing my studies.

* Master's Degree in Mechanical/Industrial Engineering
* No work experience yet except for a 5 month internship working in lean production
* Fluent in English (fluent in French as well)
* Outgoing, friendly, very good at networking
* Type 1 diabetic so Australia would be good because of free healthcare

I've always wanted to move to Australia ever since I was a teenager. No way I'll ever have a good paying job in Portugal and no prospects of building the career I want for myself.

In 2016 I met my best friend while studying abroad. She lives in Adelaide and would help me out if I needed it. Definitely trust her fully and know she'd love for me to be closer to her.

Then last Summer I met an Australian guy who I became absolutely crazy about and we've been thinking of getting more serious with our relationship but still testing it out as we know we're too far away from each other. I'm going to Australia in a few months to see him again and stay with him for a bit, as a holiday. He lives in Melbourne so I also want to see what feeling I get from the city.

How would you go about this situation? How hard would it be to get a skilled migrant visa? And if things were to actually get serious with this guy, would it be any easier to get a partnership visa? I reckon that would be harder but just wondering.

How hard is it to get your skills assessment?"

I think my major will prepare my well for a masters in Econ since part of the curriculum is math (up to linear algebra) and upper division statistics and probability. I don't know how much I have to worry about getting into a program coming from a state school, but I had a 4.0 up until this semester because of my non-major classes. 

I don't have any experience in research, but I am working on that by applying to an internship for the upcoming summer that I hope will help me come in contact with people I can have as a mentor. I have the opportunity to work on a thesis as part of the honors program in my senior year, but I am considering dropping the program as it hasn't done anything for me at this point except make me take useless classes. It would also be cramming a lot into my last year of school since I'm trying to graduate early.

I'm also a pretty quiet student and don't know my professors that well enough to have to ask them for letters of rec. 

I'm going back and forth between staying another year to make another effort in getting close to my professors and take the honors thesis courses or just graduating. 

The main reason I have decided to graduate early is because I don't like the culture of my school and want to get out as soon as possible. I never liked the environment. The only thing I like about my school is advising faculty, who are surprisingly very nice and encouraging. (I know I can talk to them about this, but my mind decided to have a mental crisis right now, on Christmas, during break and wanted people to talk to.) Leaving as soon as possible would also mean more time to get professional experience. I never had the intention of going to grad school right out of undergrad, so I think that getting professional experience as soon as possible is a plus. Another reason is simply not having to pay for another year of school, which my parents are very happy about. 

**TL;DR** Don't know if I should graduate early and get professional experience or stay another year to build up my academic profile"

  I'm a total newbie at age 30 (college 2.0) fresh out of college with an IT degree.  No certs, 2 internships working help desk positions, one ongoing website coding project.  

  Both of these offers are entry-level ""help desk"" type positions.  I understand Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL pretty well, but writing code is not my strong suit.  With practice, I imagine that I could get the logic of coding enough to be a developer. Do entry-level devs really mostly copy stuff online and tweak it a little bit to suit a project / app?  Anyway, here are my offers.  

  Offer 1:   I sought this company out by myself through a local career fair. 
With over 200 DBA professionals, this job is the place to go to learn SQL and eventually become a DBA (one of my career interests).  It has a clear path for advancement.  However, the first 6 or so months involve 1-month rotating shifts on all shifts (daylight, evening, overnight).  It has slightly better pay than Offer 2.  Worst case scenario, they put me on the permanent overnight shift after passing some tests after 6 months as a junior DBA.  I enjoyed my Database class, and would like to try my hand at it.  This place is professional dress.  

  Job tasks:  •	Respond to issues within time determined by SLA, handle entry level database tasks for Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server.
•	Database and Operating System troubleshooting and problem resolution to environments including, but not limited to, SQL, Oracle, DB2, Windows and UNIX/LINUX.
•	Maintain documentation in Word and Excel as well as Service Now workload management system.
•	Develop scripts in Shell and VBS related to monitors and automation of checks

   Offer 2:  This job was presented to me through an IT staffing agency, who can be hit or miss.  What are your thoughts on IT head-hunters?  Call center help desk job for IT Management Platform that services over 1 million machines and 700,000 clients.  It has offices in Mumbai, India, and I think some people were let go a couple of months ago.  I'm worried that my low-level job could be outsourced.   DAY SHIFT!  At least at the start.  The workers here rave about how nice everyone is, but it's a dressed-down relaxed culture, and I prefer a place with professional dress.  There is some room for advancement besides just becoming a level 2, 3, or 4 Help Desk Tech.  
  
  Responsibilities:  (Typical Help Desk)

Support Windows and MAC desktop and laptop computers
•	General access and connectivity issues
•	Desktop application issues
•	Basic administration of user accounts and groups
•	Take ownership of trouble tickets, working and tracking issues to resolution
•	Record detailed information into Service Desk ticketing system

  The idea of entering the IT field is to learn broad at the start then specialize later.  I wonder if the generic Help Desk will help me learn broad instead of a SQL-based Help Desk. 

TL:DR -    Job 1:  Entry-level DBA work, 1-month rotating shifts (day, evening, overnight) for 6 months, pass 2-3 tests, become a junior DBA, better pay.  500+ employees.  professional dress.

Job 2:  Generic Help Desk job, Daylight shift (at least at start), slightly less pay, room to advance to other parts of company (although may be stuck at help desk 2,3,4), dress down / relaxed atmosphere, 3000+ employees with offices in Mumbai, India, which could lead to my job being outsourced.  

Both jobs help newbies get certs and foster their growth.

Ideally, I want to be in a security sysadmin role in the next few years but I don't mind taking a stepping stone(s) along the way to get there. I was looking at the following options -

1. Getting an MCSE and going all out on Windows. Most colleges and hospitals use Windows systems so this seems like a great option to regardless of the path I eventually take
2. Working on improving my knowledge of Python, improving my existing SOC skill sets and Unix skills - get a SANS cert perhaps?
3. Getting a Unix cert (an RHCE?) and teaching myself some scripting. Pretty similar to 2 but Unix heavy

Is it best to get an internship at a big name in the UK then once bagged a full time offer ask to be sent to the US? How difficult is it to get jobs in the US being from UK?  

Is it crucial to get internships in the US? Will US companies even take non-us citizens for internships? 

How long of a process are we looking at?

I have been applying to dozens of different places looking for entry level work in my field all semester hoping to have something by break. Obviously, I don't have any solid leads yet. Maybe I am doing something wrong? 

I have worked three different engineering related internships over these 4 years. Two summers at a tech center doing embedded work, the next summer at an air Force Base, and this past summer in devOps for a national company. While I have good relations with all three places, none of them are options now as my wife and I are looking to live elsewhere. 

This is why I am struggling to understand why I haven't found anything yet, especially considering my experience.

Having some programming background, also just finished an online course about ML/AI and might plan toward a career as a data scientist/ML engineer. Want to do at least a MS in CS.  

1. I know it's highly recommended for students in this field to pursue at least a MS degree, and I'm planning to do the fast track program of my college to get the MS after 5 years. My question is that should I now focus on getting an internship, or doing research? IIRC, the general consensus is that research == academia, and internship == industry, but the line is pretty blurry here as I'm definitely going to do grad school, which means I'll do research anyways and getting an internship might help me more? Please correct me if I'm wrong.

2. How well would a MS in CS fare against other degrees (for example, a MS in stats) in the DS industry? Is a CS Masters much more well rounded and also allows me to switch to other career paths (i.e SWE)? Should I just try to get a MS in CS but also take some stats electives?   

3. What are the possible career paths for me? What kinds of jobs I can get with a MS CS (with a focus on ML/DS)?"

I graduated with a CS degree 3 years back and worked in the Indian IT industry for 1.5 years after which i took a year long break and came to US for Master's. 

I was an average student in my undergrads and never liked the coursework and the way things were taught there, but i always felt enthusiastic when it came to application oriented projects. I was happy with my job as a developer and fared pretty well at it. But i also wanted to explore the field more and pursue higher studies. I started applying to universities in different countries and after gauging all aspects decided to go with the US one. I invested all my savings and took up a loan of 50k$ and landed in US highly motivated. 

Fast forward to 1 semester, all my motivation and desire to learn and explore the field has gone and i feel depleted with the competition of finding an internship/job (which every one is in dire need of due to huge student loans). I have even started to hate the one thing which i loved the most - solving coding problems. My semester grades got affected because of this and i scored a mere 3.2 out of 4, this semester. 

For the sake of it, i have stopped searching for an internship and as advised by a lot of seniors, trying to focus more on the coursework and hang in there. I am trying to a get a head start now on the courses that i took for Spring semester, but i am still not finding any motivation. I am seriously confused about whether CS is the right choice for me now. 

My question to you guys is that did any of you go through such confusions at any point of time in your career and if you did, then how did you deal with it?   
All i can see now is hanging in there and somehow graduating and getting a job to pay off the loans. I feel miserable.  "

I am applying to nearby engineering companies relating to mechanical engineering and I would like your valuable opinion on my resume. Please critique my resume how ever you would like (any comments are appreciated); give me the harshest truth if at all necessary. I really would like have the best possible resume from my current experience, though limited. I have bolded and/or italicized character for ***things I should learn/earn and*** **ones I’m questioning on adding**. Please, if at all, possible answer all or some the questions I have made below (doesn't have to be in order).

&amp;#x200B;

I am (20,m) currently in a sophomore in a local community college and this will be my first time sending out my resumes to get an internship for the summer of 2019. Below are number questions I have thought of as I was editing/revising my resume which is (#) matched in the resume:

1. Having an Objective section okay for applying Mechanical Engineering internships? Is it even good? What can I improve? What are my mistakes?
2. Can I add Quality Assurance in the skills section because I helped inspect for food quality?
3. Would learning Python be better than MatLab?
4. Okay to learn MatPlotLib in addition to knowing how to use MatLab?
5. Should I add Customer Service in the skills section because I have gained some experience through work experience in construction and camps, as well as volunteer work?
6. Okay to have Eagle Scout in the Skills and Certificates?
7. Good to earn Six Sigma? How can I earn it?
8. Is Lean Six Sigma different or the same as Lean?
9. Are my descriptions in Work Experience/Leadership &amp; Involvement good? What can I improve? What are my mistakes? Are the order good?
10. Okay to repeat that I cooked for a lot of people while working at the same camp? (I was working 16 hours a day but only got for 8 hours so I was thinking that I was doing volunteer work at those unpaid hours)
11. Should I add a section for my own personal “Interests”?
12. Should I add that I am a member in my college’s Engineering Club though I’m not holding any leadership positions? How about that I was in Kiwanis’ Key Club and Rotary’s Interact Club in high school?
13. When asked about things about me they haven’t ask or I haven’t mentioned, should I say that I know a two other world languages other than English including my level of proficiency? That I was awarded *Service Above Self* award from Rotary for having the most community service hours in my graduating class? Should I mention that it was 750+ hours?
14. I worked on a two school projects: designing a bridge and prosthetic hand. Should I mention them somewhere in my resume? If so, where and what should I mention?
15. Should I revise the format? If so, what should it look like?

**Things left out after I updated my resume**

**Awards**

* Rotary’s Service Above Self Award 2017

**Organization Memberships**

* Engineering Club    2018 - Present
* Boy Scouts of America     2010 - Present
* Rotary Interact Club               2016 - 2017

**World Languages**

* Tagalog (Native)
* Waray-Waray (Conversant)

I'm 21, following a master degree in finance in a pretty good business school in France.
I'm also a CFA level 1 candidate, since my school has a partnership with the CFA institute, I thought it would be good to leave the school with CFA level II(if everything goes well)
I'll also have a MsC in Finance. Anyway.

I will have 3 internships done when I leave the school.
The first one I already did it, I managed to work in front office as an analyst in a very prestigious Swiss bank so it's pretty good.
The thing is, the next internship is going to be very important for me. I was thinking about Asset management and, with this first internship + CFA level 1 candidate on my CV I look very much like a financial markets type of profile.

But a few months ago, I kind of discovered M&amp;A. And damn does it seem interesting. Discovering new sectors seems very cool and I love the strategical side of the jobs. So I have to find an internship for June and I literally can't choose between AM and M&amp;A. Both look very interesting, and I probably have a good chance to find an internship in the same Swiss bank I did my first internship in, but in the AM department this time.

I went to some events/conferences at my school about M&amp;A and I'm more interested in M&amp;A right now. But since my profile isn't the usual one(TS/Audit&gt;M&amp;A) I know that if I don't get an internship in M&amp;A for the next internship it will be very difficult to do M&amp;A after.

I've been looking a lot on the internet about the typical differences between both sectors but I think I lack information to choose.

Do you know anywhere I could look?
My main question is : Is the strategy side of AM only portfolio management(i.e, maths) or is there also strategy like in M&amp;A?



TL,DR : Interested about AM and M&amp;A, can't choose for next internship, lacking informations.

Thanks, and sorry it's a bit long but context matters."

I'm American and have lived the past ~five years in Germany. My background looks like this:

* German studies at one university
 * Student IT manager there
 * Internship at tech Big N then
* Finished bachelor in Information Systems with data focus at another US state university 
 * Internship at EU Big Tech then
 * Internship at Big 4 Accounting then (data)
* ~3.5 years at Big 4 Accounting firm with a focus on consulting in data &amp; analytics (job title: senior expert data scientist)

I am interested in moving to be closer to my family, who live in Utah. Everything I've heard is that there is a lot of tech growth going on there, so it seems plausible. On the other hand, I also hear that the S&amp;P 500 is a bear right now, and I know that some current US economic and trade policies are further engendering instability.

Because I have a long contractual resignation period (several months to the end of a quarter), it would be a while before I move back anyway. Is the US job market still such that I should be able to find work, or are companies starting a squeeze at the end of this long run?

I am happy to post an anonymized copy of my resume later if it helps, and I can answer any other questions as well. I feel as though I don't know much about the US job market because thus far I have been in Europe so long. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you!"

So now I would like to negotiate since I made more at my last job given I’m learning more at my job than even school. I’m thinking of leverages that I have but can’t think of much to bring up during the talk with him.

My parents ask me why I'm unhappy and then accuse me of being ungrateful and crazy when I tell them why. Then later they act very loving and act like I'm crazy for being sad.

I see my father talking on the phone to my cousins which such kindness that he never gives to me. My mother denies all the cruel things she has said to me my whole life. I told my parents I don't like the major they are forcing me to study and they just become very angry and tell me I have to stick with it. My father often yells at me and berates me, than some hours later acts very loving, denies ever being angry, and acts like I am insane for feeling upset. Unfortunately I need to start looking at summer internships for it otherwise I will have no choice but to come back here for summer break.

I really wish I had a truly loving, supportive, family. I feel so fucking lonely. I really hope that someday I marry a person with a good family so I can have a loving family to visit for the holidays.

It's easier to get short-listed for companies that are highly engineer focused (I'm talking more low-level programming) when you have relevant experience, and web dev won't cut it.

**Second, I cannot rely on my network for better jobs.** The jobs I've worked at are at some very small, super-lean places and were not great places to network. Turnover is usually high, and software development felt very isolated (most devs were working remote or off-shore). Usually, networking would be your best way to move to more ideal jobs, but that's if you could salvage some good connections out of your current job.

&amp;#x200B;

**WARNING THIS IS A LONG POST**

&amp;#x200B;

Throwawaytrashtaco here I want to help you learn to breakout into the IT field but first I need to tell you a story. I started off 18, not going to college or nothing dead set on becoming another statistic on not going and pursuing a higher education. I knew a little bit about computers and what not. I got my start working as a dishwasher at a nursing home after high school. That was just the beginning. I quit that job late 2015 and worked at a factory producing battery cases and used lead during production. It took a huge toll on my body and I went from 215 to 160 very quick. I left late 2016 after a terrible breakup with a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I started off at a community college in Nebraska. I thought I was going to go into programming. I didn't like it so I decided on Networking. I went though the curriculum and also having a part time job at a hardware/home improvement store. I loved it, I found my people. I quit that job January 2018 and worked at a Phone Carrier Store selling phones and plans.

&amp;#x200B;

I left that job and started an internship this year in July and I'm leaving with 6 months of Help Desk and working on PC's I have experience in AD, Windows Server, Printers, and General PC knowledge, including a little networking. I am 21 years old.  Looking back 3 years ago and telling myself that you are never going to amount to anything and then reflecting on that. I have made connections in my field, I have the experience on what to do. I'm 6 classes away from graduating now. 2019 is dedicated to graduating and getting my CCNA.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I have put some helpful tips on what to do when you ask yourself do you want to go into IT/CS/Anyother related job.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Start off with a home lab, Ebay/Craigslist has cheap computers, Switches 3\\\*\\\*\\\* series are more than enough to teach you a little bit about networking plus you learn more about AD and maybe even Windows Server.
* If you want to program, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) has great resources as does [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) and [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/).
* Networking. Not technically the networking as working with switches and routers. But networking with people in the industry. Load up [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) and get yourself out there.
* Certifications make careers. [Comptia](https://www.comptia.org/)/[Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html)/[Juniper](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/)/[MCSA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-certification.aspx). Use these to solidify knowledge but don't use it as a crutch, experience talks during the interview and during the job.
* You are never too old to get into IT. My father went to college when hes 40 going into machining, hes graduated and now hes working at a company that makes a ton of stuff that's used in the world from computers to even planes.
* Don't ever ever ever think you are too stupid for a job. You got there for a reason. Impostor syndrome is real but its only you that decides if it makes you fall back behind your coworkers/peers. **YOU** have the power to do anything you put your mind to.
* Failure is bound to happen but you learn from it and make yourself a better person.
* Write down everything that you do. You put a computer together write it down every step you did. You setup a network, write down the steps you did in order to get it up and running. Did a server at your job hit the fan, document it.
* Your resume should include things that you have experience in. If applying to jobs and they say you need to know this. Then research it, if you get the interview and they ask it say you read up on it and are excited to learn even more about it.
* Knowing basic TCP/IP is going to help you in anyway possible.
* Powershell/Command prompt is your best friend, Learn it, eat, sleep, breathe it.
* Have a Main Resume and then edit it to tailor for every job that you apply to.
* Include a cover letter that goes in depth on who you are and why you would be a good canidate for the position that is open.
* Interviews are there to actually test your knowledge on everything. Don't stress it answer promptly but get your answer across. If you need more time or do not know the answer say that you don't quite know what the answer is and say that you would love to learn more about it. You are there to grow as an individual and further your career as well as make the company even better. Fake it till you make it.

Listen, this isn't going to answer every question you have. It wasn't supposed to, it is here to give you a clear thought process on what you want to do. I am just giving you my thoughts on everything that I've experienced. I want you ""The Reader"" to know that when you take the leap its you pushing against a current in the river that we call life. It's up to you on if you decide to paddle up and face that challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

I will answer any questions that you might have. I do apologize for the long post but I thought I would address what gets posted in this subreddit.

While I have completed the classes necessary for the 45 credit review (to stay in the engineering school), I don't really want to hurt my GPA taking any EE classes or PHYS 260/1 until I have essentially completed the CS side of the degree. This also seems to have the positive side effect of allowing me to drop CompE without too much wasted time if necessary. 

Basically what I am curious about is whether anyone has tried doing this before? and also if there are additional requirements to stay in Engineering other than the 45 credit review that would prevent me from doing this. "

I’m getting really down about how the internship search is going for a software engineering position. I have a near-4.0 GPA as a comp sci major in my junior year now. I applied to many companies and have gotten rejected from all the big names, which considering how hard I’ve worked in school id really want to work for one of these companies. I have never even had an in person interview yet because I never make it past the online assessment. I own cracking the coding interview and have done some problems and leetcode as well but it’s really hard for me to work under a rigid clock that if I don’t submit something working 100% before the clock runs out, I’m given a robotic rejection email. Has anyone gone through/overcame this experience or similar? Any advice on how to exactly prepare for those questions? I hope my investment in college is going to a good cause. Thanks!"

I'm not going to get much, if any, need-based financial aid as my parents make over $150k a year. In addition, my parents would rather don't want to pay that much for education (understandably), so to minimize my potential loans, I'm looking for some recommendations for schools strong in econ.

I live in California, so I've applied to all of the UCs and some CSUs already. U of A is my backup and I've applied for the honors college as well. My grades aren't stellar as I have a 3.1 UW and a 3.7 W, but I do have a 34 on the ACT. I feel as though my ECs are solid (couple internships, founded 501(c)3 with programs for URMs interested in CS, started a profitable business, Eagle Scout + Quartermaster, etc.) and my essays are fairly solid content-wise.

What are your thoughts on some schools that'd suit me?"

I'm a senior Computer Science student from Canada looking at two competing job offers, both with companies I've done 4 month internships with before (one last winter, one which just ended).

The first company is a medium-large sized firm in NYC, that is very highly respected in it's field. It pays incredibly well (starting at 250k USD/yr + 401k matching and an incredible health plan with lots of potential to grow, and a 50k signing bonus), is stable and growing, with free lunch and gym and all the usual crazy tech perks. It's also only a 7 hour drive or 2 hour flight where I grew up and where all my family is. I found it a pretty good place to work. I also like to cook and have a lot of cooking equipment that I could easily move to NYC and have a nice setup.

The second company is small (\~10 people) stock trading firm in Tokyo. It pays very well for Tokyo (\~175k/yr), but might not be the most stable company in the world (plus a good chunk of the pay is tied to firm performance) and has limited growth potential (as all the employees except the owner are effectively equal and paid the same with some slight tweaks to the bonus structure). It's also 12 hours by an expensive plan ride away from my family and existing friends, and I'd imagine making new friends and finding other jobs in the future will be harder there given the language barrier. However, I just worked there, and absolutely fell in love with Tokyo and Japan. The city is amazing, the general way of life feels like a better fit for me, and the transit, infrastructure and food give an incredible quality of life. My university program involves finding a lot of 4 month internships, meaning I've been able to live in many cities around the world and this is the first one I've reached the end of and not had any real desire to return home. I also quite enjoyed the freedom of the smaller firm, both in terms of the work done and the working style (you could order whatever setup you like to work on, you could work from home most of the time if you want, or come into the office, hours were mostly flexible).

Part of me thinks that I'm giving up an incredible opportunity if I don't take the NY firm, and that the foreignness of Tokyo may grate on me eventually (even if it didn't at all in the 4 months I was there). It's an insane amount of money, a highly prestigious job that I enjoy doing, and a world class city near my family where I speak the language. The other part of thinks I'm being too conservative taking that job, and should take the risk and return to Tokyo, which has been by far my favourite place to live."
a9w19z,3,2018-12-26,Is it too soon to leave my job?,goldilocks87,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a9w19z/is_it_too_soon_to_leave_my_job/,"I am 23 years old and graduated from a pretty competitive University last December. I worked multiple internships in college and completed an internship at a large company's HQ this past spring before accepting my current job in July. My current job is by far not my dream job, but I was desperate for income after my internship ended in May and accepted the first offer that came my way, knowing that it was probably just going to be a job that I work for a few years and then look elsewhere. I work at a somewhat small company in marketing and it's not the worst, but it's not the best either. The pay is low for the amount of stress and work that the job is, there's basically no opportunity for growth and I don't feel the company is very stable. I work incredibly hard and feel like my small department relies heavily on me, but don't always give me the credit I deserve and like to exclude me on a lot of stuff. Basically feels like they look down on me because of my age.

It's not the worst job, however, and I have somewhat decent coworkers (with the exception of the few annoying ones that you'll find at every job) and I mostly like the work, except for the fact that my boss won't allow me to take on more responsibility even when it makes sense for me to (it's a power thing I guess). I don't let it get to me most of the time but more recently I've come home discouraged and feeling like my job leads to nowhere, but not completely hating it enough to where I need to leave immediately.

In my two interviews for the job, they told me they want me here for the long run. Everyone at my company has worked there at least a few years and plans to basically retire there, and they seem to expect the same out of me, even though I'm young and very early in my career and this isn't exactly what I got my degree for. I'm only five months in and haven't even had access to my PTO yet, but I know I can make more money and have better opportunities elsewhere. I've recently found my dream company is hiring for my dream job, and I haven't even applied yet, but I'm worried I haven't spent long enough at my job and I'm so fearful of quitting. If I were to apply for this job, it would be behind my company's back and I definitely wouldn't list anyone from my department as a reference in fear of them finding out and confronting me. So basically my question is - after how long is it considered acceptable to leave / when should I start applying to new jobs? Would it be considered rude to leave a full-time job after only five months when they expected longer?"

To begin I am currently a Computer Science and Math major and I am expected to graduate in June of 2019. Throughout the past 2 years I have applied to over 20 embedded systems internships and have not once received a call to come in for an interview.  I even began applying to jobs and still haven't received any call backs.  I am starting to believe that this is due to my lack of knowledge of hardware. Since my junior year of school I developed an interest in working with hardware and electronics. Due to my school being a liberal arts university there aren't any courses that relate to embedded systems.  After thinking about this for some time I was considering changing my major to EE in order to increase my chances in getting a job in embedded systems. By doing so, I would be delaying my graduation by a year and half. I would like to hear what r/embedded  thinks about this.

TL;DR -  A semester away from graduating but considering changing my major from CS/MATH to EE in order to work in embedded systems."

I planned on getting a good GPA one year in Serbia and try to transfer to a UK college. Then people mentioned that I actually qualify as an international student (you need to live in the UK for last 3 years to apply for home fee status, it's not about having citizenship). So I have to pay double of something that's already quite difficult to afford.

My end goal is to move to US, but before that I really want out of Serbia. I'm not sure how useful a Serbian degree is in the UK.  I could go the [self teaching route](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and I can learn way faster than what I get taught in college. But a degree + being accepted for internships is a more safer route for a stable career.

My parents are optimistic about being able to pay my college. But I'm not convinced, I need to get a realistic answer from them later today. In the mean time what can I do?"
a9yg1t,6,2018-12-27,Are these signs of anxiety?,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/a9yg1t/are_these_signs_of_anxiety/,"So firstly, I just want to clarify that I'm not substituting Redditors opinions for going to a therapist - I'll be setting up an appointment soon.

For context - my mum is bipolar, today I remembered how when I was 12, she would get depressed and go to the terrace for a walk at which point my dad would try to get me or my brother to follow her and make sure she doesn't suicide. This memory came as a surprise and idk what to about that. Also my dad is OCD, Islamophobic and misogynistic

Coming back to me, I feel like I'm constantly exhausted. I sleep roughly 9 hours a day and still wake up feeling incredibly tired. Plus I started meditating recently and I noticed that my muscles are always so tense and it's impossible to loosen up. 

People are constantly asking me why I look so tired and I fall ill so often its a problem. 

My legs are super restless its almost impossible for me to sit still at times. In fact being restless is something that is quite typical of me - I get reprimanded for talking too much during my classes and I find it hard to follow through on rules. 

I also find it quite hard to structure my thoughts out and sometimes my mind feels so cluttered its hard to fall asleep.

If I'm not working, out with friends, drunk, working out or high I find myself feeling quite miserable and I don't quite get it? Because on paper I have it all - I get all the best internships, I get the guys, I have plenty of friends who care about me and I've managed to stay quite fit for the last couple of years.

None of these things have affected the quality of my work or friendships. But when it comes to committing to someone I find myself constantly worrying and then growing avoidant. 

So over the last couple of months I've been wondering if I have anxiety or depression. What do you think? I'm sorry if this post has been all over the place."

This post is mainly about improving an  already good situation.

I currently go  to a respected state school. It's got a great co-op program with close  industry ties and I am satisfied with the quality of my undergraduate  education there.

I just got my grades  back and they're great. I've aced every computing course I've taken  (Computing I - III, Assembly Language) and my GPA is 3.8. I'm also  taking next semester off to work at a co-op full time.

I  come from a fortunate background and my family is able to afford me  going to my current school so that I will graduate debt free.

So honestly, as I'm writing this I'm mainly thinking ""stay put dude.""

However  because my grades are so good, I'm toying with the idea of transferring  to a higher ranked, more competitive school. I think I could get into a  CS program with around a 20% transfer acceptance rate. Some schools  that are around this are New York University and University of  California San Diego (at least, according to the data I'm seeing found  through Google searches). I'm also getting emails from Virginia Tech  that are nudging me to transfer (I was in the honors program at a  community college and they got my email through that).

Financially,  the higher ranked schools are considerably more expensive and I would  almost certainly have to go around 20k to 35k in debt to attend. Future  earnings are on average considerably more, but people tell that where  you go to school is honestly not that big of a deal to employers.  Internships and co-ops matter a lot more.

One  draw would be for graduate school, I assume, and more research  opportunities. That's definitely a factor to consider, but honestly I'm  more interested in my career than grad school at this point in time as  well as being financially independent from Mom and Dad.

The  main draw would be learning more and being surrounded by more people  smarter than myself. That's a significant motivation. I just don't know  if it's ""20k to 35k in debt"" significant.

Should  I even consider this? I'm content where I'm at now and it would be a  hassle to transfer. I just think I could be doing more and could make  use of an institution with more resources at their disposal.

I'm  mainly looking to bounce ideas with someone and see if my thought  process makes sense or to see if I'm just being stupid. Thoughts are  appreciated."

* Graduated with a Bachelor's in Finance. 
* In school again pursuing a Computer Science degree (Finishing Dec. 2020)
* Currently at an internship (no coding, just troubleshooting) ends in May 2019. 
* Have taken classes dealing with Data Structures for C programming, and Object-Oriented Programming. 

I'm thinking of abandoning my CS degree and will try to settle with a minor (if they allow me) in CS instead if my internship offers me a job. My internship is more IT related work where we just troubleshoot client specific problems with our software. It pays well enough and my experience so far here has been overwhelmingly positive. I've had a discussion with my manager and the other people I intern under, and they've told me I would be qualified for a position since I already have a bachelor's degree (minimum requirement other than 3 - 5 years related experience). If I asked for job on this team, they're expanding and a strong possibility I will be absorbed into a full-time salaried position. 

&amp;#x200B;

My only concern is that if I wanted to reach a development position, say a software engineer with this company later on or with another company, should I stay in school? I feel like my programming foundation is great and the only reason why I went back to school was to network until I can get my feet in somewhere with a Corporation. However, I'm scared I will be selling my self short in the future and a ""greater"" job will be there for me if I complete my degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Should I accept a job if my internship offers one to me? Or should I stay in school another 2 years? Would I be missing out on anything, or can I learn the other skills on my own?

I've been with my company for one and half years now (one year as a graduate intern &amp; six months as staff). Overall, the company and my bosses are incredibly understanding and supportive, and I know that they personally will not give me a hard time in leaving. This company has been the greatest work environment I've ever been in, so I want to make sure that I leave on a positive note. I just don't know how early to give them notice, and how to start that conversation. Here's what I'm thinking so far...

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasons to tell them** ***soon*****:**

*  I'm in management, so they're constantly investing in my professional training and travel, and I'm involved in their long-term company plans. Ideally, I don't want to lie and have them continue to invest in me and involve me in their plans. 
* My company has connections with similar companies in the city I'm moving to. I would love to work at one of those companies, so their recommendation would help me a lot. (I work in charity/humanitarian work, so the field is supportive. They wouldn't be worried about me being ""poached"" by other companies, which I know is a problem in other fields.)
* I want to be able to use my current employer as a reference while I apply to jobs, and ideally I want to be able to apply  &amp; land a new job sooner rather than later.

**Reasons to tell them** ***later*****:**

* I have A LOT of paid vacation days that I need to schedule. (Leftover vacation days don't pay out when I resign.) I worry that if I tell them that I plan to resign, then proceed to schedule three weeks of paid vacation time, they'll give me a hard time.
* I may become ""useless"" if they start to strip away my responsibilities so early because they know I'm leaving anyway.
* I may be fired/forced to quit earlier than 6 months from now in case they find a replacement for my position soon. I'm not sure if that's allowed to happen or not, but it's a concern.

&amp;#x200B;

***So when should I tell them?*** At the moment, I'm leaning towards telling them sooner rather than later. I'm required to give at least 2 weeks notice, but given my relationship with them, I definitely will do it sooner. At least 2 months in advance. ***And any talking points for starting this conversation?***

I'm a bit confused on prioritizing between working on portfolio projects, doing tech interview prep and actually applying. I'm not confident in what I have up on Github right now, but I know I can improve it a lot during this winter break. Should I start sending out applications after having done that, or just apply every day anyway? Then of course, there's interview prep, but I can't seem to stay motivated on that because it seems like if I don't do the personal projects, I won't get an interview to begin with. 

Any advance on how to balance everything? TIA."

I'm currently a freshman in a ""pretty-good"" 4-year university in the US, aiming for a degree in computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while, I'm been considering starting a company based around part of my open-source project, but didn't have the business-know-how or connections to do so. A month-ish ago, someone reached out to me about being part of starting the precise company that I'd been mulling over. I've contributed a lot to the companies' codebase and the number of people who we intend to hire after the new-year has grown to around 10ish. We recently got funded for a rather sizeable amount for an early-stage startup by a VC and I was given a generous offer to work there (on the other side of the country from my university) for the spring and longer if possible. I feel very strongly that this company will succeed. I would  want to do this by taking a leave-of-absence from school for a semester or two, but there is a complication: I've already signed on for an internship at Microsoft this summer and they have expressed that taking a leave-of-absence during the spring might invalidate that and count as reneging.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of stuck here. I feel like I'd really regret passing this up, and while I could postpone working there until the fall, the first few months of a startup are the most important (and I'd be giving up the sizeable equity as well)."

Since January, I was initially learning web development but took up an iOS internship with a start-up in September. Unfortunately the CEO decided to stop development a few days ago. With that said, there's no proof of me having contributed anything to the company since there is no product coming out. Fortunately, I started working on my own app a few weeks ago. Now my question is, should I go ahead and make a resume based on the knowledge and little experience that I have and apply to jobs?? Some people say just go ahead and apply because I have a degree. But I feel I should atleast wait until I complete the app before applying because my degree holds little weight on its own compared to having an app under my belt. What is your take on this?

\*\*Update: Upon graduating I didn't know what I wanted to do, then i decided to learn web development starting in January. I applied to alot of places and the startup gave me an opportunity in August, except it was iOS instead of web dev. So 7-8 months of web dev down the drain as I switch over to iOS development. Here I am now, teetering between throwing myself out there or waiting for a project. Thank you, I appreciate the responses. I've been applying and reaching out to people since last night.

For the record, when it came to previous applications, I always would just declare my disability - but when one of my friends joked that I might be shooting myself in the foot, I just thought I'd ask here and see what kind of responses I get (definitely not the best place to ask, but it's better than nothing).

So I'm having an internship for hospitality in Austin , Texas for 1 year in a hotel. I'm not going to give any specific hotel names or anything like this on purpose. I would like to share my situation with you guys with the hope if you can give me the right advice of what should I do in this situation , hopefully someone else has been in the same position as me. 

So I'm on a J1 visa , my sponsors are CIEE if that matters , they are the people who I should seek help if I'm having any troubles with my internship but I can't really decide if I should or not , that's why I need your advice!

I started my internship in the beginning of July , it's been around  6 months since then. All I have done is to just work on a front desk - pm and night shifts. I was kind of getting ''training'' in the beginning . My training plan on paper is as follows :

\- first month - orientation and housekeeping

\- front desk until 21st of December

\-  few months in Back office / Management

\- few months in Food and Beverage Service

I know it sounds very generic , but I will try to keep it as short as possible, ask me if you need a bit more info for the specific department. 

For the whole 6 months all I've done is just extremely generic tasks  such as checking in people , dealing with complaints , the typical front desk stuff + a bit of paperwork on a night audit where there's nothing much to learn there. 

My general manager is supposed to be the person supervising my internship , providing frequent feedback of how I'm doing etc.  Not a single time has he gathered me and the other intern ( we are roommates , he is an supervisor)  in this hotel to analyze our progress and see how we are doing. He doesn't care at all for his interns , there's 1 more intern in the next hotel where that gm manages too  and that person is saying that he's been treated as a slave too. I've already realized that these hotels are getting interns ONLY to use them as a cheaper working hand , giving them fake promises and thinking they will be stupid enough to accept it and live like that!

I've been busting my ass for that whole period - covering 1 shift on my day off then turns out the next person to relieve me calls in sick so I have to do his shift too - 3 p.m to 7 a.m shift! Happened few times. Then I've had night shifts from 11 pm to 7 am and have to get back to work at 3pm. Not only this , but I'm paid way less than every other normal employee there. I'm getting paid 10.75 for pm shifts as per contract and in the beginning the manager told me that  I will be getting an extra 1$ for my night shifts. After the second month of doing night shifts I realized my rate is not changing , they keep paying me for 10.75 no matter which shift I'm doing. I spoke with the gm , he said next paycheck it will be fixed .IT TOOK THEM 6 MONTHS TO adjust and finally repay me what they owed me!  And the even more ridiculous thing was , when they realized they weren't paying me more money for my night shifts , the GM told me I will be getting paid 0.50$ !! I've no idea why I didn't say anything. I was really trying my best , always covering shifts , trying to prove myself to the team , been nice with everyone , never complained , never made any problems. 

But that's just some of the horrible experience I'm having with that hotel! I was told I will be provided uniform and everything upon arriving , IT TOOK THEM 3-4 MONTHS to get me 2 shirts and 1 suit. I've never received any pants as they told me and it was mentioned in my internship papers too! They literally just don't care about their interns to have uniforms! Thanks god I  decided to take with me some of my official clothes just in case! 

I'm struggling to survive the month , the bills are extremely high , I've never knew how expensive here is and how much exactly 10.75$ an hour is. My friends who was here 2 years ago told me that I should be fine , but it turns out the prices increase with each year here. I'm making around 1600$ after tax with no overtime. My rent+ bills are around 900$ !!! I'm left with 700$ for food , I do smoke ( I know I shouldn't but that's the only thing literally for me to do ) if it's raining or really cold I take an uber 6.35$ each way to work and that's it. I can't afford going out , it's ridiculously expensive here. I live far away from downtown and the uber is like 20-25$ each way , there's no public transport to get me there , and I don't own a car as I can't afford it! I'm feeling like I'm in a prison because I simply don't go out , I'm struggling financially. I'm so depressed because of it and I have no clue what to do. No one actually appreciated my hard work and believe me I'm really working hard , I've had months where I've worked 30 out of 31 days! My normal schedule is 3 PM shifts and 2 night shifts. I'm kind of managing to get used to the sudden change of my sleeping cycle with these night shifts , but now my third PM shift is replaced with another night shift! I feel awful because my body starts getting used to not sleeping during the night and I feel like a zombie when I get back to my other shift or my day off! And also I can't sleep more than 4-5 hours after these shifts and therefore I'm feeling extremely drained the whole day! This week , I worked the whole week night shifts , I had 2 days off seperated 1 on sunday and one on wednesday. I sacrificed my holiday so everyone else can enjoy Christmas , because literally if me or my friend ,the other intern ,didn't volunteer, there would be no one working on these days! A full week of night shifts means my schedule is so messed up , it's just horrible . No one else is doing such shifts , no one else gets such changes in their schedule. Literally they don't give a single shit about their interns. They have never recognized me for nothing , housekeepers are getting recognized for taking different shifts , when at the same time I'm the one doing 16 hours shifts , doing night shift to pm shift , not having any days offs and still no one actually recognizes it ,it's hilarious! Some of my colleagues are telling me ''Hey I can't believe you didn't get employee of the month , you worked your ass this month'' and I'm like yeah , maybe next month , but nope. There's a lot more to say , but I'm trying not to get that much into detail , hopefully you can get the whole picture! It's just that I've invested more than 7000$ for this internship , and not only I can't get any kind of return of the investment but I feel horrible with these shifts and the management being so careless! If I get in touch with CIEE I'm sure everyone will look bad on me , they will treat me like shit , I'm 100% sure of this. The thing is there will be 2 more interns working in the 2 hotels who are at the same page as me . It's not just me being very pretentious , we have room for comparison of previous years where we had friends working in same town , other hotel and they had the time of their life - made lots of money , had great experience, made great friends. I'm not getting a single one of these things! I really don't know what to do , please help me!

Thank you all who made the effort to read this whole piece and gave me advice!

aaciqg,17,2018-12-28,Current undergrad interested in bioinformatics. Advice?,rhuls,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/aaciqg/current_undergrad_interested_in_bioinformatics/,"I'm thinking of possible switching my major from biomedical engineering to a major that can set me up for bioinformatics. My school offers a major in bioinformatics where you can choose to be more bio or cs based or they offer a bs in biology with either a masters or masters of science in computer science co-terminal in 5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large interest in biology, the human body, and the medical field. I also deal with quite a few health issues which is what is prompting me to consider other majors. The lab work associated with just a biology degree or biomedical engineering degree isn't something that I'm sure my body would be able to handle in 10+ years. Bioinformatics sounds like it may be a good fit for having a flexible job in the future while combining things I'm interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good background in math (Calc 1,2,3 and Diff. Eq) and excel at it. I have taken general and human biology which I loved. BME doesn't actually require a ton of bio classes so I have some more experience in bio but it's been varied throughout bme classes. I have take 1 semester of Java which was new to me but I enjoyed and a BME class that used Matlab for analysis which was interesting. So I don't have a ton of CS experience atm, but do love biology and math.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a major/career that is still in the biology/biomed/health fields and has good prospects for someone with progressive physical problems. (Also one that will have a good enough salary to pay back student loans)

&amp;#x200B;

Q's:

1. Does bioinformatics sound like a good possible match?

2. What is the best way to go about bioinformatics? (continue BME degree, bioinformatics major, bio undergrad + CS masters, or bio undergrad + masters of science in CS)

&amp;#x200B;

3. What are the job prospects? How is the pay? Are jobs only found in cities? 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Is it hard to get hired with a bioinformatics degree? A problem with BME is jack of all trades master of none / any other engineering job can also be hired in that position. Are just CS degree's more likely to get the job?

&amp;#x200B;

5. In order to have good job prospects after college is it pretty essential to have internships/research for most summers? (So far for every break I've had a surgery scheduled and have been unable to do internships bc of this)

&amp;#x200B;

6. How much schooling is ideal?

&amp;#x200B;

7. Are there any websites that would give me a good idea of whether I'd enjoy this type of work within the next week or two?

&amp;#x200B;

There our lecturers come from Russia teach as the one semester material in just 3 weeks! We have only that particular subject all that 3 weeks for 6 days a week with 6 hours a day!!! At first I thought that over time I will get used to it but know I am in my 3rd year and I am completely lost. Because of that method of studying we haven't learned anything.
Because of that University I haven't made new friends because it's very small University only 250 people(in my group only 6). Also with that system I haven't learned anything from math and I can't even solve simple interview questions to pass for a internship!! I had a dream of becoming a PHD but this University ruined my life I wasted 3 years and not learned what I was supposed to learn and also I don't have the interesting student life.
Now I completely lost because of it I don't know Math to pursue my career as Data Scientist. 
Please help me."

aaeagg,0,2018-12-28,Bit lost in how to prepare for technical interviews,pouyank,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aaeagg/bit_lost_in_how_to_prepare_for_technical/,"So a bit of backstory: when I graduated high school I went to CC and tried transferring for electrical engineering (though I really had no idea what I wanted to do). I got accepted into Berkeley for EECS and now I pivoted and decided that having a career as a software developer, at least from the onset, might be right for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a transfer though means I'm super pressed for time. I'm just starting my data structures course (CS61B for anyone who's heard of it) this coming semester, when lots of companies recruit, and unless companies recruit early summer I pretty much need to be 5 steps ahead of the class.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this might be a little ambitious, but all I want right now is to have some kind of paid programming work this summer, even though I really only started considering software development as a career a few months ago. I learned how to learn very quickly from my time in CC so I'm not worried about any mental hurdles along the way, but I just want to study the best and most useful material as soon as possible because I'm so stressed for time. I don't care if I'm working 16 hours a day somedays during the school year if it means I'll be able to work this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how familiar you guys are with Berkeley's coursework but I guess the pinnacle of what I know now is how to make a basic scheme interpreter in python and how to deal with stupid abstract questions like \[this\]([https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~cs61a/fa18/assets/pdfs/61a-fa18-final.pdf#page=5](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa18/assets/pdfs/61a-fa18-final.pdf#page=5)) and those found on tests like this. This past summer I did some leet code problems so I'm not starting from 0, but I'm not starting a lot higher from 0 either.

&amp;#x200B;

What I basically want to know is for someone with my knowledge of CS, what's the absolute best and most efficient materials I should study to do good on my technical interviews and land a solid internship for the summer? I know I won't be working for google or facebook anytime soon, but working for a small company or startup that pays $30/hr is more than anything I could ask for at the moment. People always default to cracking the coding interview, but I also hear it's a bit overrated. Could someone give me a pointer on exactly what would be the best course of action for me, with all things considered?"

So, my background is like this:

I have a BA in IT.

I have worked as a tech support but I hated it.

I'm in my early 30s and now I'm living off of my savings. I want to get a job related to python programming asap.

I've started learning to code 8 months ago with freecodecamp, I've learned html, CSS, sass, jQuery and some JavaScript. But the fact that I had to learn so many new frameworks just made me stop and apparently there is a new frame work every 6 months and I felt that I can't keep up with that.

3 months ago, I started a bootcamp in mobile dev, unsure on what I wanted to do, then I realized I hate java and swift and didn't want to get a job as a mobile dev. so basically, I wasted 3 months on a tech that I hate now.

during the bootcamp I did finish some very basic projects like a calculator, we were rushed to learn so many things in 3 months and basically for those apps I copied and pasted the code, mostly not understanding what I was doing. and I feel like a fraud.

after these experiences now, I know I don't like JavaScript and I hate Java and Swift and the slow and pathetic android studio and XCode which I had to suffer these three months.

recently i was so sad on why I can't choose a programming language and stick to it, till i saw a video of this guy.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

He is talking about artificial intelligence, machine learning and some amazing stuff and I realized I had to learn python to enter this world.

So now I'm learning the basics of python with this course:

[https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036)

and plan to do this course to build some projects:

[https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/)

Right now, I’m enjoying learning python. I think compared to java, JavaScript and swift, this is a sweet language.

But I want to get a job as fast as possible.

this is one of the internships that I’m interested in:

**Candidates must have:**

**·competency in at least one of the following languages: Python, Java, C#, C++**

**·knowledge of fundamental computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithms**

**·knowledge of software design, architecture and patterns**

**·comfortable working extensively with version control systems like Git**

But the problem is I don't know anything about **data structures and algorithms. they didn't teach that in bootcamp and i really want to apply for this internship.**

how can I do that even I'm a newbie in python and I have very noob projects in java and swift, which I didn't understand the building process and just copied and pasted the code.

I don't want to include those projects in my portfolio because I can't explain them if someone asks.

My goal is to work in artificial intelligence and machine learning field. Since I’m new I don't even know the difference but I’m trying to learn everyday and the idea excites me.

If you have any other advice on how to get a job or internship as a newbie python programmer, please share.

If you have any ideas about best python courses to build a great project, let me know."

aaejnx,49,2018-12-28,Is the hiring/recruitment system failing young people?,randoma1231vd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/aaejnx/is_the_hiringrecruitment_system_failing_young/,"I would love to get some input on this.

It's widely known that many people--especially college graduates--are facing [severe underemployment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2018/06/08/underemployment-persists-throughout-college-graduates-careers/#62ff22ba7490). The bar for entry level work has been raised, and [qualifications have been inflating](https://talent.works/blog/2018/03/28/the-science-of-the-job-search-part-iii-61-of-entry-level-jobs-require-3-years-of-experience/) like crazy. There are significant numbers of smart, diligent, and eager people working crap jobs. Why does no one seem to care about this? Isn't this an extremely worrisome issue?

I'm definitely biased here: I graduated in May with a STEM degree and have lots of employable skills, namely statistics and programming. I am confident that my abilities are more than enough for an entry level job. But I can barely get interviews. It's easy to blame myself: I should have had more internships, should have networked more, should have done more of this and that and so on. All of that is true, but it begs the question: why has the bar been set so damn high? Why are these things necessary now for entry level work, when they certainly didn't used to be? 

I really believe the system itself and the way we hire people is partially to blame. There's too much automation, unrealistic expectations, nepotism, shortsightedness, etc. This isn't economically healthy. There's far too much talent going unrecognized by the hiring system. And there's far too many people given unearned advantages because they knew the right person or met some other arbitrary criteria. 

I know numerous people who are in the exact same predicament as me. I know a physics grad who's working in retail; I know another guy who's a genuinely great person and has a high aptitude for computers, yet he's working some crap job making an unlivable wage. I also know many humanities/social science majors who have nothing going for them. And sure, you could argue that people should only study fields that directly translate to jobs (I'll withhold the fact that such fields don't really exist). But that's so short-sighted. Education never has and never will be job training. My degree was in mathematics. Does math translate directly to a job? No, not at all. But it should, at the very least, signal some level of competence to a prospective employer. Isn't this ultimately what matters most?

I really think this whole issue isn't given enough attention. I think it is serious. I think people are too quick to blame job seekers, when the reality is that companies are [unwilling to invest in people](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314468). I metaphorically roll my eyes every time I hear companies whine about ""unprepared graduates."" From my experience, the vast majority of college graduates are *over-prepared* for entry level work (especially for generic business positions). I think we may be witnessing the beginning of the slow and steady degradation of our labor economy. Cue the spooky sound effects.

What do you guys think?"
aaelbt,0,2018-12-28,Did interning at top tech company over-qualify me for entry-level jobs at smaller companies?,Doub1eVision,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aaelbt/did_interning_at_top_tech_company_overqualify_me/,"I interned at a top tech company over Summer 2018. I did not get a return offer immediately following that internship. So over the Fall 2018 semester, I applied to many companies with plans to start full time work in Summer 2019. I applied to companies of all sizes. But I only ever got responses from top companies: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, and various SF startups/midsized tech companies . By responses, I mean that I was in these companies' interview process. All of the smaller tech companies that I applied to did not even send me an initial response to my application. And I don't necessarily mean that those companies were tiny, they just weren't top tech companies.

In the end, it worked out fine for me. I ended up getting offers from some top tech companies and I ended up actually taking an offer from the company I interned with over the summer, oddly enough. But until I got these offers recently, I was really stressing that only top companies were giving me attention because getting an offer from a top tech company would be much harder. I couldn't get any safety-net offers from smaller companies the whole time. Is it likely that having a top tech internship on my resume caused these smaller companies to pass on me? Is this something I should be worried about in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Did an internship at a top tech company. Afterwards, I was only able to get even initial interest from other top tech companies for full time positions. Smaller companies completely ignored my applications. Ended up recently getting offers from a few top tech companies, but for a long time I was worried that I was going to get no offers. Am I now considered over-qualified by smaller companies and is that going to be an issue for me in the future?"

The other opportunity is back home in California, where I finish my degree and go to law school and partner with my stepdad who is very reputable. I would then grow the practice, that’s the plan at least.
Now I know working for a software company and going into law are completely different. And I honestly find interest in both. 
My issue is that I am 25 and I have been strolling through the last couple of years if you may. Trying to figure out my path. 
I know both will be hard, school and law school isn’t but I would not have an issue with that. Same as software and working towards that. 
I ultimately want to end up back in California as I feel that is home. 
I only say time is running out because I constantly get asked and I really don’t have anything to show for it. And time is rushed because my step dad is also older and I don’t know how much longer he will practice law for.

I'm 18 year old buddy who likes codding and would like to be programmer, exactly Android developer. Currently I attend High  School, but finishing in May 2019. 
I'm struggling with a ""little"" problem. I'm programming in Java for 1,5 year and in Kotlin for 0,5 year. Meanwhile I'm giving lessons to students making Master's degree. 

On the one hand, I  can see few advantages going to University: easy job, graduation, good start for people who have never programmed. But on the other hand, if I were to learn boring basics, have a lot of unnecessary subjects (as students told me), staying for hours in Uni and learning something I already know , I don't know if it would be worth it. 

But if I haven't gone to University, I would go to work. But before I would go to work I have some tasks to do:
Internship - I've talked with one company and I can get 1 month intern - I think it would be better to have some experience before starting a real job.
Application for one company - one of the co-leaders told me I can try to do an app that streams video from device's camera to server over some networking protocols. I told him that I'm in, because I think it would be also a great confirmation of my skills. 
This app described above I'm planning to do before ending my High School, internship closely after finishing. 

So assuming I have done these 2 things described above, I still have a choice - going to University or not going. What would you guys do, if you were me and why? If you are an IT Recruiter and reading my post, what would you do, would you hire me or rather look for freshly graduated?

Thanks in advance for any replies."

I'm a freshman in college, and I figured over winter break I'd start applying for summer internships. However, I ran into a problem: most companies (understandably) want a link to an online portfolio with code. Fine, I thought, and I made a GitHub profile, put a bunch of programming projects from my CompSci class in repositories and linked it. However, I just found out that we aren't supposed to do this because next semester students will be able to look up solutions for the same programming projects. I will delete these from being publicly accessible, but now what? Is there some way I can have a private website/link, because I still want to show companies that I can code (using the programming projects from class)? Are most portfolios public or private? Am I expected to take a few days and create my own unique programs and put them on GitHub? Like, what's the deal with these online portfolios?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Thanks for the help guys! I think the best thing to do is to make private repositories, then make an external site. On the external site, link the several private repositories on GitHub as examples of work.**

I program as a hobby, but I've got no experience in the field and I'm not very knowledgeable on how the industry works.

I have a 10th-grade student who has fallen in love with programming, but is already in the only CS course we offer (AP Computer Science A). She's going to do an independent study next year, and a capstone project her senior year.

She's deeply interested in hacking and information security, and not in the superficial sort of way. She wants to know everything about hardware, networking, encryption software, and how all the pieces fit together.

She plans on going to college for CS, followed by grad school. This is the type of student who talks about that in 10th grade, and will actually do it. She wants to be internship or job-ready by graduation, so she can gain concrete work experience while studying the theoretical side in college.

I feel like I'm not really qualified to steer her in the right direction. My degree was in pure math, and everything I know about programming was self-taught as a hobby. Unfortunately, that makes me the only teacher on campus with any CS knowledge at all. 

Following a COMPTIA A+ study guide seems like it could be a solid, structured approach to learning this material, but I'm not really sure if that's the right approach to take.

Any suggestions on projects or goals we could set for her would be greatly appreciated.

As cliche as it sounds, I did my engineering from a Tier 1 institute, was disillusioned with the idea of engineering.
Waited for job, turned out even job sucks

Prepared for CAT, turned to an MBA, got into a really good institute, internship and decent batch rank, but turns out, I am just doing these things because of more reliable promises of a better future, I simply hate these things
Like if somebody gives me an assurance of financial independance, I will drop all this in less than a nanosecond.

I want to switch in some way if possible after an MBA with some degree, certification or anything good under the sun, I just don't want to go ahead with this thing or career for the next 40 years of my life.

Any thing that you know of, that can be pursued in order to diversify into something I'd like?

What would I like to do with my life?
I don't know. Because: 
Never thought that deeply because since childhood, after lot of ""No"" to the most basic of wishes due to financial limitations, I had decided I will try my best to never have any financial limitation in my life ever

Turns out, nothing like that happens. You get into high CTCs, at the same time get into numerous debt traps and stupid job you hate all because you once thought it was all cool

While those things are not that desirable now in my life, I feel after finishing this degree, I might as well do something I would like with my life.

Which I don't know what is
Hence I request you to tell about anything, any degree or whatever that people do, other than this MBA thing in their life.

Sab moh maaya hain BC. Kuch nahi rakha in sab mein, if there is no goal defined.
Especially with me being disillusioned, I feel like exiting everything.

I wanted to vent this somewhere, thanks.

But the job will start only from May-June. To cover the time in between, manager is willing me to offer another full time contract for 6 months, so that I start working early and will convert the limited contract to unlimited around May-June. 

 

So my question is, Can I apply for work visa(employer cannot hire me as a student, needs the status as working) now with the limited contract before my defense or I would have to wait till I get my degree ? The manager wants me to start from mid-Feb.

So here's the deal:

The work has nothing to do with cs *(besides staring at a computer screen all day)*, I have minimum wage, we already have a program that does what this does, except it's so barebones that it's practically useless and saves at most 5 minutes *(mine, at best, 20-30 minutes, not a whole lot but still way ahead of what we have now, and it's still just the first iteration)*.

One of my biggest flaws is that I agree to things without bargaining *(probably wouldn't have minimum wage otherwise)*. I was about to just let my bosses know, go through the code to make sure there's nothing malicious, and start using it, but one of my coworkers stopped me and told me that I have to be compensated for this.

I have never made a program for ""professional"" use before, just home or internship projects. Obviously I should be compensated for something that makes *work* easier.

The question is, how the hell do I bring that up if I even agree to minimum wage?

At V1.0, the program is already 5x better than what we have now, and I have 3-4 planned features to add to it, maybe even replace three more programs we use. It would kill everything else we have. We do contract work for a bunch of companies, some pulled off because we were slow and inefficient *(mostly because we rely on 4 systems working flawlessly, which they rarely do, at least 2 server crashes a day)*. One of the features I am considering to put in literally cuts a third of a day off *(hence why I'm just considering adding it, it's really easy to add it, don't want anyone losing a job here)*.

Anyway, back to track.

I am also looking for a new job, *really* want to land a software dev job, so obviously a beast like this would look great on my resume so I need to make it happen.

What should I ask for? Like, not a number, just *what* should I ask for? A raise? Free time compensation? Cash? New job position *(with raise)*? Nothing at all but recommendation?

I may have done it on my free time, but I made it *for* work.

I made it entirely on my own free time

I am a sophomore engineering major ( I am not in an engineering major yet but most likely Computer Science or Interdisciplinary Engineering with an emphasis in mechanical and computer science. I aspire to be a product designer.   


I am approaching my 300th job applications (yay!) and so far I have only had 3 interviews in my life time. One I begged for, one I was defaulted to, and the other was a present. All three of these interviews didn't involve my resume at all so I think their may be something with my resume that is stopping me from getting jobs.   


I like to think think for internships I am somewhat qualified and I normally get recruiters to drop their jaw at first sight, but I can't get any to take me to the interview portion. The jobs I apply for consist of UX / UI design, product design , software development, mechanical design , and engineering consultant summer internships . I add more or less information about certain positions in order to meet the needs of each job, but this is a general average. The only times I get close (like maybe a rejection email) to people are if they go on my website (I can tell by comparing email time and traffic times since no one goes to my website without my link) but judging by the traffic, only 2-3% of people even get to my website.   


So . . . I am open to any suggestions you may have. When I ask recuiters they just suggest keep ""doing what you're doing"" and removing my GPA but for most cases neither seems to work.

Hey reddit please help me, i feel super miserable right now and I don’t know what to do. 

TL:DR: I met a girl on a house party and cannot stop thing about her. She goes to a different university and I will probably not see her again soon. My body is like in love with her and I cannot stop thinking about her. What can I do to forget her?

It is quite a long story, english is not my native tong, so bare with me. Hope you guys can understand the situation I’m in. Here is the background story, but first some information about myself
I’m a 21 year old male, 4 year student. Decent popular, okay with girls (few hook ups every now and then), but never had a girlfriend before. Friends told me that I’m ready to have a girlfriend and that I should go look for one.


This summer I was a guide in the introduction week of my university. I met this amazing girl (lets name her ‘T’) in my guidance group, we had a great introduction week, the week after I asked her out and she said yes. About 2 weeks had passed, we had been texting each other a lot and 1 day before the date she sent me the “lets be friends” text. I was really upset, felt really sick and couldn’t sleep for weeks. I really liked her, but she liked an another guy more and now it’s her boyfriend

3 weeks after that ‘friend zone’ text, I went to a house party of a friend of mine, she is in a sorority. I played a game of beer pong with a few of her friends. After that game one of them (call her ‘N’) walked up to me and we started talking. After an hour she asked me if I wanted to be her date for her sorority’s ball (5 weeks later). I said yes and I spend the rest of the evening talking to her. Then she asked me if I could bring her home that night, I did, we exchanged numbers and we made out nothing more.

The entire night I felt like she was more into me, than I into her. For example, she walked up to me first, she asked me to bring her home and she actually made the first move to kiss me. But the next morning I texted her, she was like yea lets to the ball together, but that was it. She was not into texting, she only gave like really short answers. Which was weird but okay I don’t like texting either.

But here comes the problem. I was still into T at that time, so every time I thought of T I said to myself: no, put your energy and thought in N because you are going to the ball with her etc. So did that and I got over T.  I was really excited for the ball, but unfortunately 2 days before the ball, N texted me that her close friends couldn’t find a date (confirmed) and she was not sure if she wanted to go alone with me without her close friends. I said, if you would like to go, then I would love to go with you. 1 day later she texted me back, saying that she really enjoyed the house party with me, but when her friends are not going to the ball, she does not want to go either. She even said that it was all her fault and that It had nothing to do with me. Then I asked her if she wanted to do something else then together and she said no, she said that she was not into dating me. Going to the ball was fun and stuff, but dating no. 

This all happened like 2 months ago, but I still think of N every day. I just cannot forget her, I went to parties reaching out to many girls, but when I talked to these girls I felt nothing. I don’t feel the same connection with these girls compared to what I had with N. And I know it’s silly and stupid to think that N is ‘perfect’. I cannot get rid of that thought, I deleted facebook, instagram of my phone, so I had no urge to ‘stalk’ her on social media and I blocked everything related to her sorority too.

But one time I was so obsessed with her that I went to a party thinking that N would be there too, cause I saw that all her friends were going. But she was not there, because she is doing a full time internship right now (until February), so she is not going out. Then I realized I am obsessed with her, this is a toxic feeling and it needs to stop. 

I keep saying to myself, N is not the one, just go out and meet new girls. But somehow my brains cannot let N go, I talked to many friends, but non can help me. 
There’s a small chance that I will see N again in the near future and therefor I don’t give my hopes up yet, who knows that future could bring (even though I know it’s BS and she probably never thought of me again after that party).

I thought of a few reasons why I cannot get over N. One, i liked T so much, but I could not get her, so I put feelings I have for T into N. Therefor the feelings I have for N may be because I still like T. Second, a girl had never asked me to go with her to a ball or something like that, N was the first person to do so, so in my mind she is special.
Third, I truly felt like we had a great connection, 
I have never spoken to a girl before like N, we had such similar interests and we had a similar way of thinking.
Fourth, maybe I am too desperate to find a girl friend, that’s why I would love to be with N just for having a girl friend.


Pff reddit help me, what can I do. I want to her the cold hard truth, tell me what I can do to forget her and move on with my life. Because it’s an obsession and addiction and it needs to stop

As for me, I don't even know where to start with taking care of a kid. I can barely take care of myself. I've got a decent job for one person, and we were going to make things work. We were both going to have a job, get a fairly decent apartment in the city, a dog, travel a whole lot. I was going to go back to school, and  we were not going to have a kid for the next 5-10 years. Obviously this isn't going to happen anymore. 

So first of all my job. I currently work at a Credit Union in online support. Like I said, it's a good job for one person, but there's no way I can support a family with it.  I've got no marketable skills, or at least I don't know how to market them. I have an associates in digital audio, but it turns out you need to have years of unpaid internships on top of your degree to get a job as a sound engineer. I'm also very techy and have a bit of skill with computers and programming, but not enough to start a career with. This is actually what I was planning on going back to school for and making a career of. I  feel like I need a real career type job to make this work, but my biggest problems are that I don't know how to get them. I'm horrible at networking with people, and don't have anyone that can connect me with a career like that. I don't know who to talk with, or how to talk with them (I'm a bit socially awkward). Also, I've always struggled with confidence, and with laziness. It seems like I can't get anywhere in any career without these types of skills, and I just have never had them.

Part of our plan was for me to go back to school. I don't know how to start a career with the degree that I have, and feel like I'd do better in computer or web development. The problem is I have no real experience or qualifications in that type of field. Originally I was going to do both school and work full time. I don't know how I could afford to do that with a kid, but in the long run I don't know how not to.

So I just need advice on what to do. Obviously I have no clue how to support a family, start a career, or be an adult. What can I do to go about getting a job I need to support a kid? Should I go back to school? Help!"
aat3mw,4,2018-12-30,Decaying mental health,santamademe,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/aat3mw/decaying_mental_health/,"I’m posting on the app and also this is my first time here. I read the rules, I believe I’m following all of them but I’ll revise them and this in the morning.

So, quick FYI so everyone is up to the picture: I’ve had anxiety diagnosed since I was 21 but I probably started showing signs early in adolescence. Typical stuff you could say was a teen being moody. I went through a major depressive episode in my early twenties due to law school which was 100% not my choice.

I hate law and always have. I know I need to leave but I really can’t seem to think about any alternative and I don’t want to go to my parents. I still live with my mom (which is common where I live) and she’s fine but my dad uses money as a control technique and to quit would mean having to go through more shaming from him.

I’m currently in my first big relationship in years. I really love him. I really love my friends and my family.

But I moved to a new job and I was told a lot of things that weren’t true and now I might not be able to get the bar (you need to intern). I studied for extra years to avoid the field so I spent a lot of time in academia and this is just another set back on my CV (some find extra studies as a sign of me being lazy, I swear I’m not lazy).

My mental health is decaying. I cry at my job, I need extra sleep during the day because I’m always exhausted from not sleeping at night in a panic to to work. I’m pushing away everything and everyone because I don’t want to constantly be a disappointment.

I’m afraid my boyfriend will leave me because he’s been in a toxic relationship before and I’m scared he’ll see my mental health as an issue so I spiral out of control sometimes and get into the pit of anxiety and self doubt that he’s not attracted to me anymore because I’m not stable.

I can sense my mental health slipping away and I don’t know what to do. Last time I lost control I spent two years basically staring at walls. 

What do you do when you don’t want to lose everything?"

aau460,13,2018-12-30,Update - received a chronic pain diagnosis and needing some help,plsnophp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aau460/update_received_a_chronic_pain_diagnosis_and/,"Hey everyone! So, I have officially gotten diagnosed with fibromyalgia which is a chronic pain condition that involves over active nerves. Things that shouldn't hurt do. I am graduating very soon and I need advice. I really appreciated the support last time, so I'll explain my illness and limitations and then go into questions I have regarding jobs and HR.

- chronic, widespread, debilitating pain everywhere in my body (this is somewhat controlled with medications that have a lot of side effects regarding alertness) I have no idea when this will hit, how bad it will be, or how much I'll be able to accomplish. It causes close to total immobility at the worst points.

- difficulty typing/writing (appreciated the cool software for speech recognition for programmers, thanks!)

- muscle spasms (again, meds make me exhausted)

- short/long term memory issues (I use a note pad, but it honestly doesn't help as much as I want it to)

- brain fog (this makes running through my own code frustrating)

- aphasia, forgetting words, jumbling sentences especially when stressed (I don't think anything client-facing is for me)

- poor stress management (stress causes my symptoms to flare, but I am seeing a therapist to try and get more control over this)

- debilitating anxiety and depression (I think I've found meds that work well for me, but they make me very tired and disoriented)

- extreme fatigue, poor sleep, insomnia

- debilitating migraines, sensitivity to light and sound, vision changes (I must lay down and sleep to make them go away, but I have had vitamins suggested to prevent these from happening as frequently. Staring at screens for long periods of time makes things worse.)

Now that that's over with, I have some questions. I've had three jobs, but not when I was diagnosed. The first (non-CS) knew about my pain and worked me harder anyway, so I have a lot of negative experiences with trying to get the people I work for to understand my limitations. My symptoms have gotten ten times worse since my second internship. I constantly felt terrible, but now I'm experiencing a lot more pain than before.

1. How do I bring this up with HR other than doctors notes? To what extent should I go into detail of how serious my condition affects my daily life? Should I let my superiors know or is that HR's job? How do I talk about how much I may miss work because I'm bed-ridden some days? I'm terrified that I'll be overlooked for raises or other jobs within the company ladder because I'll be seen as lazy or stupid. I know it's illegal in the US to do that, but it is a legitimate fear of mine. I had so much confidence about my abilities until my symptoms dampened my ability to do what I am passionate about. I feel so stunted.

2. I am interested in sys admin work, but open to other ideas. Management isn't out of the question for the future, but I'm specifically asking about new grad titles/positions I should look into that don't require constant programming. I'm also looking into project management since I enjoyed that class and I pay attention to detail- I friggin love diagrams and reports. I am also interested in security audits (especially physical security- locks, door installation, cameras).

3. Benefits - is there a list of companies with good health benefits such as funding for personal trainers, yoga, massages, etc? Is this something that you should ask about in the interview process? Those types of benefits would really improve my quality of life. Microsoft really stands out to me.

The clock is ticking down to graduation, I'm starting my job hunt freshly diagnosed with a condition that is seriously hindering my abilities. I spent so long getting my BS CS and I hate that I might have to stray from development roles because of this. I have no idea how much this will affect my daily life with a full time job, but I'm already missing a lot of class and doing poorly on tests. I really need guidance.

Also, I am working with my disability people at my university and I'm looking into conferences for CS folks with disabilities and chronic illnesses. I'm hoping I can find a mentor through that.

Thanks guys!"

Right now the most probable graduation date for me is on December 2019, which is what I've been putting down on my resume for my internship hunt. I will have finished my major requirements by then so staying in school until spring is kind of a waste of money.

However, I have a strong desire to travel for a few months before settling into my new job (my family is from the other side of the world so I would like to spend some time with them too before I settle into the US). Ideally this would be around 3 to 6 months. I have been saving up for the past few years so money is not a big concern.

I am worried about how this will affect job hunting. If possible I want to secure a job before I go travelling. I'm assuming most companies would want me to start as soon as possible, and it would be hard to convince them to wait for me to join for months (which is completely understandable from their perspective). I've also thought about taking a gap semester for the fall and travel during then, but since most companies recruit during the fall I'm concerned how this would affect getting a job too.

Has anyone had a similar experience to this, and want to give advice?"

I am aware that computer science draws heavily on coding and I would like to know more about possible job opportunities / research opportunities in this career field. I have a little background knowledge of machinery from my previous experiences, which I am hoping will come in handy as I slog my way through the study area. Any advice / help would be appreciated. 

Also, I forgot to mention but I am interested in making games and creating software that helps with engineering analysis (eg. FEA Analysis), although I haven't been directly involved with any of these experiences before (but I would love to). Are there any age restrictions for programming or for someone to qualify as a programmer as such and if so what is your threshold? I am worried that due to my mature age, I might be prevented from working as a programmer after I graduate (I will be almost 30 by the time I graduate). 

Any programmers in Japan? Could you let me know what fields of programming Japanese are mostly interested in and if there are any opportunities for Gaijin? I met this programmer at a recent Japanese language test center (for which I have been studying as a hobby for the last five years) and he seemed interested in moving to the country with his girl friend (nihonjin) after his success with the game he and his studio team had been working on. It's apparently a game with a shark and emphasis on underwater experiences. It seemed much like Subnautica but with a darker twist on it. I haven't played the game personally, only watched Let's play videos on YouTube by a famous Youtuber but it was interesting. 

I have no idea regarding details of what computer science as a field entails. It has only recently come to my attention as I realised that many internships in college and jobs require knowledge of programming and this is actually an employable skillset to have, which is one of the reasons I am considering. (Another reason is that I personally feel interested in learning more about algorithms such as Artifical Intelligence). A potential drawback I see to studying this field is that I won't be able to pursue another opportunity while I study the degree and there will be countervailing costs to it in the end that offset amounts of time and money I spend on studying it. 

Hence, I would be interested to know what kinds of job opportunities are out there for people who study in this area and their experiences in undergrad and workforce. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my question. I look forward to hearing your answers."

I'm posting on here because I need advice on IT/CS, and my apologies in advance for a long post. This past May I graduated from a small but prestigious university (atleast in the northeast US) with a degree in Finance. However, due to working through college and my general dislike for college, I graduated with a very average gpa (2.8, which is probably worse than average but I still managed to land a good internship my senior year.) Since graduating, I have had a few short contract positions as a procurement analyst or Accounts Receivable analyst making only around 15/hr because I have not been able to land a full time job yet. In the 3 contract positions I have had so far, each one makes me not want to work Accounting/Finance for the rest of my life, so I would rather make a transition now. 

Over the past few months, I have been contemplating going towards IT/CS field for a few reasons:
1) I've always had an interest in gaining knowledge in CS/IT as I know that this is the information age and it is very valuable to understand how computer systems/IT works. I read a reddit post a few months ago on how useful it is to learn Python. I have been trying over the past 3 months to teach myself Python like a madman, but I have no direction or clear idea of why I'm learning Python. I'm just doing it because from my research I see that it is quite useful and versatile to learn. However,
because I don't have a clear goal/purpose in mind, it makes the learning part really drab.
2) I have a creative side to me and I look at learning coding/IT as a good way to maybe one day create my own products?
3) The third reason is that my father has been in IT/IS for 30+ years and has his own IT company which gets govt. contracts, so he has a lot of connections that could help me out (this isn't the main reason I want to get into that field, I'm not looking for a handout. I'm genuinely interested in learning and proving myself. This is just a cherry on top.)

Again sorry for the long read but here are some questions I have:
1) What are some good ways to build a solid knowledge base in IT/CS so I can start exploring  IT/CS/FinTech careers? (I realize this a very open ended question, the reality is that I'm just lost right now and don't have any direction. I do know, however, that there needs to be change/progress in my life as I am sick and tired of working Accounting/Procurement contract jobs in corporate America, which certainly isn't how I envision my future. I am capable of much more, and I also know that I am interested in IT/FinTech)
2) What are some useful online resources to aid me in my learning of Python? Right now I am using a few textbooks but I'm finding it difficult as it requires just sitting there and reading. I'm looking for something more visual, so perhaps some online resources?

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I appreciate any advice/criticism."

For 4 months I lived in Seoul, South Korea in the beginning of this year for a study abroad. It of course wasn't always easy, but I can definitely say I had one of the best times of my life. I got to eat my favorite foods all the time, I constantly had something fun and meaningful to do, and I met some of the greatest friends I've had in a while. But the fantasy had to end as I was only there for a semester. My mom was ecstatic to have me back and I really wanted to be happy to be home, but it was so hard for me to feel that way. I got to go home to my mediocre life of studying and struggling in my classes, and working 2 jobs. Even if things weren't so shitty here, I think I would still wish I was back in Korea. I had a horrible time readjusting back to my home life, both physically and mentally. I've tried to do things to replicate some aspects of my life in Korea, I have to cook korean food for myself usually because the closest restaurant is an hour away, but with my soul crushing schedule, I don't have much time to cook my favorite meals. I'm losing my korean already, i'm trying to self study but its difficult, I would love to take a class but the only one available is also an hour away and $250.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been 180 days since I've come home and I've wanted to go back every single one of them. My issue is that I feel so stuck here. I can't think of a way that I can go back and its depressing me the more that I try to figure something out and come up short. My options and their flaws are:

1. **Learn korean and apply to a company there that would offer me a visa sponsorship**

* I am way too behind on the language and would need to be near fluent in less than a year.
* Its incredibly difficult to get a job abroad, especially without much experience as I would be applying right after I graduate, plus its not easy to find someone to sponsor a foreigners visa when they could just hire a bilingual native
* I still have a year until I graduate, which seems like an eternity

1. **Go back just for this summer for a few weeks through an internship or a language program**

* I looked at this option last night and it is way too expensive. 6K+ for unpaid internships and language programs

1. **Get a english teaching certificate online and apply to teach english after I graduate**

* This is probably the most stable option as the school puts you up in paid accommodations and the pay is decent. Would be on a contract with a visa sponsorship
* The certification class is $250 and if I didnt end up making it into a teaching program there (which is entirely possible as it can be pretty competitive), it would be for nothing. I would also need to make this decision pretty soon.
* Teaching is not necessarily at all what I imagined myself doing, I would love to pursue a career in my degree field, but I guess if this is my only way to relocate I would be willing to do it and do it well.
* Like the first option, this is still a year away as I don't graduate until december 2019, which just seems like 365 more days of me being in a funk I can't shake.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know. This probably all sounds stupid but I can't seem to strategize anything that could actually work out and I only get more depressed thinking about the next year i'm going to have to live being unhappy like I have been these past 6 months. If anyone could offer some ideas or even advice on how to think through this, I would appreciate it.

I've been working in my industry (web development) for about 11-13 years (depending on if you include internships).

I want to show off my expertise in different areas and I've been working with pretty much different technologies at each job.  

How do I decide what to cut down?

Lost and Stressed Sophomore...,rain-and-tea,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ab06w4/majorcareer_within_physical_limitations_lost_and/,"TL;DR: Medical conditions suck and interfere with school and wet labs. Already in student loan debt. Transferring for part time with same major isn't an option. Need guidance for careers that fit with physical limitations, but still fit my interests. No clue at what point is too much in loans....

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I knew what I wanted to do with life (med school) but do to health issues  I had to switch plans (biomed eng.). I am currently doubting my ability to go back to school full time and manage my health issues. Also due to health issues (surgeries during breaks) I have been unable to get an internship. I've heard that it's hard to get hired as a BME and with my lack of experience it will likely be much harder. Already $21,000 in student loans towards BME degree with 2.5 years left. Cannot do part time at current university bc I would lose scholarships. Cannot transfer my major to local state university bc it's they don't accept transfers for that major. Do I write the student loans off as a sunk cost? Do I try getting through the semester risking another $9,000 in student loans and my health declining? Do I switch majors and try to transfer to local university, if so what major? Is a STEM degree even a good idea for someone with my limitations and inability to set time aside to complete internships/research at undergrad level?

Long time lurker, first time poster. Read the sidebar stuff, but I hope I'm not breaking any rules posting this.

The short version of my situation is I graduated with a 3.9 GPA with my BS in IT (dual concentrating in cyber security and digital forensics) about six months ago. While I think I'm a smart fella I also think college gave me a decent introduction into a lot of stuff, but I'm not specialized anywhere. Here I am 6 months out of college looking at jobs finding nothing I think I can do or am qualified for. I am 100% not a programmer and don't desire to be. It seems like every ""entry"" level position I find wants 2-3 experience in whatever the job is. Not a lot of internships in my area either. I've had people tell me apply everywhere but I don't want to get hired somewhere with no clue what I'm doing.

I'm currently working part time at a grocery and feel miserable all the time that I can't apply my degree and find a decent job. I'm trying to work on myself/resume in the mean time by studying for my Comptia A+ cert exam (and hopefully Network+ and Security+ after), but I still feel like I'm wandering aimlessly here waiting to get lucky and see the right job. I don't know if this is a common feeling or experience others have gone through. What can I be doing to help my situation? Maybe I'm a dunce and missing the simple stuff, but this overwhelming feeling is getting to me all the time. Any advice is GREATLY appreciated."

I was able to get a high GPA (around 3.9) and have been involved in several extracurricular activities, where I hold leadership positions. However, my raw programming skills are not too great and I basically have no side projects (the ones I have are basic). I am also an international student.

My question is how much do companies care about technical skills and whether or not they care about soft skills and involvement in extracurricular activities. Just to give you context, I have applied to many internships and have mainly gotten rejections (not even make it to the interview stage). However, I recently got invited to take the interview for a company and successfully completed their programming challenge. However, I don't think my code is efficient or clean, which is why I'm doubtful.

I am really hoping that the company considers my soft skills to make up for my average programming skills. Do you think companies want you to be really technically skilled for CS internships or do they mainly care about willingness to learn and hardwork?"

I always had a low self esteem and have believed in a prophecy that I was never ""meant to"" succeed.

Two years later it got better, but two years after that, I got accepted to a university - yay! But it did the same thing to me. My mental illness relapsed. My OCD this time was more pure-O and the thoughts were absolutely horrible. My grades declined. 

Now, a bit of a back story: I developed a medical problem: long story short, I developed difficulty swallowing (I now have meds for acid reflux but the problem is still undiagnosed). But I would be constantly hungry 24/7, and as a result, unable to focus or concentrate on schoolwork or fall asleep at a reasonable hour. I developed a coping mechanism by drinking homemade fruit smoothies. Unfortunately, however, those are really expensive, and in a year, I turned a $6,300 savings into a $1,200 credit card debt. Even that was not enough to solve the problem, and the ""hangriness"" made the OCD obsessive thoughts worse.

Last summer I got a mechanical engineering internship - hooray! But I thought it was too good to be true, so I sabotaged it. :( I was expected to work 6AM to noon, five days a week, plus a Calculus class 6PM to 9PM, four days a week, plus four hours a day of studying. I failed the class and got fired from the internship for showing up late and being tired on the job.

I am not lazy. I have had several jobs recently where I work 40-50 hours per week in manual labor with little to no issues. But I need someone else to structure my time FOR me. I despise school because of my failures and associate many negative things with it.

A development in my OCD has made me 'guilty' for taking free time. I don't play guitar anymore (when I was 15 I practiced for 90 minutes per day and got extremely good as a result). I wanted to start reading as well - I bought some really cool books almost two YEARS ago - but I haven't gotten around to reading them, because of aforementioned OCD, or guilt that I don't deserve free time. 

I've only relaxed a couple of times this year. All of my ""free time"" is spent being extremely hungry, frantically going grocery shopping for food, preparing food, or making futile efforts to eat said food (often at midnight, 1AM or 2AM). Or just plain feeling guilty for taking free time. I never relaxed. For example, a year ago, I bought a ticket to go see Cannibal Corpse in concert. Even after I had bought the ticket, and even after the concert started, I was still trying to decide whether or not to go.

My parents are also very keen on my grades, because they have not been very good. My dad has threatened to take me out of school if they are not good (but in that case my mom has offered to loan me money for a semester). Plus, the credit card debt. Plus, he told me that unless extreme measures are taken, I will have to take out a loan for school. Plus, I made my dad furious at me for dropping the ball on him and ignoring his texts (due to my anxiety - but I'm afraid he'll just think I'm making excuses).

I have so much anxiety right now that I can't even look at his texts...

I'm 23, and will not experience graduation until I am 26 or 27 because the OCD-based problems have put me behind. I am a failure. My lack of a career has made me an undesirable romantic partner to women. I don't have the will to kill myself but I have the thoughts of it. I have no hobbies anymore, because my mental and physical health have eaten up my free time. I want to be like my 15-year-old self, who always drew really cool artwork out of pure, creative artistic passion. The guy who always pushed himself to get better at guitar. I even got close to learning how to play ""Through The Fire and Flames"" in real life, in its entirety. I want to be that kind of a person again."

I have an American phone number, so I do not know how I would handle the job hunt in this regards as I've heard many employers will not look at your application if it has a foreign number.

I have had internships the past three summers and have both work experience and strong extracurriculars throughout the year. 

**Language Skills/Budget**:

I originally was using it as a stepping stone to medical school which is no longer plausible do to health issues. I'm 1.5 semesters into college and have take $21,000 out in student loans. Due to the aforementioned health issues it is also much harder to do anything such as research on top of full time student status and I have been unable to do internships since every break so far I have had to schedule a surgery. I've gone from feeling very confident in what I wanted in life to pretty lost over the last year (I took medical leave for 1 years to receive some infusions and surgeries) and I don't even know if engineering is for me at this point. However, if I don't return in 2 weeks I lose all scholarships and will absolutely have to choose a different major in order to transfer home and continue at a state school.

Am I screwed? Should I switch?

If I absolutely should switch, what are good options to switch to that will accept some credits so I didn't waste $21,000 in student loans.

Credits I have (From AP's or university credits)

* Calc 1 and 2 from AP
* Diff. Eq
* Physics Mechanics, Physics Electromag. from AP
* Java 1
* Math Methods BME (focused on Matlab)
* Chem 1 and 2
* BME Instrumentation
* EKG reading and application
* General Bio from AP
* Human biology and lab
* Circuit Analsysis 1
* Digital Systems
* AP Lit, AP micro
* All but 2 of my humanities credits completed

Side note question: Is graduating with $60,000 in student loans with a BME degree manageable or too much?"
ab2g86,3,2018-12-30,In which ways will Phi Theta Kappa help me? What’s the likelihood of me getting a scholarship?,JScalzo14,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ab2g86/in_which_ways_will_phi_theta_kappa_help_me_whats/,"I recently just joined the honor society Phi Theta Kappa. I was debating joining over the past year because I wasn’t sure that it would benefit me too much. 

One thing that led me to join was putting it on a resume for employers. The school I’m transferring to in the fall does an Accounting night every year where different businesses accept applications for interns. I wanted to have something else on my resume aside from good grades in school and work. So this was the main reason I joined, to have a competitive edge when applying for internships and jobs. 

I am also aware of scholarships that you can receive upon transferring through PTK. I researched a little bit on the scholarships and other students experiences which showed people have different experiences. I noticed there are a lot of scholarships that depend on not only your academic achievements, but also with your involvement with the organization. This is where I was conflicted to join. I don’t have the time to devote to partaking in events with my chapter, as I go to school full time and work as well. This narrows my window of scholarships down to the ones that are focused on academic achievement. 

I currently have a 3.83 GPA with one more semester before transferring.  I expect that my GPA will stay around the same with either increasing slightly or slightly decreasing this semester. My question is, do you think I would receive a scholarship with my GPA? This is where I’m worried because I know PTK offers a lot of invitations, but have limited scholarships. 

I saw that you could look up the school in which you are transferring to see what they offer PTK members. The school I’m transferring to said $2,500. Is that a guaranteed scholarship that one would receive or what may or may not receive? 

I would like to hear from other PTK members who have gone through the transferring process. Ideally ones who weren’t extremely active in their chapter. I am currently already accepted to a University through a transfer program in which I will receive a 30% tuition discount for maintaining a GPA above 3.50. So getting into a school isn’t my worry, but rather driving the cost of tuition down is. Ideally I’d like to pay tuition out of pocket and not take out a loan upon transfer. Nonetheless, I still think joining will be beneficial for resume building. 

Please give your input on my situation and let me know how your experience with scholarships and transferring went with Phi Theta Kappa. "

ab2wok,36,2018-12-30,Should I attend a programming Bootcamp if I'm already pursuing a degree in computer science?,dragan15,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ab2wok/should_i_attend_a_programming_bootcamp_if_im/,"starting this January, I'll be finishing up the final semester at a university, where I'll obtain a B.S in Computer Science. Today I received an email stating that I just got accepted to a 12-week long IOS Mobile Development Bootcamp that will begin in February. The Bootcamp itself is free as the company receives sponsors from other tech companies, so there will be no financial cost to me at all for attending this bootcamp. I'm not denying the practical experience that I'll obtain from the bootcamp, but I was wondering if my time could be better allocated elsewhere (like preparing for job interviews/applying for jobs). 

To give some background on my position, on top of completing my final 12 units that I need in order to graduate, this bootcamp will likely eat away the majority of the free time that I'll have left during the spring semester, and at the moment I do not have a job lined up for me after I graduate. During my current  winter break I've been allocating my daily free time towards applying to other places, organizing meetings for the school club that I'm running, and completing a few personal projects. I've also been working as a Software Engineering intern for a small startup, that will **not** likely lead to a full-time position. I also have limited experiences in mobile development as most of my personal projects and practical experiences are focused on the full-stack development of web-based software applications. I did make a few small apps, and I had a blast workin on those projects, so I wouldn't mind progressing my skills in mobile development. I just wouldn't know how applicable swift would be in the job market, along with mobile-development in general. I am taking a mobile development course as one of my final required courses at my university, where the emphasis would be on cross-platform apps, through c#, so this experience may make me more well-rounded?

  I'm at a position where I feel that I need to just focus on applying and preparing for interviews, and highlight the experiences that I had already completed. At the same time, this bootcamp may expose me to networking opportunities, amazing lectures, and cool projects that I can add onto my resume. Should I take the opportunity considering its free, or should I focus on job hunting until I land a position?

ab3emp,104,2018-12-30,"PSA to anyone going on an international co-op: your phone company will probably try to charge you &gt;$100 for a seasonal hold to temporarily deactivate your plan so you can keep your number when you get back, but if you say you'd rather cancel your account then they will usually waive the charge.",life_of_a_penguin,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/ab3emp/psa_to_anyone_going_on_an_international_coop_your/,"If you go on an international co-op you'll probably put your Canadian cell phone plan on a seasonal hold. This basically means your account and number are both temporarily deactivated for your time away so that you don't have to pay for a phone you can't use for four or eight months, and then you get to go back to your old number after your co-op term ends. Sounds great, right? However, your carrier will usually try to charge between $10 - $20 per month for this. For example, I was surprised to see that in [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/aasmbv/for_those_of_you_whove_done_coops_in_another/) thread (which I replied in and what inspired this post), some students were paying around $15 per month to not use their cell phones while on an international co-op term. 

However, you should know that if you call your phone company and request a seasonal hold, you can usually get it for free if you **politely** tell them you will cancel your phone plan if they cannot give you a free hold. For example, my own phone call went something like this:

""Hi, I would like to put my phone on seasonal hold for the next eight months because I'm going on an internship in the USA.""

""Oh no problem! That will be $15.00 per month""

""Wait, I will have to pay every month that I don't use my phone?""

""Yes, that's our policy.""

""How much does it cost to cancel my account?""

""Oh there's no charge for that.""

""So why would I pay $120.00 to not have a phone when I can just cancel my account for free? I've been with you guys for a few years so I'd hate to do that but I can't afford to pay that much for a phone I'm not using. Is there any way you could remove the charge for the seasonal hold? Otherwise I'm afraid I would have to close my account. I might come back to Koodo after my eight months but I would also look into competitors at that point too.""

""But this will let you keep your old phone number.""

""I understand that, but I don't have many contacts so giving them my new number when I return wouldn't be difficult.""

""Okay sir, one moment, let me put you on hold.""

(Hold for 10 minutes)

""Okay sir, I am able to put your account on seasonal hold for no charge. Just so you know, you will see payments of $15.00 on your bill, but that will be credited to your account so you won't actually be paying for it in the long run.""

""Great. Thank you!""

So yeah, just politely ask for a free seasonal hold and explain that you will have to cancel your service otherwise. They should just give it to you for free. Don't let them know if you actually really need to keep your old phone number, since otherwise they know you're gonna stay with them and you lose all of your negotiating power. 

Just stay polite and explain your situation, and you should find that they'll waive the fee without much resistance. I thought that since a new co-op term is about to start, some people might find this useful. :)"
ab40dj,3,2018-12-31,Admission straight from math undergrad?,Nurylevol15,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/ab40dj/admission_straight_from_math_undergrad/,"Hello! I’m wondering if any of you could give me some guidance. I’ve been a lurker for a little while now since I decided I wanted to pursue a master’s in CS. 

I’m going to be graduating this May with a BS in applied math. I’m worried that I don’t have the prerequisite CS/programming skills needed to be accepted or be successful in the OMSCS program. 

I’ve taken all that a math major would be expected to take: calc, diff eq, discrete, linear, real analysis, abstract, numerical analysis, linear programming, modeling, graph theory. I’ve taken more statistics than many of my math classmates too. 

For CS I’ve only taken the introductory sequence at my college which covered elementary data structures, algorithms, OOP, big O notation, even a little bit threads. These used Python and Java. They were only 2 intro courses that contained all of these topics, so I can’t imagine that they went too deep since there are courses specifically for algorithms, data structures, etc.

I also have taken a statistical programming course which focused mainly on R and SAS.  

I have had some internships, but none used programming languages that are used for most of the classes that I’ve read about on reddit for OMSCS. I did a lot of data analysis and programming using JMP scripting language and Matlab. Currently I’m working as an intern at a large tech company (will matriculate to full time after graduation) using a drag and drop language to create an app (project lead prefers the interface to an actual language). The logic is still there, but it’s not the typical experience I see others in the admission threads having. 

My question is, is this enough for me to be admitted to the program? I know I’ll have to do some catch up or preparation before some courses using MOOCs, but should I take more formal CS courses before applying? I was thinking of taking a SQL class since I’m interested in databases and it would help the work that I’m doing, but would it be necessary for the application?

Other info: I will end up with around a 3.9 gpa barring any horrible times this upcoming semester and I will probably have strong letters of rec. "

Somewhat unique situation.

I went into college thinking that I wanted to become a software engineer, so, while I did get into some target schools for IB and such, I decided to go to what I felt would be the better CS school. I'm currently a first year at Georgia Tech with one semester finished and a 4.0 GPA.

I've realized that I would much rather be working in investment banking or even s&amp;t (mainly IB but I would prefer pretty much anything in finance over CS). I know that, for those types of jobs, the school you go to matters a lot and that GT is not a ""target"" school, so I wanted some advice on what path I should take to get into IB.

Theoretically,  I could switch to finance major and try to get Investment banking internships but that doesn't seem like a great move because Tech isn't really known for finance and is really good for CS.

Would it be possible for me to stay as a computer science major and logistically find an internship and eventual job as an IB? Since Tech is known for CS, I'm thinking of trying to leverage that.

If not, would my best bet be to just try and transfer to a target school and major in finance? If it makes a difference, I would prefer to stay at Tech and major in CS because I feel it provides some very good job security in case finance does not work out.

All advice would be appreciated. Thanks!P.S I don't know how much of an impact this has, but I have a top-tier CS resume with multiple related internships but nothing finance related (although it's always been a passion).

After an update, it was very slow and eventually wouldn't boot, nor recognize the HDD. The HDD would still spin, so I tried a fresh install of Windows 10 from a USB, where it would get to the black screen with the blue Windows logo. It would stay on this screen without the spinning dots indefinitely. 


Since it wouldn't detect the HDD, I tried different cables that I knew worked, and it still wouldn't detect it. I tried the old cables with a CD drive, and it was detected, so I thought I isolated the problem to the HDD. So I dug out an old laptop and tried to boot the PC with the laptop's HDD, but it also got a black screen with the Windows logo and no loading. Attempting automatic repair brings up the same screen, but with ""Preparing automatic repair"" and still no indication of loading. https://imgur.com/a/nwLdDJ9


I've scoured the Internet pretty heavily, and I've only found a few cases of this and no real solution afaik. I was pretty excited that I thought I found the problem and was going to buy a new HDD/SSD, but now I'm worried that the same thing will happen if I try to boot it off there and that it's an indication of a larger problem.

Some background:

I got a BBA in Information Systems during undergrad with a 3.2 GPA. I paid for school myself and ended up with 28k in student debt. During undergrad I knew people who really struggled to find employment and I wasn't diligent enough finding internships and the IT internship interviews I did have didn't pan out. This gave me anxiety about finding work, so I ended up taking an non IT internship with a large insurance company. I then worked full time for them but really didn't enjoy the work and now work for a large contractor as an operator at a nuclear plant. While I find my work interesting and am paid well, I work rotating 12 hour shifts and realize this career will not suit me long term. I have been coding in my free time mainly in python and java consistently read about tech. I spoke with my head manager and there is a possibility of mentoring with a software developer in the IT department of my company.

I've been looking around a few subreddits recently to try and get a feel at what it would take to pursue either of these options. I'm currently 27 and am about to begin school this coming semester. However, it's a community college in the capital of my state. I know there isn't anything wrong with starting at a community college, but there are a few things that I'm just a little worried about.

Anyway! I'm torn between pursuing something in communications/english or computer sciences... I know those are pretty different subjects and it may be a little funny to be torn between the two, but this is my thought process on them:

Communications/English- I love these subjects. I find communication to be essential in so many processes and in day to day living. I believe communication is something that a lot of people tend to undervalue or not consider when facing a problem. Career wise, I would like to go into something related to public relations or editing. However, I've always heard about the cliche with communications degrees and how difficult it can be to find a job in that field. I've read a few threads where people have asked for career advice with communications and a lot of responses seemed to suggest internships, clubs, and the opportunities those provide. My fear with starting out at a community college is that I will miss out on those opportunities and by the time I transfer into a university and have access to them, I will already be behind everyone else and at a disadvantage. Does anyone have any experience with something like this?

Computer Sciences- Again, I find the subject interesting and really love how wide of a career tree this subject branches off into. When it comes to exactly what in this subject I would want to pursue, I'm really not sure. I know there are dozens of possible careers in this major. I also know that there is a pretty solid chance of securing a job after graduation. Not to say that it doesn't require any hard work or anything, but I know that the industry is booming right now and if you're good at what you do, there is a really good chance of employment. I live in NC, so I'm not too knowledgeable on how big the CS industry is here. However, what I'm nervous about is the fact that I honestly have very little experience with CS and/or programming. I have a little hardware experience (I've worked for a tech repair shop in the past), but aside from that, I don't have any real experience. So I'm worried that I'm at an age where I'd have a hard time getting into that field since I have little to no experience. To anyone who's gone into this field, what are your thoughts on this?

So I'm just looking for some outside opinions to sort of help me choose something. Does anyone know of anything that may be a good mix of the two or that incorporates both subjects?

Thanks!"
