I am a little nervous about it because it is a big change. Plus I don't really feel qualified for it, but I do have some computer related stuff on my resume and I feel like that may have helped me. (Won a competition/scholarship from Google). Other than that, I don't really have verifiable IT/Computer experience. Just that I'm slightly above average and I'm the tech guy at my current work. It's not even like I have done major work with computers at my current job. Just could figure some stuff out.

I know this is a very good opportunity to get my foot in the door and what not. Does anyone have any suggestions for a crash course for basic computer-related things? From the sounds of it, I'll be a tier 1 or 2 help desk person. My label is just IT Tech Support. It is also marketed as an internship. They are aware that I am in school for Computer Science as well. They also do have a week-long training session.

""IT technical support officers maintain the computer systems of large organisations, ensuring that they run smoothly and providing technical support and advice to computer users.""

Was the exact description they gave me. So, I am asking, what does that sound like to you and does anyone know of any crash course I can take during this week to help me prepare? (No, I don't have any of the certs either. Just the scholarship from Google and enrolled in Computer Science)

Any help would be appreciated, thanks guys &amp; gals."

I'm a senior in college. I received a full time job offer from a company in NYC. This is not a normal 'new grad' job offer. I've done six internships and thus I am now considered 'experienced'. But because the position is for 'experienced' developers, they are not really willing to wait so long for me to graduate.

Normally I would have already said no. Thing is, the project I would be working on is kind of a big deal. It's a very public move by a big 4 (company is a subsidiary), and the project is very high profile. I'm afraid to say more for fear that I may be identified, but you can't live in NYC without knowing/hearing about it.

I have worked full time in the past while also being a full time student (it's how I've done all those internships). If I take this offer, that is what I am planning on doing. My course load will be light, so I'm confident I can physically handle it, but I really don't want to go back to doing that. Having full time work and school is depressing.

Offer is for 105k base with a 10% performance bonus. I've already negotiated it up. I am also concerned this may be slightly low for NYC.

I (probably) have return offers from previous companies I've interned at. I can't give exact specifics for fear of being identified.

Compensation is everything including signing/performance.

Offer 1: Very famous media company, ~115k (was told by manager and team lead would receive offer)

Offer 2: AI startup, ~90k - ~100k, I don't know how many RSUs. (This is trickier. I may get this offer but also may not).

I would be a mobile developer at all offers.

I'm still in the process with IBM, Twitter, Palantir, Amazon and a few other companies I'm not going to bother mentioning. No guarantees I get any of these though.

What would you do in my shoes /r/cscareerquestions? Try and go back to the AI startup? Return to the media company? Tough it out for one semester and work at a high profile project? It is only 4 months after all. Or abandon all three and try for a well known tech company?

I'm leaning towards the high profile company at the moment."

I graduated with my Degree in Communications (broad, but can be applied to various industries) in 2014, full of ideas and determination to work in creative small business, hr/comms for ethical and sustainable production companies, advocacy for re-directing society's focus and interests towards things that matter (i.e. NOT obsessing with the branded self, mindless celebrity culture and ""social media starlets"" who are basically walking talking advertisements for materialism and misplaced obsessions with products that are not necessarily adding anything positive to the world). I'm pretty disheartened by the state of the world and my so-far inability to get a job, despite interviewing well and constantly reaching out and applying, cold-calling, etc. I have been working in fashion retail for the past few years, hating how shallow and rude customers are more then ever, being treated as less-than even though i know I'm actually a person who cares more about what's important than these people spending $300 on clothes that have not been sustainably or independently made. I have volunteered, completed unpaid internships, interviewed for jobs only to be turned down for lack of experience. I'm not well connected, I don't have a big family and i moved to a new city where i don't really know many people. I feel hopeless and I don't know how to get someone to just give me a chance in a role I can get passionate about and learn important things that make an impact on how i and others live our lives. If anyone has any advice on getting a foot in the door, knows a contact at an organisation that is ethical or environmentally focused, community+nature+arts, or an advocacy group challenging materialistic interests, I'd love to hear of them!

*Fairtrade Au/NZ
*Loving Earth
*Small Giants (Melbourne-based publishing company)
*Etsy
*The School of Life
*Thankyou Company
I am based in inner-city melbourne but happy to commute as required for the right job.
Any other suggestions for companies or groups would be great! Also, If anyone is able to help me get a job that is meaningful in these areas, I would be willing to arrange a legitimate agreement for my first paycheque to go to that person in thanks. I'm incredibly serious about this, as finding a fulfilling job in such a self-image-driven, more-more-more stuff world is taking up so much of my time and wearing me down. I just want a chance to make a difference.

I feel like my background is unique and I really want to make sure it comes across correctly. Specifically, I've worked at a church for 10 years and the last 5 has been as an ordained minister. I'm concerned because in reality I am still very passionate about my religion, but I really do understand there's a place for it. I'm not nutty and don't plan to use the workplace as a forum to preach or anything. I don't know how to get the right idea across in a resume. Also, I'm an American female in Computer Science so that adds to the uniqueness...

Also, as a note: I have only taken 3 basic CS courses and haven't done much in the way of projects so I have none listed. Is it wise to list even the baby projects I've done? Should these be on a github account?

I plan to start applying for internships with this resume as soon as I have a final version of it.

I've already been self teaching (C++/C#) before and during school and I'm going through freecodecamp for learning web dev. Ideally I'd like to get an internship and then go from there, but there's a few issues. There is no internships in the area I live. I live in a small town in central NY, and the nearest city is roughly 40 miles away. Even more frustrating is that this city doesn't even have any internships for me anyways. There's only a few and it's only for people pursuing a 4 year degree. 

The obvious solution would be to just move to where the jobs/opportunity are, which is what I plan to do once I finish school, but without an internship I feel like I might be set up for failure if I move to another city/state without any work experience or job security. 

I'm just looking for any advice on what moves I should make next to find work/experience. Or if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what they did."

I just don't want to go through the same things I did after getting my BS (unemployed for a long time, found work in data entry).

What I do have is:

- A CS degree (complete by the time I start working)

- Experience with C/C++/Python/Java/Javascript/LAMP from coursework

- Internship experience in software development (3 month)

- Two years of lab assistant work (CS lab)

- A strong preference for development in a commandline linux environment (almost every assignment in school had to be developed, compiled, and submitted via a RHEL server, preferred editor is vim over IDE's) as well as UNIX philosophy in software

- A sincere desire to learn more about linux servers and operating systems

- Years tinkering with desktop distributions (includes working with apt, portage, compiling from source, etc)

- Experience from my networks course re-implementing protocols in python (multi-threaded, final project was a class-wide overlay network)

Basically, I'm pretty comfortable with approaching problems in linux systems, navigating the environment, writing scripts, etc. but I've never had to do anything like setup my own public bridge, use automation software like puppet, create a cluster node, administer a complex database, or really even log activity on my computer.

Long story short, graduated with a degree in Biochemistry the past spring, mostly due to being pushed into it by parents who wanted me to be a doctor and were quite relentless about it. Discovered a love for this field (as in CS) about a year ago and started coding months ago. Started off with something really simple, Code Academy. Did the Python, Ruby, Javascript, and HTML tutorials but also did the Git and make your own website tutorials.

After that, started the CS50 course and have been making decent progress in that, things have been moving along quite well recently after I got past the initial hurdle of working with C. 

Will finish the course but I feel like I am just getting to the tip of the iceberg. I have been working as a lab technician since graduating but recently applied for a ton of positions in software sales. My logic is if I can get my hands on anything related to tech, that would be better than nothing.

Recently got a job offer for an entry level software sales position, will be making more as a base salary (commission not included) with that than I would ever make as a lab tech!

I will spend time off of work (don't have to work weekends yay!) finishing the CS50 course. 

Going back for a second bachelors degree is just not an option for me right now, it won't be doable, not doing that at all. I am very open to a bootcamp because it won't take me 1+ year of my life to do and the pay off will be more immediate, confident that I will give it all I got.

But if I can get by without doing either of those, that would be great.

So after I am finished with CS50, what else do I do to get a career going in this industry? What other program or course of action can I take after I am done with CS50? I want to be a web developer.

How would entry level work look like for me? Would I have to start an unpaid internship or will some companies take a chance on a guy like me?"

I am also in the Seattle area, which is fairly competitive for internships. With a full course load this semester of three CS courses, I've had no time to focus on interview questions. I am considering dropping a non-core CS class and using the extra time to focus on developing my resume, work on an existing personal project, and practice interview questions. 

There are two potential drawbacks: 

1. I would have to attend summer class next year to graduate. This will probably happen anyway if I land an internship over the summer, in which case dropping the class won't affect my schedule.
2. I'd use my one yearly mulligan drop. If I fucked up another, harder course, it could set back my degree.

I'm getting the feeling my very competent full stack web developer colleague who has worked here for 5+ years is earning less than 65k.

Even looking at Glassdoor, it seems Web developers are paid, generously speaking, 2/3 what a Java developer may make.

Why is this?

Should I switch to ""backend"" development if I want more money in my career (assuming I love either)? 

Bonus question: it seems fellow Web devs care so much about the hippest new language of the year, and I'm starting to feel the industry expects you to know Angular 2/React/newThing or you're not a ""marketable"" Web developer. It's honestly pretty draining in the long run to me. Is Web Development not for me?"

I performed reasonably well in the interview, and later that day I received an invitation to a dinner with a cohort of Yahoo! engineers and interns at Keg. At this dinner, I was told that I would receive an offer from Yahoo! within the coming weeks. I asked very specifically whether this was a ""maybe"" or a ""yes"", and I was told in no uncertain terms that it was in fact a ""yes"".

I received no communication from Yahoo! after that night, and today I discovered that I wasn't even ranked by them on Jobmine. I fortunately had other, better options in hand, so this wasn't a major problem for me personally (this is also the reason why I didn't reach out to them earlier in the first place). That said, if I had halted my job search after receiving the offer I could have potentially been left jobless - basically I dodged a bullet.

I know that it's not smart to count on an offer without written documentation, and if I really wanted to work for this company I should have actively maintained contact with them. Even still, I find it pretty alarming that they would break a verbal agreement like that without any warning or explanation. Is this par for the course? Should I have seen this coming? Should this sort of incident be reported to CECA, or is my concern overblown?

If nothing else I hope some other naive CS kid learns from mistakes. Get these things in writing, kids."

I'm a 25 year old Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate student at a prestigious university in the U.S. I have had two internships, one at a large, well-known company, and another at a small startup. I hope to not sound arrogant, but I'm quite a good programmer and student (teaching assistant, extracurricular hackathons, personal projects).

Recently, I was called for an on-site interview at a small but well-known tech company in San Francisco. Again, I hope not to sound arrogant, but I absolutely smashed all of the technical questions, as well as behavioral ones about prior work experience and so on. So, I was understandably quite surprised to be rejected by them recently. 

What immediately came to mind was a strange interaction with my would-have-been manager. She said that I seemed a bit older than the typical college senior. I acknowledged this, and she asked me ""what my deal is"". I answered her questions with honesty and tact. 

I do honestly feel as though my age and maturity has been an asset to me in the pursuit of my CS degree. I had to work *so* fucking hard, straight out of high school, just for attending university to be plausible. I was even accepted in to my furthest stretch university, which has one of the best CS programs in the world.

Aside from this manager, every single person who interviewed me was a couple years younger than me. And I am now considering the possibility that they felt as though my atypical circumstances were a red flag for them - perhaps they felt that an ""old guy"" being junior to younger programmers would create tension in the team.

This is immensely concerning to me, as I feel that a similar dynamic may re-occur in my future interviews. So, I turn to the learned minds of /r/cscareerquestions to either confirm or assuage my fears. Even more importantly, I am strongly considering seeking legal recourse against this company, as I am quite sure that I have been wronged. I believe that they should be outed for their unethical behavior, but I worry that doing so outside of a rigorous legal framework could damage my reputation.

One last important note - I did share the questions and my solutions with one of my professors while seeking her advice. She confirmed what I already knew - that I gave optimal solutions; even going so far as to prove that my solution was a lower bound on the time and space complexity of the problem! I understand that this was a violation of the NDA that I signed, but I don't anticipate being an issue if I pursue legal action (unless of course this post is linked back to me - whoops!)

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks =)"

I am studying Mechatronics, only 3 more courses to take and a couple exams to do in order to graduate, however I need to cover my internship hours which I am doing in an automation company as a robot programmer that works for different car manufacturers (VW, BMW, Audi, Ford, etc).

This means, I need to think about my professional future. And here's where I need your advice. Right now I need to decide between these two options:

**First Option**




Stay at the company where I am doing my internship as an employee since they offered to hire me after my internship. I like what I do, coworkers are great and I am learning a lot, also the company paid an expensive programming certification and I have a monthly income that's 30% above the avarage salary of a recently graduated engineer (in my country), I even got a 30% raise of my base salary  after working here for 3 months. I could build a succesful laboral career from here, and have economic stability in the future. However this job consumes all my time, to the point that I am afraid I am putting on risk to be able to finish my degree. I work a minimum of 54 hours a week, 70 avg. and there have been weeks where I have to work 80-90 hours. I feel like I have to sacrifice all my time for a stable and succesfull career. In other words it makes my life less enjoyable, and makes finishing my degree really hard but not impossible. Don't get me wrong I like what I do in the job, it's just that the time I have to put into it's killing me. So, being more clear the advantages of staying are:

Advantages:

* Economic stability and good monthly salary.
* Expensive certifications that could help to find a better job in the future.
* Fair oportunities to grow in the company.
* I like what I do in the job but it gets repetitive with time.

Disadvantages:

* I have ~~almost~~ no free time, making it really hard to finish my degree or even spending time with my GF or family which is really important to me.
* I dont see my self living this lifestyle in the future, I would even prefer earning less money but having an actual life to enjoy.
* Probably I wont have to chance to start a business in the future, something I have always wanted to try.




**Second Option**




Since I'll finish my internship in 31st December I can choose not to stay at the company and now my cousin who is a co-founder of a small new bussiness, that develops specific projects that different companies asks for,  invited me to join as a co-founder. This business recently got a 250K USD fund for one of their projects that won a big Start-Up event. They have done some ""small"" projects, Polaris (Off-Road Vehicle brand) being their biggest customer so far. Almost all the money earned is being re-invested in the company to make it grow, which means there's not a stable monthly income,  and it could even be $0 if there are no projects to develop for that month. I feel like this could be a really good oportunity to give my self a chance to start something of my own (since I would be part of the team, not just an employee) instead of having to work for someone elses. 

Advantages:

* I'll have ~~more~~ time to finish my studies since I would work with flexible schedules and do stuff that I enjoy.
* I can work in any project I would like to develop.
* The work environment is even better than in the other company
* There's a lot of potential with this small bussiness, a 250k USD fund is a huge thing. I could earn more money in the long run than in the company I am currently doing my internship but of course it's not guaranteed.

Disadvantages:

* No monthly income nor economic stability (which I dont really need since I still live with my parents, which is really common in my countray at my age and I have no debts nor student loans to pay).
* There are NO oficial certifications that could improve my CV for other options in the future.
* Even with the 250k USD fund, the bussiness could never grow and stay in the past just like as a life experience thus having to start from zero looking for a job

I dont know if this might seem like an easy choice for you, but I feel like I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or to ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also the satisfaction of try something I've always wanted to"".  

Also I think it's important to mention that I dont need the economical stability right now and I can afford the risks of the second option I just don't know if leaving the safe option is a good choice.

Thank you very much for your time and your advice is really appreciated!

**TL;DR: Regarding my laboral future I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also having the satisfaction of trying something I've always wanted to"".  Taking into account that I dont need economical stability right now and I can take the risks and consecuences of choosing second option.**

I am deciding between two offers for co-op positions this winter. This will be my second co-op job.

One position is for a Software Engineering Intern at a Toronto based company which helps ""major brands with their connected device needs"". This means I could be working on a variety of projects and platforms (smart watches, Android/iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Oculus VR...). 

The second offer is for an Android Developer Intern at Kik (the messaging app) in Waterloo. 

I am gravitating towards Kik because they are more well known. However I worked as an Android Developer over the summer and do not want to ""pigeon hole"" myself into being an Android Dev for the rest of my life (this probably won't happen, but still I want to expand my horizons, ya know?). Since the first company is a consulting company, the project I would be working on depends on what active projects they have when I start, so I could end up on an Android team there too...

Thanks for any advice picking between the two! "

Also my parents and others seem to keep saying ""things will get better and work out"" yet I can't seem to believe them when it doesn't feel like it will at all. I'm currently not making money (though maybe that will change if I can stick through this) and feel extremely lonely as well even since I graduated from college. To be honest I think my depression seemed to start in college due to the stress of having 6 classes at once and not being able to balance things well and even since it's just continued to be there. I personally don't hide my emotions in real life yet I feel worried a lot and not as happy as I used to be.

From 21-24 I attended college and worked construction (731 laborers union) - I was setup with a asbestos removal company and worked all over long island, staten island, queens, etc. The work was sporatic but was perfect considering I was in school.

Towards my last year of school I decided to take an internship through my college to help me land some type of career when I got out of school (I was working towards a degree in business management).

I ended up finding an internship right down the block from my college for marketing at a vitamin &amp; supplement company. The internship was very interesting, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. The web developer / marketing manager took a liking to me and trained me on a lot more than what he was supposed to. I really ran with the opprotunity...once my hours were complete they asked me to stay on board part time...and after a few months full time (construction basically phased out of my life at this time).

After a year here I felt the need to grow and the web dev/ marketing manager (who I had now become very close with) told me about a job opprotunity at an advertising agency in NYC his brother worked for as digital media analyst. I'd basically be working on his brothers team who was the director of analytics. I was very nervous to work in NYC (I really hate crowds). but I took the shot and started the position. After a year I was promoted to manager, after 2 years my director left and joined up with his brother to start their own consulting firm.

I ran the department for 7 months until I was laid off. I have to admit the last year there I was miserable. Commuting to the city from long island everyday, constant stress, the agencies refusal to staff up. 5 other people were laid off along with me (the agency is in bad shape).

Now it's been 2 months and honestly, I feel so lost. I don't know if I want to go back into advertising, I'm like 3 classes from getting my bachelors, I have debt piling up and the freedom feeling of not having to work is sort of turning into a depression.

I don't exactly know why I am writing this, I guess it would just be nice to know if anyone has been in this position and could tell me how they managed to get out of it?

* There's a lot of potential with this small bussiness, a 250k USD fund is a huge thing. I could earn more money in the long run than in the company I am currently doing my internship but of course it's not guaranteed.

Disadvantages:

* No monthly income nor economic stability (which I dont really need since I still live with my parents, which is really common in my countray at my age and I have no debts nor student loans to pay).
* There are NO oficial certifications that could improve my CV for other options in the future.
* Even with the 250k USD fund, the bussiness could never grow and stay in the past just like as a life experience thus having to start from zero looking for a job

I dont know if this might seem like an easy choice for you, but I feel like I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or to ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also the satisfaction of try something I've always wanted to"".  


**Some additional things to bear in mind:**

* **I dont need the economical stability right now and I can afford the risks of the second option I just don't know if leaving the safe option is a good choice.**

* The second option is not an Start-Up, but its also not a formal company yet, it's just in the process of being one. The means a lot of the formalities are not well defined but I will have the chance to give an opinion about it when the time comes.

* I am really aware of the consequences of working with family, and I feel very comfortable working with him since he's more like my brother and I know him really well. Also I don't have to invest money, just time. No one is making a living out of this business yet, it just pays for its own expenses and they are all investing time with few or none economical return hoping to make it grow.





Thank you very much for your time and your advice is really appreciated!

**TL;DR: Regarding my laboral future I have to choose between a ""Secure laboral path that will give me economical stability, with a bright but dull future that I might not like or even hate it in the long run"" or ""Try something really crazy that might not work, but has a lot of potential and also having the satisfaction of trying something I've always wanted to"".  Taking into account that I dont need economical stability right now and I can take the risks and consecuences of choosing second option.**"

The thing is, I love pretty much all of it (though maybe back end a little more), so I can get distracted and go off on tangents with other languages pretty easily.  So in this case, I need someone to just tell me what to do (no ADHD coping tips requested).  I do need to go back to work soon if I want to keep the lights on and I would like it to be in some area of programming.  
What do you suggest focusing on right now for the quickest realistic path to landing a coding job?  
Since I make a habit of learning, I synthesize new information fairly quickly.  I'm especially intrigued with anything analytical/scientific, my background is in project management and finance, and I live in NYC if that makes a difference.  I can't afford internships or bootcamps.  I've tried looking at operational roles in the tech industry just to be around people that could help me learn more, but they're really snobby about letting people into their exclusive club.  It appears you must be born into it.  *I'm not looking for any unrealistic short cuts here, just a way to pay the bills while staying focused on learning more.

I'm in 2A CS, sequence 3 so Winter is basically my first co-op term. Assuming if my co-op advisor approves my co-op sequence change is it still a good idea to pursue the 8 months co-op vs risking the offer and ranking it 1 for my 4 month co-op.

I've figured out the pros and cons for each of these companies, but I'm still VERY conflicted.


**8 month offer (software engineering; networking/cloud/virtualization company; private company)**

*Pros:*

pay is good, networking/cloud company (talked with previous interns, checked glassdoor reviews, and asked previous projects and they seemed very interesting), learn ALOT (cutting-edge technologies), very good company culture and everyone is chill

*Cons:*

many friends told me that I shouldn't do an 8 month co-op because the time commitment is long and if I get bored then I'm kinda stuck with it, i will be a term behind all my classmates, since 8 month coop term (2x 4 month coop terms) I don't know if I can get a cali/SV job in my ""third co-op"" term (I'm sure I will be busting side projects, Leetcode and CTCI during the second half of my 8 month co-op term).

*Possible Negotiations:*

telling the company I will be a term behind and instead of having an 8 month ""consecutive"" work term propose for 2x 4 month co-op term for my first two co-op terms at the same company so that I can still be in my same sequence and I don't have to be a term late or switch my sequence


**4 month ranked (software developer; financial company; public company)**

*Pros:*

very close proximity to my house back home (10 mins by walking distance?), 4 months; hence I don't have to go through any hassle of switching co-op sequences because I'm basically following my plan

*Cons:*

pay is slightly higher than minimum wage, the work looks very boring, company culture looks very dull, talked with previous interns and they either didn't learn a lot or the projects were basically qa testing and writing log reports even though the job title is software developer

Yeah, so basically I'm contemplating between the two options I currently have and I'm tired of interviews and I don't want go to continuous. Should I ""try"" to negotiate with the employer for a 4 month co-op term or follow my suggested negotiation above? 

Very sorry for the long post guys. Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!"

5aprf1,2,2016-11-02,Is there any way to link directly to a database from a pivot table?,Loth1207,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5aprf1/is_there_any_way_to_link_directly_to_a_database/,"Hey there, I would like to ask for some advice about linking to data in excel. Let me give some background on my problem.

I'm an intern in an advisory company. During our projects we receive various data like monthly trial balances. Currently our go to method of analysis of this data is:  
1. Creating a database from all trial balances in one sheet,  
2. Setting up several pivot tables (up to 10-20) depending on what we want to see,  
3. Creating tables which gather data from these pivot tables for report preparation (we can't just format pivot tables because of strict firm policy about the look/formatting of tables and because we make some adjustments or additions to the data).

Now, the problem I currently have is how inefficient/non-futureproof methods of linking to pivot table are, at least to my knowledge. Currently I can see only 3 methods of creating these presentation tables:  

**Direct link to pivot table**


Pros:  
* Easy to setup-up  
* Gives ability to quickly navigate from data in final table to pivot table ( in case of need for some check-ups)  
Cons:  
* ANY update of database which cause appearance of additional row in pivot table breaks all existing links


**Using getpivotdata function (basically copying categories names next to presentation table and months/years above the  table, the function gather information from these columns/rows), then adjusting the table based on what I need to present.**


Pros:  
* Does not break after updating the database  
Cons:  
* Takes some time to setup every table and delete excess rows
* Changing anything in pivot table (switching/adding categories) breaks the function - pivot table must remain unchanged

**Copy/paste values**


Pros:  
* Very easy  
Cons:  
* Not linking makes it ultimately hard for other colleagues to reference the data (and for me after a few months whenever we have to update the report)  
* Values doesn't update with changes in database &lt;- dealbreaker


I am wondering if there's any method of direct linking to the database based on the output of of pivot table in a way to futureproof my work. For now I can't see any reliable way to create presentation tables based on pivot tables that doesn't bring any big flaw when it comes to updating or changing anything after commiting to one of those methods. Any idea would be highly appreciated."

My question though, is what type of certifications should I strive to get?  Some colleagues of mine have a Security+ certification from an organization called CompTIA.  After quickly skimming their website I see they also have a Networking+ certification, would that also be good to obtain?  I've also heard that CISCO certifications would be good to get as well.

I am deciding between two offers for internship positions this winter. This will be my second internship.

One position is for a Software Engineering Intern at a Toronto based company which helps ""major brands with their connected device needs"". This means I could be working on a variety of projects and platforms (smart watches, Android/iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Oculus VR...).

The second offer is for an Android Developer Intern at Kik (the messaging app) in Waterloo.

I am gravitating towards Kik because they are more well known. However I worked as an Android Developer over the summer and do not want to ""pigeon hole"" myself into being an Android Dev for the rest of my life (this probably won't happen, but still I want to expand my horizons, ya know?). Since the first company is a consulting company, the project I would be working on depends on what active projects they have when I start, so I could end up on an Android team there too...

Thanks for any advice picking between the two!"

Which one of these places would you go to? I'm interested in the back-end side of things so I would probably be doing that. 

I feel like paypal and mongodb have the best 'names', but at the same time 84.51 is really data oriented (with hella DB questions in their interviews) so I feel like 84.51 might be great to get into 'big data' type stuff. There doesn't really seem to be much information about that company online so if anyone knows something it would be helpful!

Factset seems like a great place as well, but career wise I feel that it doesn't have the name of paypal/mongodb, and I don't have any particular interest in fintech as a career so I probably wouldn't be able to use it in that way. 

Mongodb has that unicorn/startup rep, but at the same time I've heard so many bad things about mongodb as a product so I'm not too sure how to feel.

1. **Business processes** (such as forecast calls, identifying areas we could be more efficient in)
2. **Business Insights &amp; Analytics** More than just being able to spit a report out that has a bunch of numbers, we need someone that can articulate what those numbers mean and help sales managers who have $100M+ businesses in understanding the state of the business.
3. **Collaboration** This role touches many different areas of the business. Not only are you a member of the high performing team of ACES and will need to work with one another as you all perform similar functions, you will need to work with the marketing, finance and operations teams to ensure your sales teams are well equipped.

**ACES are typically co-op students and ideally will be going back to school following their work term.** 
**This goes without saying, but compensation is on par with what you can expect from typical co-op roles**

**This role will start in late December 2016 and end in August 2017**. It’s a great opportunity for students to get their foot in the door at Microsoft, and has shown to be a great development program as many ACES especially from Montreal have returned as MACH’s within the company as well as used this platform to gain the skills needed to get great jobs upon graduation.

We’re looking for someone who **takes initiative** and doesn’t need others to get them going, is very analytical and doesn’t just report out the numbers but truly understands it and can articulate what it means, **passionate about technology** and is overall well rounded and wants to come kill it at Microsoft.  

If you're someone or know someone that wants to take this opportunity and run with it - send me a PM and we'll give you an email you can send your resume to.

I'm 21 years old and aim to graduate in 3 years with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently I'm not in school as I moved back home, but am re-enrolling next semester. I previously went to school for 2 1/2 years as a Biochemistry major before finally facing the fact I was not enjoying what I was doing. After a lot of self searching, consulting others, and researching online, I've set myself on this path and feel immensely better doing so.

About 10 months ago I was arrested and charged with 4 felony counts of possession with intent to distribute. I'm just a few months away from my final court date and sentencing. The good news is, my lawyer seems pretty confident I will end up with probation and not having to do time, which will be great so far as allowing me to continue with school. And, there is even a chance that I could receive a deal that expunges my record after successfully probation. Although this is unlikely and I won't be counting on it, it is still a chance.

That being said, there is nothing I can do to turn back time. I made an awful, awful choice, and will most likely have to deal with it for the rest of my life. In a sense, I am glad this happened. I was very much headed down the wrong path and surrounding myself with the wrong people, and received the biggest wake up call one could give me. This has given me a newfound focus and desire to succeed unlike I ever had before. I know that if I can overcome this, it will make me into a stronger person than I had ever imagined. I want more than anything to simply graduate and find a decent job to support myself and a family comfortably.

I can't stop stressing over this. I made a terrible judgement call but I am far from a bad person. I am dedicated to turning my life around and want employers to see that as well. Still, I fear landing a job could turn out to be hell. I'm coming here asking for advice. What can I do in these next 3 years of school to help me out as much as possible? I am dedicated to learning to code on my free time (I almost decided on computer science, but also have an interest in hardware. Considering the amount of free resources to self-teach programming, it was an easy decision). I actually find it quite enjoyable, and figure it will make me that much more employable in the future. I plan on staying as involved as I can when I am back in school in January. Research labs, volunteering, clubs / organizations, and hopefully internships over the summers if I can find a company that will accept me.

Do any of you know anyone (if not yourself) that managed to be successful in the engineering field despite criminal convictions? Any tips on types of companies or regions that may be more lenient in accepting applicants with felonies? I'm open to any advice or criticism you guys have to offer. I am dedicated to the the plan I have, but that doesn't make it easier for me to stop worrying (If you can't tell, I have a worrying problem :P).

Thank you all :)

PSAT: Got a 1410 (710 M, 700 R) as a sophomore. Expecting higher 1400's for the PSAT this year.

SAT II: 800 Bio-M. Planning on taking Math II and Chem before senior year.

Class rank: Not published, told I was in the top 10% at the end of last year, and I'll probably stay around there.

UW/W GPA: 

UW not published, probably around a 3.8? 4.34W, as of the end of sophomore year. Going up at the end of this quarter by a little (Honors= +.5, AP's= +1). Also, this is accounted with marking period grades. Can anyone tell me if it's true that colleges only care about final grades. If so, I probably had around a 3.8UW freshman year and a definite 4.0 sophomore year. Expecting around a 3.8-3.9UW this year

Coursework:--

Freshman year- all honors (not allowed to take AP's), nothing interesting. 

Sophomore year- all honors and AP Bio. Also took an organic chemistry class that was pretty interesting, but not substantial in information.

Junior year- AP Chemistry, AP English Language, APUSH, and AP Calc AB. Rest honors except for a comp sci class next semester, since there isn't an honors version.

AP Scores: 

AP Psych (5)

AP Bio (4) i'm cri ;(  I studied really hard for this one

AP World (3) Not submitting. Was taking a rigorous honors version of World History, signed up for the test without studying much, and got absolutely demolished by that writing section.

Awards:

Not any yet besides AP Scholar, but I have a few that I'm pretty sure I'll get National Merit, National Honor Society, and National Spanish Honors Society this year.

Extracurriculars:

Science Ambassadors (inner-city tutoring club)- Leadership since 9th grade, and I'm the most proactive leader this year and will probably be next year too.

Academic Quiz Bowl- 9th-11th, tournament organizer from sophomore to junior year. Probably will keep the position for leadership creds, but won't be super involved in the future.

Started a non-profit that is projected to raise around $10,000 for local charities by the the time I will be applying for schools. I feel that this is probably my major hook.

Worked in a chemistry lab since summer going into 9th grade. Just cleaned for the first year, and did quality control on precious metals for the last two years.

Independent research transfecting plants with the luciferase complexes in fireflies and renilla. I got negative results, so I don't think colleges will think much of this.

Probably will have a summer-long internship at NIH, NIOSH, or WVU (preferentially in that order) through various connections. 

Schools: 

This is where I need help. I don't really know where I should go, since I don't know too many people closely that really know the college admissions process. I have a few schools, but I'm not sure which schools I have a chance with or if their biology programs are any good. I really want a small to medium school in a urban area with plenty of research opportunities. I also really haven't toured any schools, so I am going purely off of what I've read around here and other places online. Here is where I'm thinking about in preferential order.

Hopkins (prob ED), Carnegie Mellon (tied with Hopkins, might ED if I like CMU better after touring), UPenn (also tied with Hopkins &amp; ED scenario), Tufts, BostonU, Northeastern, U Delaware. 

Questions: 

Where else should I be looking? Which of my listed colleges do I have no chance at? Which shouldn't I apply to because their biology programs aren't that good?

Do colleges care about quarter and semester grades, or just the final grade? (stated above)

Is it true that you can get out of ED if the financial aid package isn't enough?

Finally, what can I do to improve my application the most? I already don't have a lot of free time, but I can make some sacrifices if I can make any big boost to my application.

Thanks!"

5at2j6,12,2016-11-02,Aspiring engineer with potential felony convictions,Jdbkv5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5at2j6/aspiring_engineer_with_potential_felony/,"Hello all,


I'm 21 years old and aim to graduate in 3 years with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently I'm not in school as I moved back home, but am re-enrolling next semester. I previously went to school for 2 1/2 years as a Biochemistry major before finally facing the fact I was not enjoying what I was doing. After a lot of self searching, consulting others, and researching online, I've set myself on this path and feel immensely better doing so.
About 10 months ago I was arrested and charged with 4 felony counts of possession with intent to distribute. I'm just a few months away from my final court date and sentencing. The good news is, my lawyer seems pretty confident I will end up with probation and not having to do time, which will be great so far as allowing me to continue with school. And, there is even a chance that I could receive a deal that expunges my record after successfully probation. Although this is unlikely and I won't be counting on it, it is still a chance.


That being said, there is nothing I can do to turn back time. I made an awful, awful choice, and will most likely have to deal with it for the rest of my life. In a sense, I am glad this happened. I was very much headed down the wrong path and surrounding myself with the wrong people, and received the biggest wake up call one could give me. This has given me a newfound focus and desire to succeed unlike I ever had before. I know that if I can overcome this, it will make me into a stronger person than I had ever imagined. I want more than anything to simply graduate and find a decent job to support myself and a family comfortably.


I can't stop stressing over this. I made a terrible judgement call but I am far from a bad person. I am dedicated to turning my life around and want employers to see that as well. Still, I fear landing a job could turn out to be hell. I'm coming here asking for advice. What can I do in these next 3 years of school to help me out as much as possible? I am dedicated to learning to code on my free time (I almost decided on computer science, but also have an interest in hardware. Considering the amount of free resources to self-teach programming, it was an easy decision). I actually find it quite enjoyable, and figure it will make me that much more employable in the future. I plan on staying as involved as I can when I am back in school in January. Research labs, volunteering, clubs / organizations, and hopefully internships over the summers if I can find a company that will accept me.


Do any of you know anyone (if not yourself) that managed to be successful in the engineering field despite criminal convictions? Any tips on types of companies or regions that may be more lenient in accepting applicants with felonies? I'm open to any advice or criticism you guys have to offer. I am dedicated to the the plan I have, but that doesn't make it easier for me to stop worrying (If you can't tell, I have a worrying problem :P).


Thank you all :)"

I'm a long term software dev intern for the IS department at a reasonably sized semiconductor company. I've been here for about 6 months, and the position is until I graduate (may 2018 assuming all goes well). 

My supervisor has had nothing but good things to say about my work, learning capability, etc. 

Would I be more hirable if I stay here for another 1.5 years, or do a different internship over the summer? 

I am relatively happy here, and could see myself working here (professionally, after school) for maybe a year or two before the commute kills my soul. 

Also is it too direct to ask if they would want to hire me once I graduate? If there isn't that safety net of a quasi-guaranteed job, I almost certainly would prefer to go to a different internship (most would pay more than them, and the environment here is dry/boring).

Thanks!"
5atxi6,2,2016-11-02,"Is finance experience/education looked down upon? (in AI research, algotrading)",confuciest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5atxi6/is_finance_experienceeducation_looked_down_upon/,"I'm in second year of university right now. I planned on going into finance in high school, since it was the only thing I had really been exposed to (did well in maths/economics/accounting without much effort,etc). The program I chose allowed me to spend two years studying in other areas with a few required business courses, then the final two years in a management program which would culminate in a commerce degree. I took mostly humanities last year and am taking almost all mathematics courses this year. The business program itself is respected and forces you to develop soft skills like presenting and collaborative work while covering most of the content you would see in an MBA program. It's a very safe and practical option for me, I am near guaranteed a good job at 22 if I stay at the top of the class,
But.

I'm not sure I like business much. I find finance interesting, but most of the careers in finance I'm interested in like hedge funds/prop shops involve skills I'd probably be stronger in if I was majoring in math as opposed to management. I've also been considering transferring to computer science with the intention of going into some area of AI research and getting a PhD, since I have a genuine interest in the field and it seems like a perfect combination of all the subjects that excite me. My parents think this is not a good idea, as I have no formal experience with computer science. They say I should continue with the business degree and if I want, add a second degree in CS/mathematics which would probably take a bit more than an extra year to do. Apparently finance courses and soft skills are harder to pick up than technical CS abilities (??? I thought this sounded wrong but okay). I see how this could be the best of both worlds, since it is a good option to fall back on in case I try CS and hate it/am awful at it. The issue is that the school is considered great for business but not known at all for computer science and it wouldn't be ideal prep for grad school - even a master's which I would hopefully be able to skip if I was in a rigorous program at a top school. 

My questions: are soft skills and an education in business an asset in tech or a waste of time that could be better spent learning advanced concepts in math/cs? Is it bad for me to continue with summer internships in finance until I have enough knowledge of CS to try software engineering or should I be in summer school to accelerate that? Would the dual degree with a well known business program be better than a CS/math degree at a more prestigious school? Do many people with PhDs in ML end up in finance anyways (i.e. will I save time and money by going straight into it with the dual degree and getting experience versus grad school)? Is CS tedious or is it fun and logical and intellectually stimulating? How do I know if I even am capable of succeeding in a CS undergrad, let alone doing a PhD?

Any advice would be much appreciated, I don't know anyone in tech so it feels very risky when compared to business, which most of my family and friends are involved with. "

5aucos,4,2016-11-02,Computational Science Opportunity Questions,J-Bobby,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5aucos/computational_science_opportunity_questions/,"Hello I am currently a sophomore computer science student at a small university in the west US.  I have been kind of struggling to find a internship for the summer since I am behind on some of my CS classes because I recently switched to CS from electrical engineering.  I have a company that is around my hometown that would be willing to let me have an internship but it would be mostly electrical engineering instead of programming which is what I really would like to focus on.


Just recently I have talked to my advanced engineering math professor about opportunities in programming that he had since he is a computational science professor and parallel computer professor as well.  He seemed really thrilled that I ask him about it and he was even more excited because I have a large math background compared to most computer science students.  He let me borrow one of his books on computing in PETSc (a programming language that I know nothing about but it is very similar to C) and told me that if I help him for the rest of the year that he might give me a job this summer working for the university on one of their projects.  He told me that he would help me step by step since it is a hard thing to get into and he really recommended that I work on it during the weekends so I don't get behind in other classes.  This job that he ""offered"" me is kind of a big deal around here apparently.  It is a program that gets federal grant money from the department of energy and they pay for an appartment and food all summer as well as pay a pretty decent wage.  The project he said was something to do with the simulation of a hard physics problem and the coolest part is that we would be using a super computer that is in the west coast.


This sounds like a perfect fit to me and I am really excited to get started but I am a little hesitant because I want to make sure that spending this much time on a project will help my future.  I really love programming and that is why I want to become a software engineer in the future.  Just like everyone I have big dreams and wish to work at a big company for a few years such as IBM, Microsoft or Google.  I was really hoping I could find something this summer that would set me apart from the crowd.  My problem is that I am not sure if this is what an employer would like to see since it is using parallel programming to solve math equations unlike building software like companies probably want to see.  I have thought about doing computational science before since I love math too but I am not really interested in going to school for that long and the career possibilities don't look as good as SE/CS.  I was just wondering what anyone here would have to recommend."

I wanted to reach out to this sub and see if anyone could offer any helpful tips, ideas or just general advice. I graduated from my local university with a BS in CS and a 3.8 GPA 6 months ago. During my time there, I took on a C#/SQL internship that I had to leave due to health issues, I did some Python work for the university, and I took another C#/SQL internship that, after 6 months, turned into a job out of college. 

Now my goals are to get out of the city I'm currently in and to get a better job with more opportunities than my current one. However I feel somewhat out of my depth and I'm honestly not sure where to even begin or if my internship/univerisity/current job experience is even going to help. Most jobs out there ask for a minimum of maybe 4 years in some programming language or framework and I simply don't have that kind of experience. I suppose I could work on a project at home to get familiar with such a thing if I were interested enough in the company or the technology (or possible salary/benefits), but I don't know if this would be considered ""valid"" experience. 

I plan to start acting on these goals in about a year from now, when I will have worked at my current job for 2 years (including the internship). Simply put, where I am now is a dead end for programmers and I'm looking to move up and out. What are some good ways to move forward? Should I be doing multiple side projects at home to make up for lack of experience? Should I be looking into freelance work or contract jobs (if this is even a good idea, considering what experience I have)? I'm just very new to all of this and I feel like I most likely started out on the wrong foot.

I was lucky to find a great internship in Japan and before i signed my contract with them i asked the school if the contract dates where ok. They asked me to increase the length of the internship so i asked the company if it was possible and sure enough i got a new date and the school approved.

Now, 3 months later, 2 months before i am going to japan the school suddenly tells me that internship period is to long. The original contract that i have is 70 work days and they want me to make the company sign a contract where i work 60 days. They say that since the school is not part of the contract between me and the company they ""dont know"" of its existence so that its not a problem for them and that i should just stay 10 days longer after my school contract has expired. (the original contract is between me and the company and the school contract would be between al 3 parties)

Is this even legal?"

I (23F) recenty graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and now I'm looking for a job as a .NET developer. The problem is that I don't have any experience besides the school projects and a internship (front-end development). Now I found a 2 month internship on .Net that starts in January and if I'm good enough the company will offer me a full time job and if not...well I'll still be looking for a full time job :( .What should I do? Should I keep looking for a full time job in hopes that I will find something or should I apply for this internship and hope that they will offer me a full time job after. The internship lasts 2 months and I can apply until November 15 so I have to think fast.

In about a month or so I will have finished all the requirements of my Software Engineering degree for university except 2 months of industrial training. Now this has to be a paid internship and I should have done it in my 3rd year but I kinda focused on personal projects (which made me much more money anyway) so I have to do it now.

Can I apply for most full time positions and simply use the first 2 months to complete my degree? Do most employers generally care if I don't have my degree yet? I was thinking putting something like that on my resume might put off employers? My other option is to apply for internships, work hard and try to get a full time offer at the end.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

I'll be starting coding on websites like leetcode soon.

I'll also be giving GRE soon and I think I can manage a score of 320 or a bit more. My CGPA isn't that great due to some issues. And I have no computer projects or internships on my resume. 

I was wondering, which way should I go ?( So that admission to a university in the US is easier)

1. Should I get an internship ? How should I try to get it considering my limited experience ?

2. Should I do a project under a computer science faculty in my college ?

3. Please share if you have anything else in mind.

I now have an offer for 90k and incredible benefits (Over a month PTO excluding national holidays, tuition reimbursement for when I work part-time Jan-June, amazing health coverage, dental, vision, etc). I have friends who are graduating and getting offers for 100k-110k per year (I don't know their benefits), and I was wondering if 90k is an alright offer. 

A company that I did an internship with might be able to get me an offer, but they've been very slow in responding. They'd likely be able to offer more, but only if their budget allows it. I've emailed them multiple times, but haven't gotten a clear answer back. They'd be able to offer a bit more pay with a bonus and stock options, but I don't have an offer from them in hand. Is this a case of having a bird in my hand and two in the bush?

I'm graduating with a 3.7 GPA and a major in CS. The place I have an offer from is a non-profit research institute, so I don't expect to be blown away by the salary. I just want to make sure I'm not being lowballed."

I just graduated with my bachelors in business with an emphasis in Information Technology. The only classes I took related to computer programming were an introduction to computer programming, an introduction to web development, introduction to databases and advanced databases.

The highest math I took was brief calculus and I didnt take algorithm and data structure classes as they were not needed.
I did an internship over the summer using c# and running the MMVM pattern and I deeply struggled. However, I didnt have much help from my supervisor as he was busy doing his own thing so the project was left for me to do and I failed miserably as I didnt get the project completed in the 3 month time frame.

All this made me realize that I am extremly unprepared and I am discouraged because I dont know if I will make it as a software developer. Luckily, I am also interested in data analysis, not data science but data analysis. However, I dont know if I even have the background to do that.
Obvioulsy job security is also a concern and I enjoy both professions equally. However, I feel that I already failed as a software developer so maybe data analyst is my last choice?

Any advice from experienced developers or data analysts would be appreciated but I definitely need guidance on what to do next.
Also, I am currently working in the banking industry making 19 dollars an hour and I am 27 years old already.

5axk6m,2,2016-11-03,Internship questions?,haldol5ativan2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5axk6m/internship_questions/,"Hi guys,

I started out my career path as a pre-med, student, and only switched to software engineering within the last year. My questions have more to do with software engineering internships than with actual questions on code. I'm unsure if this was the correct subreddit to post into; if that's the case, any guidance to the right subreddit would be greatly appreciated!

Moving on: I've currently applied to a bunch of internships, some from a career fair at my school, and some just from online applications. The only face to face interviews I've been getting are from the booths I visited at the career fair

My question: should I be discouraged that no one from outside the career fair is getting back to me (I'm assuming silent rejections here)? I'm beginning to think I only got these interviews because of my attachment to the school (Boston university), and not because of my actual skills. On the other hand, I'm not sure if outside a career fair, companies start going through applications at a later date, and is in part why I'm not yet hearing back.

As to my resume: I've been able to be a part of an app that helps BU students (don't want to specify further in case people know), and have worked in a lab from a development perspective (basic troubleshooting, etc). I have knowledge (and have used) most of the major languages (C++, Java/C#, Python, ruby, Linux, sql, html/css). I know this is a pretty shallow delve into said skills, but can provide clarification if needed.

I'm super appreciative of anyone can offer some insight! I REALLY want to gain some good valuable experience at a full time internship, since most of my programming experience has been class-related."

5axydy,3,2016-11-03,"Almost two years at my first job, should I ask for a raise or start finding a new job?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5axydy/almost_two_years_at_my_first_job_should_i_ask_for/,"Some backstory; I've been programming for about 5-6 years now, almost 2 of those years professionally at one company in the Cleveland area. I started here as an intern out of high school and my boss said he was impressed with me enough that they decided to offer me a full time position. Starting here, I didn't know anything about corporate-grade software or the technology that is generally used. Fast forward to now, I've been the sole developer on a few large customer facing applications and I think I've really grown. I'm mainly a backend developer working with Java + Springboot, but I've touched .NET and worked with Mongo/SQL a lot. I talked to my boss and I'm going to work on becoming proficient in .NET next. He's trying to give me .NET projects that one of my coworkers can help mentor me on. 

I make $39.1k a year. I understand that I'm not worth much as someone without a college degree, but I have done a lot of work here. My boss has tried guiding me through everything I've needed to learn and he's said he's impressed with how I'm turning out, and that I wouldn't be here if they thought I wasn't pulling my weight (obviously). But, I still feel like I'm being underpaid at this point. I barely make enough to save money, pay rent, pay for gas + my car, etc...

My question is, do I have enough experience to go out and try to find a new job? Or should I stay here and ask for a significant raise? I like my current company, but I just don't know if they're going to give me enough money. With 2 years of experience, I feel like I'm almost to the point where I can go out and try to find new jobs. But I'm worried that's just not the case."
5axzko,1,2016-11-03,"Had an emotional breakdown and argued with my mom. Now she's taking her anger out on the rest of my family. What should I do? (Long post, but please please read).",jjh0928,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5axzko/had_an_emotional_breakdown_and_argued_with_my_mom/,"Hello everyone, I'm a 19 year old college student and lately I've been struggling. It's my first year of college and it's been really hard for me to make friends and get used to how competitive it is around here. Growing up, I was never allowed to have friends over, hang out with people outside of school, go to parties, school dances, prom, or participate in any non-academic extra-curriculars. I grew up with no social life and now that I am older it's starting to affect me because I have really poor social skills. 

I commute to campus (mom won't let me dorm or take public transport and I don't have a car so she drives me), and she's very strict about picking me up as soon as classes are over, so I can't join clubs, internships, or anything. I go to a pretty ""prestigious"" school, and sometimes the classes are really hard but I can't go to tutoring because my mom just thinks I'm not trying hard enough, even though I stay up all night trying to teach myself the material and even spend my lunch break and all my free time doing my homework and studying. I am stressed to the max and commuting everyday takes a combined three hours which is why I want to dorm on campus but my mom just doesn't get it. 

I don't have any friends in college, I'm really shy and awkward so people just ignore me which is understandable but I've been really lonely and isolated lately and I just want someone to talk to. I had a few close friends in high school, and pretty much everyone who met me at my old school found me kind and funny, but in college it's so different. I'm close to one particular childhood friend, and she was advising me to talk to my mom about how I've been struggling but I was always too scared to confront her, until yesterday.

I had a meltdown yesterday in the car when my mom picked me up after class. I won't bother you all with the details but it was just a bad, exhausting day, and I just lost it. My mom started talking about how she wants to buy me a car because she's tired of driving me around and I told her (honestly so) that I should not get a car because it's more expensive to buy me a car + insurance + gas (my school is far) than it is to dorm (I got a LOT of financial aid + scholarships), plus I'm so busy throughout the day and the last thing I want to do is drive home with 1.5 hours of traffic every freaking night. Then she started yelling at me saying how I'm being idiotic and that only people who hate their parents dorm in college and how it's her responsibility to control my life and campus activities are only for bad, immoral people and that's when I started to get really angry and I told her that she's the reason I've missed out on so many opportunities in life and just because I want to have some independence doesn't mean I'm ungrateful and disrespectful it just means that I am so tired of living like I'm under constant scrutiny and surveillance. When I'm angry, I cry uncontrollably so at this point I was sobbing I'm not sure why but I always get like this in response to stress but then again I've spent a lot of years keeping my frustrations bottled up inside. I asked her why doesn't she trust me because I've been nothing but obedient to her even if it made me mad or frustrated to do so. She doesn't understand that extra curriculars in college are important to apply to grad school and to network and make connections so I can find a good job.

The rest of the car ride was complete silence. I composed myself in time to come home and act like nothing happened to the rest of my family. But today my mom is being a jerk to everyone and no one knows it's because I had an argument with her. I feel guilty that she's taking her anger out by acting coldly to my family but at the same time I don't regret it because it was about time that I stuck up for myself. She's completely ignoring me but that's pretty normal of her when she's mad at anyone, and she usually stays like that for a few days or weeks. Anyway, I'm not sure if I should say sorry or something because I didn't want her to get so mad I just wanted her to realize that I need a little more freedom now that I'm in college. She blows everything out of proportion and she always calls me immature even though she's the one who is holding a grudge. I just don't know what to do. My old friends would always tell me to defend myself from my mom and that things will change for the better but it only made things worse. Please, I need advice.

*Side note* I don't have a job (I'm not allowed to have one) so I can't just leave my home because I'm financially dependent on my parents."

5ayvr9,2,2016-11-03,Stripe or Uber for summer 2017 internship?,summerintern2017,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ayvr9/stripe_or_uber_for_summer_2017_internship/,"Hi guys, I'm a junior considering two awesome offers from Stripe and Uber (both in SF). The pay for both is about the same, and I think the benefits are somewhat comparable, too. Stripe offers corp housing while Uber only offers a housing stipend; I would rather take corp housing to avoid the hassle of finding a place to stay in SF. Comparing the offers alone, I would slightly lean towards Stripe.

However, I think that Uber has better brand recognition than Stripe. And since I am going to be looking for full-time opportunities next year, I am assuming that brand name is important for that. This summer 2016, I interned at one of the big 4, so on the other hand, perhaps pursuing brand names isn't as important of a consideration this summer.

My other considerations for my decision would be the company size/culture and possibility of receiving a return full-time offer. Both Uber and Stripe are smaller than any of the big 4, and I would like to intern at a smaller tech company next summer. Also, assuming that I get a return offer, I could see myself working at either company after graduation.

What are your thoughts on this?"

1 - Refuse the interview and reapply the next year better prepared?

The problem is I have not received an offer from this company yet and I am not sure what to do. 

I asked the local company for an extension on the offer, they said we can talk about it once it before it expires on Friday. I have already sent an email to the company in San Francisco regarding the position but I doubt I will hear back from them soon.

I am not sure if I should take a risk and reject this offer and wait for the summer offer or if I should not trust what the hiring manager said and accept this job.

What would you guys do? 

To note: I also have an interview set up with one of the big 4 next week, but I doubt I will do well with them.

Basically, I was going to be picked up for a soccer game by my best friend, who texted saying she would call and warn me a little bit before she was leaving. I, in the process of wasting time on my laptop, was like “dude totally” and just kept on surfing the internet, assuming when I got the call, I would have time to get ready and run out the door.

Little did I know I would literally be running out the door, and not back in for quite a while.

Obviously, I should have just gotten ready, but as we all know, the internet can be all-consuming, and I have no willpower. This was a couple hours before the game, so I was drinking lots of water to hydrate and stuff and basically not really paying attention to the time.

Sure enough the call came and broke my distraction, but instead, she said she was actually already on her way. Note: she lives like a two-minute drive from my house. Freaking out, I raced around my house, throwing on my uniform, grabbing shin pads, socks, water, and so on.

I rushed out the door, ran to their car, and realized the water I had downed earlier was really taking its toll on my bladder. So I asked if I had time to use the washroom, tossed my bag on the ground, and hardcore *sprinted* to my side door. It was not out of necessity to pee, mind you, but because I was scared I was going to make us late.

In the middle of my driveway was an old trailer. Naturally, upon hitting this roadblock, I set my left foot to the side and onto my neighbour’s lawn, in order to avoid aforementioned trailer. Naturally, that foot slipped because I was wearing worn-down Birkenstocks, I was running like a madman, and the grass was wet. Naturally, as my left foot was sliding forwards, my right foot stayed firmly planted on the pavement and I saw in a flash—as I was so gracefully falling down—my ankle snap outwards.

Basically, what followed was just me laying on the ground sobbing at my rapidly swelling ankle and my parents rushing outside like “wtf” and my friend and her dad being like “wtf”, and then there was a nice trip to the hospital.

Coincidentally, this all took place at the exact same time my parents were supposed to leave to go pick up my brother from the airport after his summer internship abroad. Instead of seeing her son, my mom got to drive me to the emergency room, where I learned it wasn’t just sprained, I full on broke my fibula and needed surgery.

Best part was at the hospital, when all the nurses kept asking me how the soccer game went, jokingly asking if was it the winning goal, because I was in my uniform. To which I had to reply that no, I hadn’t made it to the game, as I had slipped on my neighbour’s lawn. Oh, the looks I got. My cheeks were flaming.

This also took place a week before I started my first year of university; I missed out on the 101 week I had paid for just nights before and got to “explore campus” on crutches for the next month and a half.

To top everything off, there wasn’t even a rush to begin with, as I was so unfortunately unaware, because we had to wait for a third teammate to arrive at my house who was also carpooling before we could leave.

In the end, I have a three-inch scar on my ankle to forever remind me of my stupidity and bad life decisions:

Take note, children. Don’t wait until the last minute to get ready, and don’t run in Birkenstocks on wet grass.

**TL;DR** I broke my ankle and needed surgery because I freaking slipped on grass when running to the washroom."

How do I convince my parents to let me go,CheeseCakeHaven21,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5b2clr/got_an_internship_offer_how_do_i_convince_my/,"Hi. I'm currently doing my ACCA studies after finishing my degree. I recently left my full time job to take time off to complete my ACCA full time. I'm 23 this year.

So recently I applied to the ACCA internship program. But my parents are bent on me taking on a full time job instead after I finish my papers in December. I went for the interview just to see if I could qualify. So I actually passed the first round of interview and I received an internship offer from a reputable firm (BDO LLP). 

I've applied for many FT jobs back in August just to see how many companies (including BDO, oh the irony) will write back to me and in fact only 1 got back to me which didn't give me a favorable offer at that time so I had to turn it down. 

I spoke to the HR yesterday and they said they'll take me on as an intern till the period stipulated in the program (3months min.) and after which they'll see if I have performed adequately enough to be considered for a FT job. I feel that is reasonable and said I'll give them my final answer after thinking about it through the weekends. 

So my situation is not such where I'm desperate for the money. In fact I feel that the internship will prove to be a good stepping stone to enter into the company and earn myself a good name and hopefully gain a very good experience from it. 

My parents are very bent on their decision (idk if it's an Asian parents mentality to ""micro manage"" the decisions). But I need to find the courage to convince my parents I wish to pursue this route instead because I'm very very interested in saying yes. 

I appreciate any constructive feedback! "

5b3atp,1,2016-11-04,Would there be any appetite for a live Excel coaching business based on the big investment bank's intake programmes and made applicable to all?,BusinessTechCoaching,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5b3atp/would_there_be_any_appetite_for_a_live_excel/,"I’m wondering if there would be any appetite for something I’m thinking of starting.  I’m a technology coach and ran the European Investment Banking Technology Coaching team at Morgan Stanley for many years.  I worked directly with management and the guys on the ground to design and run their technology coaching programmes including the intake programmes for interns, full time analysts and MBAs as well as senior hires.  Our biggest topic was Excel and we ensured that these guys were business ready with it and risk free before they arrived at their desks and supported them with it on an ongoing basis.


I left the firm a while ago but have been invited back to assist with other intakes and I’m now thinking of providing similar coaching online.  I’ve made it a bit more generic so it’s not just banking specific and I think it’d be really useful for anyone who’s looking to get into the business world or just move within it.


This is unique and directly relevant Excel coaching that I know big employers want their staff to have. It covers relevant Excel functionality but with a focus on the things you absolutely need to know to create professional, usable, scaleable and accurate models for use within a corporate team and that can be presented to clients.  I would incorporate all the shortcuts, hints, tips and best practices that are relevant in the business world.  In short, all the stuff that’s going to give you a real advantage and will save you so much misery with re-creating things if you don’t know it.  This is the stuff that’s going to make your VP think you’re a safe pair of hands and not the person who they have to send back with endless mark ups and who needs constant monitoring.
If you think this would be good knowledge to have, I’d love to hear your thoughts.  I do need to eat so I’d charge for this but it would be really affordable.  I would deliver these modules live, online using Skype/Google Hangouts/Live Meeting etc so you can ask questions and get an immediate answer.  I’m based in the UK so I’m in a great time zone to accommodate anyone wherever they are in the world and we have a currency that makes these modules really affordable at present!
I’ve run some experimental modules in person over here in the UK and they were well received.  I’ve been considering taking it online to a wider audience so I just thought I’d check to see what the appetite is further afield.
I’d welcome genuine comments.

**Edit**
I don't think I made it clear above that this isn't specifically Excel training which, I appreciate, is available elsewhere for free.


**To answer other questions...**


The modules I'd run wouldn’t be specifically for banking students so no, I don’t expect banking knowledge.  I’ve stripped out the banking-specific models and examples so that anyone from any industry background can understand them.  The modules do start at the beginning with Excel because they’re designed for people who might have studied a subject that simply doesn’t use much Excel (history, theology, law, medicine etc) so I go back to the beginning with them and fill in the blanks and start to iron out bad habbits.
With that in mind, I’m bringing people up to a good level of Excel usage but within the context of a corporate job.  This means they’ll fill in gaps in their knowledge but will learn, among others, things like:


How to avoid ruining the usability of a model by inappropriate formatting (and I’m not talking colour schemes).  


Learning what functions are actually used in the real world, which ones aren’t, which ones are flawed and can give you wrong results and which ones are just used as discussion points.  


How to avoid crashing models, how to spot when workbooks are corrupt and what to do about them when it happens.  


How to make models that the rest of your team can use (which allows you to live in peace!).  


How to use Excel quickly, efficiently and accurately (this is continually the biggest request of management).  


How to create output that’s appropriate and compatible with your clients.  


Why circular references can be useful and how to manage them.  


What is the reality with the pros and cons of array formulas and how are they viewed in the real world.  


All the best practices that large firms want and need you to know so that your models are professional, useable, accurate and can grow with the demands made on it.  And a load more..."
5b3cko,2,2016-11-04,Feel like I messed up my life quite a bit.,TA6687246,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5b3cko/feel_like_i_messed_up_my_life_quite_a_bit/,"Some background:

Currently a senior engineering student in university but the sudden increase in workload has caused me to stress out to the point where I can't find the motivation/discipline to keep going. So now I'm failing most of my classes and have a very bleak output of the future. 

The biggest thing I'm worried about is that I will have to take at least another semester at least to graduate and the university I attend only gives 8 semesters of scholarship, so each additional semester will be around $13,000. I don't want to burden myself or my family with huge student debt loans and was the main reason I went to this particular university, but now I feel like a giant hypocrite since I'll likely have to pay up anyway if I want to graduate.

I've also done a few internships and I realize they aren't representative of an actual job, but I didn't seem to fit in well with the work environment. I know work isn't always fun but I'd like to find something I can at least tolerate and feel fulfilled. 

Again, this all leads into the whole bleak output of the future.

So now I'm seriously contemplating suicide as these thoughts are also weighing down my ability to enjoy life.

I've yet to tell my parents about my situation as they have fairly high expectations of me and I don't want to disappoint them. 

So in summary: I've got a poor outlook on my immediate future, and then even if I do graduate I have little hope of finding a job that I'll actually enjoy just to live. Also my parents are hoping I make it big and I don't want to disappoint them.

I'm sure other people have experienced a similar situation to mine and I'd like to hear how you coped with it and found a bigger purpose in your life.

I was offered a position as a community liaison at a middle school. I took the job because I thought it would give me a lot of experience in the field (it has) and I am really interested in establishing myself in. I want to be a school counselor and I have already applied to my local graduate program to get my counseling credential. If I get into the program the internship credential would allow me to work as a counselor in the morning (if I can find job) and take classes to get the credential and masters in the evenings after work.

Currently, my job as a community liaision I am not doing so well. I have an $80,000 budget that I have to implement on programs, events, classes for parents  but the ideas I come up with must be approved by admin (principal and assistant principal). Almost all of the ideas I had for the school year got shutdown by admin. In addition, admin/staff use me as their translator which isn't part of my job, and I have told them various times that this isn't something I do and if they need a translator to contact district office but they don't listen. Basically, since the beginning I felt that I was in a position to fail, with very limited training on how things worked (I learned that myself), very little discussion with my supervisor in the district office about usage of the funding/regulations/policies. Another major factor that I dislike is that I commute every day hr drive to work and usually an hour and a half back home after work. The commute is sucking the soul out of me and I feel very unmotivated. 

I was thinking about quitting because I think that it's very likely for me to get fired and the job is making me miserable.

I've been incredibly fortunate to receive internship offers at Google, Microsoft, Palantir and Citadel. I know that chance plays a big role in the recruiting process, and I fully understand how incredibly lucky I got this year. 

The point of this post is that I have no idea how to decide between these offers. Which of these places do you think would provide the best opportunity for long term career development? I know Google and Microsoft would look incredible on a resume, but I worry that the jobs might be too cushy, and I would get complacent. I worry that Palantir doesn't have the experienced managers and mentors that older, bigger companies do. And I worry that Citadel would be too cut-throat, and I would burn out. 

What would you all consider when trying to decide? Any insight or help would be really appreciated. Thank you"

For one, will a good CC/Extension transcript post-undergrad assist me? I plan on taking more courses in CS and Molecular Biology. I have already studied some CS in college. 

Are there any skills I should specifically learn, or that will shine on my resume? I know this depends on the company, somewhat.

I am confused about what type of applications I should build.  Would small mobile apps using native languages such as Java look better on my resume as opposed to small web development projects using JS and a framework like react?

I know the quality of code is important, most of my school projects have been completed in Java and C and I have recently picked up some JS which seems fun.  

Also apart from open source, a friend of mine who has been in the industry for a while is working on developing an react based mobile app and asked me to join him.  This project is not open source though and it is something they are trying to do on the side to make money.  I wonder if teaming up with them would be an ever better idea as opposed to open source which seems more appealing to me?

Keep in mind that I want to use the month not just to learn but get a small project or some small programs up and running that would be appealing to CS recruiters.

Or would you guys recommend that I spend quite a bit of this time getting better at DS and algorithms?

Anyway about me: I'm 20, and went to a very small high school. I didn't care a whole lot about doing extremely well, so my GPA could have been better. If I remember correctly it ended up being 3.76. I had no extracurriculars, and only two honors classes. But I also attended a technical school while in high school, and received a certificate for that program. This was for Multimedia and Web Design. Other than that I don't have much going for me to get into a more selective school. I'm not looking to get into an Ivy, just a more selective school. 

Here is what I'm thinking of doing so far:

- Take the ACT (didn't take in high school)

- Retake the SAT

- Start some volunteer work

- Attend a community college

- Get good grades at community college

- Apply for transfer to selected universities



I'm also planning on doing a lot of self study using online resources. I don't know a lot about programming, so I want to learn as much as I can. 

There are a few reasons I want to get into a more selective school. I feel like after graduating I will have a slightly better chance getting a job. I feel like I will possibly meet more likeminded people who are interested in their work. A better school might provide better connections or reputation as well. 

So, here are my questions. 

What will help me get into a better school? 

Should I pursue a general track at a community college or focus more on mathematics courses? I know this may just be personal preference, but thought I would ask anyway. 

What are the most important things to look into about a school's Computer Science program? Or a school in general. 

Also, something I'm wondering. Say I don't get into the school of my choice, could I still attend their career fairs to get internships or jobs? Would this be frowned upon? 

Any general advice about attending college or a career in CS will probably be helpful as well. If you were in a similar situation I'd love to hear your story. 

Thanks! (:

Im 23, never had a real job, about to drop out of highschool the second time, and have a BMI sitting around 15.      

My dad died when i was turning 18 which ruined me at the time, causing me to drop out of highschool the first time. No worries, he was sorta abusive, the kind of dick that kept sticks behind the kitchen door to beat you with. Kicked me out of the house several times and even came at me with a knife.
  
Since then, I've basically just wasted 5 years. And it's fucking killing me.  
What I've done in these 5 years:  
Rotting in my room, no friends.   

Tried becoming a chef, top of the class and i do make amazing food. But i didnt show up to class enough because i thought it was a joke most of the time. Like, imagine a classroom full of kids who can't cook for shit that are tasked with making even shittier dishes, that was the daily routine. Thinking back, i was the only one take culinairy school serious enough to take my own sharp knives with me.      
  
Worked EXTREMELY SHORTLY as an intern at a huge packaging firm, then i got appendicitis and was fucked for half a year.  

More rotting in my room, browsing reddit. No friends.   

Tried to get welfare, they sent me to something like a ""work camp"" where kids with no idea what they wanna do spend their times. Absolutely shit pay. Literally everyone in class did nothing besides me (and couple of others **sometimes**) and i felt so bad for the teacher. 
  
After that (right now) I'm having another go at highschool. But this school is apple-jerkoff-certified or some bullshit.    
So it started out normal, i came early everyday. Ace everything because i basically know all of the material. People in class are like ""wtf are you even doing here?"". But now i can't take it seriously anymore. We basically only do group assignments. My groups so far have consisted of slackers that browse facebook all day/bronies that draw ponies all day/people who skip a period to smoke a joint etc.   
Our main teacher showed us ""solar freaking roadways"", how cool of a concept it is, followed by me and another student having to point out how idiotic it is. Honestly, our teacher is that gullible guy that shares everything on facebook that looks cool in principle but is a total waste of time in reality.    
We work with iPads. You people have no idea how lame teaching with these can be. So many fucking useless apps. Apps designed for children. We're generally forced to use inferior software and hardware.  
I can't take it seriously. Every fucking day i spend there is irrelevant. I didn't go to school a single day last week. Heavily considering to drop out and do something productive.     
  
I'm fucked. What the fuck should i do? Relying on my mom is the last thing i wanna do. I can't do that to her. She has done too much for me already.   
Never written a job application...   
  
This post is a mess, it's 3am...  
   
My pros;   
*fluent danish  
*fluent german  
*fluent english  
*broken farsi  
*very quick learner  
*can build computers and work pretty well with them    
*can cook pretty fuggen good food  
*generally elitist at everything i do   
*hella efficient, and always looking for ways to make something more efficient   
*have drivers license and car (thanks mom)  
  
cons;  
*BMI of 15, physically not too strong    
*hella antisocial in my spare time  
*look like a SJW stereotype although im the opposite  
  
   
Suicidal thoughts are creeping up on me, but there's no way I'd be giving up on life just yet.  
**ANY** advice/guiding/hints appreciated   
What are my options? somehow selfemployment? webshop? opening a unique streetfood vendor?    
Literally any advice hints or guides...    
Thank you for reading through mess. Sorry if it's difficult to go through, but I'm extremely restless at the moment.

I screwed around my freshman year and had shit grades in science courses but pulled them up since then. 

I'm now on the search for a backup option, should dentistry not pan out, and my family/friends have mentioned MIS/CS as a possible option. My other option is to pursue a MS in biology/biotechnology but I did lab work and graduate-level research for my senior capstone project and I was not a fan of the tediousness and boring nature of being stuck in lab all the time. Anyway, I have a family friend who is a current MIS major who has told me it's the way to go as his father was also an MIS major and now a president of a major defense contract company, but I'm not sure if this is the right career path for me. Not to say it isn't but I have no CS or IT background at all. I can work my way around any OS and have basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge along with plenty of basic computer hardware and software knowledge (I'm the go-to computer guy around my family, girlfriend's family, and all of my friends - even long-distance friends who call me for computer solutions). I also love solving basic computer and IT issues around the house and other peoples' computers (I've worked with personal computers running Windows and OS X/macOS and enterprise systems running older Windows systems). 

I've applied to a nearby university to enter their MIS program in the spring, just in case. I would apply to a CS or online MIS program but I don't have any prereq's to warrant it. And to be honest, I know CS is a ton of math and I am decent enough to keep up but not if it means taking more math classes (already took Cal I my freshman year along with basic statistics classes in my college career). Was wondering if I could get some opinions here on a possible move and if it's worth it to pursue a 2nd degree and even an MS in CS or MIS/Information Security (I have a sweet spot for cybersecurity in my heart). Also, any help with directions for a MS, and even internship ideas, if it's worth it, would be great as well. Let me know what you think.

Hi guys,

So I'm a sophomore at MIT, and as the title suggests I can't get an internship interview. 

About a month ago I applied to a bunch of places I could think of off the top of my head, and a couple weeks ago I went down intern.supply and applied to a bunch more. I also went to my school's career fair and handed out resumes and such to places I recognized the name of. 

Since then, most places haven't bothered responding at all (even with a rejection email), much less given an interview. I'm wondering whether this is because I'm a weak candidate (in which case I want to do something about this before next year) or if it's just because places don't want sophomores (in which case I can continue what I'm doing and try again next year).

Basically, I'm doubling in math/CS, but it's very easy to get a math degree at my school (the requirements are intentionally lenient to accommodate people doubling), so I'm taking a lot of math classes first before focusing on CS. In particular I'm taking a bunch of graduate classes right now, so I don't have much time to devote to side projects. In particular, the general advice for projects of ""find something that should be done and do it"" doesn't really help me, because those things are either trivial (i.e. I can do it in a couple hours) or way too time-consuming (i.e. I don't have the time to do it with my courseload). 

Thus from a CS perspective my resume is presumably quite weak; I don't have many projects to speak of (besides some small minor ones) and the CS classes I've taken are basic introductory-level ones that I've taken just to clear out requirements (i.e. the ones I can finish without devoting too much time/going to class, which are necessarily the basic ones). So I can totally understand why I don't come across as a serious candidate.

On the other hand, I'm mildly surprised that I'm getting *nothing*, as I don't think I'm so weak as to get filed under ""completely ignore"". In particular I also have a decent competitive programming background (Codeforces, USACO, etc.), so I think I'd stand a decent chance at getting past an interview if I could get one (most interview problems I hear aren't too bad; they'd be mid-level competition problems or so). So I'm wondering whether I should take this as

a) A ""wake-up call"" so to speak, i.e. that I'm actually a terrible candidate and need to make changes before next year if I want an internship. In particular, if this is the case, then I'm happy to lighten my courseload and focus on putting together some projects next semester in preparation for recruiting season next year. But obviously I'd rather not do this, which leads me to

b) An indication that places don't want to hire non-advanced sophomores, but will do so for juniors, in which case I can continue with my current educational plan of finishing my math requirements then moving on to the upper-level CS stuff.

c) There's something else horribly wrong with the way I've been applying (i.e. through company websites/the intern.supply links) that's leading to my stuff getting filtered out automatically.

Does anyone have any insight on this? Thanks!

Assuming I end up with the felony convictions, am I utterly screwed in finding a job in this field? I honestly feel like my chances with CS are as good as anywhere else.

Sorry guys this is gonna be a bit of a long post. I'm a senior in college majoring in Game Programming. I'm just honestly feeling more and more concerned about my job prospects. My boyfriend has the same degree I am currently working on and he graduated a year ago. He has yet to find a job that uses his degree(or anything other than the crap fast food jobs,retail, and factory work that does not require any kind of degree and will hire almost anybody). Lately I have been applying for tons and tons of internships, new grad positions, and entry-level positions. I have filled out over 150 applications in the last 2.5 months. I stare down LinkedIn and Indeed every day. I went to every page of google with the search terms video game intern. I searched for any mention of internships on Facebook. I also went to gamedevmap.com and went to every link in the USA and Canada looking for jobs to apply to. I'm starting to feel like I'm even running out of jobs to apply to that I feel my skill set aligns with. I taught myself to program when I was 11, took Computer Science classes in high school, and as aforementioned am now a senior in college. I have also been working on a game known as Crimson Nights with some others at my University and it will be sold on Steam. Its almost done and right now were looking at releasing it probably on/around the 18th of this month. I have had 8 interviews with 6 different companies, but have not yet been offered any jobs. Well I was offered a unpaid internship in Hollywood, CA, but I most definitely can not afford to move to Hollywood and work for free. I'm on my own and pay all my own bills, my parents don't help me with anything, and my student loans from the FAFSA don't even cover all of my tuition(I'm paying around 7k a year out of pocket just for school). I know how to use Unity and Android Studio. I can program in C#, C++, Java, Lua, Python, JavaScript, ActionScript, HTML, CSS, and Visual Basic. I know how to use git already and am familiar with Scrum and Agile Development. I also am familiar with and able to use many various IDES, including Visual Studio and Eclipse. What can I do to make myself stand out and get a paying position somewhere(games or software related)? My portfolio is located at https://alisontaylorprojects.wordpress.com/
Please help! Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Again sorry for super super long post but I've been feeling a bit depressed about it and disheartened. I'm worried all my hard work will amount to nothing and that my degree may just end up a worthless piece of paper."

5bdguf,18,2016-11-05,[Internships] Sophomore can't get an interview,VeniVidiVici42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5bdguf/internships_sophomore_cant_get_an_interview/,"tl;dr: Am I doing something wrong or am I just a sophomore?

Hi guys,

So I'm a sophomore at MIT, and as the title suggests I can't get an internship interview.

About a month ago I applied to a bunch of places I could think of off the top of my head, and a couple weeks ago I went down intern.supply and applied to a bunch more. I also went to my school's career fair and handed out resumes and such to places I recognized the name of.

Since then, most places haven't bothered responding at all (even with a rejection email), much less given an interview. I'm wondering whether this is because I'm a weak candidate (in which case I want to do something about this before next year) or if it's just because places don't want sophomores (in which case I can continue what I'm doing and try again next year).

Basically, I'm doubling in math/CS, but it's very easy to get a math degree at my school (the requirements are intentionally lenient to accommodate people doubling), so I'm taking a lot of math classes first before focusing on CS. In particular I'm taking a bunch of graduate classes right now, so I don't have much time to devote to side projects. In particular, the general advice for projects of ""find something that should be done and do it"" doesn't really help me, because those things are either trivial (i.e. I can do it in a couple hours) or way too time-consuming (i.e. I don't have the time to do it with my courseload).

Thus from a CS perspective my resume is presumably quite weak; I don't have many projects to speak of (besides some small minor ones) and the CS classes I've taken are basic introductory-level ones that I've taken just to clear out requirements (i.e. the ones I can finish without devoting too much time/going to class, which are necessarily the basic ones). So I can totally understand why I don't come across as a serious candidate.

On the other hand, I'm mildly surprised that I'm getting nothing, as I don't think I'm so weak as to get filed under ""completely ignore"". In particular I also have a decent competitive programming background (Codeforces, USACO, etc.), so I think I'd stand a decent chance at getting past an interview if I could get one (most interview problems I hear aren't too bad; they'd be mid-level competition problems or so). So I'm wondering whether I should take this as

a) A ""wake-up call"" so to speak, i.e. that I'm actually a terrible candidate and need to make changes before next year if I want an internship. In particular, if this is the case, then I'm happy to lighten my courseload and focus on putting together some projects next semester in preparation for recruiting season next year. But obviously I'd rather not do this, which leads me to

b) An indication that places don't want to hire non-advanced sophomores, but will do so for juniors, in which case I can continue with my current educational plan of finishing my math requirements then moving on to the upper-level CS stuff.

c) There's something else horribly wrong with the way I've been applying (i.e. through company websites/the intern.supply links) that's leading to my stuff getting filtered out automatically.

Does anyone have any insight on this? Thanks!

Here are the two I am thinking of. Please let me know if you think these are decent answers, or if neither of them are any good.

1. My height. I am fairly short and I think people don't take me as seriously because of this. I have to try extra hard to prove myself because I don't have as much physical presence when I enter a room and have to make up for it with my actions.

2. I am a very harsh self-critic. I think this stems from having been the only female in my physics program and feeling like I had to prove myself capable just because I am a female. I think that this comes off as me lacking confidence sometimes, and I am trying to actively make sure that it is not the impression I give off.

Maybe neither of these are good, I don't know. Any feedback is very appreciated! Thanks :)"

I'm the head of maintenance at an assisted living home, and lately I've been feeling like the director is looking for a reason to fire me. It's fairly difficult to screw up a maintenance job when you know what your doing but the director keeps finding things to complain about even if they aren't realistic. For example, I had to repaint a two bedroom apartment where I was only given three days notice that we had a move in and it needed to be fixed up. The average time to paint and apartment of that size for two people including setup and cleanup is three days, it took me four by myself due to also having to complete my normal work since we have a policy to fix maintenance orders within 24 hours. Her issue was that apparently I worked too slow and she was disappointed that I didn't have it done sooner. Again, I was only given a few days notice beforehand and two of those days were Saturday and Sunday which I came in to work on.

There was another apartment last week where they wanted painted where I got a text at 9 at night on Sunday that my director wanted another apartment painted by Tuesday afternoon for a move in.

Another issue they found was that the contractors for flooring installation (that I recommended we do not use) would show up late and leave early and wouldn't tell me a time for when they would be back. She said it was up to me to control them (after the fact) but I had no part in dealing with them at any other time and she set it all up.

There was also an issue of a bunch of maintenance issues slipping by that I knew nothing about and she asked why I wasn't getting to them. The problem turned out to be that instead of people filling out the maintenance forms and putting them in my box up front they'd come up to me in the hallways while I'm holding an 8ft ladder and a tool box and juggling 10 other tasks I need to do before lunch and ask me to do something. When I'd tell then they need to submit a form they'd say ok and not do it.

There's been multiple occasions where the office staff and the director would be talking to me and just say how much they wish the previous maintenance guy never quite. They've gone through 7 maintenance people in the last 3 years and I'm starting to see why they have such a high turnover rate.

She also was annoyed that I only came in for half my weekend to work one time instead of the whole weekend. She said apparently I'm not as driven as she thought I was. This was after a no notice call on a Saturday afternoon, apparently being on call to them means I'm not supposed to leave the town and I don't require any notice for non-emergencies.

The other day I was suddenly called down to the directors office (no explanation, no surprise). When I arrived every other manager was sitting inside and they immediately started asking questions that were very vague.

""We're you in [room number] with [housekeeping staff]?""

""Yes, I assembled the carpet machine for her and wanted to make sure it worked correctly and the sewage issue was cleaned up.""

""That's not your department so why did you have to go?""

""You had me clean the last sewage issue because the housekeeping staff didn't want to so I wanted to make sure it was done correctly and I didn't have to stop painting again to clean it up.""

""Were you alone in the room together?""

""No, there was a CNA in the room for most of the time then she left and [one of the managers that was in the room asking questions] came in. I was in the room for less than two minutes total.""

""[Other manager] says you were alone with her.""

""If you think something inappropriate was taking place I can assure y-""

""Oh, no no no, we just need to know if you saw [housekeeper] on her phone at all?""

So they made me think I was being accused of sexual misconduct in order to find out if a coworker was using their phone at work. The part that's almost offensive was I was the last to be told about an issue with the housekeeper and what they were discussing. I'm also a manager and they treat me as if I'm a busboy in the cafeteria. I found out about what was going on from the intern who was apparently higher on the need to know list than me, another manager. Lord knows why the Activities director and the kitchen supervisor were at the meeting questioning me.

This one is my biggest issue and has me kind of worried. The nursing director from my work called and asked me to go to the hardware store then come in yesterday, when I said I wasn't in town they said they'll call someone else, I asked what happened and she said never mind then hung up.

I then texted my boss what was going on and after an hour she said the other person told her that I refused to come in even after they explained it was an emergency and a safety issue. So now my boss is having us both in her office Monday to discuss the ""issue"" because I'm on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week and I should have come in despite not being in town. Apparently giving up my last two weekends and working 3 weeks straight and staying late everyday wasn't enough to warrant a weekend off OR A proper explanation so I can judge whether I needed to come in immediately or if it could water until the next day."

So in my sophomore year I'm currently studying algo and introduction to Java and computer engineering (mods are pre-determined by the school, can't change). We don't have a class on math in computer science so algos are quite hard to grasp. do you guys have any tips on mastering algos and ds questions? I just started on ctci so let's see how that goes. 

I did a simple internship last year at a startup which was focused on web dev/digital marketing/business development (30/40/30%) but now I'm really looking for SWE internships as this is my intended career path

* Cruised through school, took Cs, learned almost nothing, no internships, took low-paying dev job after graduation. 

Fast forward one year: I've gained a lot of experience and now I'm getting contacted by recruiters at large companies and have friends who can refer me as well. I recently had a call with a well-known social media company, mentioned I had a lot going on, and asked to interview in February, which they said would work. That gives me a concrete goal to work towards. Now here's the problem:

* I suck at DS/Algo. Couldn't tell you how to implement a LL, don't know what a Heap is, don't know how to implement the different sorts at this moment. 

* My strongest language is PHP; I've forgotten my Java since school. I don't want to interview in PHP, I'd like to learn Python so I'm doing practice problems to learn the syntax but it's just an extra hurdle. 

I picked up a copy of the Algorithm Design Manual to read on my commute, ordered CtCI, and I'm trying to do problems on leetcode but I'm really struggling. I feel like 4 months is enough if I can be efficient with my preparing, but it all feels quite overwhelming at the moment. So my question is: 

* If you were in my position right now, with my (lack of) knowledge, and had 4 months -- what would be your study plan? 

Say I can allocate one hour per day to studying: do I start with the design manual cover to cover before doing anything else? Watch videos on Data Structures? Just tackle practice problems until I'm blue in the face? I feel like I'm trying to kind of touch everything at once and I'm floundering. Any advice, or someone to just sort of lay out a proper plan would be extremely helpful right now. "

I've turned 30 a few months ago and still single. Only been in one relationship 4 years ago that lasted 1 year but I wasn't really into her just stuck with it because nobody ever liked me before and I wanted to see what it was like. I have zero friends, have always been an introvert and never understood how to communicate. I'm always the outcast even at networking events people look at me like I don't speak english.

I was bullied through school and all through life people have just pushed me around and taken advantage of me. Even at work I output twice the work of my coworkers yet I'm paid literally half because they know how to stand up for themselves and I'm too scared to say anything and make the same pay as the interns despite 10 years experience. I even have an advanced degree but that got me nowhere. I have the nice-guy syndrome, and reality pains me every day to realize nice guys truly finish last. Not just with work but with relationships.

Girls avoid me like the plague. I think I'm good looking but somehow they just see something wrong with me. I've had 2 dates in the last 4 years and they ghosted immediately after the date. I see lots of ugly people holding hands and I just know I'm better looking and why can't I find something. I feel like I must be majorly deformed or something and just so used to it that I don't notice it when I look in the mirror.

The holidays are always super tough for me and I don't think I can make it through this year. Even if I found someone today, they wouldn't know me enough to want to spend the holiday with me.

I see so many people with true friends, childhood friends with deep connections. That's something I want but I'm way too old to ever get that. Even if I find a couple friends, they'll never bond to me like their childhood friends.

Mostly I just want a relationship. I'm 30 and look 20. So 20 year olds don't want me once they find out I'm really 30 and 30 year olds don't want me because I look 20. Also it seems everyone over 25 is already married or had been engaged or have children. I feel if I find someone on my same level they would have to be super undesirable. I feel all hope is lost in finding someone desirable for me. Plus if they were desirable then there are so many better guys with tons of money, friends, family. I have nothing to offer anyone.

I don't even enjoy any activities anymore. I used to enjoy a bunch of things but gave them all up. Like fishing and hiking but they were all solo activities and I'm tired of being isolated."

I will have all of my prerequisites and Breadth Courses finished and have a competitive 4.0 GPA. I also have an internship in Private Wealth Management that I did this Summer. 

Since starting at community college my goal was to get into Haas and pursue finance. More recently, I have been taking a couple of computer science classes for fun and have really developed a passion for it. I have also been learning more about EE and am interested in that as well. It has gotten to the point where I am considering staying one more year at my community college and re-applying next Fall so I could complete the lower division coursework for EECS and declaring it as my minor once transferring, with the intent of declaring it as a second major afterwards. I have spoken to both L&amp;S Admissions and Haas Admissions over the phone and received some contradictory advice. I know each school kind of runs as its own bureaucracy and has its own rules and flexibilities. I'm calling an EECS Advisor to get their opinion tomorrow but in the meantime, I wanted to hear what UCB students think.

Apparently they will only accept 70 max units to transfer, (I will have ~110 if I stay one more year at my CC), but from my understanding even units above the 70 can be used to satisfy prerequisites for both majors. I also understand that they grant you 5 semesters to complete both majors. Is what I want to do even possible? Since I am not at Berkeley yet and live in Los Angeles, it is hard to be able to know if I could even organize the upper division classes so that I could graduate on time.

Thanks for the help/advice. I know that I am super lucky just to even have a chance at Haas, but I really feel like I would be missing out if I didn't also pursue my passions in CS and EE. Regardless, I am applying to Haas this Fall to see if I can get in, but in the meantime, I am planning on staying another year at CC with the intent of double majoring if possible. Since another year at CC will have a big opportunity cost, I want to be sure I can pull this off and see if it is worth it. I could of course just minor in EECS, though I don't know if it is worth all the effort just for a minor."

A little bit of background: I'm a junior undergrad studying electrical engineering and CS. I haven't really had an internship at a big name company yet unlike some of my other CS friends. Because of this, I started the hunt for internships really early this year and worked relentlessly to get an offer from a respectable company.

Whenever I had spare time I would be on Leetcode or CTCI, I stopped exercising to have more time to practice, I made excuses to avoid going out or socializing too often, and I feel that I put my mental health at risk. Failed interviews crushed me to the point where I didn't want to talk or move. I tend to have an obsessive personality and can get fixated on a particular goal very easily.

Fortunately, I was lucky enough to get a few offers, and I will be interning in the Spring and Summer with two well-known companies.

The thing is, getting these offers made me happy for a couple of days, but then I became sad again. I had to reject one offer in order to accommodate the other two, and I was flooded with regret. I still keep wondering whether I made the right choice, and seem to continue to come up with reasons for why I didn't, even though I have no control over that now.

I seem to never be satisfied with myself, even though me-from-6-months-ago would have been so impressed with where me-from-today is. Sometimes I think this is a good thing, that I'm always motivated to improve and do better. But sometimes I fear that it's damaging and unsustainable. I think it stems from the fact that the tech industry is so competitive and there are always others who seem more impressive, but it could also be a personal thing.

I know this is a longish post but I want to get a sense of what others feel? Is this common in the tech industry or even in general? Is it something I should work on improving?"

Her issue was that apparently I worked too slow and she was disappointed that I didn't have it done sooner. Again, I was only given a few days notice beforehand and two of those days were Saturday and Sunday which I came in to work on.

There was another apartment last week where they wanted painted where I got a text at 9 at night on Sunday that my director wanted another apartment painted by Tuesday afternoon for a move in.

Another issue they found was that the contractors for flooring installation (that I recommended we do not use) would show up late and leave early and wouldn't tell me a time for when they would be back. She said it was up to me to control them (after the fact) but I had no part in dealing with them at any other time and she set it all up.

There was also an issue of a bunch of maintenance issues slipping by that I knew nothing about and she asked why I wasn't getting to them. The problem turned out to be that instead of people filling out the maintenance forms and putting them in my box up front they'd come up to me in the hallways while I'm holding an 8ft ladder and a tool box and juggling 10 other tasks I need to do before lunch and ask me to do something. When I'd tell then they need to submit a form they'd say ok and not do it.

There's been multiple occasions where the office staff and the director would be talking to me and just say how much they wish the previous maintenance guy never quite. They've gone through 7 maintenance people in the last 3 years and I'm starting to see why they have such a high turnover rate.

She also was annoyed that I only came in for half my weekend to work one time instead of the whole weekend. She said apparently I'm not as driven as she thought I was. This was after a no notice call on a Saturday afternoon, apparently being on call to them means I'm not supposed to leave the town and I don't require any notice for non-emergencies.

The other day I was suddenly called down to the directors office (no explanation, no surprise). When I arrived every other manager was sitting inside and they immediately started asking questions that were very vague.

""We're you in [room number] with [housekeeping staff]?""

""Yes, I assembled the carpet machine for her and wanted to make sure it worked correctly and the sewage issue was cleaned up.""

""That's not your department so why did you have to go?""

""You had me clean the last sewage issue because the housekeeping staff didn't want to so I wanted to make sure it was done correctly and I didn't have to stop painting again to clean it up.""

""Were you alone in the room together?""

""No, there was a CNA in the room for most of the time then she left and [one of the managers that was in the room asking questions] came in. I was in the room for less than two minutes total.""

""[Other manager] says you were alone with her.""

""If you think something inappropriate was taking place I can assure y-""

""Oh, no no no, we just need to know if you saw [housekeeper] on her phone at all?""

So they made me think I was being accused of sexual misconduct in order to find out if a coworker was using their phone at work. The part that's almost offensive was I was the last to be told about an issue with the housekeeper and what they were discussing. I'm also a manager and they treat me as if I'm a busboy in the cafeteria. I found out about what was going on from the intern who was apparently higher on the need to know list than me, another manager. Lord knows why the Activities director and the kitchen supervisor were at the meeting questioning me.

This one is my biggest issue and has me kind of worried. The nursing director from my work called and asked me to go to the hardware store then come in yesterday, when I said I wasn't in town they said they'll call someone else, I asked what happened and she said never mind then hung up.

I then texted my boss what was going on and after an hour she said the other person told her that I refused to come in even after they explained it was an emergency and a safety issue. So now my boss is having us both in her office Monday to discuss the ""issue"" because I'm on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week and I should have come in despite not being in town. Apparently giving up my last two weekends and working 3 weeks straight and staying late everyday wasn't enough to warrant a weekend off OR A proper explanation so I can judge whether I needed to come in immediately or if it could water until the next day.

I'm worried about the meeting I need to have now with my director and the head of nursing as they know each other well and it appears to be a my word against hers type of meeting. What should I know to protect myself in case of being terminated?"

3rd year econ admin major, concentration:marketing 
Going to start upper division courses next quarter. Have taken lower level business and econ courses


Storytime


So I started this retail job about two months ago, it's my second job, I'm about to leave a different retail store I've been at for 3 years. This store is small, but corporate owned with about 8 locations nationwide.

Anyways, I go in for my shift this past Saturday, and some of corporate is visiting and I shake hands with the company's marketing manager. 

I ask her how she likes being a marketing manager and give her my little elevator speech. She then tells me to contact her if I ever need an internship as they would love to get someone that already works for the company (district manager told me they like to promote from within). Small talk happens as they purchase a couple items, and they leave. 

My problem :

Is this a good time to just email her and ask for the internship? I feel a bit under qualified but feel like I could learn a ton in the field. What should I do? I'm definitely going to send her a follow up email, but have no idea what I should say. 

Any tips reddit?"

First-generation naturalized citizen with well-educated parents. Income &lt; 70k.

Intended major: Biomedical engineering with a focus in synthetic bio or genetic engineering, and pre-med (plan on going into an MD – PhD program after undergrad for neurosurgery). I’m also interested in minoring in physics if it’s possible.

ACT: taking it in December, I know it’s a little late for my first time.
SAT: taking it in January 2017, same deal. 
SAT II: will be taking Biology-E (after sophomore year), Physics (after junior year), Math II (during or after sophomore year), Latin (after junior year) and possibly Chem (after junior year).
PSAT: scored a 1490 by some act of god, though I have no idea if my score raised this year.
Class rank: currently in 1st due to most of my classes being honors/AP. my school ranks on a 4-point scale with honors and AP being 5 for an A.

UW/W GPA: 
freshman year: 4.0/4.71
sophomore year (projected): 4.0/4.86

Courses:
Freshman year: honors, talented art, AP human geo and calc ab
Sophomore year: honors, AP psych, environmental science, calc bc, comparative/us gov, physics 1 and 2
Junior and Senior year: I will have taken all AP science, math, and English courses, plus the two econs and Latin.

AP Scores:
Human Geography – 5, Calculus AB – 5, World History – 3. Not submitting the last one since I took the test in middle school as part of an accelerated course and got the same score.

Awards:
AP scholar freshman year, and maybe every year, hopefully. I’m aiming for National AP scholar, state AP scholar, and National Merit. I have placed at the regional (multiple), state (thrice), and national (once) level in competitive research presentation. I’m trying really hard to qualify for ISEF this year.

Extracurricular:
I’ve been in Talented Art for 9 years and counting. I have presented my research at an international toxicology conference. I have been working at a state university’s toxicology and inhalation lab since grade 6. I’d really like to get an internship through RSI or HSAP in the future. E-board (teacher) for my schools’ MAO, historian of our Latin club, and co- leader of our robotics team. I’m also of my school’s STEM, Beta, and Chemistry club, and our state’s Math Circle. 
I’m also teaching myself how to code since I have no experience whatsoever, starting off with Python and then C++ and Java if I can pull through. This is purely just to be familiar with programming before college.

Unis:
My dream schools are Stanford or MIT, for obvious reasons (I love Stanford’s startup culture and MIT’s proud nerdy atmosphere). After that, I don’t really know where to apply except my state school since it has a highly competitive MD-PhD program that gets you into the medical workforce 2-3 years early. I’m on the fence about applying to anything else since studying at my state school would be free (so essentially my scholarships would pay me to go to college). Please help!

Things I’d like to know:
Based off my goals and what I put time into, what colleges should I look into, and which ones should I apply ED/EA to?
How can I improve my application and make it more well-rounded yet show that one area where I excel the most? I have actually a lot of free time if I don’t procrastinate and get off Reddit.

5bkzbe,2,2016-11-07,[NoVA] XSport Fitness Personal Training Cancellation and Refund,trashcancarla,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5bkzbe/nova_xsport_fitness_personal_training/,"Hi all,

I signed up as a member at the Fairfax, Virginia location of XSport Fitness at the beginning of August. I got sucked into a personal training plan--ultimately a dumb move for me but I was pumped at the time. The general manager assigned me a trainer who I met later that day for my first session. All was well.

During our next session, the trainer told me that he unfortunately had to put his two weeks in due to moving for an internship, but we could continue our sessions until he had to leave. I told him I understood, and he gave me the number of another trainer I ultimately ended up not contacting. Turns out, XSport dropped him on the spot rather than letting him stay two weeks. I only know because I showed up for my second training session and he told me.

So, fast forward to the end of August. I'm not getting the service I'm paying for, and I call to find out what I have to do to cancel my plan before the end-of-the-month charge hits me. The person I needed to talk to wasn't in, but the man on the phone took my information and assured me I'd get a call back sometime in the next couple weeks (apparently the beginning of the month is hectic for them). He held my payment and I wasn't hit with another charge.

I never got a phone call. I was hit with another charge on September 30th. I called to refute that charge and tell them that I had never gotten a call back. The guy said to come in during a weekday when a manager was there in order to cancel. Well, life happened (crazy work hours, family issues, and sickness), and I ended up calling back October 30th for them to hold the payment until I could come in. They told me they couldn't hold it and to call the general customer service number. When I told them I'd had it held before by them, they insisted I call the 877 number. I begrudgingly agreed. It was Sunday, so the center was closed. 

Frustrated, I emptied my checking account into my savings and later got an email saying they couldn't process my payment and that I should log on to the member portal to pay. I thought I was in the clear, and moved my money back so I could use it. Four days later, I'm hit with a charge that's half of my monthly PT payment.

I'm going to the gym tomorrow to cancel my plan and hopefully get my money back. Throughout this whole ordeal I've ended up being charged around $500 for a service I'm not receiving.

I unfortunately don't have a copy of the contract I signed (tore my house apart looking for it. Dumb, I know, but I was told I could cancel if I wasn't feeling it). I've also been charged the enrollment fee I was told was waived since I have corporate benefits, and another random $10 charge on top of that. I don't plan on disputing the monthly membership fee, but I do need the other money (all but two sessions of personal training I paid for, plus the apparent enrollment fee and random $10) back.

I'm worried (but expecting) I'll have to threaten legal action. Do I have a leg to stand on here? I'm not even sure what the process would be if I did have to take them to court. I'll work on finding the copy of the contract I have, but I'm wondering if any of this puts me in the hole in terms of refunding my money.

I appreciate any and all advice. Thank you!"

I've been active in this community since my freshman year and it has been a great resource. I will be graduating soon and would like to share my knowledge and skills I've learned and developed in terms of Internships. 

Landing interviews and securing your Dream Internship starts with your resume.


I was in the same exact shoes as many of you. In junior year with absolutely no Intern experience. I was applying to dozens of companies each week only to never hear back. But I changed gears and spent more time on learning how to land interviews and saw my potential increase. 

I started my internship at a small company doing great work. I went on to Intern for 3 Fortune 500 companies as a result of my shift in approach. 

Over the past year I've helped hundreds of students on campus and online.

I have finished all my prerequisites at my university and I have begun taking the harder programming courses; however, I am married with a child and I need to start making more money now. I currently make $13 an hour managing a quick service restaurant. 

I took a lower paying job that afforded me flexibility to go to school, but I am now unable to pay my credit cards and my credit score is in the gutter. I currently go to FIU (Florida International University) and still have two years of schooling left. Recently I was emailed about UCF (University of Central Florida) having a web developer boot camp. It's a 6 month course and teaches all the current web technologies. They also have companies on board as potential employers and they do a rigorous interview prep as part of their course. The course is $9500 and I would need a cosigner to be approved for the loan due to my low credit score.

I am looking at the bootcamp as a way to get me into industry and get me a livable wage. I see it as something that would allow me to avoid taking anymore student loans since I would potentially make enough to cover my classes on my own, even if I had to go to school part time. 

I'm wondering if my thought process is on the right track or I should keep going to school for another year until I get more experience and then try to get a job or internship. Also, maybe I am not thinking about other options I have available to me, suggestions are appreciated."

Everyone says to apply for internships, even if you are a freshman, but I have almost nothing besides a few clubs and classes to put on my resume. While my first semester is kind of empty, I have a lot of more impressive things that I will be doing next semester (assisting with research) that will increase the likelihood of scoring an internship. 

Should I wait until next semester when I begin researching and start more advanced classes to apply for internships? Or should I be applying now?

Also another question I have is could I apply for an internship this semester, and then apply again next semester? Would this be considered alright or will I get blacklisted from the company?
Any responses would be much appreciated.

Edit: Ok, judging from the sarcastic comments and people telling me to calm down, let me clarify *why* I am applying to internships as a freshman. I am looking for internships not because I feel the need to do so to stay competitive, I am looking for internships because I would rather crush my left testicle than work at Walmart for one more goddamn summer. I want to get the experience and better myself not to stay competitive, but because I am passionate about learning about computer science and engineering and there is nothing else I would rather be doing with my summer. Hope that clears things up :) "
5bpapb,25,2016-11-07,"I want the hard truth, no bs explanation of how much school prestige matters.",_Converge_,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5bpapb/i_want_the_hard_truth_no_bs_explanation_of_how/,"I have asked this question many times, but I have not once gotten what I feel is an *honest* answer from people. I'm a CS undergrad at a state party school with almost no research opportunities. I came here because people told me prestige didn't matter, and that it was the smarter economic choice. I want to get a PhD and do research, and people giving vague answers is not helping me at all.

So, first of all, if school prestige didn't matter, why would people want to go to prestigious schools? The usual answer I get is ""because there are better networking opportunities."" 

But you know what? Top tech companies *obviously* are more likely to hire people from top schools than people from weak schools. 

Is anyone honestly going to sit here and lie to my face by saying that I have just as good a shot at getting into a top grad school as someone from MIT? 

The *automatic* assumption about a person who goes to MIT is that they are more intelligent than me, which is why they are at MIT and I'm not. No one will honestly acknowledge that. How often do you read about studies done by Harvard? How often is it assumed that someone who goes to Harvard is automatically superior to people at random state schools. It happens *literally* all the time.

If you go to MIT, or Caltech, or Stanford, *obviously* you have access to significantly more research opportunities, significantly more impactful letters of recommendation from faculty and research advisors, significantly more recruiting from top companies, and a significantly better reputation by default.

So how can anyone tell me that simply working hard is enough to get me into a top PhD program? Professors at my school tell me that the reason they chose to teach at this school was because they *didn't* want to do research. The best I can hope for is to be accepted to REUs, which would have no reason to accept me since I have no research experience to begin with. And then even if I get great grades, a person from a better school with lower grades would still get more respect because its assumed their curriculum was harder.

And I'm expected to somehow compete with people at top schools, getting **consistent *high impact* research experience**, with top professors in their fields?

I genuinely feel that not going to a strong school is an *extreme* disadvantage. Its not just a situation where you have to ""work a little harder"" to make yourself stand out. From my current position, it seems that it will be very hard for me to get to where I want to go, while my friends at better schools tell me every day how much research experience they are getting working at internships with top professors that guarantee them good LORs.

So can someone please just be honest about this actually being the case, or tear apart my perception of the situation completely. I just don't want to waste my time thinking that trying hard will be enough, when the reality is that this path just isn't really open to me the way it is for others."

I've received offers for an internship at JP Morgan in Chicago and at MathWorks in Natick, MA (outskirts of Boston).  And, I've been having a lot of trouble trying to decide between the two.

The MathWorks internship is 12 weeks, compared to JPMC's 10 week program, but their overall value by compensation turns out to be about the same after the internship is over (separated by a couple hundred dollars).

On one hand, I'd like to live and work in downtown Chicago at a large corporation because there'd be plenty of things to do.  But, MathWorks is more of an engineering company so I'd meet more like-minded individuals that not only love programming, but also math, algorithms, and theory.

Does anybody have any past experience with either company (internship or full-time)?  Should I make my decision based on city  (and where I want to live in the future) or what I'd be doing there?  I'd pretty much be guaranteed to make more money at JPMC when I graduate, but I don't know if I'd be doing exactly what I want.  I guess what I'm most afraid of is that I choose JPMC because of the city and pay, but I end up doing lame web development and CRUD operations instead of algorithms, data structures, and math.  If I could guarantee that I'd be doing exactly what I want (graphics programming, machine learning, the above mentioned, or security), I'd choose JPMC in a heartbeat, but I have no idea what other peoples' experiences were with them.

- Which has more prestige in the CS world?
- Where will I learn the most?
- Is considering the salary a bad thing to do in this scenario? (salary is difference of 10k a year in favor of JPMC)
- Is living in downtown Boston and commuting to Natick by train every day an option or is that kind of weird/far?

I'm sure at least one of you has been in my situation before; what did you decide on?  And if you haven't been in my scenario before, any advice you could give is very much appreciated.  My goal when I graduate is to end up on the west coast (preferably Silicon Valley) in a top 4 company, so I'm looking for the internship that could best prepare me for the future.  If you could even give advice on whether or not you think one city is hands down a better place to live in, that'd be very much appreciated.

By the way, I'll be graduating in the following Spring after I complete the internship, so this internship is important to decide where I wanna be in the future.

I interned at a fairly well established company for the summer. They are based in SF and the job profile was **Full-stack**. They gave me a return offer:

- ~125k
- 10k signing bonus

I've heard one should always negotiate, is that true? Should I be content with the offer or try up the base/signing? Also, I'm an international student (I don't know whether that's relevant or not). I've stopped applying to other companies and am fairly sure I want to join this one, the **deadline to accept the offer is in 3 days**.

I started out in engineering so I have 20+ engineering credits and around 50+ gen ed and math credits. I started taking some psych courses this semester. I really do not want to finish my engineering degree (looking at 4 more semesters of classes I don't care about or expect to use).

I talked with one of my school's career counselors and she suggested getting an interdisciplinary degree with engineering as my main concentration and math and psychology as my second and third concentrations. Doing this would allow me to graduate in three more semesters.

My other option is to transfer to another school and pursue a full Human Factors degree there. This would be financially difficult and would put me in school for at least two, if not three, more years (i.e. 5 to 7 semesters).

My concern is that employers will not take an interdisciplinary degree as seriously. I do have five human factors engineering internships on my resume, so that should help some, but I don't know if it's enough to risk getting this kind of a degree.

What thoughts do you have? If you are an employer, would you be willing to consider someone with an interdisciplinary degree?

But how much of the skillset you have, by the time you graduate, will be self-taught? Did you guys have to learn programming languages, for example, on your own time, which ended up being crucial for career prospects / graduate school? Are there any other skills that you learned (and needed) in a similar fashion?

Basically, what I want to say is, can I rely on my school's academics to provide me with all the skills and resources needed for career success, or is there a fair bit I must do of my own accord, beyond what is usually stated (e.g. internships, research). 

If there is a lot of skills I'll have to learn on my own, I should really cut down on my gaming..."

First time poster, but long time lurker on many of the programming/ cs-related subs around here. 

#A Little Background:

I am graduating this May and have worked in development positions the last two years. My grades are generally good and more importantly, I pursue my own projects outside of school, which I think is invaluable. 

I worked as sort of a backend dev (mainly scripting in Powershell and building DBs) as a Sophomore/Junior, and then got a full-stack development internship last summer that went well enough to get a job offer. I ended up turning the job offer down since I am trying to move to the PNW (Seattle suburbs or Portland) and wanted to to minimize the distractions during my senior year. I am trying to move towards the end of the summer to give myself a break to recharge/ finish up a few personal projects (and hopefully contribute more to open-source), but I am flexible. 

So far I have applied to a couple larger companies that had level 1 developer/ analyst positions listed on their career sites, but I haven't really gained any traction. I put my name into the Microsoft student feeder program thing, but am skeptical about that too. I have been contacted by Amazon since I applied last year, but I do not plan on pursuing it.

#My questions:

What is the best way to approach tech companies in the west? Is there a good avenue for discussion or should I just try to message people on Linkedin? How does it look seeing an internship on a resume that didn't result in a job? Will this be a deterrent?
How would it look to take 3 months off after school instead of jumping right into a job? Are there popular hiring periods in the year?

I have one connection to reach out to, and I will be pursuing them, but is there a better way to start? 


**Appreciate any help.**"

I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but I'm hoping that I get placed on a team that doesn't deal with low level stuff.

So recently I have been interviewing with several companies, and I managed to get an offer from one. This company is not a tech company, but they are a very big name in the financial world. The compensation is slightly above average and the environment seems fun. They also happen to be located in my city, so I wouldn't need to search for housing, and it's an easy commute.

My general plan has been to accept this internship if I don't get an offer from a unicorn I have been interviewing with. I did my main technical interviews with the unicorn, and had planned to either accept or decline the other offer depending on how the unicorn responded. 

Today, the unicorn told me I did really well, and all my interviewers recommended me, but that I was just slightly below the mark. However, due to how close I was, I was offered another interview. This is great, and means I just need to try a bit harder, but it somewhat throws a wrench into my plans. As there is another phase after the technical interview, as well as having to deal with extra scheduling time, learning whether or not I get the unicorn will take longer than I expected.

The offer I have has no explicit deadline, but I don't think they'd be willing to wait until nearly early December for a decision from me. At the same time, that's more or less how long I'm thinking the unicorn's total process will take (due to Thanksgiving + scheduling). I'm not really sure what I should do. I've been told I should just accept the offer I have, and then tell them I'm no longer available if I get the unicorn. But that seems really unethical. Is that really a course of action I can take, with no repercussions?

I'm just so unsure of what to do. I need to have an internship this Summer, but the unicorn is actually my end goal. Any advice on how to navigate the situation? "

This brings me to my question. I have been thinking of getting my masters and have decided that I will stay in Software Engineering rather than continue with Computer Engineering (wanted a career that was more relevant to computer engineering before graduation). Would you guys suggest an online Master's program or one from my local University, University of Nebraska? Which programs would you suggest for an individual with limited coursework related to Software Engineering?

While I am happy with my company right now and am hopeful for a decent raise to come with the promotion, I want to start thinking about the future. I would like to go further. In order to get this promotion I joined a cross functional team to offer ideas and implement solutions for improving productivity and volunteered to take on additional tasks through that group. That got me noticed by the manager and scrum master. I have been nominated to take additional training as well, will be going to NFJS in Denver :) Getting an offer from a previous manager helped get me the promotion as well. What I would like to know now is what can I expect as a Software Engineer level 2? Also does the label really make a difference to a hiring manager outside of my current company? I will have been a level 1 for 8 months when getting the promotion, will that affect their expectation? What can I do to prepare myself and make myself look even better? Any resources that you guys suggest?

Also seeing that most of the folks here are advocating for the big 4, I'd like to know what are my chances into getting in one of these companies in the future? Should I be participating in hackatons?

I want to build up a portfolio of ""stuff"" but I have no idea how to get started. 

My question is: 

1. Is now a good time to even consider internships or should I focus solely on my education? 

2. There a ton of different fields in CS, and I have no idea how to even begin to figure out what I want to go into. Where do I begin my research? 
 
3. I would like to take a variety of courses to figure out what I want to do -- what different courses are recommended to get a better understanding of what there is?

4. I want to network with other people in the similar field. Are there communities or outlets I should check out to meet up and socialize with beginners like me as well as expertise in the field?

Out of curiosity, I asked the third party company who performed my background check for a copy even though I know I passed. It turns out there was a discrepancy, because the agency I used for one of the temporary contract positions I had in the past had no job title for my work and couldn't verify. I specified on the background check form that the payroll title might differ, but it came back with a discrepancy anyway. Now I have a new background check for a separate offer, and I don't want to fail.

My resume job title is ""Independent IT Consultant"" for three of these temporary positions, which is a factually correct descriptor, but will it appear inflated given that the background check showed I was making $11.50/hr? I never gave salary info to this new company I have my offer from. What's the best thing to do this next time I fill out a background check form?"

While stocks and finance interest me, I think I would fit in culturally better in Silicon Valley or Seattle, but it's tough saying no to a wall street offer especially since I don't have any other offers from internship searching this fall. Would working on wall street set me up well for finding a full time job next year? I want to work full time in California or Washington over NYC.

I was a retard in High school, so I had to take remedial courses. I also transferred college very late so not all my credits were transferred and I switched majors computer engineering to computer science. I was also focusing on my Youtube channel/gaming so I failed some classes. 

Basically, right now I'm taking 5 courses and I'm doing fairy well in all of them. But, the problem is I got no experience, except for one of the classes I'm taking right now. We have a group project consisting of QA, Backbone, Graphics, and Specs with about 5 people on each team, we have to make a game that resembles Space Invaders. I guess that's the only experience I have.   

I recently lost interest(I still like it, but I'm not addicted anymore) in gaming, so I can fully focus on programming now, but is it easy for me to get an internship or experience before graduating next year? I can probably do some side projects, but I'll hopefully have at least 1 internship before I graduate. After I graduate would I be in a bad position for applying for real jobs? or am I fucked if I somehow get declined on every internship?"

At the end of the second year (and failing Accounting 1A twice), I decided Accounting was just not for me. I looked into Computer Science and found out that it was something that I understood and can work out.
Starting my 3rd year, I have been trying to repair my GPA and have taken myself fairly seriously in restarting my education. I am currently taking some intro/intermediate programming courses in C++ and Java and retaking some classes that I failed on the side.
I want to transfer to a UC or CSU and I know I have a long way before I can even think about applying.
However, I feel a bit lost in how I should proceed with this path. I would like to get some work experience in a relative field (even something as simple as cellphone repair) or perhaps an internship.
I want to build up a portfolio of ""stuff"" but I have no idea how to get started.

My question is:

1. Is now a good time to even consider internships or should I focus solely on my education?

2. There a ton of different fields in CS, and I have no idea how to even begin to figure out what I want to go into. Where do I begin my research?

3. I would like to take a variety of courses to figure out what I want to do -- what different courses are recommended to get a better understanding of what there is?

4. I want to network with other people in the similar field. Are there communities or outlets I should check out to meet up and socialize with beginners like me as well as expertise in the field?

5. Do you have any other recommendations/opinions/ideas that I could benefit from?

The only other career I could see myself in is programming. I have *some* background in the field -- I've played around with HTML/CSS along with python and java in the past (and we're talking &gt; 6 years ago). I enjoyed it a lot, but sadly I got sucked into the pre-med ""philosophy"" in my Undergraduate studies, so I majored in Psychology + Biology...and boy do I regret doing that.  
-------------  
My Options:  
--&gt; **First Option:** Start an associate's degree/computer science certificate in Spring 2017 (deadlines for these approaching this week!), try to get a programming internship in the Summer of 2017, and then complete the associates degree/computer science certificate in Fall of 2017. The goal after that, of course, get a junior level job. **The only problem:** I'm not sure if I'll be eligible for FAFSA -- I haven't made enough money from my crappy job working in the Emergency Department to pay for this endeavor.  
--&gt; **Second Option:** Do a bootcamp. I'm pretty sure I'll need a 0 to 60 bootcamp as opposed to a 20 - x bootcamp like HackReactor. Doing a bootcamp will allow me to gain the skills necessary to code in 3-4 months and *hopefully* get a job making $70k-75k (?) **The problems:** I'm not sure if there's a lot of upward mobility with NOT having a CS degree and only having a bootcamp certificate. At some point, I would like to get a Masters in CS or possibly an MBA if I choose to go that route, the former of which requires at the very least an associates. Additionally, I have no idea how to fund a &gt;$10k bootcamp. Lastly, I live on the east coast, and most of the top bootcamps are on the west coast..moving for 3-4 months would add an additional $10k to this option.  
--&gt; **Third Option:** I go through with medicine, hate my life, and commit suicide as I'll be in well over $200k debt that I'll be unwilling to pay for. **The problem:** I don't get to live!!!

To get the job, I need to pass the traditional software engineering interview (CTCI style) and am looking for the best resources to help me study.

I have a mixed background in CS - did a math major in college, took some computer science courses, did one internship, and have done an internal training program for coding. I also completed what I felt the challenging problems and sections from this intro course. In short, I feel I have a decent grasp of the basics and would not call myself a beginner, but I definitely have some holes and areas for improvement in my data structures and algorithms knowledge, which is what I am hoping to get advice from you all about.

- I strongly prefer written resources over any videos
- I want the resource to be in python
- I want there to be attack-able modules, meaning not too much at once covering the major data structures and algorithms one at a time 
- I want practice problems with solutions to be with the accompanying modules - so, for example if the section of the book is on lists, problems just on lists. Cracking the Coding Interview does an ok job at this, but there are some slight differences with Java Arrays, Hash tables, etc than with Python lists and dictionaries. Since I've been learning Python and can interview in that, I'd prefer to stick with it if I can.

For conceptual material, I love this book - it's really friendly, modules are a good size, but the thing that's missing here is a good, meaty set of practice problems!

In addition to a resource recommendation, if anyone is reading this and feel they are at a similar skill level to me (and in the NYC area), please do reach out as I'm also looking for a study partner (or several) as that makes these sorts of things much more fun and meaningful.

5cbhzu,27,2016-11-10,I'm tired of crying about the past. Recently Diagnosed.,sassyslut69,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5cbhzu/im_tired_of_crying_about_the_past_recently/,"I just cried for 2 hours straight today. I'm 23F and was diagnosed recently. I'd like to rant a little now if that's ok. 


I was that girl everyone said would succeed. I was one of the only girls in my business school to be accepted into a program that fast tracked you to Wall St. I had leadership roles where I stood in front of lectures and taught people things. I wrote for the school newspaper. I was sassy. I was fun. Everyone thought I had it all. I thought so too. 


Everything started to fall apart my senior year. I was juggling courses with an internship and a job. Energy drinks were my water. I started to notice I was getting crazier every weekend and caring less about my future. More cocaine. More molly. More sex. Lots of sex. All of my friends were applying to jobs and I wasn't. I couldn't. My bosses started to notice I've been skipping meetings and duties. I started to avoid them. My room was a disgusting mess (always had this problem but it was unlivable this time). I got a D in a course for skipping too many classes. I never get bad grades. I spiraled. I started to wonder what was wrong. 



Looking back it makes sense. I've always felt like I was more..childish than others? Always living in the moment. Never thought about the future. I would lose my phone every couple months. My mom never gave me her purse as a child because I would always lose them. I don't remember my childhood though. I don't remember lots of things. Thought I was developing early Alzheimers. I would blurt things at inappropriate times. I spent money recklessly. I procrastinated every single essay/assignment until the very last minute. I couldn't retain information in lecture if I wasn't interested. Doodled a lot. Day dreamed a lot. A guy once told me I was ""the dumbest smart girl"" he ever met. I was unpredictable. I could throw temper tantrums at friends, boyfriends, strangers. I was always known as the ""crazy"" friend. I had the crazy stories, the crazy adventures. I was always a little too loud, too silly. Too intense. I needed to have all the fun. All the stimulation. I was most miserable when I had to be alone in my room with my thoughts. So many thoughts. No direction. 



I was burnt out. My brain snapped. I ended senior year without a job. I fell into a deep depression where I couldn't get out of my bed for 5 months. I didn't understand life anymore. I didn't understand why I didn't have a job like all my friends. I thought I was supposed to be the smart, ambitious one. I still couldn't fill out a job application. Maybe I'm actually dumb and can't adult. Why was adulting so hard? Am I just a worthless lazy fuck? I turned to booze and boyfriends to distract me. I then mustered up any energy I had left to get a job. Then got fired a couple months later. W.T.F.



That's when I realized I must be missing something. Life shouldn't be this hard. I booked an appointment with a psychiatrist and told him to fucking help me please. I was diagnosed. I was in denial. I was given Adderall. 



Meds. Who knew. Immediately something had changed. I felt.....calm. content. quiet. (That's how I felt on cocaine. I knew my reaction to coke wasn't normal). I could sit down and just fucking be. I don't fidget in my seat. I don't feel the need to do something fun. I cleaned my room. I applied to jobs. It no longer takes all my energy to do basic tasks. I could see clearly. I can regulate my volatile and unpredictable emotions. A weight has been lifted. Life feels real. I feel like an adult. 



This week has been strange. It's crazy to think that what I thought was my personality is actually due in large part to lack of dopamine. I'm having an identity crisis. I'm sad that I wasn't treated earlier. I'm sad that I suffered from depression and low self esteem. I'm sad for the girl I could have been.



But now I know how strong I am. I knew I could be better. This wasn't how my story was going to end. I'm thankful there is a solution to my brain and I'm ready to fight back with a vengeance. Happy tears now.

Three of these are software positions, with the fourth being the director of a rather large club at my school.


What I'm trying to decide is what will be the next thing I bump off my resume (to make room for a fourth tech internship) to keep it down to 1 page. My first option is to bump the directorship and list 4 tech jobs. The second option is to bump off a full-stack position I had nearly two years ago. I'm not really planning on becoming a full-stack developer full time, so I'm not sure if this position is actually valuable for any of my future applications.

I figure more tech-based work experience is always good, but the leadership experience provides more diversity to my resume and a better talking point in an interview.

Any opinions on what I should do?"

I'm pretty happy with that - it seems pretty fun, and it'll be the first big-name booster on my resume.

My original plan was to do the internship and then finish my degree in the fall (I'd only need one semester after this upcoming summer in order to complete my CS degree). However, recently Microsoft offered a fall internship to me. If I took it, I'd end up doing both internships pretty much back to back, and then return to school in the spring and complete my degree.

The problem is, I'm not really sure that's a wise choice. There are certain classes that my college only offers in the fall that I was looking forward to taking. Additionally, taking Microsoft's fall internship means I lose a semester, as otherwise I could be graduating by December. So I'm pretty torn at this point.

Are there any others who have been faced with the decision of whether to do back-to-back internships or just graduate early? What would you do in my position and why?"

We support a comparatively large finance and marketing department, who, with the exception of a few, see nothing but their own greatness. We have one user who is a semi important director ($SID) and, from what I am being told by my peers, constantly will walk through IT and try to start conversations about firewalls, IoT, and stuff that he clearly doesn't understand. Essentially he thinks everyone in IT is his best friend because they let him talk so that he goes away. Recently, he put in a ticket about ""laptop not functioning properly"". I send him an IM asking what the issue is and he said to just come to his office, as it would be ""easier to show me"". Away I went..

&gt;$Me ""Hello $SID, I saw your ticket about your laptop. What seems to be the issue with it?""

&gt;$SID ""Last week I was on important business trip doing important things and my computer wouldn't come up. It just stayed black. I can't have that happen to me.""

&gt;$Me ""That doesn't sound good. Has it been doing that before or is this the first time?

&gt;$SID ""This is the first time. I'd have called you guys if it happened a lot, I can't have that. I need my laptop to work.""

&gt;$Me ""Understandable. Well if this is the first time it could have been a fluke. I can run some diagnostics on it and check your hardware if you'd like.""

&gt;$SID ""Nah, I think I need a new one. Can you make that happen?""

&gt;$Me ""Before that I wouldn't mind taking a look at this one, if it is having issues we should try and fix it.""

&gt;$SID ""I can't be without my laptop right now. Can't you just build me a new one? I know $OtherDirector just got 
one.""

&gt;$Me ""I can check the lease on your laptop (We lease all our equipment from Dell) and see about getting you a new one a bit early if yours be up soon.""

&gt;$SID ""I think you can make it happen now. I'll go talk to $MyBoss about it, I'm sure he'll take care of me.""

&gt;$Me ""I'll go talk to him after we are done here and see what he would like me to do.""

&gt;$SID ""Yeah, do that. I can go get $GlobalITDirector and $DBAdmin, they know me, they'll hook it up. You'll be getting me a new laptop by tomorrow."" 

&gt;$Me ""Okay.. Sounds good""

I go back towards my desk and stop by my bosses desk. The conversation went as follows:

&gt;$Me ""Hey $Boss, quick question. $SID wants a new laptop, and he went on for a while about how he was going to talk to you and $GlobalITDirector and $DBAdmin because you guys would hook it up for him.. Is this anything I need to worry about?""

&gt;$Boss ""No.. not at all. He think's he's sweet.. He's not. If he asks again send him to me, and do not give him a new laptop until his lease is up.""

I'm working on a project for my internship, I've been given a data set that I worked up into an excel spreadsheet of about 400 rows and 15 columns. I want to make a program/app that will let my employer easily get info on rows that match parameters they put in. From what I've googled SQL sounds perfect for this, and I've already learned the basics of the language, but I'm not sure how to go about actually working that into a usable program. From what I've read about MySQL (which was really interesting and I want to learn more about it when I'm on less of a time crunch) I get the idea the database is only accessible through a website? If thats the case, what would be the best way to go about making this application offline? Would I be better off just making something with Java or Python (the only languages I know, if theres a better option, I would gladly learn another if that's what it takes to get this done)? 

Any advice is appreciated, I'm afraid this is a really ambitious project for someone who is barely a beginner, but I tend to learn best when I throw myself into the deep end. Thanks!"
5cfldu,24,2016-11-11,MongoDB or Microsoft for a summer internship in software engineering?,dsioa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cfldu/mongodb_or_microsoft_for_a_summer_internship_in/,"Hey everyone,

Trying to make some tough decisions and would appreciate guidance if you have any: I have offers from both MongoDB (NYC) and Microsoft (Redmond) to work as a software engineering intern for the summer between my junior and senior year.


Below is some information about each of my offers.

**MongoDB:**

 * Working in Times Square, NY office (HQ)

 * Free Housing in NYU dorms

 * Smaller company perhaps provides more interesting work

 * (Seemingly) more selective internship program

 * (Hopefully) server or cloud team


**Microsoft:**

* Working in Redmond, WA office (HQ)

* Free corporate housing in nearby apartment

* Slightly higher pay (+$5/hr)

* Huge name brand which could help on my resume

* SQL Server team


Last year, I worked at big-name financial data company in NYC. Coming from a large company, I feel that Microsoft might be a similar experience. However, a summer in the Seattle area would be a ton of fun, and the Microsoft name could be a huge help on my resume. Furthermore, the SQL Server team seems to be pretty legit. (If anyone knows anything about this team, that'd be amazing!)

I'm not 100% sure about the future of MongoDB, especially when most tech companies prefer to use PostgreSQL, Cassandra, HBase, etc. depending on the problem. At the same time, I *loved* the culture at MongoDB, and it's somewhere I'd love to go to full-time when I graduate. (They hinted that they mainly hire new-grads from their intern class.) 

Because of these reasons, I'm really conflicted about which company to go to. Has anyone interned at either of these companies, and could give me any advice? (Or even if you haven't, I'd love your opinion.)

Thanks so much guys!"

I was very sure about this until the end of my junior year/beginning of senior year. As a result of these plans, my undergraduate degree is in English. I was going to do a MIT program to get my certification, but I have no desire to do teach and definitely do not want to spend two more years and $20k+ on a MA degree I don't even want.

I used my elective slots this quarter for English ed classes and absolutely hate them. Even if I were to be accepted into the MIT program, I don't think I would be a good teacher, at least at this point in my life.

All of my extracurricular experiences have to do with working with high school kids: observing classrooms, some tutoring, and helping out with campus events catered to secondary students. None of this experience is prolonged, either. I did not have a chance to build good relationships with mentors given that all of my volunteer experiences were for separate events.


Outside of school, my only work experience is in food service. With the exception of my freshman year, I only worked consistent jobs during the summer to save for school. During the school year I primarily focused on keeping good grades to obtain and keep scholarships.


On a more positive note, I only need two more classes for my major and 16 credits to graduate. I have 20 credits (4 classes) I could fill with electives. 


For the remainder of the school year, my options are: 

1. Take the minimum full-time credits Winter and Spring quarter and focus on getting a relevant job or internship.

2. Chose a minor, but not have much time to look for/work a relevant job.

3. Take 16+ credits Winter quarter and be done with school in March.

** I have a scholarship that will pay 100% of my tuition under the condition I keep a 3.5+ in every class. I cannot afford to slack off in any classes if I want to stay in school through Spring quarter. I have $20k in loans and was hoping to stay through Spring quarter to keep them deferred while I am on my lease in my college town. 




I'm very worried about job prospects given my degree and lack of experience.

 If anyone has advice to push me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it!

I’m a MBA graduate, Eagle Scout, UCLA Alumni, Entrepreneur and was even a Manager at an international engineering and manufacturing company for the Oil &amp; Gas Industry. I graduated my MBA with honors, worked full-time on multi-million dollar projects and have vast experience in multiple industries (Oil &amp; Gas, Energy, Education, Municipality, Fast-Food, Sports, and Entertainment). To some, my background and qualifications may be impressive, to others, it may seem monotonous, or even mediocre. However, a couple months ago, I was unemployed, lost, depressed...and couldn't get a single interview, no matter what I did. 

I’m writing this entry as an informative piece, only to share my experience of being unemployed and the journey I took before I was offered the opportunity to work for literally the best company I have ever had the privilege to work for. The information I am about to share is something that I see everyone can benefit from, regardless of their background. I feel that everyone can learn through my experience, and it would be selfish if I didn’t share this. Now please note, I am not the best writer in the world, but I will do my best to be as clear and informative as I can. Also, the information I am about to share, I believe is most applicable to those looking for their first or second, full-time or even part-time job(s). 

Background of Looking for a New Job:

Like many new graduates coming out of college, I had no idea really what I wanted to make a career out of. I graduated with a BA in economics and MBA, with an emphasis in Management. I am both a UCR and UCLA alumni. When it was time to look for my first full-time job, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were not many opportunities within finance (the industry I was most interested in), and therefore I had to apply to elsewhere.

My first full-time job was working for a small, international engineering and manufacturing company that specialized in skid mounted power generation and process systems for the Oil &amp; Gas industry. I applied to this company through my university’s career website and I accepted an entry level position with this company as a “Sales and Marketing Administrator.” Being “fresh out of college,” I was looking for an opportunity where I could gain new knowledge and skills that would contribute to my overall growth and development as a professional. This company seemed to be a great fit. 

However, long story short, I worked at this company for about two years. During my employment there, I was working 70 - 100 hour weeks while I was on salary (meaning I did not make any extra money for the extra hours I worked). Given my average hours worked per week and salary paid, I was able to calculate that I was making less than the minimum wage per hour (this is with a MBA degree). I was literally working every day on a low salary, even on weekends. I was working so much, the company ended up giving me my own personal key so I can access the offices anytime I needed to. I invested all my time and energy in this company, only to find out that there was no real future for me there. This was a small business, and I was able to realize that the owners of the company had their own agenda which was not beneficial to my future. I can go on and on about the many reasons why I had to leave, but that is not the point of this piece. The point of this, is to share my experience of finding my next job and the lessons I learned. 

The Beginning of my Job Search

Feeling pressured into getting a new job, I decided to create an updated resume, which I could use to apply to any job postings that I saw myself as a good fit. Even though my preference was to find a finance related job, I thought that the more jobs I apply to, the greater the probability of me getting an interview - my main goal was to just find a new company to work for. Therefore, towards the last three months of my employment at this engineering and manufacturing company, I decided to submit myself to all and any postings that I could on Monster.com, Indeed.com and LinkedIn. 

One week went by, two weeks, three weeks, 1 month, and I still had no interview opportunities. By the time one month passed, I probably had applied to over 500 job postings. I was appalled that someone with my background and experience couldn’t even get one single interview offer. It wasn’t until I saw one of my friends from my MBA program post up a link on Facebook to a job description that their company was currently hiring for. This was for a Financial Analyst Position at a multi-billion dollar company (will not name for confidentiality purposes). However, I reached out to my friend, submitted my resume, and got a phone interview within a week.

For the next two months, I went through 6 interviews. I met with HR managers, department managers, team members, and had multiple on-site visits where I learned about business operations and how my role would tie in. Interviews seemed to be going great and I even learned from my friend that the Interviewers were very impressed with my candidacy. After two months of interviewing, I finally got a call from HR to discuss compensation for the role. They knew what I was currently getting paid (at the engineering and manufacturing company) and they informed me that the position I was applying for had a salary cap just below my current pay. I told them that this was completely acceptable to me (since it was moving me into a finance role) and I would happily accept any offer as I was more excited to become part of the company. They were glad to hear that the compensation was acceptable and told me that their decision would be made within a couple of days. I felt very hopeful as they were saying extremely nice things and it sounded like they were putting together an official offer for me. 

At this time, I decided to start working on my resignation letter to my current employer. This was not a simple task, but the words were somehow easily transcribed from my brain to my paper. I had this letter ready and was just awaiting for the official job offer before submitting it to my supervisor. 

I remember that everyday that went by, felt like a week. It took three days (three of the longest days of my life), before I heard back. On this third day, the company I spent two months interviewing for, finally sent me an email which I was expecting to see an attachment of an offer letter. However, it was the complete opposite. Instead, they sent a four sentence, generic paragraph basically saying that they have decided to no longer consider my candidacy for this position, my resume will stay on file, blah, blah and blah. I would have included the full email in this posting so you can read what rejection feels like, but there was a disclaimer in it that prohibits me from sharing it. Regardless, I was in shock and instantly felt like I just wasted two months of my life interviewing for this position. 

During the next week, I fell into a state of depression. This was a completely new experience for me as I am typically an optimist and don’t let things like this affect me. However, this hit me, and it hit hard. I became very anti-social, quiet, and felt like breaking down because I put all my eggs in one basket, and it didn’t pan out for me. This was the first time that I experienced rejection on something that I thought would completely play out in my favor. Knowing that I didn’t have an offer and was still stuck being at my current employer was eating me up inside. At one point, I even broke down in front of my girlfriend, thinking that I would never be able to get a job elsewhere and that I was a complete failure. 

After a week, with the support of my girlfriend, I realized that there was no point sitting and dwelling    T&amp;D in recent weeks yearsin  . Like all other past failures in my life, I needed to learn from this experience and keep pushing forward. I knew that I needed a new strategy. Therefore, I decided to recollect my thoughts and start my job application process all over.

The Second Beginning of my Job Search

Unlike my first job, where I settled for a position because it was the best one I could get at the time, I decided to make this time around different. I decided that I was not going to settle. I did not want to risk working at another company where I would find myself in the same position two years down the line. Therefore, I set myself some strict guidelines for my new job application strategy. These included, but were not limited to:

New Employer must:
-Be in the finance industry/or the role has to be finance related
-Be a larger business (at least 500 M in revenue/year and making a profit for the past 5 years)
-Have a company culture that is innovative and appreciative
-Value autonomy and teamwork
-Be within commuting distance (&gt;50 Miles)
-Have good management
-Provide growth opportunities to its employees
-Have low turnover rate
-Have at least above a 3 star glassdoor rating or above

I admit, these may not the best guidelines in the world, but they were a start and specifically geared towards what I was looking for in my next employer. From my first full-time employer, I learned a lot of things that I did not want, but that list is too long and extensive to include. Therefore, I only focused on my must-haves. 

I can go into great details of how I came to develop my new strategy of getting an interview, but I think it is best to explain the “Roadmap” that I created through my extensive research, countless trial, and error. 

Tips to Getting an Interview:

Please keep in mind that the nine (9) tips below are something that I created as a guideline for my job application process. The combination of these nine (9) items allowed me to lock eight (8) different interviews within two (2) weeks with companies that fit my job search criteria. I believe if these tips are taken seriously and then anyone can be successful in also getting an interview with their potential dream job(s). 

1. Create your perfect job criteria

Take the time the time to create your ideal job. Put a list together of your “must haves” and think about both your short-term and long-term goals. For example, personally I wanted a career in Finance. Therefore, one of my must-haves was to stay focused within the finance industry or finance roles. I found that it would be easy to also consider other roles, but I stayed true to the type of positions I was looking for - all finance related (finance associate, financial analyst, etc.). By having my list, I was able to use that as a reference when reading job descriptions and deciding whether or not to take the time to apply to them. 

2. Have a great resume(s)

Make sure that your resume is job specific and not generic. I learned that making a resume that is customized to match a job posting has a much greater success rate than just making one resume to submit to all job postings. Therefore, don’t be lazy, and take the time to revamp your resume to better fit a job description. This includes incorporating keywords from the job description(s) and have them match those in your resume from past work experience, making sure your experience falls in line with the role you are applying for, and keeping it to a single page length.

3. Create a dedicated email address

This is important when applying because you will be getting a lot of emails throughout your job search. It is crucial to keep your job application emails separated from your personal ones, so I found it most useful to use a dedicated email address. Make sure this email is professional - easiest to use your name in some manner (tied with a number or middle initial). Your email should not be deemed as unprofessional as this may negatively affect the way companies perceive you. Remember, your image is everything when a company is considering you. You do not want to give them a reason to not consider you. 

4. Do your research

Read into the companies that you are applying for. Glassdoor.com is a great website to read employee reviews on the company and getting some insights to the company’s interview process. Don’t just apply to a random company as you may find yourself working for a company that you will not enjoy working for. Check out the actual website of the company you are applying to. Read the “About” sections and see if their mission, vision and company core values are something you can see yourself following on a daily basis. Keep true to your perfect job criteria and you will be fine. There are a lot of companies out there that fit my criteria, it was just taking the time to find them that was the hard part. 

5. Submit your resume:

Online Employment Websites - Use these sites to help find the available jobs out in the market. You can use these website to refine your job search to specific job titles and locations. These sites typically have the most recent job postings from companies is all industries. 

Indeed
Monster
CareerBuilder
SimplyHired
ZipRecruiter

Be careful when using these sites. You will see thousands of jobs on here. It is extremely easy to submit yourself to all the jobs, but remember, your time is limited and should be spent only on companies that fit your perfect job criteria. 

LinkedIn
LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network with 300 million members in over 200 countries is now posting jobs for hundreds of different companies. You will need a LinkedIn profile to access and apply (this is free - as long as you are not getting the premium accounts). This is also a great place to research people who are currently working for companies that you want to work for. You can look at their profiles (if they are public) and even see past companies that they have worked for. You can benefit from this insight and even consider those companies as possible companies to apply for (if they fit your company criteria). 

School Career Website
Every College and University should have their own career website. Make sure to take advantage of this if you are a current student. Companies will post internships, part-time and full-time jobs in the job portals of the school’s career site. If you have already graduated, then you can also pay a small alumni fee (if it’s not free) to use the site for a specified period of time. I was able to find three companies that fit my perfect job criteria and was able to get one interview out of it.

Staffing Agencies
I was speculative in using staffing agencies at first, but I was eventually able to realize the great potential of using this as another resource. The people working at these agencies have a wealth of knowledge, connections, and they will be able to provide you with other opportunities that may not even be posted on employment websites. For finance related jobs, I used the following staffing agencies:

Robert Half
Vincent Benjamin
KForce

The staffing agencies helped me to better understand the finance industry, fix my resume, practice for interviews, and find new companies that fit my perfect job criteria that I was unaware of. I was able to get two interviews from using staffing agencies. 

Friends
Don’t be too shy or ashamed to reach out to friends for help. Remember, this is your future and your life. If you know of friends that are working at great companies or have connections to other companies (that you are interested in), take initiative, and reach out to them. You never know what opportunities there may be unless you try. I was able to get two interviews through friends. I can proudly say that my current (new) employment was through a friend. 

Network
In my previous job, I was able to network with hundreds of people. I have established connections with CEOs and other top executives. Through this network, I was able to add them to my LinkedIn. I found it was extremely useful to use my LinkedIn network to reach out to my connections when applying to jobs. I was able to get connected directly with some hiring managers through my contacts on LinkedIn. My network itself contributed to getting three interviews at three well established companies (fitting my perfect job criteria).

Creative Approach(es)
When applying online, sometimes it is extremely difficult to standout. The creative approach was born out of desperate measures and happened to work out in my favor.

Go to the company in-person - In times of desperation, sometimes you are forced to do something outside of the norm. When I was in a Financial Hub (Irvine) visiting a staffing agency, I realized I was in the middle of multiple companies that fit my perfect job criteria. I recognized a company in the area that I applied for a finance position and decided to take a short walk over to their building. Since I was already dressed up (from my meeting), I walked up to the front desk and asked if I could meet with a Human Resources Manager. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful (the company had a strict visiting policy where you could not meet with anyone if you didn’t know their name). So I ended up standing outside and just waited for employees to walk out of the building. I was able to speak with five people and one of them was in the purchasing department of the company. She kindly provided me with her email address and I emailed her later that day with my resume. To my surprise, she responded back same-day and even connected me directly with the Finance Manager of the company. I scheduled an interview with them that same week.

Call them - Sometimes applying to the job is not enough. Companies get thousands of resumes everyday. Sometimes, you will need to do something that will help you stand out, like calling them first instead of waiting for them to call you. If the company you are applying for isn’t too large, then typically you can find the person you need to speak to by speaking with the receptionist. I learned this trick when I was working sales and was trying to get a hold of Purchasing Managers. If you are able to find the name of the department manager for the position you are applying for (through LinkedIn or other medias), then the receptionist of the company will typically connect you directly with them. Some sites even put their contact information on their company site. Don’t be scared to call them. I used this strategy on five companies and was able to get interviews with three of them. 

6.  Set a goal for yourself

Submit to at least 3-5 qualified jobs/day (or more!). Be diligent about this. Applying for jobs is not easy. It is very repetitive, boring, and even discouraging at times. However, do not give up. Dedicate the time you need (roughly an hour a day), and take the time to apply. You never know which application is going to pay off, but the more qualified companies you apply for, the better your chances. Also, I remember at one point I felt like I applied to all the jobs that fit my criteria. Don’t stop there. I can guarantee you that there are always jobs you are unaware of, so stay diligent and take the time to find them. 

7. Job Apps for Mobile Devices

instead of playing games, being on facebook or instagram while you are on the toilet at work, make it a habit to constantly check for new jobs that are being posted. If you’re are work, screenshot these jobs on your phone (if you are unable to apply) so you can apply for them later. (See below example). 
		
		Some of the job apps I used are:

Indeed job search
Monster.com
Glassdoor
Simply Hired
LinkedIn
Careerbuilder
Ziprecruiter

8. Career Fairs

School Career(s) Fairs - Go to your school's career fairs for your specific industry. Take advantage of these career fairs which your school puts together for you. Even if you have graduated, you can still attend as an Alumni. Make sure to print plenty of resumes (as you will need to hand them out to recruiters) and get the business cards of every company representative that you speak with. Make sure to prepare good questions to ask and think of something that will make you stand out so the recruiters can remember you. In addition, follow up with the recruiters that were kind enough to give you their business card.

Job Fairs - Cities tend to host a lot of job fairs too. I did look into these, but never actually went to them. I am posting this in my list because I would have gone if I didn’t already have interviews already. Check with your city to see what job fairs are coming up.

9. Things to Remember:

Its not instant-it will take time. Patience is key.

Do not get discouraged nor give up. Do everything you can to stay positive and use any negative energy as your fuel source to find a new job. Anytime I got discouraged, I would just get on the computer and start applying to more qualified jobs. As long as I knew I was doing everything within my power to get a new job, then I had nothing to feel discouraged about. 

Dress to impress - professionally.No matter how interviews you get, make sure to take the time to prep yourself. First impressions are everything! 

Show you have the ability to learn and demonstrate that in your resume and interview. You may come across job descriptions where you may not have some of the skills that they are looking for. If there are only a couple of these, then don’t let that discourage you from applying. Demonstrate in your resume how you had to learn a new skillset and were able to apply it quickly. If you are asked for an interview, then elaborate on that experience to show that you can learn the necessary skills required for your new job.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket - Even if you get an interview, keep applying to other companies. It is always better to have multiple offers. You can even use this for negotiation purposes later.

Don’t Settle - Know your worth. I am saying this because I personally know there are companies that will try to take advantage by squeezing an employee’s compensation to below industry average. Therefore, know what you should be getting paid for in the positions you are applying for (factoring in your experience level).



So for those interested in how these tips worked for me. Another long story short, I ended up leaving my employer at the engineering and manufacturing company once I created these nine (9) tips and invested all my time into applying these tips to my job application process. I made this risky decision, because I truly believed in what I created. This decision was the best decision I ever made as I am now working for one of the best companies in my industry. However, do what you feel is best for you. I personally know I had to take my life in my own hands and I believed in myself, so I took the risky route (I am not recommending anyone do the same, especially those supporting a family). 

That said, I can proudly say that this roadmap worked for me. I am sharing my story and my tips so those who are currently looking for a job, may hopefully benefit from them by securing new employment. Looking for a job is not fun - it actually sucks. It is time consuming, stressful, and rejection becomes a very familiar feeling. Diligence, patience, and determination are the qualities that will make someone successful when following this roadmap. If my story and tips help you with your journey to find a new job, please share your story or comment. If you find other helpful tips in your job journey, feel free to share those as well.

I wish those looking for a new job best of luck and I hope you can use this to help find your perfect job!

* I had difficulty understanding both of the people who interviewed me(Parsing heavily accented English is tough; both my parents have heavily accented English but even still..). 
* I've heard stories of firms underpaying their H1B people(I was told that the majority of them are ""consultants"", not even full time employees) and in general firms doing so don't really value the whole engineering side of things. 
* I'm a US citizen and this is only an internship so pay is less of an issue, but I really worry about how this huge h1b demographic reflects on how little the firm values great software engineering.
* This was at a tech center office of a Fortune 500 company and their main product/revenue stream isn't from software.

Are these valid concerns?

5cj9tt,6,2016-11-12,How difficult is it to get into a good masters program for CS?,slimecake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cj9tt/how_difficult_is_it_to_get_into_a_good_masters/,"I'm currently in my last semester of undergrad and I'm thinking about going to grad school for CS instead of going straight into industry. I had a couple of software engineering internships and kind of realized from those experiences that my interests are more geared towards academia. I have a good GPA (3.9 overall) from a no-name state school, but I'm worried since I didn't complete any research during undergrad. I attempted to do some research with a professor during one summer, but life happened and I had to stop. Will it be difficult for me to get into a decent school without any research experience and only industry experience?

 Not sure if this helps or is even relevant, but I did receive some significant academic awards during undergrad. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation I would be extremely grateful to get your opinion on the matter. I guess I'm just trying to see if you all think I should even bother applying to decent CS programs in my situation or if it would just be a waste of my money (for application fees) and time."

It's a pretty nice gig, good pay, and REALLY flexible hours. I mostly do RDC unlocking accounts, some server things nothing major, testing various equipment like receipt printers and USB scanners etc, shipping packages to various stores, handle calls from the stores about their tech issues and troubleshoot various problems around the office. Currently at this company there are only 5 IT people total handling the Corporate Office and the around 150 stores we have. Two months ago one of the full time members that did the same stuff as me left for another job, and since then I've really stepped up to the duty and pulled my own weight.

I have probably another year or year and a half of my B.S in Computer Information Technology, and hopefully after I graduate I could get a full time position there, or find something else.

Sorry for this slight rant, but now onto my actual question. Where do I go from here? This is mostly a desktop support job, and I like Network and System Administration quite alot actually, but I feel if I applied for a Network Admin job, I feel like i would be under qualified for most of them. So how would I go about going from a Desktop support job to a Network Admin job? Or would there have to be an in between job before I could get to a Network Admin position?

I'm a senior about to graduate with a degree in computer science in May 2017. I've been working hard on my job search and have been fortunate enough to receive a few exciting offers. One of which is to be a research associate at a very prestigious university in the US. It's a 2 year program and sounds like something that I'd be very interested in doing (big data, data analytics, visualization, etc.). The majority of my internship experience has been doing similar things so this is a job that I know I'd be comfortable with and most likely enjoy.

I still have a final, on-site interview with Bloomberg in a couple weeks and I anticipate accepting that offer if I am to receive it. If not, I really am seriously considering this research associate position.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of position? I know it won't pay as well as something like Bloomberg but is it sometimes ok to sacrifice pay for a more enjoyable/comfortable job? Will taking this position now hurt my chances of receiving an in-industry position down the line?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I have posted here before, and I need further clarification. I am considering the MSI B150m Bazooka Plus motherboard for the m.2 SSD capability, but do not want to waste money on a core i3 rx470 build. I will upgrade to a better machine in 2-3 years, so I think a functionable mobo is good enough for me. What I am worried about is the case I have picked out has 3 fans, but the mobo only has one CPU fan header and one case fan header. I live in an area where the summers do get hot, so I do not want to overheat my system. I am wondering if I can connect the fans straight to the PSU, where there will be no issue. If not, then I would need a mobo with at least 2 fan header, where I can get a fan splitter. My only concern is that will intern fry my motherboard. Thanks in advance."
5coja6,2,2016-11-13,How do employers view an academic internship compared to a corporate/non-academic one?,Venerous,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5coja6/how_do_employers_view_an_academic_internship/,"I'm a CS junior, and I received an e-mail yesterday letting me know that I had been accepted as an intern for a non-profit tech clinic sponsored by my school. The organization basically partners with other non-profits throughout our county and works to expand their technology outreach - apps, websites, software, things like that. It isn't a paid internship, but it does allow me to continue attending school during my internship, and the hours required per week isn't too demanding. I'll also be able to earn credit towards graduation, and I'll still have access to the mentor aspect of it as well.

Regardless of the answer I'll still be taking the internship offer - I have no reason not to, and my next semester is looking fairly light compared to my previous ones. I just wondered what employers thought of academic internships through universities instead of those based in the private sector. Are they of 'less' value than a standard internship through a company?"
5cpb3c,1,2016-11-13,[30+ | Intermediate Java] Humbly asking advice to start a career in the industry,RVerite,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cpb3c/30_intermediate_java_humbly_asking_advice_to/,"I've invested a substantial amount of my time in order to learn how to code properly in the last 18 months.  
For the last six months or so, I've practiced for about 50 hours/week and got a firm grasp on Java 8 syntax and (mostly) built-in classes. I've also quit my day job and got in line for a few internships, with no result.

Being a CS undergrad, at the beginning of this learning journey of mine a took my time with understanding CS concepts through C language syntax. By the time I was done with it, I had a solid base to better understand OOP and Java courses I've decided upon. Being how I've now completed core courses that cover the basics and beyond, I took interest in OO patterns, Spring MVC in particular. I've encountered some patterns before; *Design Patterns* book had helped a lot. I'm still learning from examples and at a steady pace, altough I think I'm a few months behind from tackling advanced Java/Spring assignments.

Ultimate goal of mine is to get certified with Oracle. In order to do so, I need to put my current skills to good use and earn enough experience and money. I'm willing to take my time with certification, but I need your help at this point. I'm not sure how to best pursue my career in the industry; simply, I don't know where to start and what to look for. I would like to have a good-enough portfolio and at least a couple of certificates under my belt before applying for a software development position in a company. Is there a solid way to handle some intermediate Java tasks, better my skills and earn enough to take certification exams?

- - - - 

Pinpointing some of the things I know how to do using Java:

- I can solve most (job) interview questions with little effort;

- I can understand, debug and unit-test projects other people have coded;

- I can set up a web server and know how to deal with existing APIs on the web;

- I have a working knowledge of HTML5/CSS3, and a fair measure of understanding JScript;

- I know how to manage SQL databases through SQLJ/JDBC;

- I'm proficient with Swing, heavy and lightweight components, themes also;

- I understand how lambdas and streams work;

- I understand Spring MVC basics;

- I know about version control and GIT;

- I can develop simple games that use A/V resources and design levels.

 

Any guidelines and tips greatly appreciated, thanks in advance."
5cph5d,5,2016-11-13,What's the longest period of time you'll stay at a company without a raise/promotion?,startup_burnout,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5cph5d/whats_the_longest_period_of_time_youll_stay_at_a/,"...assuming of course that you consistently deliver high quality implementations while also going ""above and beyond"" regularly?

Part of me wants to leave my current company as during my first year at my startup I've busted my ass to enhance/add features to the company's product to make it significantly more competitive without any sort of increase in equity or pay.  This is during a period of great growth of our bottom line, so it's not as if we can't afford to give raises to top performers.  I can't decide whether it's better to just start over at another company or suck it up and stick it out to the 2 year mark so that I have a slightly longer stint on my resume. 

I do enjoy the work I do at my current company (and the people as well) but I feel it's somewhat demoralizing to be a chief contributor to the company's success without any direct reward.  At my last job at a larger company raises/bonuses were much easier to come across which is somewhat ironic because I feel that I'm about 4 or 5 times more productive at my current job.

If you were in this situation, would you try to switch to a more meritocratic company?  I've only got 3 years experience (4 if you count internships) so I'm not sure how this would look on my resume long-term."
5cpjtt,28,2016-11-13,My experience on changing careers as an introvert - with tips to succeed in the workplace!,chridem,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/5cpjtt/my_experience_on_changing_careers_as_an_introvert/,"I graduated in 2013 with a Masters in International Relations and a very strong sense of foreboding.
&amp;nbsp;

After being neatly shepherded through school with expectations of good grades and absolutely no understanding at all of what I actually liked doing, I’d just finished an internship in an NGO that was supposed to be the stepping stone to a wonderful career in international development – and I realized that I didn’t like the work.
&amp;nbsp;

Sure, I liked our motto, I liked what we were saying on our website, I liked what people thought I was doing at my job.

&amp;nbsp;

But the truth was that **I dreaded going to work every day**. After interacting with my boss all day I would come home drained, with barely enough energy to watch TV and boil up some pasta.

&amp;nbsp;

So I realized I had to make a change, and long story short, today I’m an IT Business Analyst in a large financial institution where I work on e-banking and mobile banking solutions.

I feel valued by my superiors and co-workers, see concrete results to what I do and there are many career opportunities open to me – all that with great financial stability and benefits.

I have several amazing mentors who help me when I need it and give great advice. I have a strong network of friends and family. A wonderful boyfriend.

I take the time I need to take care of myself – I work out 3 times a week, read 6 books a month, am learning two new languages.

I find quiet spaces throughout the day to peacefully recharge. I have lots of energy to tackle projects that interest me. And I’m one of the only female volunteer firefighters in the city :)

&amp;nbsp;

So why am I sharing my experience with you?

Because learning to code to break into the tech world is just the first step of having a fulfilling career in your new field. Or, to be more general: getting past the gate-keeper (i.e. the job interview) is just the beginning.

As a matter of fact, where I work, at least half of the criteria applied to employees in year-end reviews are related to **soft skills**. 

&amp;nbsp;

Are you perceived as helpful and collaborative?
Are people comfortable coming to you with questions?
Can you succinctly and clearly present a topic in front of people?

&amp;nbsp;

So without further ado, here are my tips for fellow introverts to help them succeed in the workplace!

&amp;nbsp;

First (and this might sound ridiculous but bear with me), **pick your boss the way you’d pick a spouse**. 

When I work for somebody I like and respect, I could do any job and find it fulfilling and interesting. As a student, I worked in a t-shirt printing booth at a festival in France and absolutely loved it! But if I don’t feel valued and respected as a human being by my manager, I will simply not do a good job and no fancy title on my business card can change that.

&amp;nbsp;

Being able to pick out what people you work well with is also a great base to start **finding mentors**, which is my second piece of advice. To get anywhere in life and keep your ego small, you have to be a life-long learner and that means finding the right teachers. I have half a dozen of mentors who have _changed my life_ in the past three years, each in their own special way. One of those mentors is the reason I got into tech in the first place!

&amp;nbsp;

And thirdly: **know yourself**. If you know what matters to you in the workplace, you will know which job opportunity to go for and which to forgo. A method that worked for me is to go through all the jobs you’ve ever had and for each of them, jot down what you enjoyed about them and what you didn’t enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s an example based on my t-shirt printing stint:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – feeling super helpful to my boss because he didn’t speak the language of our customers and couldn’t communicate with them without me.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – standing on my feet all day and burning my fingers on the pressing machine. 

&amp;nbsp;

Or for my NGO job:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – working with books, interacting with people of different cultures and using my foreign languages.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – my boss apologizing on the phone that his “secretary” had made a mistake when he had actually made that mistake. Being called a secretary when I was a project manager. Feeling micro-managed.

&amp;nbsp;

And for my last job:
&amp;nbsp;

ENJOYED – taking a problem that the developers were stuck on and solve it because I knew the right people to ask. Making the new intern practice her English with me because she felt insecure speaking up in meetings. Brainstorm ideas to better implement Agile in our delivery unit.
&amp;nbsp;

DIDN’T ENJOY – writing down super-detailed meeting minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

By going through this mental exercise you will start identifying patterns of what works for you and what doesn’t. Everybody likes and is good at different things, you don’t have to stick with something that’s a terrible fit for your personality! 

&amp;nbsp;

I hope my experience can bring some value to fellow introvert women in the workplace! If it did or if you have any questions, **let me know in the comments** :)

I've had my eye on the Engineering Practicum internship at Google, but I'm open to Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.  Even though I'm a freshman, I think I can still show I'm more than my title.  I graduated two years early so I started college very young and I've been programming for 5-6 years.  Currently, I'm developing an app in an attempt to differentiate myself from other applicants and am hoping to have a demo in time by December.  What do you guys think I should learn and/or do and put on my resume to help my chances?  Or should I just abandon the idea of an internship this early?  Thanks for the advice!"

But I've been searching for other summer opportunities and received offers from them. Although I haven't formally accepted the other opportunity, they are very tempting. The ideal situation for me would be to stay until end of Spring semester and transition to the other internship. When should I let them know? 

I'm worried about how they might react to this, and whether they would decide to terminate current internship immediately.

I don't want them to miss the opportunity to find my replacement thinking that I am staying.

I also want to leave in very good terms with them because they have done so much for me and gave me so many opportunities to learn.

And slightly related question: is an internship that might lead to full time job better than just a summer internship? How to decide what's the best option for me? 

Thank you all in advance!"
5cs6pp,2,2016-11-13,"It feels like everything's going downhill, fast",Jamie59,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5cs6pp/it_feels_like_everythings_going_downhill_fast/,"It's hard to live when you've never known happiness, but it's even harder when you've known it and also understand it'll never return.

A year and a half ago, I was an incredible naive teenager that somehow managed to stay optimistic in incredibly crappy circumstances. Around that time, I met the girl who afterwards became my first girlfriend at a camp. It was strange; when talking to her as well as others around me, I felt (and probably was) extremely confident, charismatic and healthy whereas I was shy, introverted, and self-conscious before. We only knew each other for several short days, but everything seemed to click perfectly in place. Though our homes were separated by more than a hundred miles we tried long-distance, and everything seemed perfect. Though those days were tough like any other, it always felt like it was worth living, getting through every day to talk to her at the end of it.

a few months later, I attended an internship at a local university and found a passion in physics. I worked feverishly on a research project for two weeks, barely doing anything else. I had hope for the future; I had something I loved enough to make my career, and I had someone who I loved more than anything.

But the good things didn't last. On the last day of summer break, my girlfriend broke up with me suddenly, and vanished. As an instinctive coping mechanism, I became obsessed with making the perfect mask for myself. Though I had managed to fool even myself that I couldn't feel emotional pain, it showed up in other areas. I lost my passion for academia, and a halfhearted attempt at a relationship afterwards showed me that it seemed I had lost the ability to feel happy like I once did. Now, I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and it feels like everything's going downhill.

Every time I try to get myself out of it my head keeps reminding me that I will never be happy like I once was. I fear I've lost the ability to feel happy in the first place. I still can't feel any passion for my major field even though I'm set to go to uni to study it, and I don't think anybody would even want to befriend me much less anything more than that in and after uni. Back then, it felt like every day had a purpose, and was worth living; nowadays it feels the opposite.

Is this really the end for me?"
5cs7au,36,2016-11-13,I thought I did everything correctly,Dula91,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5cs7au/i_thought_i_did_everything_correctly/,"Well I am posting on here because I literally have no idea what to do now.  My buddy showed me a picture of someone who posted on a subreddit about looking for a new job and he got a lot of responses so I figure I have nothing to lose.

All my life I was told that to be successful you need to go to college and get good grades and then you will be able to get a good job.

I completed high school by the age of 16 and then went into college very underprepared and not really mature enough to go.  I had too easy of a time in my prior education and I did not know how to study.  I eventually learned what to do and on my way to a Major in Chemistry.  I eventually hated what I was doing and after completing 2 years worth of chemistry classes I switched my major to International Business and minored in Management.  I ended up getting into some pretty heavy legal trouble when I was 19 and 20 years old and it is something that will follow me for the rest of my life but I learned and coped with it and have pushed through it and graduated with my Bachelors of Arts in International Business with Minors in Management and Chemistry (since I already had more than enough credits why not add it to the degree).

Coming out of college the job market looked pretty bleak and didn't really have many prospects because of my background at the time.  I had zero professional experience ( I participated in no internships, i feel like my college didn't emphasize them enough) and I live in Wichita, KS where international business isn't a huge thing.  We have a predominant aviation/manufacturing industry (which I have no real desire to go into).

So what I opted to do is the one thing I knew, go back to school.  I was on felony probation, jobless, but pursuing my Master's in Business Administration.  I ended up getting off of probation and completed my Masters and had landed a job with a local oil company as an in house Landman.  The pay wasn't too great but there were a ton of fringe benefits to the job that made up for it.  I loved the people I worked with and what I did on the day to day but I wanted more.

Prices plummeted and Kansas Common was trading in the 20's.  We had a full stop on drilling and we weren't even leasing new prospects.  For the foreseeable future we were a drilling company that was doing everything but.  For a few months we did some in house cleaning of old paper work and past projects but eventually there was a layoff in the company.  Over 25% of the workforce was let go.  I was one of the four in my department of eleven.  I don't blame my manager for choosing me and the others, we were the logical choices.  Me and my old boss still remain close (I have known him for about 15 years).

So no here I am about 10 months from the time I was laid off.  I have my MBA, B.A. in International Business, and almost 2 years of experience in the Energy Sector.  Since I was laid off I have been all over indeed and careerbuilder and several other job boards applying to different jobs.  I am hoping for some direction.  My past convictions have never affected where I work or what I can do.  I am willing to relocate or travel as needed.  I would love to work with developing nations.  I have even considered going back to school for my D.B.A. or even taking the BAR.

I apologize for the novel but I hope all of you who have read this far may be able to appreciate my situation.  I am not looking for charity, I am looking to earn my place in the workplace.  Any continent, any country, any state, any city.

All advice is welcome!!!  Thank you!"

I'm genuinely concerned.

So, recently I accepted an offer to work at Google this summer under their Engineering Practicum program. Exciting stuff, right?! However, now that it's been setting in, I can't help but wonder why they picked me...

I ran a quick search on LinkedIn and all the past EP interns go to Ivy league schools and top CS schools like MIT, Stanford, and Georgia Tech and have done impressive research projects or prior internships... while I'm here attending my state public school with a 3.5 GPA and no past internships (I'm a second-year)

Additionally, all of my other friends who have applied who are WAY smarter than me have gotten rejected.

...AND EP is a diversity program and I'm an Indian male (how much less diverse can you get for engineering?!) All of the LinkedIn people's profiles are either girls, minorities (hispanic/African-American) or both where I'm literally the definition of the majority.

I got along really well with co-workers and my boss would like to hire me, but I am in a larger hiring pool for the greater organization. 

My question is this. Is my letter of intent dependent on me getting at least a 3.0 GPA or will they still hire me? Is there a pdf of hiring guidelines floating around? Has anyone had a similar experience getting in with a low GPA and a letter of intent? 

I'm pretty worried because I know to get the internship they were very insistent that interns had at least 3.0, but I couldn't keep those numbers up. I have a family and a chronic illness that required 2 surgeries in the last 5 years that have made the GPA difficult to maintain. I'll be graduating in April with my B.A. in Computer Engineering.

I'm a senior in college that is in the middle of my job hunt. I'll be graduating in May with a BS in computer science and would ideally like to be a software developer.

After interviewing for several different positions at one of my top companies, I was offered a systems engineering job. The problem is, I don't know if I want to do systems engineering. I have a few main concerns and I was hoping I might be able to get some advice.


* If I take a job in systems engineering, would it make it harder or easier to get into software development later?

* Do software guys tend to view systems guys as just IT guys? (Kind of the general vibe I've been getting)

* Is systems engineering a good place for a Computer Science student to start a career?


Some other background, I did an internship in network security doing some pen testing and web development. My GPA isn't great, which is somewhat hurting my job hunt, but it should be significantly better by the end of my last two semesters.

Thanks for your help!"

**Background:** my mother is abusive.  Physical, verbal, emotional.  I love my father very dearly, but she has used him to get to me and my siblings, sometimes directly (""hit her"" or ""tell your daughter _______""), sometimes indirectly (being abusive toward him/my siblings if I'm not available to abuse directly, or making him tell her the details of a conversation I had with him that includes details about my life that I wasn't keen on her knowing).  The emotional abuse is only becoming more evident as I've been able to distance myself, especially by holding my other family members over me.  

My final semester of college (now) and the summer before, I was supposed to move back home for my internship.  I got a summer job that allowed me to stay away from home, but the second or third day all summer I was home (put it off until August), she started  rampaging.  I moved out that day and started staying with a friend's family near enough that I could still do my internship.  I am set to graduate in December, and in January I leave to go overseas for several years for a job.

**Back to today:** I never explicitly told my parents that I moved out, but it's quietly understood.  I changed my permanent address to the place I am living now (haven't told them where that is) so she wouldn't have an excuse to make me stop by for mail/be able to go through my mail (which she has a history of doing).

She still pays for my health insurance and has been saying since she began to suspect that I changed my address that she needs my tax returns for the 2016 year so the government can determine how much she was supposed to pay in total for...this year.  My insurance is covered for 2017, all taken care of by my job which begins in the first week of January.  I have good friends that I plan to be in touch with/possibly live with when my stint overseas is complete, and I trust them to handle my mail, any confidential information, etc.  However, my mother is saying that it is a legal/financial necessity that she have and be able to go through my financial documents for this information, in addition to insisting on filing my tax return (which the organization I'm working through said I should not have to worry about and that they'd handle it).

Two things with that in particular: one, she has always been intrusive about my returns, making me do them but insisting on knowing how much I made, then lording over me how much I made and still rely on her financially.  Two: especially since I have moved out, she has been...bending the truth about how much I am legally obligated to, and it feels as if she is doing so to control where I go and what I do, and also to force herself into the details of my life (example: I want to do a hike after my stint overseas, and she made up a bunch of totally invalid reasons that I shouldn't go, including saying that while I have a valid driver's license I have to have car insurance, even if I don't own a car).

**Does she actually need to know how much I made last year, or she is trying to maintain her hold on me?  Do I need to have my documents sent to her?  I was hoping to cut her out as soon as I moved out, but for my siblings' sake I've been trying to keep it civil.  Is there a way that I get the information she needs sent to her without having to have contact with her?**"
5ct6bm,1,2016-11-13,Tailoring a job title for a resume?,jax006,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5ct6bm/tailoring_a_job_title_for_a_resume/,"So I'm a senior year engineering student and I'm beginning to get deep into the job application game. I've been getting advice and tailoring my resume for a while now, but there's one thing I've been wondering, and I keep getting different answers from peers.

I don't have any internship experience, which I know puts me at a disadvantage, especially because of the ""keyword"" type of sorting that I've heard big companies do when going through all of their resumes.

What I do have is very close to an engineering internship though. I work at a control systems company out in the panel shop, and I regularly have to communicate with our engineers, CAD techs, customers, ect. However my job title is ""Electrical System Assembler""

I feel like it puts me at a slight disadvantage not having a more crisp ""System Engineering Intern"" title, or something similar. It would certainly make my resume more eye catching.

A bunch of friends/colleagues have suggested just putting that on my resume anyway. They claim that a company wouldn't really do the homework required to find out I wasn't technically an intern. Other people I've asked have said that no, I would get myself disqualified for a job if I fabricated a title like that. 

Any thoughts from the ever-knowing internet?"

Right now I am an Junior Computer Engineering major, mainly looking to go for a masters (perhaps a PhD) in Computer Engineer, focusing on Embedded Systems design (I probably would opt do a thesis if I possible). My motivation for this is that after working both an internship as a software developer as well as working in a research lab at my school, I found the latter to be a lot more satisfying. I know that I probably have not experienced a lot in industry, but given my experiences this far, I can see myself happy in more of research role after graduation, so it makes sense to me to go to grad school. The one caveat that I found though was that most grad schools that I have been looking at for just their masters program have and average GPA in the 3.5/3.6 range however my current GPA  - if everything goes well - will only be in the range of 3.3/3.4. Should I completely scrap the idea of going to grad school or might there be a way to launch into a career in research (be in industrial or academic research) after graduation? "

I'm about to graduate from engineering school. Two years later than expected because on my second year of uni I had to deal with a cronical neurological disorder. I'm currently 24.

Last year I had a full year internship at a quite prestigious insurance company, finished this mid year. Made a lot of mistakes, but also had quite big achievements for an intern. Due to this I was offered two full time jobs in different areas.
 
I did not take any of those jobs because a) conflicting schedule and b) I had little to zero interest in those areas. My internship period came to its end without me receiving a full time job offer in my area.

Unfortunately, my condition demanded me to take so many days off because I didn't feel well or had one of my damn frequent medical appointments. No matter if my absences were justified, when compared to the other interns who were always there, this left a bad impression within my area.

I'm about to finish my last semester, I'm day and night at uni, so looking for another intership or full time job right away was no option. 

Do you guys think I should disclose my condition in my resume? I'm inclined to believe I shouldn't and only bring it up when needed, which will probably happen in interviews, and in this scenario, what's the best way to talk about it without self-sabotaging myself?

I’m not sure. I’m not sure about much. This weekend I decided to come home early for Thanksgiving. I know, it’s basically two weeks away, but this week my birthday takes place and I wanted to spend it at home. I’ve been away for a while for college. I’m about to graduate so being consumed with classes and work, I’ve just been caught up with everything at school. I don’t live too far away from home, but I just haven’t visited since my dad’s birthday in February. Anyway, I decided to come down early to spend time with my parents, but two days in and it has been anything pleasant.

I came home on Friday and realized my dog had passed away. Naturally I was upset that they hadn’t told me, but I think it’s just that they didn’t want to worry me. It only happened a couple of days ago so I’m assuming they just waited to tell me in person. The odd thing is they don’t seem upset about it, and they don’t talk about how my dog passed away. Especially, my younger sister who was attached to Frodo since we’ve had him since she was five, she’s fifteen now. I arrived this past Friday evening, so just in time for supper. I tried to bring Frodo up at the dinner table.


The conversation was going okay. They were asking me about school, work, my internship. The normal things my parents ask when I come home. They tell me to call more since they get worried, and not to be spending all my money on weekends. So, it wasn’t bad. Then I asked about Frodo, and how he passed. My parents, since they were sitting across from each other, just looked up and glanced at each other. Then my dad asked for some salt. Mentally I was like “Ok? Are you guys just going to ignore that question?” Then my sister said “I was kinda sad at first, but it’s okay since we’re joining him soon.” I was mentally trying to process what she said, to make sure I heard it correctly, when I noticed my mom make a dirty look at her. I wanted to push on and ask more, but the more her answer rolled around in my head, I began to feel uncomfortable.


I went out that night with my neighborhood friends. We went out drinking and it was a great time. I came home around 3 a.m., slightly drunk. My parents being early sleepers, I always had tried my best to be quiet when I got home late. So, on Friday night/ Saturday morning, I tried opening my door as quietly as possible. Trying not to wake up our dog, until I realized he wasn’t with us anymore. As I walked in, I heard people talking. Which sent chills down my spine, until I realized it was my parents. Which should have been some relief, until I quickly realized they were talking in the living room with all the lights off. This was one of the first flags that I noticed. I came in through the kitchen door, so for me to get to the living room I must walk past the kitchen/ dining area and make a left. My bedroom is behind the dining area. I didn’t come in through the main door because we don’t live in the best neighborhood and we have a lock on the door that can’t be open from the outside. This door is hardly ever opened so the lock is put in place pretty much all the time. Unless we order pizza, or we are waiting for a package to get delivered. Anyway, as I made my way to the living room they kept chatting, when I realized all three of them were standing in the middle of the room facing each other. Being in a somewhat drunken state, I just said hi and excused myself. They said goodnight without even turning around. I got to my room, and fell asleep trying to forget.


Saturday morning, I take my sister out to watch Dr. Strange and on the car ride there I ask her what they were doing last night. She said they were just talking. Now that my parents weren’t there I pressured her by asking more questions. I asked “Julia why were you guys talking in the dark with the lights off?” She took a while to answer, and I began getting aggravated a little bit. I asked her again, and she said “that’s how the neighbors told us we could bond more”. This threw me off. I asked her why at night, and why with the lights off. She said that’s just how families bonded. I told her “This is not how families “bond” at night. This isn’t what we’ve done in the past. It’s just creepy.” Then she said “Yeah, mom and dad knew you wouldn’t understand”. After that I let it go.

When we got home that afternoon my parents were trying to fix the antenna. Like I said, we don’t live in the best neighborhood, and we can’t afford to have cable. So normally when a car passes by or it’s too cloudy we lose signal. Sometimes, the tape that holds up our antenna falls off, and that was the case this time. I offered to help, as they fixed the antenna from the outside, I was to go in and yell out when the t.v. received signal. As I made my way through the kitchen to the living room, I saw that they were standing in front of the window staring in. We had our curtains down so I know they couldn’t see in. They’re transparent, but because it was still daylight outside, you were only able to see from the inside out. We have thicker ones that we put down at night. I yelled out to them saying I was ready, but they just stared. For about a minute. For some reason, I turned around and noticed my sister standing at the entry of the hallway, staring back. Just staring. I turned back to my parents, and they weren’t in front of the window anymore. Then I heard them yell out that they were ready. I turned around to ask my sister what the hell that was about, but she had gone back to her room. 

After that, my parents came back to watch t.v. as if nothing had happened. I asked about the neighbors, and who they were but they just said they hadn’t really interacted with them. After supper, I excused myself and went out with my friends that night. 


A local college bar has $10 all you can drink on Saturdays and there was no way my friends and I were turning that down. So, we went out. As I was getting dropped of that night/ Sunday morning. I remembered what had happened the previous night. I was about to go in through the kitchen door, when a group of people step out. Four of them to be exact. The parents and two daughters. They introduce themselves as the neighbors, and since I was drunk I clumsily introduce myself. They quickly leave, as I walked in. I get scolded by my parents for acting like an idiot in front of my neighbors. I get annoyed, since it was about 2 a.m., and I was thinking who was visitors over that late, especially since there were no indications of the lights being on from the outside. The lights weren’t fucking on. Why weren’t they fucking on, and why did my parents lie to me about interacting with our neighbors.


Today was the most normal day we’ve had so far. Even then it’s been a bit odd. My parents seem to be avoiding me since last night. I haven’t seen my sister all day. She’s been in her room, and hasn’t come out. When I asked if she wanted to see some YouTube videos together she just plainly said no, and I haven't seen her come out all day.

Something’s wrong here guys and I don’t know what to do. It’s late here now. About midnight. My parents should be asleep since my dad has work tomorrow morning, and my sister has school. But I can hear them talking again. I peeked through my door crack, but the lights aren’t on again. I am thirsty and I want to go get water, but I’m afraid. My parents aren’t themselves anymore. I think they have people over. My neighbors? I want to go out and see. I want to confront them and ask what the hell is going on. 


Guys please help me. Something’s going on at my house, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel welcomed here anymore. I hear them laughing. They seem to be having a good time, I think. This isn’t the family that I’ve been used to for 21 years. I don't think I can make it two weeks if they keep acting up. It's just creeping me out. There are definitely others here. It's midnight for fucks sake. Why can't they just go to sleep?

In a previous internship I worked from home 3 days a week and in the office 2 days a week so I've had experience working from home before.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I love you all."

What's the best way to pursue a CS career when you've already established a career in another field?

I currently work for the government doing inspections at power plants. I have a mechanical engineering Bachelor's degree and about 7 years work experience (0 of it being anything related to CS.) I'm looking a few years down the road when my job ""ends"" and I have to find something else to do, and have been self teaching myself CS basics and programming languages in my spare time.

I see tons of posts about doing internships, but how do you apply and convince someone you have the know how to do a job you weren't ""officially trained for"" (i.e. no CS degree). Quitting my job to pursue an unpaid (or even low paying) internship in order to get a foot in the door is not really an option, so what are the best path(s) forward?

I'm currently studying CS in 4-year(in 2nd year atm) programme in Europe.
My question is: When is the right time for me to start applying for internships? Most universities abroad are like 2 years so most people start in their second year but I'm not sure if I'm eligible yet.
Is there a magic list(I wish) of things someone should know before applying?
Another thing I don't know is if I should only apply for internships in Europe or in US as well. 
Thanks in advance :D

5cxvgo,1,2016-11-14,University dropout with a trust fund: unmotivated and depressed,Tp333,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5cxvgo/university_dropout_with_a_trust_fund_unmotivated/,"Surprised that I'm even writing this. Because I am SO unmotivated. It's 3 PM on a Monday and I just woke up. I'm a 22 year old unemployed female university dropout with no plans for my future or even getting employment.  You would think that I'd get motivated from others constantly asking me about my ""job hunt"". But I'm so ashamed of admitting my laziness that I lie to them and say I have a bunch of interviews to go to etc. I then get anxiety over lying to them. (Parents, friends) . I also feel like I'm isolating myself from my loved ones because I don't want them asking me questions about my future/ don't want to lie to them so I just avoid encountering them in general. (Not eating dinner with my dad anymore because he keeps pestering me and I don't want to admit that I'm an unmotivated person because he would associate that with ungratefulness) 

Usually for me I get motivated if there is a purpose but lately I'm having trouble waking up early because there is no purpose. I have no where to go and I have no motivation to find anywhere to go. I only wake up early if I make plans with someone and someone is counting on me being there early. 

I don't have a job and I'm unmotivated to get one because I have $$$ in my trust fund. I stopped going to the gym because the body acceptance movement really spoke to me. I dropped out of university because good grades weren't enough of a reason to motivate me to study for exams so I ended up failing and just dropping out entirely. I bought a book to inspire me to get motivated but I can't even bring myself to read it. (It's an ebook and on my iPad so every few pages I get distracted by YouTube/other apps on my iPad). After much procrastinating, I finally took driving school after 2 years. I completed the in class portion but I can't even get motivated to book my in car driving lessons which I've already paid for (out of the money from my trust fund). 

Even this past summer I got an internship (out of luck), and I had no motivation to complete the tasks at the job at hand. I did them hesitantly (after hours of procrastinating on social media at work). The moment my boss would leave the office, I'd go back to social media and YouTube etc. I feel like I've been like this since high school, and sometimes I think I might have ADHD. Or something. 

I remember in university, when I had readings to do for 3 classes. I found it incredibly difficult to finish one reading and then go on to the next, instead I went back and fourth between my 3 readings/textbooks till I finished them all at the same time by multitasking. In short: I get bored if I do the same task for a long time at once. I need a distraction. Another example: my mom asks me to unload the dishwasher. Halfway through unloading the dishwasher, I  feel the urge to wipe the countertops clean and ""distract myself"" and then I go back to the original task at hand which was unloading the damn dishwasher. 

I have been told by previous bosses and teachers that I should ""work on my listening skills."" I try my best but sometimes perhaps I don't have the patience to read through instructions that I just assume things and do them without proper listening/ instructions. And every single time i have to take a test/exam , for as long as I can remember, it would take me MUCH longer than my peers to finish, I'd always be asking for extra time to complete the test.  Do I have an undiagnosed learning disability? I don't know. 

Beforehand, I used to make excuses and blame my circumstances for my unmotivated laziness. I blamed the gym for being too far away as an excuse that I didn't work out. But this past summer I lived in a fancy new condo with a high class gym inside of it and I did not step foot in it once. I was THAT unmotivated. That's when I realized that my circumstances were NOT the problem. I could have the best of the best of the best and STILL be an unmotivated sloth. 

In terms of work/school, I used to think that the reason I was unmotivated was because I didn't find my ""passion"". So I spent two years searching for my ""passion"" and I found it. Now I know what I love, I know what I need to do, yet I'm still unmotivated to do those things and work towards goals. 

I have ""big plans"" for my future and I know what I want for myself but I have no motivation to take the steps needed to follow through. 

I don't know if I'd say that I'm depressed because I am happy. Despite some discontentment with my laziness, I am reasonably happy. However, I've read symptoms of depression.

These are the ones that apply to me:
-Insomnia
-Increase in appetite 
-Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that aren't your responsibility
-Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things

That being said, I'm a fairly optimistic person and try not to let those symptoms bother me from being ""happy"" or doing things that make me happy (ie staying up till 4 AM binge watching Netflix and sleeping in and repeating the cycle all over again). I guess I'm happy because I'm finally doing ""whatever I want"" except I'm not happy doing this ""whatever I want"". Sometimes I don't even have enough patience to sit through an entire episode, so I scroll through Instagram while it's playing in the background. I always joke that I don't have the attention span to sit through super long movies which is why I avoid them. 

When I ask my friends to describe me, they'd say hyper and creative. And I agree with them. I'm 22 but act childish most of the time/ make inappropriate jokes. I also get bursts of creativity which motivates me to do the creative thing occasionally. 

I want structure in my life, I want a job that gives me purpose to wake up every morning, I want to be motivated to do things at the job, I want routine (despite originally saying 9-5 sucks), I want to feel motivated to apply and seek out the job that I want. 

I have all these grand plans for my future and what I want to do and where I want to go and when I see someone else (friends of mine) doing those things on social media I get jealous, insecure, self hatred consumes me ex: ""THAT WAS MY IDEA FIRST UHHHH"",  and feelings of extreme FOMO.

World of Reddit: how do I get motivated? How do I find purpose ? Can you be depressed and happy at the same time? Do I have ADHD? What's wrong with me? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I would go to a therapist but I'm paranoid/afraid that if I reveal that I have a trust fund, they might take advantage of vulnerable rich unmotivated me. "

However, I'm really, really unsure of which one I should choose. If anyone could please give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

Here are some things about me:

--I enjoy programming, especially web development. UX Design also seems really interesting to me.

--I've learned how to program mostly through self-teaching and Coursera, and it's my preferred way to learn about CS-related topics.

--I'm fairly good at math and I enjoy it.

--I did an internship at a software company and I hated the work environment. I really didn't like that I sat at a desk and coded for hours on end while barely interacting with others. I don't see myself working at a place like that.

--The school I'm starting at has no web development or UX electives. I'm not particularly interested in learning about data structures, algorithms, etc, but maybe that's because I don't know much about them.

--I dropped out from another school recently due to depression (I had been studying CivE). My workload was preventing me from pursuing my non-academic interests and that took a big toll on me. I don't want to relive that experience, unless I'm extremely interested in what I'm studying. 

--My eventual goal is to become an entrepreneur. I see myself working as the builder of the machine rather than a part of it.

--I'm afraid that I won't be able to find a job if I study business with, say, a focus on MIS. CS has way more job opportunities, especially for web devs.

--I don't know very much about business and so I can't say for sure if I will like studying it. Same with the work environment; I don't know if it will be different from the one I had with my internship.

--Parents would much rather me study CS over business, but my personal happiness is more important to me.

--Part of me wants to study CS just because it's considered a ""smart"" degree, whereas business is considered to be not so ""smart."" This is due to insecurity.

Any and all advice is appreciated greatly. Thanks!"

I was approached by a few recruiters on Linkedin over the past couple weeks, and it seems like people are shopping around getting ready for 2017, but no one seems interested in humoring a conversation about free labor which is confusing to me. I've worked in a lot of different fields and right now I only know what it's like to build websites, I have no idea what an actual industry job would entail and I'd like a peek at what a 9-5 dev job for a company would feel like. Can anyone with an HR perspective give me any insight regarding an approach for a developer internship? Is imposter syndrome so rampant that everyone is terrified at the idea of a newbie looking over their shoulders? I feel like there's a knowledge gap here but any time I try to find relevant information online I always end up at the same sites and articles spouting the usual ""project get side-social hackathons, hot languages! Very code! Much dank!"". Is there any way I can get back into a daily environment where I can code and discuss code with peers right now, rather than just relentlessly work on side projects by myself?


Thank you for any advice and suggestions, I appreciate you taking the time.

A few questions:

First, I plan on getting a 2 year and then transferring to finish a 4 year.  I've constantly heard that it's important to get a internship while at school in order to get job experience to start immediately after school.  How true is this, and how much would it hurt my career if I didn't, and stuck with my current full-time job till I get my degree?

Second, I have 4 specializations I can take, Cisco Certified Network Associate Security, Global Certified Windows Security Administrator, Redhat Certified Security Specialist, and High Technology Criminal Investigations.  In your opinion, which of these degrees offers the most job security, opportunity to get hired, and would pay the most?  Also, while Red Hat and Windows Administrator seems self explanatory, and I know a Cisco certification refers to networking and routers, I'm not sure how that refers specifically to InfoSec, I'm not 100% sure what the Criminal Investigations route would take me.   Anyone have any insight into either?  I know my college doesn't offer any certifications, they just prep you to take them.

Finally, anyone have any advice for an InfoSec degree and career, steps that you wish you had taken or just some insight into what I can expect?  I'm moderately versed in computers and have built several and done light IT here and there, but I've never had any education on it.

Currently working in an intern position at a church in Oregon. I found a listing for it online around 2.5 months ago, and have now been here for around a month. They’re currently overhauling their program, and I was the last intern brought in under their previous internship format.  


The format of the internship, as advertised, was simple. I would work part time for the church, helping during weekly services, and aid with any needs during the week. In exchange, I would be provided with room and board from a host family within the church. When I arrived, it was a little different though – I would be staying in an “intern house” with other interns, and would be paying for my own food. The food situation has since been in negotiations, as someone made it an issue for the staff, so they’ve been working on providing me with a monthly stipend. 

The last few weeks have been a little rough and I’ve been contemplating leaving the program, and today during the staff meeting it was brought up that the head pastor wanted to modify the internship program to potentially give college credit. With these things in mind I started looking up some info on unpaid internships and what laws exist in regard to them, when I found a few sites with info that intrigued me.  

***

The first site I found was the [SBA’s guide](https://www.sba.gov/blogs/how-set-internship-program-your-small-business) to starting up an internship program. The parts that intrigued me are here: 

&gt;*‘Unpaid interns cannot do any work that contributes to a company's operations’* 

&gt;*‘Unpaid interns can shadow other employees and perform duties that don't have a business need’.* 

Right now I am working on projects that directly contribute to the company’s operations – I’m redesigning their website, am in charge of designing their new app, and run the visuals for nearly every service we hold.  

***

The next site I found was the National Council of Nonprofits’ [guide on Interns]( https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/interns-employee-or-volunteer). The section that interested me was the ‘Unintended consequences of interns’ portion, where it says: 

&gt;*‘if your nonprofit considers its interns ""volunteers,"" but pays them a ""stipend,"" there could be unintended negative consequences. The stipend may cause the Department of Labor to classify the intern as an employee, creating the obligation to pay the intern at least minimum wage and back taxes.’*

as well as

&gt;*’On the other hand, it may be appropriate to treat the intern as a ""trainee"" – relieving the nonprofit of paying minimum wage, but raising the need to document carefully how the internship primarily benefits the intern -- not the nonprofit.’*

From my current situation, I’m not getting either. There is no definable or dependable stipend just yet, and from the discussions I’ve had with some of the staff, there is no curriculum for myself or for other interns to follow for our skill sets. Right now I am just doing task work for the church, getting things done for them better than they could do themselves.  

***

From there I looked up the Oregon.gov [FAQ page]( https://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/pages/t_faq_interns.aspx) on interns, employees, and trainees, finding that: 

&gt;*‘Students are considered employees and their work covered by the FLSA if: 
1. They provide essential services to the employer; or
2. They are working in a position where someone is normally paid; or
3. There is a history of paying someone to do the same or similar work; or
4. Other people are currently paid for the same or similar work.’*

Right now I am providing this church with design services I would charge other companies hundreds for (I am a freelance graphic designer when I’m not doing work for the internship). I feel confident in saying there are likely other churches with individuals getting paid to do what I do now (designing and running graphics and media for that organization), especially considering I applied for such a position before taking this internship. 

***

A few other notes, though they probably aren't needed – they are currently revamping the program to where you pay $5000 before entering the internship to help cover your food expenses for the year. There is typically a few different types of interns – ranging from tech/media (what I am) to worship, youth and children’s ministries. None seem to have a defined curriculum from what I've heard from other interns.

So I’m not sure what to do. I’m probably going to leave this internship due to personal differences, but given my (admittedly rudimentary) research on everything, I’m not sure about the legality of some aspects of this internship. Maybe I’m just looking for more of a reason to be pissed at them, who knows. Just figured I’d see what everyone here thinks.


tl;dr – I’m working as an unpaid graphic design intern for a church being provided free housing, there’s no curriculum for me to follow, and I’m essentially working as an employee, is this legal?"

I need some advice (obviously). I'm just gonna cut to the chase. **Here's my situation:**

In September, I started an internship at a law firm in my city. As it turns out, this other girl that I know is doing her internship at the courthouse which is nearby. This girl is really popular. Like I mean, really popular - as in she gets over 600 likes on Instagram popular hahaha. I, on the other hand, am not the most popular guy. I tend to keep somewhat of a private life, and I certainly do not have a large group of close friends. However, today we went just the two of us for lunch and things clicked (for me at least). I caught us gazing into each others eyes on multiple occasions and my heart pretty much felt in such a way that I haven't felt in a while. Now, I'm the type of guy that falls for a girl easily and always seems to get his heart broken at the end of the day (honest truth). When we arrived back at the courthouse, she thanked me for the lunch and I suggested that we should do this again. Without any objection (no pun intended), she said ""yes of course.""

**So here's where I'm at right now:**

Basically, I want to continue to pursue things with the ultimate goal of ending up in a relationship with her. Now the thing is, I got out of a year long relationship in early June, and I've moved on, but I've almost forgotten what its like to pursue a girl and start over. This is literally embarrassing for me. I'm in this state of confusion yet awe and I just need any advice I can get.

My entire life has been absolute Hell, although I feel bad even saying that considering how others have it worse. My parents don't know how to parent. My other two siblings suffer from depression, and my brother is now a paranoid schizophrenic who my parents try to forget about. Anytime I cry or voice discomfort, I'm hit or told I'm a schizo failure. From age seven I've had plans of killing myself. I was bullied so severely in school that I'm afraid of people, not even the principle would help me even as I was assaulted by people. I had horrible trauma, but I took theatre for five years to force myself to pretend to be happy. Now I'm charismatic and appear normal irl and it's tearing me apart. Everytime I try to talk to someone they leave or tell me to just go to therapy. I want to be successful, and I tried hard at hobbies and remembering things but could never be as good as others even if I tried for hours. I found out recently that I have a learning disability that affects my memory, sense of direction and mathematical ability so I learn at slower rates than others. People consistently tell me I don't try hard enough, and if I complain or cry at all they assume I'm instantly crazy when I'm trying as hard as I can. I'm consistently called useless and oversensitive, and overall I just can't see anything good about the world. My parents are separated, my mother twice divorced, my step father a murderer and in jail now and my father married to some foreign woman who he knocked up. The only person I had was my brother, and now he doesn't even remember my name. I'm bitter. I have a loving boyfriend, but even though he cares about me he's not able to talk to me and I'm consistently told by others that I'm incapable of being helped. I have an internship with an amazing company and my future doesn't look dark, but with how ignorant people are I just can't see myself salvaging happiness from anything. I hate the world. I hate everything it has to offer. I want to live in the wilderness away from people and their disgusting amounts of apathy towards everyone else. Nobody ever helped me, not even when I was being abused and now they want to pretend like it never happened to make me shut up. Nobody, not even friends will listen to me.

Yet, not only am I mightily struggling and almost failing with my specialized coursework, but I find myself depressed at the thought of working around that field for the rest of my life.


The more I think about it, the more I want to switch into Human Resources. After serving as recruitment director for 2 student organizations, I've found myself to really enjoy that sort of work. In my intro to HR class, I was the only one who scored above 90% on the first midterm.


My school's HR program is somewhat small and doesn't have a cut-off GPA to apply. Since Human Resources is also in the College of Business, many of my core business pre-requisites are complete. I would simply need to fulfill the 21 specialization credit hours (after I barely pass this java course, I will have completed 6/24 specialization hours for Information Systems. I've heard that it's also a field in demand, but the starting salary is also a lot less generous. Grad school is also a necessity to move up higher in the work place.


And yet, after thinking about it for the past month and trying to decide what my minimum cost of living would look like upon graduation, I decided I'll learn to live with $12,000 less in starting salary for a field in which I feel competent. I know that I'll be in school for at least an extra semester. Many of the places that I've applied for internships have more Human Resource openings that IT positions. I planned on going to Grad School since I was in high school also. Should I switch into Human Resources, I will be on track to graduate on time. Since I've already taken out the money for another year, I know that a Spanish minor is definitely attainable as well. One look at my resume, and it's apparent that I have much more experience organizing and working with people, rather than with programming.


Now, here's the hard part: how do I tell my parents? They see me struggling, but they acknowledge that as long as I'm trying my best, they'll value my effort more than the letter grade or GPA. My mom constantly worries about me getting a job upon graduation. My dad always speaks of the importance of hard/technical skills (which HR definitely does NOT emphasize). Both of them are concerned with how much money I'll make out of the gate. I grew up in a typical Asian household, and my parents were already somewhat disappointed when I told them I didn't want to be an engineer or a doctor. I feel like if I were to switch into a degree like HR, they'd see it as a waste of time and money; my dad believes I can get job like that without a degree. I'm afraid of disappointing them, further even though I cannot honestly perform to the best of my ability. 


Thanks for hearing me go off, Reddit. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!"
5czppr,3,2016-11-14,Is no motivation a sign of ADHD?,Tp333,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5czppr/is_no_motivation_a_sign_of_adhd/,"Surprised that I'm even writing this. Because I am SO unmotivated. It's 3 PM on a Monday and I just woke up. I'm a 22 year old unemployed university dropout with no plans for my future or even getting employment.  You would think that I'd get motivated from others constantly asking me about my ""job hunt"". But I'm so ashamed of admitting my laziness that I lie to them and say I have a bunch of interviews to go to etc. I then get anxiety over lying to them. (Parents, friends) . I also feel like I'm isolating myself from my loved ones because I don't want them asking me questions about my future/ don't want to lie to them so I just avoid encountering them in general. (Not eating dinner with my dad anymore because he keeps pestering me and I don't want to admit that I'm an unmotivated person because he would associate that with ungratefulness) 

Usually for me I get motivated if there is a purpose but lately I'm having trouble waking up early because there is no purpose. I have no where to go and I have no motivation to find anywhere to go. I only wake up early if I make plans with someone and someone is counting on me being there early. 

I don't have a job and I'm unmotivated to get one because I have $$$ in my trust fund. I stopped going to the gym because the body acceptance movement really spoke to me. I dropped out of university because good grades weren't enough of a reason to motivate me to study for exams so I ended up failing and just dropping out entirely. I bought a book to inspire me to get motivated but I can't even bring myself to read it. (It's an ebook and on my iPad so every few pages I get distracted by YouTube/other apps on my iPad). After much procrastinating, I finally took driving school after 2 years. I completed the in class portion but I can't even get motivated to book my in car driving lessons which I've already paid for (out of the money from my trust fund). 

Even this past summer I got an internship (out of luck), and I had no motivation to complete the tasks at the job at hand. I did them hesitantly (after hours of procrastinating on social media at work). The moment my boss would leave the office, I'd go back to social media and YouTube etc. I feel like I've been like this since high school, and sometimes I think I might have ADHD. Or something. 

I remember in university, when I had readings to do for 3 classes. I found it incredibly difficult to finish one reading and then go on to the next, instead I went back and fourth between my 3 readings/textbooks till I finished them all at the same time by multitasking. In short: I get bored if I do the same task for a long time at once. I need a distraction. Another example: my mom asks me to unload the dishwasher. Halfway through unloading the dishwasher, I  feel the urge to wipe the countertops clean and ""distract myself"" and then I go back to the original task at hand which was unloading the damn dishwasher. 

I have been told by previous bosses and teachers that I should ""work on my listening skills."" I try my best but sometimes perhaps I don't have the patience to read through instructions that I just assume things and do them without proper listening/ instructions. And every single time i have to take a test/exam , for as long as I can remember, it would take me MUCH longer than my peers to finish, I'd always be asking for extra time to complete the test.  Do I have an undiagnosed learning disability? I don't know. 

Beforehand, I used to make excuses and blame my circumstances for my unmotivated laziness. I blamed the gym for being too far away as an excuse that I didn't work out. But this past summer I lived in a fancy new condo with a high class gym inside of it and I did not step foot in it once. I was THAT unmotivated. That's when I realized that my circumstances were NOT the problem. I could have the best of the best of the best and STILL be an unmotivated sloth. 

In terms of work/school, I used to think that the reason I was unmotivated was because I didn't find my ""passion"". So I spent two years searching for my ""passion"" and I found it. Now I know what I love, I know what I need to do, yet I'm still unmotivated to do those things and work towards goals. 

I have ""big plans"" for my future and I know what I want for myself but I have no motivation to take the steps needed to follow through. 

I don't know if I'd say that I'm depressed because I am happy. Despite some discontentment with my laziness, I am reasonably happy. However, I've read symptoms of depression.

These are the ones that apply to me:
-Insomnia
-Increase in appetite 
-Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that aren't your responsibility
-Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things

That being said, I'm a fairly optimistic person and try not to let those symptoms bother me from being ""happy"" or doing things that make me happy (ie staying up till 4 AM binge watching Netflix and sleeping in and repeating the cycle all over again). I guess I'm happy because I'm finally doing ""whatever I want"" except I'm not happy doing this ""whatever I want"". Sometimes I don't even have enough patience to sit through an entire episode, so I scroll through Instagram while it's playing in the background. I always joke that I don't have the attention span to sit through super long movies which is why I avoid them. 

I want structure in my life, I want a job that gives me purpose to wake up every morning, I want to be motivated to do things at the job, I want routine (despite originally saying 9-5 sucks), I want to feel motivated to apply and seek out the job that I want. 

I have all these grand plans for my future and what I want to do and where I want to go and when I see someone else (friends of mine) doing those things on social media I get jealous, insecure, self hatred consumes me ex: ""THAT WAS MY IDEA FIRST UHHHH"",  and feelings of extreme FOMO.

World of Reddit: how do I get motivated? How do I find purpose ? Can you be depressed and happy at the same time? Do I have ADHD? What's wrong with me? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I would go to a therapist but I'm paranoid/afraid that if I reveal that I have a trust fund, they might take advantage of vulnerable rich unmotivated me. "

Then the random variable ""X"" follows a binomial distribution and takes the value ""k""e[0, n] with probability n! * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) /(k! * (n-k)!). Maximized at k = round(np, 0).

5d0p31,3,2016-11-14,"CS major, transfer student... doing fine academically, but not socially (due to workload/time basically). Advice?",MrFender95,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5d0p31/cs_major_transfer_student_doing_fine_academically/,"Title says most of what I'm going to say. First semester at a four-year university, and the transition hasn't really been an issue at all! It's just under an hour away from home, so anything I'm running drastically low on, I just come on home every other weekend and pick it up then. 

Thoroughly enjoying my CS classes, aside from the bulging anxiety I get when searching/applying/preparing for internships. Not sure if I'll get one, as I'm technically a freshman in the CS curriculum, just junior level credit-wise. I TRY not to worry too much about any of that, however, because I know the school I'm at will prepare me heavily for an internship and a great career in the next (hopefully) three years I'm here!

Being a transfer student, my GPA from the community college, by way of the college's modus operandi, did not transfer as well. So essentially starting off with a 0.00 GPA, which is exactly why I've been hitting my workload diligently! If I had to tally up the hours per week (which I don't), I'd say it's in the ballpark of 36-42 hours spent (could be more, like I said, don't keep track) of studying/doing homework a week. Doesn't include weekends but this semester I've lucky to usually not have to take much home with me as far as assignments go.

The problem is, with my anxiety over getting all my work done to the best of my ability, it's been a near-futile effort to squeeze in time to make friends/meet a girl, of which I naively thought the transition from CC to Uni would allot me with tons of time to pursue those things!

So, quite naturally, I've been a tad depressed when thinking about my circumstances lately. No, not lately... make that the entire semester. Just now getting to me, though.

I do make tons of acquaintances, really nice people, in my CS classes and otherwise, and for most of them I try and get some sort of contact info. It seems, however, that whenever I have time to hang with one of them, the other doesn't. Alas, I suppose that's the nature of college. I understand and respect their work ethic, though this doesn't help my endeavors.

Of my surrounding peers (i.e. the guys I share an apartment with on-campus), I seem to be the only one with this issue. Four of the guys are heavily into video games, and I'm not, otherwise I'd chill with them in the living room, where they are a majority of the time.

My roommate, who I transferred from the same CC with, is an avid PC gamer, so more video games. Doesn't help he's got online friends (which I'll never quite understand; I could never forge a meaningful connection with people online, or at least enough of one to call someone a ""friend""). Seeing as he's got his social group to talk to while enjoying his hobby, I doubt he's having a depressive mood about his experiences here.

My prime hobby is playing guitar. I have been for 6 years and it's so much a part of who I am. So while I'd love to join a club in order to ""meet more friends and have a social outlet"", there's no guitar clubs, or anything remotely interesting to me that's not related to my major (because there is a CS group on campus, and I've gone to a few of their meetings, nice people there as well). If The other negative about joining a club is that, with my aforementioned workload and work ethic, I doubt I'd find the time to spend the time I wanted to in the group. Wouldn't have the time to be very involved, that's for sure.

Sooooo you might be able to tell why I feel alone in this predicament of mine. It sucks, and I try to ignore the feeling the best I can. But I just wanted to post here to gauge people's thoughts on what I might be able to do to alleviate this situation. As far as the dating scenario goes, only thing I've really tried is Tinder, and I'm finding out lately that it's a disproportionate sex buddy finder/bot-fest. lol

I really want things to change, either now and for the rest of the semester, or starting next semester when my schedule feels a little less rushed. Again, all (non-shitpost) advice is appreciated!"

Need some advice.",Snozed,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5d2k1h/im_in_my_final_year_of_computer_engineering_have/,"Hi guys. I'll try to keep this short as I can.

I'm studying computer engineering at a university in europe, and in my 2nd year I had to choose between specializing in either more computer sciency stuff (mostly programming) or networking and security. In my first year I had some basic programming courses (Java, Python, C) and I didn't really like it, so I thought I'd give networking&amp;security a chance.

I've found out that while I like networking a little bit more than programming, i'm still not a huge fan. The only thing I thought was OK were my security classes. I learned about hacking, penetration testing and some other stuff that I thought was pretty cool.

I got an internship this summer at a medium sized construction company in the US through a family friend (I'm half american). They had never had an IT intern before, only construction engineering students, but they put me in their IT department which consisted of some great people and I learned quite a bit. While I got to do some interesting stuff like help set up new servers and routers in addition to getting admin privileges for most of their systems, most of my time was spent on tier 1 help desk support. I was good at it though, and they offered me a permanent job when I'm finished with my studies.

So I guess my question is: should I take the job and hope that something better will show up down the road? I liked working at the company, but I didn't like most of the work, and I didn't learn anything about cyber security. I want to work in the US as the job market in IT isn't too hot where I'm from these days. But I heard getting a job in the US isn't easy either when you don't have experience, and applying for jobs is pretty pointless if you don't live in the city. My grades are pretty average.

I'm working on a CCNA right now because a lot of people told me it would be smart to get it, and my school pays for the certification as a part of one of my classes. It has been during this time of practicing for the CCNA that I've realized I don't really like networking and I wish I had taken a security cert instead but now it's too late. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

It's hard enough putting it into words as it is, let alone in a straight narrative that makes sense.

I have occasionally thought about offing myself before over the years, but they were harmless entertainings of the thought, you know. At what point is living no longer worth the bother, and if I went through with it, what are the repercussions for my loved ones? That stuff. I don't want to hurt my dad, who's had a hard life as it is. I don't want my younger brother going through my loss on his own, as it was hard enough on the two of us when we lost our mom to cancer a few years ago.

That's when it all went downhill, fast. I was never a very disciplined student, but I was very gifted. I got through, sometimes barely, on aptitude for the course materials alone. When our mother died, I was 23, and was well over halfway through getting my bachelor's degree.

All of my gusto for the trade (high school education) vanished. All of my gusto for much of anything, really. I managed to grit my teeth through all the raw material and exams that were left to me, but I couldn't be a teacher anymore. My final internship I failed three times. I've gotten even fatter than I was. I often ignore bills until a bailiff order comes.

I'm 25 now, which means no more government grants for education where I live. It also means my dad's taxes would go up since I can no longer be under his care in the government's eyes, no matter my situation. He's been on health care since he had a stroke nearly 20 years ago, so he's not exactly comfortable financially.

I quit my studies with only one semester left. I had to, since all that was left were internships that I obviously cannot fulfill while working. I applied at the store I'd worked at for five years while studying. They were hiring too, but for reasons I still can't understand, the manager I'd known for five years and who had always been content me chose not to hire me.

Me, my brother, and a friend have been renting an apartment for two and a half months now, which is a better financial solution than sending our dad's taxes into the stratosphere. The idea was that I would be working at this store, and we split all the bills three-ways. I was so sure I'd get that job (and so were plenty of my colleagues). But I didn't, so I started applying for other jobs. They either turn me away for being overqualified when they see I went to school for so long, or they send me away for being underqualified when they see I didn't manage to get the degree after all that time. On top of that, it's slim pickings because I don't actually have a driver's license.

I've been applying since the end of August and I still don't have a job. Tensions are rising in this house and I've just stopped... Whatever you call it. I can tell my stance on suicide is changing. Earlier today my brother was yet again telling me how he's getting tired of me still being home. I said it's pissing me off too, that I don't enjoy living off their goodwill and not having a single penny to my name. He started rebutting yet again, and I just had enough. I got up, slammed my door in his face and locked it. Our dad invited us for dinner tonight and I'm not going. I've sat in my room since I locked the door an hour ago now, crying on and off while typing this.

I just want to get my fucking shit together but it feels like the world doesn't let me. And I realize the world doesn't owe me anything, but I don't owe the world anything either. I had to stop myself from googling suicide methods. The very least I can do when checking out is make sure I'm not a grueling mess or that I don't give some poor train driver PTSD.

I don't even know what I expect to get out of typing this. It feels like my life is stuck in a rut, and the only way out is to land a fucking job *soon*. And even then I think I'd still be treating the symptoms and not the cause. I just don't want to anymore man. I just can't be bothered. You try, and try, and try, and you just don't see results.

I just sit here, being a fat blubbering mess, while sending applications into a void that only seems to swallow them. I'm a burden to those around me."

I have a couple questions about the hiring process in the EU/US, and more specifically the Netherlands, but feel free to chime in if you have any experience with working in the EU.

From what I have noticed so far it seems more emphasis is put on passing courses, unlike the USA where getting 60-70% in a course is unsatisfactory for some. Obviously it is always better to have a higher GPA, but what are employers mostly looking for in the EU? Would simply having graduated your bachelor's and or master's degree suffice?

Also, how has job searching gone for any EU graduates that looked for a job or even an internship in the USA?

I assume, that most of the standards in the USA are applicable to the EU,however university studies are much more difficult for me here, so perhaps there are some differences when hiring EU graduates.

   I see a lot of advice about how to pass the interviews and get offers, but I am wondering if anyone has some advice about after the offer.  I was lucky enough to get an offer from a Big 4 (MS), but I've been working in hardware test engineering for the past 5-6 years doing mostly low-level stuff (C++, LabVIEW, VBA).  I also have a degree in physics, so definitely have some imposter syndrome going in.  I have worked exclusively in small companies up to this point (&lt;40 people), so I imagine working in a giant company will be different.

   I'd be happy to hear people's experiences about how they transitioned successfully, either directly from college / intern to full-hire, or more like me where they were doing something different than CS into CS, or even from a small company to a large company."
5d55db,5,2016-11-15,Internship said they would let me know about graduate offer in January - how can I get them to let me know sooner?,what_reddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5d55db/internship_said_they_would_let_me_know_about/,"This year I completed an internship at an awesome company (about 400 employees now, less than half that a year ago). I learnt a huge amount, loved the people and just generally really enjoyed working there. I had regular one-to-ones with my manager and the senior developer I worked with most often and their feedback was always that I was exceeding expectations and doing really well. 


Towards the end of the internship, I had a final one-to-one with my manager where he explained that they would contact me in January to let me know if they were giving me a graduate offer. He seemed extremely positive and said that he would like to give me one now but they had to wait until the end of the quarter to see if they could hire more junior devs. This all makes sense with information I had known while working there, since they had put a freeze on hiring junior devs to sort out their onboarding process and hire more senior devs. 

I got to know my manager well and I trust that he would give me a straight-up no if they didn't want to hire me. I'm confident that they will give me an offer if they can, but I'm not 100% certain that they can.

Another company who I applied to last year (similar size and market) has emailed me today asking if I would like to talk about graduate opportunities. This has motivated me to try get an offer from the company I worked at (since I would really like to work there again) and if I can't, I will apply elsewhere.

How do I nicely (but firmly) ask if they can let me know now instead?"

5d5hms,9,2016-11-15,Life is Funny,suchacapricorn,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5d5hms/life_is_funny/,"It's funny. Just when life seems to be getting better, everything always just comes crashing down. Or maybe I was just being too optimistic. 

I'm a 22-year-old Asian American female, 5th year in university. I was academically dismissed at the end of my junior year because I have been an academic failure from the day I set foot on this campus. During my gap year I was the happiest I have ever been. I finally had time to figure things out for me and to find motivation. I took community college classes and managed to get high enough grades to get back into my 4-year college. This is my first semester back and it has been absolute hell. Academically I'm still struggling, but I'm struggling even harder just to find enough motivation to get out of bed every day and go to class which is where I feel my academic struggles are coming from. I always feel sad, or angry, or quite frankly just dead.

Things got even better today because this spring is supposed to be my last semester but now I probably won't even be graduating. I found out I won't have a way to pay for school next semester and I already owe my school money from this semester. It sucks even worse when I have already started my grad school applications and now I have to put those on hold for at least another year. I see my friends graduating and moving on with their lives and I'm still stuck in the same place I've been in for the past 4 years and I can't shake the feeling that I've failed when I know I really haven't. 

I'm super iffy about asking for or receiving professional help which is even funnier because I study rehabilitation and counselor ed and intern with a mental healthcare resource at my school. I'm just a huge hypocrite who can't take my own advice. I guess it's also because I still don't know what I want. Most of the time I don't even know why I feel the way I do. I know my life honestly isn't the worst but I also know that the feelings I have are valid. There is so much good in my life but for the past several years I have just had a hard time seeing beyond all of the bad. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to die. Or I guess at this point I'm still unsure. This is not the first time I have had suicidal ideations but they are becoming more frequent and more concrete to the point that I actually have plans of what I would do. I'm scared to die, but I am equally scared to live with myself because all my fears and worries and demons seem to get more powerful every day. Death only seems reassuring because at this point I am not really living and the future just looks bleak. I just go through the motions. Wake up, go to school, go to work. Some days I don't even eat or sleep because my mind just runs full of terrible thoughts and they keep me awake. 

I told my best friend goodbye today. Realizing how sad and afraid that made him made me really think other people are the only thing keeping me here. I don't want to hurt the people who care about me so I keep telling myself, ""Just one more day,"" but at this point it is really more for them than it is for me. I know there are people who do care about me and want me to win this battle but it's hard to keep fighting for myself. 

Sorry that this is such a long post and it kind of went nowhere, but I just have so much in my head to sort out. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to care, because it means a lot even if you all are just strangers on the internet."

I don't have a Computer Science Degree, so I don't know how employable I am, if at all. I have tried the Java language but not yet Android and am confused about connecting all the dots to build an app. I don't know how to best use my time to build an app efficiently, from start to finish.

I'm located in the bay area and am willing to take an internship, drive, skype, shadow in-office to learn from any experienced Mobile Developers.

She goes to my university and is my major and every semester we've had at least 3 classes together and we hung out almost every second of every day. After what was my third summer away from her (internships), I realized that long distance wasn't really what I wanted and I knew that chances are that she wouldn't get a job in the same city as me so I broke it off. It wasn't really bad over the summer but here at school I see her in classes almost every day and we still continue to be really good friends. However it's killing me on the inside that like I'm sleeping alone every single night when she's two blocks away and I know I still have feelings for her. Like I keep on getting upset ever time I see couples holding hands walking down the street.

Senior year has been no fun because I don't really want to go to bars if I'm not dancing with a girl and I don't plan on getting to know any girls that well because I'm graduating and moving halfway across the country anyways. Not sure what to do... I don't have many friends that are that close because me and her used to spend like all our time together. I'm trying to cut back talking to her on fb/in person because I don't really know what else to do but part of me feels like I'll just completely lose her if i do that and I'm not sure if I want that. When I broke up with her, I just never in my wildest dreams thought that I would be the one unhappy.

She still doesn't know where she's going to be full time so it doesn't make sense to try to get back together because if she doesn't end up in the same city as me, both of us don't want to do long distance. I'm just not sure how to stop feeling crappy."

Here is the main list: [REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp) Last summer I had a REU and that experience is what got me my internship for this coming summer. I had no prior engineering work experience before last summer. Here are some thoughts:  

  -The application process is different than the majority of industry applications. For most applications you have to write a short essay and you need letters of recommendation. However, I have yet to see an REU require an interview of any sort. Customize each essay and get the best letters of recommendation that you can, even if they're not an engineering professor. None of my letters of rec were from engineering professors, two were from the humanities.  I simply wrote an essay, got letters of rec, applied and got in.

 -Don't just look in the engineering category. I was one of two engineering students, while the rest of the students were in the hard sciences. The REU I got wasn't even in the engineering category.   

 -Most REUs are geared towards people without any experience and/or geared towards minorities, women and people with disabilities.     

-You need to be a US Citizen since it's funded by the US gov't.

Edit: Some more tips from /u/SiTheGreat 
Tip: if there's a specific professor you want to work with that's associated with the REU program (most university pages give a list of potential PIs and their projects), email them and let them know that you're applying for their department's REU program and that you're interested in working with them specifically. They might decide to try to push you through. This worked for me.

Agree with not limiting yourself to the Engineering category (I did astrophysics); REUs are generally pretty prestigious, so it looks good on your resume no matter what you're doing. Also, apply to as many as catch your interest - between 6 and 13 was what most of the other REU students at my place applied for (I did 10 and only got into that one).

Edit2: From: /u/shl00  If you're Canadian, I believe the NSERC USRA (Undergraduate Student Research Award) is very similar! As a Software Engineering student I got one in Computer Science. It worked out for me because I (still) don't have any industry experience but I do have good grades (got it with an A- average)."

Said friend is also much much older than me and doesn't take no for an answer. I like the guy and I see what he's doing to help me out but I don't know maybe this isn't right way to do it.

I'm currently a Junior in college and I've never had an internship, so ,when offered a year-long opportunity of learning, it's hard to pass up. 

So here I am, asking if y'all think I should continue towards this internship for what it is or decline and aim for something more programming related for the summer."

I'm going to start an internship in a few months at a consulting firm and because of past experiences I'm feeling pretty weird wearing a suit all day.

Until now I have had big problems fitting all my belongings (like wallet, keys and cellphone) into the pockets of my suit, which then looked pretty bulky and made me feel like they were going to drop out. I have been thinking about buying a shoulder bag instead of using my university backpack, but still: Most of the things that I need on me, will be in the bag which is a problem for me.

1) Do you have any recommendations? How do you handle this situation?

Secondly I am going to be at the customer's site from Monday till Thursday thus being in need of a trolley/suitcase/travel equipment (hand luggage size). My question to you is:

2) What do you use for your work travel? Is one trolley/suitcase/travel equipment (all hand luggage size) enough?

My last question concerns your travel equipment:

3) What are the most important unusual things to travel with in your opinion?

Thank you very much for your help!"

I am super fortunate to have offers from 3 of my top companies (Google, Dropbox, Snapchat). 

I was given the choice of doing 3 shorter internships (11, 12, 12 weeks) or any combination of the 2 for longer internships (~16, ~16). I currently have one significant internship at a large tech company (not Big 4) and will have one more 4 month after this. 

I feel that Dropbox/Snapchat would provide the best opportunity for me in developing my technical skills. However, I also really like the Google team I was placed with and a big part is that I will be able to live with my friends that I haven't gotten to see for a while since the Google campus is right next to my school.

I'm just seeking some advice on what to choose and why. Does the shorter duration strongly affect my projects/experiences? I really want to be able to stay with my friends and do all 3 although I don't feel that I need 5 companies on my resume when I graduate.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I am having issues finding a job in accounting. I do not have any actual real world experience in working in accounting. I did not do any internships while in school, I did not participate in accounting clubs or made any professional connections, looking back those were bad moves. In general I was hitting the books keeping my head down and trying to do well in all of my classes. Based on the results now, I should have participated in accounting clubs for the professional connections, and I should have done an accounting internship, and said F**k the other classes, but whatever that part is over.

I am looking for help finding a job in California in the Los Angeles/ Long Beach/South-Bay area. Your feedback is appreciated.

Also for anyone reading this in a similar job search situation, this is what I have learned from over 6 months of the job search. You will need the following skills at least, and I am not saying I have all these skills but I am working on learning them. I do not recall any accounting professor relaying this information or any useful job information other than ""join the accounting club"", so here it is:

Any advice would be appreciated!

I am currently a 5th-year senior at a major public university, and I'm on track to graduate this coming May. I will be graduating with majors in philosophy and mathematics, and my GPA will likely be in the good but not great 3.3-3.4 range. 

I am finding that one of the career paths I'm most drawn to (among a couple others) is a career in public policy. I have been really interested in politics since middle school, and I have followed it closely for a long time. If I did decide to enter public policy as a career, my short-term goal would be to just get an entry-level position in public policy, and I think my long-term career goal would be to work on the policy teams of a Governor or Mayor or other policy-makers, or work for a think tank, or as a high level policy analyst. However, my current knowledge about public policy is amateurish and wide but shallow, and while I think my two majors have given me a lot of skills that would be useful in a public policy job (critical thinking, analytical writing, reading dense texts, some quantitative skills, etc.), I don't have much formal education in public policy itself.

Furthermore, I just don't have much work/internship experience at all (long story short, for most of college I dealt with various mental health issues, severe social anxiety chief among them, that prevented me from getting work experience), and my education, while I think it has been very good and valuable, has been very much at the theoretical level in both majors. I only have a little experience with databases or programming, for example, despite my math major.

I am scrambling at the moment to apply for internships in public policy for the coming spring semester, but there frankly aren't that many locally and I worry that my lack of formal education on politics and the social sciences will hinder me here.

So I guess I have a couple questions: Can I realistically get from where I am now to an entry-level job in public policy in the near future? If so, how?

Do I need to go to graduate school to achieve either the short-term or long-term goals here? "

I'm 21 and in my 4th year of university. I'm in a business degree. However, last year I added a CS major too. 

My parents are mad. I've dropped 4 classes since adding the CS major, the workload is overwhelming doing both of these degrees. They say I'm wasting money, and I should have tried to finish the courses with Ds. My cumulative GPA is about 3.4/4, and I'd like to keep grad school as an option in the future. I felt like Ws are better than Ds, if I'm better prepared for next time.

- The first 2.5 years of school, I took a full course load while working part time and finding an internship one summer.
- After this time, I started trying to work towards a CS major too. I resigned from my job, I knew it was going to be tough to do a double major:

Jan-Apr, 2016: 5 courses enrolled, 3 passed (2 business Ws)

May-August, 2016: 3 CS courses passed

Sept-Dec, 2016: 5 courses enrolled, I'm going to pass 3 (2 CS Ws)

I got great marks in everything that I've done so far, but 4 Ws are horrible. :[

----

I feel like crap about this, but I think it's better to drop instead of barely holding onto a passing D through the term. I didn't feel like I had as much time as I thought I would, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Here's what I got so far:

- Next term, I plan on taking 4 courses instead of 5 (retaking two of the Ws), and then I'll be done the original degree minus two electives. The prof is horrible though, but he's the only one who teaches these courses (he's just extremely difficult).

- I'll need 2 electives to graduate, so I thought I'd take 2 CS courses in summer term (retaking one W) to finish the degree with a minor in CS. The summer professor is MUCH better than the one I have currently, and I can work on finding a job while finishing up the degree.

- I'll figure out what I want to do after that. I'll have 10 more courses to go for a general CS degree, if I want to finish the second major.

---

I don't feel like my dad will understand. I've offered to pay for summer, since he told me that he'll pay for 4 years of school and that's it. Which is fine with me... but he's disappointed that I'm wasting money.

But I just received an interview offer from a small local company to intern during the school year. I've never actually interned before so I was wondering if having 2 internships would be better than just 1, even if the 1 would be from a well known company. I'll be applying for new grad positions next year, so I do want my resume to be the best that it can be, but I'm not sure how much an internship from an unknown company can help. Personally, I'd rather not do the internship at the small company because I know that it'll probably have a negative impact on my grades, but if it'll be a significant resume boost I'm willing to do it.

On a side note, the small company has thrown a few red flags. First of all, they offered me an interview without even looking at my resume. Second of all, I wouldn't be getting paid, but instead I'd be receiving school credit. Third of all, they asked me if I would be going to be staying in the area after I graduate. Personally I thought that was the weirdest of all of them because I'm a 3rd year, how would I know whether I'd be staying or not?

Initially I came in as a mechanical engineering major, switched to computer engineering (didn't lose any credits).  I liked physics and circuits but it just wasn't something I enjoyed enough to continue.  So I took about 6 months off to figure things out (considered transferring to a school closer to home in TX). 

I ended up snagging an internship at a really small software startup back home (austin TX) for a few months, boss agreed I had a bit of a knack for software dev.  I decided to return to Boston in the summer, only had one applicable class to take in order to transfer to computer science at Northeastern.  I took that one class and with a bit of effort landed a job as an intern at an Tech Stars startup, continued working for them until August of 2016 (they currently reside at the Harvard Innovation Lab).  My time their gave me some serious data science experience, including machine learning and NLP.  Got to work with a previous amazon AI engineer and a PHD from CSAIL working on machine learning integrations which was pretty cool.

Fast forward to current.  I've really been disenfranchised with my CS education.  Grading criteria is idiotic, and my side interests in blockchain work have only been getting stronger.  All started when I got involved with the Ethereum community back in 2014.  Long story short with my major change and time off I still have about 3.75 semesters left before graduation.

I was really fed up and mentally not in a great place, thinking about how much I enjoy working (in contrast to school) I decided to start contacting recruiters I knew in the space along with prior connections  and spammed angellist a bit.

Within the week I had 7 interviews, 4 offers came back.  2 were very early stage startups on the west coast (both blockchain related) their offers were good, however, I don't have a lot of cash on hand and early stage startups are risky (especially those without funding).  I got another offer from a more established blockchain startup that was profitable and shipping (est. valuation of $5mil).  I had some of the hardest technical interviews I've encountered yet but managed to make it through.  By some act of god they liked my projects and were impressed with my blockchain knowledge.  This is coming from the founders, all of which are Stanford PHD's.

So, their offer was $5k for the first two ""trial months"".  After that they said I can either decide to go back to NU or come on full time as employee #4 with a starting salary of $85k with healthcare (PPO plan) and 1% equity (with a very liberal vesting cycle).

I'm definitely on the fence as to if I really want to leave college or not.  Worst case I can look at this as a solid 6-8 month internship (unfortunately NU won't let me use this as a co-op since it's so time sensitive and my co-op cycle wont allow for it).

What do you guys think?  I just don't have a great idea of what dev salaries outside of the big 4 are in the bay area / what median starting salaries for college grads are.  My biggest angle here is that this is an entry into an industry with huge potential, at a startup working in the blockchain space actually selling something outside of the financial space while also turning a profit.  This is exactly what I'd do in 2yrs if / when I graduated.

Here is my background:

Age: Late 20s

Bachelor’s: English (degree from a foreign university)

Classroom Experience: 3 years of ELA  (I was head teacher for 2 of those) and 4 years of ESL----both in two Asian countries with elementary and junior high school students

Language Skills: Bilingual

Certification: No state-approved teacher certification

Level Preference: Elementary and Middle School



As of now, I have three options:

(1)	Find any teaching job (private or public) that would accept a non-certifiied teacher and then go to night school to get my certification.

(2)	Find a non-teaching job and then go to night school to get my certification.

(3)	Enroll in a 1-year intensive certification program (those programs that include a Master’s, year-long internship, etc).


Looking at my background, which option would be best to pursue? It would be wonderful if I could get a job without any certification but I know that will be a difficult feat in my case. If you do recommend night school or intensive programs, do you have any school suggestions? I am specifically looking around the Seattle area and suburbs and not on the east side of the state. 

Thank you so much for your help, teachers! I am literally stuck with how to proceed so your suggestions will be very helpful! "

I thank you all for your help and consultation, you were a big part in this :)

When putting the parts together I had nearly no problems. I just had to push the motherboard and graphics card a bit to the desired location, so that the screw holes would line up.

The big task was connecting the cables and the cable management (which also kinda ended up bad but meh, it works). 

I guess a mATX case is also more difficult to handle but I wanted a small case.
When connecting the 8 pin CPU power I had to shove my index and middle finger in between CPU cooler and the case ""roof"" and after about half an hour I finally managed to get that connector to stay there, robustly connected. 

Cable managment was also difficult, getting the cables to fit somewhere, not taking up too much space on the other side so that the side panel would still fit on and connecting 3 SATA drives. Because of the spacial issues I actually had to use one additional drives power cable from the PSU because I couldn't get one cable to go from the HDD and SSD up to the ODD^^

But all in all I manged it and am very happy.

Here are some pictures, in some I'm playing with the lighting of my RX 480 :)

For example, they were preparing to do a huge migration of their outdated technology to newer ones. I have experience doing this exact migration at my previous internship. If the offer is non-negotiable, I also asked for an extension on the deadline to decide, so that I can wait for other companies that I was waiting to hear back from (after great final interviews from my POV). 

The original deadline to accept is tomorrow, and she hasn't replied to neither the negotiation nor the extension request. What could be causing the delay?

Currently at a job that’s great. Good coworkers and manager. Relaxed environment. Good pay. Flexible hours and a short 10 minute drive from home that’s next to my school. 
I started at a more administrative role and then moved into this team after they determined it was a good fit. The initial project we were doing was great, lots of scripting and interesting work.

The problem is I’m not really learning anything anymore and it’s gotten really monotonous. On the side we were supporting a few applications but since our team got smaller that’s taking up a lot more of our time. Also our current project we’re working on is entirely interfacing with users and sending emails. The projects on the pipeline are more of the same. So my current day consists of responding to emails, doing tickets (mostly password resetting), and sending emails.  I’d like to move around within the company but at the end of the day I eventually want to be a software dev and not IT. If I stay they’d want me to stay with the team or at the very least spend most of my time on IT related tasks. 

What I was considering doing is leaving at the end of the year and spending my last two semesters focusing on school (which took a bit of a dip when I started working) and working on my portfolio and software dev skills. I feel like I’m really inexperienced because of the focus on theory in school and the unrelated skills at work.  
This last point is sort of lazy but I also just want to enjoy the last bit of college I have left before I spend the rest of my life working. I miss the days of just binge watching anime/playing video games and I feel like once I start working those days are going to be rare. 

**TL;DR** Should I leave a good but boring and unrelated to my career goals job to focus on school, build my portfolio/skills and enjoy the last bit of college.

I wanted to start by giving a little information about myself to be able to give everyone the best explanation of my problem. 

I am currently an undergraduate and the Community College Level. I am majoring in Computer Science and I do not know a lick of programming, but I have been working with and on computers ever since I can remember. They truly fascinate me. I am currently enrolled in Trigonometry for next semester. I had to go back and complete two other Algebra courses to rebuild my foundation in mathematics which is vital to a computer science degree. I am doing great and I have actually really surprised myself in mathematics in ways that I never thought were possible for me to comprehend. I am also trying to complete a BS in CS so I can eventually go to graduate school and study Forensics. I would like to eventually become a Computer Forensics Analyst.

I was wondering what I should do to prepare for trigonometry next semester. Should I read up on some things? Maybe do a little research? I have never taken anything higher than college Algebra itself so I want to be prepared for my courses ahead of me. 

Other Questions Relatable to topic:

-Would you recommend internship over the summer?

-Is there any way I could prepare for my math and programming courses before I take them? (C++, Cal 1-4, Physics)

-Should I get my associates degree before transferring?

Believe it or not,  I have asked multiple Advisors, Counselors, and even my instructors these questions and they never have a solid answer! I just want to find what is going to work best with me and give me the opportunity to be able to work in the CS field! Any information and/or personal experience would be great! Thanks so much!"

21 years old student in university, currently on internship making 50k a year, will be back in school after April (only part time job income after that)

Car: 20k equity, bought it for 30k cash in January 2016 (big mistake on my part)

TFSA: about 25k in total (maxed out), half CPP with (second most aggressive allocation, positive gain), the other half are 80% CJR.B and DR.TO (losing money, about 2.5k so far for these 2)

RRSP: about 6k with mostly Amazon stocks and 10% TD stocks. I am getting charged about 100 bucks a year from fees because this is a self directed RRSP and I don't have more than 25k in it to avoid fees.

Saving: about 10k in cash with about 8-9k more student loans coming in January 2017 (only 600 will go to tuition)

LOC: 20k student LOC, unused.

Net income after expenses (food, insurance, etc) and paying some of my parents mortgage comes to about 800 a month.

So I made some mistakes of buying an expensive car when I got my internship and I regret it a lot. My plan is to put 5500 into my TFSA in January and sell my stocks and just stick with CCP portfolio for a long time. and about 3k into my RRSP (room for 2016), what should I do in my RRSP? should I sell everything and implement CCP portfolio? Or get a TD e series fund RRSP account to avoid the 100 bucks a year fees.

 also I am planning to sell my car for 20k and get some cash back from it, and just get a car for about 5k and just drive it until it dies. Because my intnership is over next April and I want to travel a bit in the summer I will need a lot of cash saved up. What do you guys think what I should do?"

5dkf1m,20,2016-11-17,Advice for Computer Science Students in their First Year of Degree Program,AyushiJha,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/5dkf1m/advice_for_computer_science_students_in_their/,"I am currently a final year undergraduate. Here I have gathered some advice I wish someone told me when I was in my first year of computer science engineering program. The points mentioned below are my opinion, seniors' advice, general advice, experience (both mine and others), etc.

After getting their computer science degree, students tend to take up the following career paths:

 - Job
 - Research (MS/PhD)
 - MBA (Management)
 - Other


Here I'll summarise what I have learnt about how to make sure your career path is set.  


First of all, you need to decide which path you actually want to take. It is difficult for a first year student to know what they want four years later, but you have a strong inclination towards something, like you know you are interested in becoming a professor, or you want to become a CEO, you can use these tips to help gain an early advantage. For others, I would recommend trying out different things, dabble in research work, try managing a college festival, etc. etc. There are two ways you can decide what your career path:

 - **Top Down Approach**: In this approach, you assume that you like everything. Now, try your hand at different projects, research work, competitive programming, organising events to name a few. You will start to realise that some paths just aren't interesting enough for you. Or you'll get interested in a single path and want to devote all your time to that. Use the method of elimination to finally decide what you really want. Of course, this might take you one or two years, but try to decide before the pre-final year.
 - **Bottom Up Approach**: Assume that you are not interested in anything. Now, passively try out one thing at a time, like spending a few days in a competitive programming challenge, or focusing on a pet project, volunteer for an event at your college, offer help to your seniors in their dissertation work/read some papers. This way, best case scenario you may not have to try everything to find your calling. You have also created a network of contacts you might need if you later decided to switch your decisions.

The main aim of this post was not to help you decide what you wanted to be, but a step-by-step guide about how to go there quickly, by utilising each year of your college/university. 
***
Now that you have decided what you want to do, here is how you can excel in each career path:

 - **Research** : Do you want to pursue further education (MS/PhD) in a prestigious university? Most of the universities in the top 20 expect you to have published at least 1 research paper in an international journal. Also, you need letters of recommendation from 2-3 professors or someone highly recognised in academic community. Recommendations from employers do not have much value. For getting a good recommendation from 2-3 professors, you need to work closely with them. Try to get into your college's research community as early as possible. Let the professors know early on that you want to work under them, so that you don't miss out any opportunity. Identify what research topics you are interested in, read papers in that topic. If your university doesn't have a good ratio of professors, there are many other universities providing research opportunities during the summer or winter breaks. The more closely you work with the professor, the more you understand how research works, and definitely gives you advantage in the pursuit of your master's.

 - **Job**: Many students want to get a job as soon as they get their degree. The standard procedure for such ""freshers"" is a technical test (like Google APAC scholar test), followed by 4-5 interviews. This is where competitive programming gives you an edge. The coding tests, or ""hiring challenges"" usually comprise of a series of programming based questions, mostly from data structures and algorithms. The speed of solving, efficiency of your solution, optimal solution, all these factors are taken into account. Don't waste your time solving 100 easy-medium questions. Read the most common questions asked in your dream company, which will most likely include graphs, dynamic programming problems, trees, graph traversals, etc. Learn how to solve them, and practise several variations of these problems. The higher your proficiency in these types of problems, the better your job. After you clear the first round, the kind of questions might change. Practise solving questions on paper or whiteboard. other than programming, you may be asked questions related to core computer science subjects. Some of the most important subjects are operating systems, database management systems, data structures and algorithms, cloud computing, networking (most likely for a network engineer profile). Research a company before the interview, and study accordingly. 

 - **MBA**: MBA gives you a management degree. The chain is usually manager -&gt; director -&gt; CEO. With many sublevels in between. It is possible to become a technical/project manager in a company after 4-5 years without a management degree also. Admission to an MBA program requires at least 1-2 years of job experience. As a manager, you are expected to lead others. To get into a good business school, you need to display excellent leadership qualities. Aim for becoming a president or top leadership post in a university club/fest/etc. If you know you want to get an MBA, try getting into a club from the first year itself. Generally the most persistent ones are awarded top posts in the club by the time they reach their final year. Give talks, organise seminars, gain experience from internships.

I'm still taking my last pre-req for McIntire (the Commerce school) and will be taking pre-reqs for declaring a CS major next semester (Discrete Math, Software Development Methods, and Mathematical Probability as an elective).

I have no previous CS experience but I genuinely enjoy my first class and can see myself doing it as a career. I'm most likely going to be interning at a top-ranked S&amp;T position this summer, which isn't really related to quant at all but still worth mentioning. I also have the opportunity to research as an undergrad with a really brilliant cloud-computing professor who knows that I'm way below the average skill level of her PhD students but who was still willing to reach out for a grant because of my interest in her work. 

I was wondering what would be the best way to position myself to get a quant-related internship the summer after my Junior year (Summer 2018), and if it's even possible. I'm going to look into setting up a github and trying to learn as much as possible on my own over the coming year and a half, but aside from that, what can I do to really stand out? Also, where should I be looking for internship positions, since a lot of firms hire almost exclusively from ivys? (I'd be willing to take unpaid work if it was relevant)

Any advice is really appreciate"

Depression?,Tar__Toast,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5dkmzb/is_this_cyclothymia_anxiety_depression/,"I have just recently gotten to the point where i am willing to admit that I may need to get some help. I am working on finding a psychiatrist, but this is difficult since I have no insurance. But I am just curious if anybody has some insight into what these symptoms sound like. Or maybe nothing is wrong and I just need to get my shit together... 

Most of the time, I am depressed. I am exhausted. I spend most of my day fighting away negative thoughts about how nobody likes me and shit like that. And even when I am doing something that I love, I rarely enjoy it, or there is an underlying emptiness. i constantly distract myself to not think about all of the shit I have to take care of before I graduate. I don't know if I have depression that causes anxiety, or anxiety that depresses me. 

But I have periods of time that I feel great. Usually only for a few days. But often times I don't just feel great, but I am being like crazy fucking productive. And then I just lose all hope out of nowhere and go back to seeing the bad in everything, mostly myself. 

There are other times where I just feel crazy fucking agitated. Like, I keep thinking about all the bullshit that I am not doing, like homework or whatever, and I just get pissed. I usually ignore this pretty well, but sometimes it results in my yelling in my car or throwing something across the room.  

So yeah.. I think I am probably forgetting a lot of details that I wanted to give. But I am just so sick of this. I have become a fucking horrible student. I was supposed to be starting my internship this next semester, but I met with a professor to tell him I need to postpone until I figure this out. I don't think it would be responsible for me to start my internship before I've made some forward momentum on figuring this out. 

Sooop... is this normal? Like, I know everyone is their own harshest critic... but I am more of an unrelenting bully to myself. I just can't imagine that everyone around me is thinking the way I do. My own mind stands in the way of my success more than anything. At least I tell myself that. My biggest fear is that I am just hoping for a diagnosis to make an excuse for the fact that I am unable to live as a functional adult. 

So, any input or advice would be lovely. Thanks :)"

Even though I have been slowly increasing my gpa, I will end up just scraping by with a 3.0 gpa upon graduation.

5dmpzg,1,2016-11-18,[Build Upgrade] Looking to upgrade my CPU/MOBO in order to increase FPS in CS:GO,Rallerbabz,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5dmpzg/build_upgrade_looking_to_upgrade_my_cpumobo_in/,"Hi /r/buildapc,

I'm looking to do an upgrade in order to run CS:GO properly. It's kind of disappointing that it has to happen, as I used to go 200+ FPS just one year ago and nothing in my build has changed since then, just bad optimized updates from Valve. I've a 144 HZ monitor and I am therefore looking to, under no circumstances going below 150 FPS, preferably above 200 FPS at all time. I know it's a super bad optimized game, so I'm hoping someone in here knows which CPU would do best. A friend of mine is still struggling with FPS problems with his brand new i5 system, which should destroy such a simple game.

I'm also looking for a CPU that will last me, hopefully, as long as my i7 920 has lasted me, maybe even longer. I've a 212 EVO cooler on my CPU that I can reuse, I guess.

My [current build](http://pcpartpicker.com/list/znryVY),  that gives me around 100 FPS in CS:GO...

I've tried to overclock it, it gave me a FPS boost, however not enough and the increased power usage is going to make it more expensive than buying a new CPU/mobo in the long run I think.

Budget is hard to tell, I live in Denmark so I imagine the prices are a bit different here. Preferably below 2000 DKK (285 dollars). I'm able to buy it a bit cheaper than retail price as I'm an intern in a hardware store, but usually I tend to buy from the second hand market. Not really sure if I should go for new or used?

I'm also not sure if Black Friday will bring any good deals - some people say it's just crap that's on sale, but it's next friday and I'm not exactly in a hurry as my system works just fine. So I guess I'm also looking for some suggestion on what to look for at Black Friday - which CPUs and mobo would be ideal for my need."

5dnl9v,1,2016-11-18,What do you think about small non-startup company?,blanceXR,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5dnl9v/what_do_you_think_about_small_nonstartup_company/,"I am a new grad and I currently have several offers, one is a medium well-know company (not as well as FB, Google but still) based in SF with around 500-1000 engineers post IPO for quite some times, let's say Company A.

another one, company B, is a smaller one with 100-300 engineers based on Seattle. 
Company B was a startup several years ago, and bought by a large non-tech company 2-3 years ago for ~ 1 bil. They used to hire only experienced people until they're bought, since then they started to do internship and hire new grads.  


The overall compensation between the two company are about the same considering tax and COL ($400/mo difference after tax).

I currently prefer company B because:
* I like the city. Lower COL, less stressful (I think)
* I like the team. Most of the teammates are senior level, they build the core system architectures like user database, login systems etc. 
* The work life balance seems pretty good. You can literally work from home all the time.

However, there are some concerns. First is that they pay nice, but no way to make big money (So that I can buy a house). Their stock price is basically not moving while Company A's is like a roller coaster.
Second is that everyone I asked are saying that SF has more oppurtunity plus Company A is well-known which combined together can help with my future career. As a young guy I need to take more risk and not care about housing, work/life balance, stable job etc.. and a larger company can teach me more than a small company.

Also it seems like it is only normal for someone to switch jobs every 2-4 years to get pay raise while very few people are staying with one company, not to mention a ""Small"" company.  


Any help or insights are greatly appreciated!

5dnyt5,1,2016-11-18,Do I stand a chance at admission?,NomChompsky92,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/5dnyt5/do_i_stand_a_chance_at_admission/,"Hey all,

I'm an RF Spectrum Engineer currently working for a large defense contractor in the DMV area. While I enjoy the work that I do here, I've been thinking very seriously about a career switch to software development, with the intention of ultimately working for a startup or one of the resident tech juggernauts (Google, FB, etc.). I received a much more hardware-oriented degree in EE at the University of Maryland, with a very ehhh GPA (little better than 3.1). I've only recently graduated, and have worked at my current company for one summer as an intern, and as a full-time hire after graduation for a little over a year now (I'm doing well here and believe it wouldn't be hard to get work references)

My software development experience is fairly narrow. I've taken a few classes in C and lower level HDL in undergrad, as well as completed a few of the Codeacademy courses in Python and Java (very beginner level, I know, just wanted to learn the syntax mainly). 

In my work, I've picked up Excel VBA and used it to build a number of ad-hoc engineering tools, as well as a bit of Python script to manipulate geographic data in QGIS.

In order to build a portfolio for myself and increase the chances I'm hired at a large private tech firm, I've been considering four options: Traditional Masters in Comp. Sci, OMSCS in Comp Sci (GA Tech or other), MOOC, or programming bootcamp.

Do I stand a chance at admission to GA Tech's OMSCS program?
Would it be worth it to complete one of Udacity's nanodegrees first, to increase my odds?
If I don't stand a chance either way, which of these other options do you think is my best bet to break into this field?

The option I'm probably considering the least right now is the traditional Masters degree route, seeing as my GPA isn't great, I don't have an undergrad in CS, and of course, the much greater cost of a traditional degree (would it be worth it to pay that much more for a degree from a lesser school? I'm fairly sure my GPA would prohibit me from admission to a graduate degree at my own alma mater)

Thanks in advance!

I had a few great internships, one in supply chain operations, and another as a project manager, but I basically realized I wanted to become more technical and commit myself to a career in Software Engineering. I landed a job at an Oracle software consulting firm in San Francisco, where I've worked as an Implementation Engineer for the past 2 years, but the role is far less technical than I originally imagined (think drag-and-drop configuration) and honestly, the stability of the firm is a little shaky. We're already quite small, and a recent lack of projects has resulted in our leadership shutting the company down for a few weeks during the holidays. Needless to say, I don't think I can see a future here so I've been applying fairly aggressively at a number of different companies.  
   
  
I haven't received many callbacks, and I've had the most success through Hired, which got me 3 interviews. I recently made it to the final round with a well-known San Francisco start up for a Software Engineering role, which in of itself was very validating, but I just got a call from the recruiter saying I didn't get the job. I floundered a bit during the technical interviews, especially with some of the JavaScript use cases I hadn't studied (using call/apply to set scope for computed property functions) and needed a little too much guidance from my interviewers. Without being too melodramatic, this was a blow to my ego and has left me wondering if I even have the right skill-set to be applying for the roles I want.  
   
  
Basically, where I'm at now, I don't know how much longer I can ride out my current job while I continue to apply. I'm considering applying for graduate MSCS programs, but that would likely require me to make up undergrad courses at community college before I could have a strong application. Are there any of you who have been stuck in a similar situation? After this last interview, I'm really not sure if my technical chops are up to snuff to even bother applying for full-time Software Engineering positions. I'm waffling on whether I need to go back to school to fill in the missing pieces, or just suck it up and keep studying and applying. I've attached my resume for context and would greatly appreciate any opinions, insights, or feedback. Thank you!

25yo Hispanic Male

Gmat: Officially taking Dec 17, scoring around 720 on gmatprep tests, aiming for 750+

College: Tulane - Presidential Scholarship 

Degree: Finance, cum laude (3.5 or 3.49 can't recall)

Grad Degree: Masters in Accounting, cum laude (3.33)
 
Work:
10 months - Financial Analyst for small firm, a family company that gave me a job until I found something I wanted to do

1.5 years - Supply Chain Analyst for a small international chemical manufacturing company - interviewed for FA position but they wanted me to learn more of the industry so put me in supply chain. Turned out that was a lie and there was no opportunity for me to move. Hate that company ha

Current - 6months - Business Analyst for a FinTech Startup - I do sales/marketing analytics as well as loan pricing and modeling. Should get a promotion after a full year. This is a rapidly growing company and well known in the credit space. WSJ article a few weeks ago on us.

EC: 
Currently a mentor for SCORE, which is an organization that mentors small business owners in all areas. I focus on finance/accounting/strategy

Have volunteered with Junior Achievement on multiple occasions.

Goals: MBB Consulting. I really didn't know what I wanted to do in college until I took a strategy class and a case competition class (my team won). By the time I realized what I enjoyed it was really too late for me to get in through recruiting. I have since tried to gain as much experience as I can in different areas of a business. I have a friends in strategy consulting (Deloitte &amp; Accenture) and I really do think I will enjoy it.

I know my background is different but I think I can spin it right. I had an audit internship with PwC which made me realize that accounting is not a career for me. I also did an equity research internship which I enjoyed and even have a published report. I had a very hard time finding work after school in that field without moving to NYC just to interview. Tulane is in New Orleans which has little professional job opportunities or even top companies recruiting on campus so it was a very hard struggle to find a position anywhere. Most people I knew that got jobs went to either an account executive role or had amazing connections. I felt like I slipped through the cracks.

My GPA was also a 3.65 before my 5th year which I stopped caring as much and focused on job hunting. Which obviously didn't really pay off for me. I also had serious depression my final years in college which is why my GPA is low. I need an MBA to rebrand myself because I know I am more than capable but I just lack opportunities.

Skills: Python, Excel (VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE: don't have to use a keyboard, write macros, etc), PowerPoint (build decks regularly at my job), SQL, R

Where can I be competitive at? I am looking at Sloan, Darden, UCLA, Fuqua, Goizueta, Columbia, Booth, Harvard (very interesting connection to Harvard - Harvard brought my grand father to America for medical research) but I know my ""prestige"" may not be there. And one more thing which I could probably put on an essay (not sure) - my father never graduated college and my mom got a worthless degree 

I am saving for a admissions consultant because I know I will need one given my background but what do you guys think?

EDIT: I plan on applying Fall 2017. By matriculation I should have two years at my current company and 2 years at SCORE

EDIT2: Scholarship money is very important to me but M7 is by far the biggest deal for me.

5duzet,1,2016-11-19,Mid twenties - no hard skills - looking for advice!,Woke_but_Broke,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5duzet/mid_twenties_no_hard_skills_looking_for_advice/,"Hello, r/Advice!

Honestly, I am admittedly hesitant in writing this out because some could very possibly deem this post as nothing more than a whiny rant. To be clear - in posting this, I am not aiming to elicit pity or validation; rather, I am seeking advice - be it a point in the right direction or even a reality check. This is a throwaway account. With the disclaimer out of the way:

Let's start with the positives!

I am in my mid twenties. am in good health, have a college degree, and a wife who is not only beautiful mentally and physically, but also supportive. Outside of joint college debt of around 45k that is currently being managed, we are in great financial shape and have a pretty decent amount of savings (almost 10k). I am currently working an office job for an up-and-coming company that I strongly believe will give me great job security - if I continue working there - for years to come. I have a supportive, loving family and a small yet awesome group of friends. For all of these things, I am extremely fortunate and very thankful.

Reason for my post (the negatives):

*My college degree is basically useless (interdisciplinary studies)

*My current job (I started a little over three months ago) does absolutely nothing in scratching my deep-seated itch to try to make a positive impact on the world: i.e helping/protecting others, resolving issues that plague society, bringing to justice the corrupt and criminal, etc.. I know for a fact that the only difference me and my coworkers make is maybe adding on a few cents to the company's stock. Feels pointless and like a waste of potential. Though I tell myself that my job IS important for our financial well-being and my resume, I think my brain is fighting back that notion very strongly at a sub-conscious level. I have a hard time absorbing vital info that is essential to me in performing the job optimally. I have the ""new guy amnesty period"" for a little while longer, but I know that soon, I will fall behind in what is expected of me and will probably start having a hard time... this is very frustrating because I know that, when I am interested in something, my brain obsesses about it and acts like a sponge! It is extremely frustrating to not be able to absorb the knowledge needed to do my job independently and at high efficiency. I am already seeing coworkers hired around the same time as me transitioning from the ""fake-it-till-you-make-it"" stage to actually knowing the ins-and-outs of the occupation...whereas I feel like I am going to be stuck eternally in the ""faking"" stage. I feel like my brain is more occupied with things it deems more important - such as the state of our government, ever-increasing ideological polarization fueled by the media, Russia having a Satan II missile that can wipe out areas as big as Texas, how our society is becoming increasingly reliant on (and ignorant of the consequences of) technology that is utilized to both help it and exploit it... and so on. These are examples of the types of issues I have been fixated on since childhood. My brain naturally comes back to them time and time again.

Bottom line: I am bored, my job feels overwhelmingly pointless in the grand scheme of things, though I am currently performing to standards, and perhaps am even considered promising, I feel like a fraud, and my brain seems to be rejecting any attempts at just sucking it up and learning the ins and outs of said job.  I know im not living up to my potential both in the occupation I am currently in, and how I am performing doing it. It is driving me mad, and I know I need to do something else - risk of financial fallout be damned. I feel like a fish trying to climb a tree. I know I am not at all stupid, but I just in no way feel cut out for what I am currently doing.

I am pretty certain that I am smart. I was in the gifted and talented program in school, and I have always done well at IQ and aptitude tests taken over the years. 

Here's the catch though: I never really harnessed it. Instead of developing study skills and trying to max out my potential for the first 20+ years of my life, I took the path of least resistance. I never studied in grade school (though i got good grades and made honors) and I took easy classes in college to continue that trend - hence my useless interdisciplinary degree. Anything that requires study I avoided like the plague, and I regret that immensely. I didn't come out of undergrad with any hard skills, but I did come out with a pretty fried attention span due to probably too much gaming and social media, as well as a mediocre work ethic that I am ashamed of. ""Hard work beats talent when talent isn't working hard"" is so very true, and now, though I know I have some degree of talent, I very much feel behind the curve because I never really worked hard...

Now, with all of this in mind, armed with 20/20 hindsight and a much more mature outlook on life, I am seriously considering going back to school. I know I need to go back for something I am passionate about, because after years of uninspiring jobs, it seems that having a purpose and a passion behind something I do will really enable me to live up to my full potential (my brain won't be constantly rebelling against me). I am very much interested in international relations, computer science,  and politics in general, but due to my lack of study skills I have an overall shallow understanding of those fields. For this reason, I am really considering getting another bachelors and then pursuing a Masters, seeing that I have more than likely a pretty sloppy educational foundation to go into grad school with...Getting another bachelors before a Masters could really open more doors for internship opportunities as well.

Reading this over, this is more than likely coming across as a disorganized rant. I probably should talk to a psychologist or something. Perhaps this whole wall of text comes off as pretentious and entitled. I am very aware that many people never end up in the career field that they are interested in or have a passion for. Should I just accept that perhaps that reality is for me too and I should just be thankful for what I have now? I am just looking for advice and am thankful to receive any and all feedback and/or direction. thank you!

Applying for CS major in all and put Computer Eng./Undecided for alternate.


Demographics: Asian(Chinese)/White male

GPA: Freshman-&gt;Junior year: 3.59 at a top 200 in U.S. school, GPA senior year is currently 3.83 and looks like it will probably end up in the 3.8-3.9 range by the end of the semester (have A's in all classes except for a B in French III)(All unweighted GPA I should add)

Course load has been pretty heavy throughout highschool, I've been in honors/AP math every year except junior where I took Calc instead of AP Calc because I got a C/C+ in Honors Pre-Calc so I recognized that I needed to take a step back and re-evaluate my study habits.  

AP classes taken so far: AP Physics and AP Comp Sci

AP Classes Senior year: AP Micro/Macro Econ, AP Stats, AP English Lit and Project Lead the Way Biomedical Engineering (counted as a dual enrollment)

ACT: 31 SAT(old): 2020

Extracurricular: National Honor Society, Volunteering at random places (art museum, senior center, etc..), 2 summer internships at a local tech startup as a technical intern (programming, data entry, coffee runs, etc..), 1yr JV tennis/3 yr Varsity tennis, and currently involved in the HOSA competition (national biomedical science competition) 

I have a large legacy at UW Madison (grandpa, dad, dom all did undergrad there and grandpa was a professor at UW Eau Claire), and I currently live in Seattle, so I get in-state treatment for UW Seattle.

----
So I think the thing I'm really worried about here is the fact that in sophomore year I got a solid C/C+ in pre-calc which is a huge outlier in my grade trend.  I'm also worried about highlighting my great performance senior year on my apps, since for the schools I've applied to so far, only my freshman-&gt;junior year grades are being seen and I feel like in senior year I've finally just figured everything out and I feel like I'm totally ready to take on any academic challenge whereas I was still figuring things out freshman-&gt;junior year.  I mean, if they defer me and ask for my current grade report, that's one thing, but I feel like by being deferred, there is already some bias placed on your application.  

Is there some way I can really highlight the academic growth I've experienced in senior year on my apps? 

------

On a side note: does anyone know how long it takes to get a response for rolling admissions typically? I applied to University of Minnesota on Sept 26 for the Nov 1st priority deadline and I still haven't gotten a response.

Also, other schools I'm applying to:

UC Berkeley (my way out there school)

UCLA

University of Illinois - Urbana

UMinn-Twin Cities

Western Washington University (safety)

Also any suggestions for match schools would be greatly appreciated!!"

I started college back in 2009 and did horribly for a few years and being an addict.  This completely wrecked my GPA 

I've come back to college as a CS major(never settled on a major for more than 2 semesters before cs) and have been doing much better this time around (especially being 2.5+ years sober)

I've got a Major GPA of 3.23 and am on track to get it even higher this semester. However my Cumulative GPA is at 2.36 because of how poorly I did my first time around and how that stays on my transcript (talked to records, nothing they can do about it) 

It truly sucks being an A and B level student who can't apply for internships because so many places seem to have a 3.0 minimum. 

What can I do to make sure I get a decent internship? I have a real passion for computer science and feel that I am capable of really good work. Like really, this field keeps me sane. 

Some basic info:
basically only have school projects but working on more. 
Taken Data Structures and got through with an A.  
Consider myself proficient for a student with c++ and especially Java. 

Any advice is really appreciated

+ CGPA: 98.66/100. Three times Dean's Lists and several other monetary awards for academic performance.

+ TOEFL: 102. GRE: 147 Verbal, 166 Quant, 4.0 Writing. I screwed up the Verbal test so bad because I did not have enough time preparing for it. Also, I thought I did well on the Quant test but somehow I got only 166, which was a bit lower than my expectation.

+ Had a paper accepted to the short paper track of an international conference.

+ Did an internship at Google. Had 6 or 7 side-projects. One of them is an Android app, which currently has about 100.000 downloads and an average rating of 4.5+.


I really want to retake my GRE but it seems quite late at this point and I also feel like I want to do other meaningful things rather than just memorizing words that I would never use outside of this test.

I have been trying to find out what I can do and what I can excel at. Whether it's programming, electronics, design or modelling or any other thing, but I am not able to. I don't have any skills and I am not interested in anything that can be related to a professional career. I spend most of the days, working out, cooking, listening to music, video gaming and walking in the city. I just go to work 2 days a week and go back home and don't attend classes anymore.

I realize that it's just a matter of time before I graduate and find myself jobless, no money and might not be able to find a job.

It's not depression, frustration or lack of motivation which is causing this problem. I have always had those just like any other healthy individual, and was able to manage through school and high school. But real life isn't high school and maybe I am not good as an engineer. But if I am not supposed to work in engineering, then what should I do.

sorry for writing all of this, I am just lost."

So I currently have two internship offers I am trying to decide between.

One offer is from Cerner in Kansas City, the other from Bank of America in Charlotte.

I was hoping you could give me advice with my job hunt and future career path options. In 2010, I graduated with a BA in Mass Communications &amp; Journalism. It took me until July of 2013 to find a job in my field (I had had several internships and did some freelance gigs but this was the first full-time, steady communications job). And I got very lucky as I started out as a Newscast Director at a TV station. Less than two years later I was promoted to Production Supervisor and Lead Director. After a year of that in April of 2016, I moved with my bf to Maryland near the DC area. My problem is all I have experience in is production television. I would be willing to work at a part-time production assistant or anything at all in news, but I can't seem to find an ""in"" here. I had a lot of responsibilities at my old station. We worked with a virtual set, we had loads of technical issues, we were a small group so I ended up booth producing for a year, doing social media, and a multitude of other tasks that weren't really related to my job. I also did a lot of video editing, but as I did not shoot any of the footage it didn't feel right using it for a demo reel. So after two months of getting absolutely no where with the TV stations up here, I opened up my search options. In June I got a job as a Marketing Assistant with a small company doing marketing, social media managing, and event planning among other duties. The thing is - I hate my job. It's a toxic environment. My old tv station was also toxic, but at the end of the day I loved what I did. 

So I have a couple of years experience in TV and about 5 months worth of experience in marketing. My bf has tried to talk me into going back to school, but out of state tuition is ridiculous. Also, we'll be moving next August, so by the time we've been in state long enough it won't be worth it to start school. Not to mention I'm almost done paying off my student loans which has been a tremendous feat, so I'm not sure I'm ready to take that plunge again.

Does anyone have any advice for someone looking to get into the communications field who only has a few years of experience and no demo reel? I feel like I get rejection after rejection and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The only thing I know of is to network. But how do you network without coming across as someone desperate for a job?  Or does anyone suggest going back to school to get a different job? "

Cloudera

* Would be on a team that works on a core, open source component of Apache Hadoop

Yelp

* Would be on a data mining team that uses machine learning

Twitter

* Would be on a back-end team (but not in SF)

NVIDIA

* Would be on a team doing work with AI.

I think I probably would learn more and have a diverse experience at Cloudera since I do already have a fair amount of machine learning experience already from a significant side project and have little experience in distributed systems. On the other hand, I would be able to apply much of what I know with machine learning at a much larger scale at Yelp. I would also value the opportunity to be in the Bay Area (which would be all three except Twitter) highly.

My main factors in a decision would be:

* how much will having the company and experience on my resume will help in landing interviews at top companies when it comes to full-time positions next year

* reputation of the engineering team

I'm a 21 year old senior, graduating in May 2017. I'm clueless to which direction I want to take my life, and I'm full of regret for not taking more advantages of the opportunities I had at college. I didn't join the debate team, the track club, nor the judo team....I partied a lot and chased women too much. Switched my major from psychology to Computer Science, double majored in math but dropped it...GPA is sitting around a 3.1 currently. Never really studied, and I have 5 withdrawals on my transcript. 

Suffered a lot of depression growing up, junior year (last year) was terrible and I contemplated committing suicide. Finally seeing someone helped a lot, I'm doing much better. I like to think I'm intelligent, and I'm confident I have very good social skills and can deal with a wide array of personality types. 

I just wanted to provide some background information about myself but ideally I'd like to work with technology in some aspect. I can program in Java and some C++ and taught myself how to do web development with Ruby on Rails. Thing is I did an internship over the summer, and absolutely hated the office life.... Would love a job where I'm active and could travel a lot. Even better if I made my own hours! but that's pushing it, right?

My post doesn't really contain a direct question, to reflect my mind's current state. I can provide elaboration on any portion / topic if it clears any confusion however.

5e53xx,3492,2016-11-21,"An unaired episode of The Food Network's ""Chopped!""",iia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5e53xx/an_unaired_episode_of_the_food_networks_chopped/,"I’m chef Geoffrey Zakarian’s personal espresso maker and latte-foam artist. Yes, that’s a real job. With benefits, in fact. Great health and dental.


One of the perks of my occupation, aside from hanging out with GZ and getting to eat many of my weekly meals at his outstanding restaurant, The Lamb’s Club, is the access I enjoy at The Food Network’s studios and associated properties. 


GZ is a pretty big deal over there, which I’m sure you know if you’ve watched the network for more than a few hours. Aside from Chopped!, which is his best-known show, he’s building a new audience with the Saturday morning feature, The Kitchen. His personality fits so well with whatever he’s in, though, and it’s just great to be a part of it.


I’m totally fanboying right now. Sorry. I hope that doesn’t sound disrespectful in the face of what happened.


GZ was shooting a few episodes of Chopped! with Aarón Sanchez, Marc Murphy, Alex Guarnaschelli, and Amanda Freitag. Ted Allen had just gotten there a bit late but immediately started poking fun at Aarón for a new tattoo on his hand that looked a little like a dick. (It totally did.)


I was in the backstage prep kitchen setting up Geoffrey’s personal Elektra Belle Epoque espresso machine. I’d shown him the preliminary designs for the three lattes I’d be making over the course of the day’s film schedule. Out of the 28, he chose *Spring*, by Pierre-Auguste Cot, *Seated Woman with a Red Kerchief*, by Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, and my favorite, *La Vérité sortant du puits armée de son martinet pour châtier l'humanité*, by Jean-Léon Gérôme. I’d save that one for last.


The first episode of the day went well. A Nigerian-born British chef led the way throughout, and it was no surprise that he won. After it was over and they were setting up for the next show, GZ brought me a piece of the truly-outstanding bread pudding dessert that’d clinched the win. Laphroaig scotch-soaked brioche sounds wrong, but in that chef’s capable hands, it was transcendental.


The four chefs waiting in the wings for the next episode were called onstage. Ted gave the rules in his inimitable style, and GZ, Amanda, and Alex sat at the judging table, trying not to laugh. If only the TV viewers knew how hard it was to maintain the air of seriousness the show tries to project.


Anyway, the appetizer round went pretty well. It was obvious the lady from Westport was going to get chopped, since she left out two basket ingredients while trying to make some weird fritters out of mussels and kale. Sure enough, when Ted lifted the cloche, her appetizer was under it. She didn’t even thank the judges for the opportunity to compete.


The entree round came next, after the crew cleaned the chefs’ stations. I was hard at work on *Spring*, but I kept glancing up at the monitors in the prep kitchen to see what was going on.


Right as Ted announced there were only five minutes left, I heard Ted and the judges gasp. Apparently one of the the chefs had cut himself. 


Now, anyone who’s watched Chopped! knows that chefs cut themselves all the time. It adds an extra element of suspense to the show as they have to wait for the EMT to bandage the wound and secure a glove, then they have to work through the pain and make sure not to get any blood on the food.


This cut was really bad. The problem was, the chef wouldn’t stop. Something was very, very wrong. GZ’s second latte was forgotten as I stared at the live feed from the studio monitors. All the other chefs stopped what they were doing as the EMT crew tried to attend to the chef. His name was Evan.


Evan was clearly disturbed. He shouted, “homemade sausage wins the round 87.2% of the time! Round one was close but this one will be a cut above!” He laughed hysterically and waved the knife at any approaching EMT. One of the producers came into the prep kitchen and dialed 911.


My eyes were glued to the monitor. GZ was calling to Evan and trying to talk some sense into him. He said he was a great chef and that he’d been to his restaurant before and really loved the Homard en Croûte. Evan didn’t acknowledge, so Aarón tried. He said something about being really proud of the work he’s done and it reminded him of himself when he was younger. No response, just frenzied cooking and prepping of the meat grinder.


Alex cried.


A pan Evan had been heating was smoking hot. To everyone’s dismay, he yelled “reduce by 25%,” then carved between his index and middle fingers all the way down to his wrist. Everyone except Evan screamed. Blood poured into the pan and steam erupted from the hot surface. The odor of boiling blood filled the studio. One of the prep chefs next to me puked into the sink.


Another EMT tried to grab Evan while he was busy cutting, but Evan reacted quickly and slashed the man’s shoulder. Not deep, but enough to make sure the EMT didn’t try anything again.


“Oh no,” I heard Aarón moan. Alex shrieked. The blood steam had fogged the monitor’s camera, so I couldn’t see anything. I stepped out from backstage and saw why they were so distraught. Evan’s hand was gradually disappearing into the meat grinder. 


GZ and I locked eyes and he just shook his head. I nodded. I felt bad for the guy. Horrified, but still sympathetic. 


More and more of the man’s hand disappeared into the grinder. This would’ve never worked with the terrible meat grinders they had throughout the majority of the show’s history. Those things wouldn’t grind a sheet of paper. These were new, though, and they were powerful. As we watched, Evan’s arm disappeared up to the elbow as bloody confetti poured out and filled the bowl on the table.


The fire alarm sounded. Apparently some panicking intern had pulled it thinking it’d get the authorities there faster. 


“Form into patties and braise in blood sauce with thyme, carrots, diced shallots, and fennel pollen,” Evan called out over the din of the alarm. “Add chocolate and poblanos to create a pseudo-mole sauce to ingratiate Sanchez and Freitag if they are judging. Add butter for Guarnaschelli. Add veal demi-glace for Zakarian.”


Evan’s arm had disappeared up to his shoulder. He wrenched the stump out. Pulped flesh dangled while blood spurted. His complexion was beige.


“Follow the braising with a quick sear. Plate with potatoes if Murphy is judging.” Marc was busy throwing up into a trashcan. 


The studio door burst open and four police officers entered the studio. Evan had dropped the knife and was busy making patties out of the meat that’d once been his hand and arm. “Bone fragments may be overlooked if the flavor profile is strong enough,” he yelled, and began to drop the patties into the pan of reduced blood. He then added the aromatics he’d cut up before going nuts.


A scent filled the air. I was overwhelmed by the most disturbing sensation I’d ever experienced; the smell was intoxicating and luscious. Everyone stopped shouting and crying and puking as their nostrils filled with the rich odor. A cop shot Evan with a taser, and Evan collapsed on the bloody floor. He convulsed for a moment, then stopped. The EMTs ran to him.


One of the producers turned off the burners and ordered all nonessential personnel to leave immediately. I looked at GZ and he pointed at his watch. I was six minutes late with his latte. Of course he’d be thinking about his latte at a time like this.


I went in back and began the laborious process again. *Spring* was a no-go. I wasn’t about to try to do it over, so I prepared *La Vérité sortant du puits armée de son martinet pour châtier l'humanité*. I hoped it would put GZ in a happier mood, if that was at all possible.


The $20,000 espresso machine hummed and I deftly painted the milk foam and espresso into the objet d'art we both loved. I listened as the EMTs took Evan out and the police questioned the chefs. It didn’t take long. They left right when I was about to finish. 


I came out onto the set with the latte and stopped dead in my tracks. My hands trembled and part of me knew my artwork was being destroyed, but that was the least of my concerns at that moment.


Geoffrey, Aarón, Marc, Ted, Alex, and Amanda stood around Evan’s station. They huddled in front of the pan, each holding a fork. Each of them was cutting off small portions of the terrible sausage Evan had made and eating it. Overcome with nausea, I dropped the latte. Everyone looked at me.


“Jesus Christ man,” GZ complained. “Was that the Gérôme one?”


I nodded.


His expression softened. “Sorry, I didn’t ask if you were okay. You good?”


I nodded again as he took another morsel of the sausage.


“Look, I know this looks strange and we all admit we’ll probably feel pretty bad about it tomorrow, but when else are we going to have a chance like this?”


Aarón chimed in, “C’mon buddy, give it a try.”


The other judges joined Aarón and GZ and encouraged me over. It still smelled spectacular. GZ cut me a tiny piece and I put it in my mouth. It was the best thing I’d ever tasted.


“Hey, is that camera still on,?” Alex asked around a mouthful of carrot and sausage.


“Hmm, yeah,” said Amanda, staring at the green light.


“Guess it’s one for the blooper reel,” GZ laughed. “For Chopped! After Hours.”


They all laughed and I backed away, not sure how to feel.


“Hey,” GZ interrupted, “anyone want a latte?”


Ted belched. “Fuck yeah.”


I went backstage and started to make their lattes. As I was turning the corner, Alex quipped, “yeah, that guy totally would’ve won the round. If he lives, maybe we should send him a card.” 

They all thought that was a superb [idea](http://unsettlingstories.com).

Here's a little background info on me.


I'm a student without a degree yet, I'm about half way through my CS degree. I have had no internships and no professional software jobs except one small freelance gig. I do have a lot of experience with openGL and c++, I've been learning c++ for the past 7 years and openGL for the past 3 or so years. I've completed data structures and algorithms at school, as well as an android, iOS, and java courses. I believe I am indeed qualified for the position and that given an opportunity to learn and further my knowledge, I would exceed in this position.


Skip to Friday. I get a call saying they'd like to setup a interview with me on Wednesday and I'm so so scared. I don't know what I'm worth, I don't know weither I lowball my salary to 30K or I do 40k, 50k, 60k. I'm currently making 20k before taxes.


I've been thinking that I just say something along the lines of:

I'm still not sure what I'm worth, I'm not really interested in how much this position pays as I am interested in the opportunities this position opens up for me. I currently make 20K and I would like to make something around x ( I'm leaning towards 35K here) as that would allow me to live a little more comfortably than I currently do. 

This is in Colorado springs, CO BTW, if that helps with anything. Thanks for the help guys, I'm just so confused. "

I wanted to be as detailed as I could. I want to live in Europe again but I’m having trouble forming a plan since I don’t know anyone who has done this before.
  
I majored in French in college and studied there twice, and I’m extremely anxious to go back. I want to live in Paris long-term, and I’ve been realizing that with my education and experience, it would be impossible to get a job there right now. So, I’ve been considering doing a masters program in Paris, then trying to find a job there. 

I just graduated from a large American university this past May, and have been working at my current job as a communications specialist since January (I started out as an intern until I graduated). I have a BA in French Language and a minor in Linguistics, and then I have an additional degree in Media and Information with a specialization in Media Management. 

I have been looking at continuing my education with a masters in communications, or something to do with digital marketing. 

I’m a native English speaker and am nearly fluent in French. I speak elementary Spanish and Dutch. I would like to do a program in English, but preferably in a French speaking country so I could still work on my proficiency. My second choices (if I can’t find a program in Paris) would be Germany, Ireland, or the Netherlands. I love learning languages so really anywhere in Europe would work for me as a back-up.

My worry with applying to grad school is that my grades weren’t exactly stellar, and I’m not taking the GRE until February. My cumulative GPA was about a 3.3. I also considered taking the GMAT but I’m a bit intimidated by how much studying it requires. I work 40 hrs/week and help my brother run an online business now, so I’m not sure I could fully commit to that much studying. But, many of the schools I’ve looked at accept both test scores. 

I would like advice from anyone who has done this kind of thing before. Would doing a masters in France help my chances of being hired in France? Should I continue to look for jobs in Paris or is that not realistic? Would I have a better chance of getting a job in one of the other countries I mentioned, or is it just as difficult as France? Another option would be finding an American company with offices in Paris/Europe, but I don’t even know where to begin looking for that.

Thanks for your help!

Anyways, I've seen a couple people around here that have gotten CS internships. What did you have to do and know in order to get the internship? I feel really underqualified, and I feel like I don't have a lot of time to build up my resume more. I also feel pretty stupid for not getting more coding experience by myself.

And if I want to email local college professors or businesses regarding a potential internship opportunity, what am I supposed to include in my resume? Just follow a normal resume format?

I'm consider myself fairly knowledgeable and have a few projects that I'm working on. There is are a few  projects that management has me working on and I provide tech support as needed, but i still find myself with a lot of downtime.

What can we do next?",throwaway08053,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/5e6jwt/my_coworkers_and_i_are_desperately_underpaid/,"I work in what is technically considered a small business. We are a publishing company with more than 50 employees but a majority of the sales team is contracted. I joined the company 5 years ago right out of college after an internship, and at the time the company was half the size that it is now. I was working as an assistant editor for three publications with an editor-in-chief and two other editors. Since then we took on another four publications (two in the last year), hiring another three assistant editors in the process. I have since been promoted to managing editor. We are owned by 2 publishers.


Besides the editor-in-chief (EIC) I am the longest tenured employee in our department, seconded to two other editors who came on board about a year after me when the company started to expand. The other two editors I worked with have left the company. Up until about a year and a half ago our team of five editors was a very well-suited group of people: We all got along very well, split work up evenly, took each other's criticisms to heart and learned from each other. We were all painfully underpaid and overworked, and as the company continued to grow we were expected to take on more work without extra pay. Naturally, people started to leave. Two of our strongest team members left and the EIC hired one person out of college, a former intern of mine (employee 1), and another employee who was referred to us (employee 2). A third editor (employee 3) joined our staff after we acquired another publication as part of the buyout. 



As the company expanded it's very clear that the EIC is not suited for as much responsibility as he has been given. He is relatively anti-social and doesn't communicate well, and his job has become doing what the publishers tell him and questioning nothing. Meanwhile, Employee 2 and Employee 3 are some of the most over privileged brats I've ever met. Employee 2 took my old position, but now does half of the work that I was expected to do and is never expected to take on more. When negotiations began EIC came to me laughing about the exorbatant salary Employee 2 was asking for, but she was hired the next week, so I have to imagine he met her somewhere in the middle. Even if he offered the employee 12K less than she was asking, it would still be significantly more than my salary.



Employee 3 still works under the belief that she is only expected to work on the publication we acquired when she was brought on, even though every other editor works across all 7 magazines. Employee 3 also got drunk at a work event and told me how much she makes, which is about 10 grand more than I do. Employee 2 and 3 know how to play the EIC like a fiddle; when the EIC comes to them with any work they will immediately say no, and because the EIC is very socially awkward he'll just come to one of the original three editors and ask or pay an outside writer to do it as opposed to managing the two of them. Employee 1 is overworked, and is getting a lot of shit from our publishers because she is picking up the slack of 2 extra people and getting work in late. Meanwhile Employee 2 and 3 come in late every day, take 2 hour lunch breaks and leave at 4:55. I have no problem with hiring freelancers, and I will never have a problem with working hard at something I'm good at, but if money is being taken out to cover their slack they shouldn't be making more than me.



Myself and the two other editors in this company have gone to our EIC three times in the last year to discuss this and nothing has changed. I originally went to my EIC and told him I couldn't keep living paycheck to paycheck and said I needed a raise totaling *this* much and was denied. I told the EIC I knew how much the employees made and the publishers just denied that and tried to tell me asking about salaries was illegal (which I know is a lie). I, meanwhile, have been trying desperately to get a new job but just can't get a nibble, so they know I'm stuck here. Our HR rep is just that by certification, he is actually the accountant and he's a terrifying person to be in a room with. And the EIC has been instructed to not allow any of us to speak with the publishers at any time. One of the publishers admitted to a former employee that he intentionally speed walks through the office so no one will try to stop and speak with him. At this point the three of us feel truly, truly trapped where we are. We thought about going to a lawyer but the most respected ones in our area wouldn't want to help us since they can win awards through our magazines, and none of us have any money. 



So what can we do? My one editor is suggesting storming the publishers office and demanding they work with us, but knowing the personalities of these people it would not end well. Can we write a formal complaint or something that would need to be addressed in a more professional, controlled setting? "

I have no clue where else to look at, so I wanted to see if anyone had any advice about what to do when no college seems right for them, or if anyone has any suggestions of schools I should apply to that I may have overlooked.

My stats:
-3.7 weighted GPA and 32 ACT... school doesn't do class ranks (4 AP classes and 5 honors classes throughout HS)

- To put my grades in perspective, I attend a competitive public high school (25th in NJ, 404 in nation according to USnews)

-I have fairly good extra curricular's... (President of 2 clubs, played 7 seasons of sports, involved in theater, internship for political organization, a few more)

Criteria: 

-Preferably within 7 driving hours of NYC, but not required

-Over 2,000 students

-I'm looking for a school with a cool scene. I've suffered through  years of a preppy town, and that's not the environment I'm looking for... I'd like to be by a city, but am willing to hear suggestions of schools that aren't

- I really really liked McGill University but I hate the winter and the brutal winters in Canada seem hard to compromise on... so if anyone knows schools with a similar vibe to McGill but are in a warmer area?

-I've applied to Northeastern, Fordham, Penn State, Rutgers, McGill, Lafayette, Tufts, Lehigh, BC... I liked BC and Tufts but am doubtful I'd get in

Is this just all a matter of me being too picky? Any advice would help. I don't mean this to be some annoying post, I'm genuinely am feeling extremely unsure of everything and want to see if anyone has any suggestions. Thanks so much!

Schools I've visited and didn't like: Richmond, Bucknell, Villanova, Gettysburg, George Washington, BU"

While obviously the policy will differ between organisations, if an intern is (hopefully) offered a full-time position do they generally have the latitude to move to other divisions of a company, or is the offer usually with the same team? The divisions would be in the US and this assumes acquiring a visa is possible. The salary disparity between the US and Canada is the primary reason behind this.

I could really use some advice. I think a timeline might be the best way to give some background:

* **Prior to Fall 2014** - Computer Engineering Major. high GPA. 1 co-op and an internship. Some issues with anxiety, but it hadn't had too much of an impact on my life

* **Fall 2014 semester** - I was doing well until November, then I started to have problems with depression/anxiety. I fail 1 class, but do well in the rest

* **Spring 2015 semester** - major depression/anxiety problems. I get some help from the university counseling center and increase my existing prescription. I withdraw from my classes except for 1 class and my senior capstone project (2nd half of year long project)

* **Summer 2015** - I stayed with my parents, occasionally helping with a seasonal rental business and not really doing anything else

* **Fall 2015 semester** - I went back to school, then withdrew after several weeks and went back to live with my parents. I had no job during this period.

* **Spring 2016 semester** - I went back to school and I pass all but 1 gen.ed. class. I went to a big university-sponsored job fair, but I panicked and didn't talk to anyone.
 
* **April 2016 to now** - Live with my parents, completed my last class online, and applied to a few dozen jobs. Bombed my only phone interview.

That brings us to today. I've been doing some job searching, but anxiety has made it difficult. I think that it's getting easier, but some days just checking LinkedIn or similar sites makes my heart race. Cover letters can take hours because I can hardly think of what to say when I feel anxious. My only phone interview opened with the questions ""Why haven't you started working yet"" and ""Why didn't you have an internship last summer?"", which gave me such anxiety that I could hardly answer those questions or any of the questions that followed. 

So, I've come to ask for advice .

1. How do you deal with job searching anxiety? I've read some tips, but sometimes it still seems so difficult to even search for a job.

2. How do I talk about my recent history? Should I tell potential employers that I had to take a medical leave? Should I try to address this in my cover letter so that they don't ask these extremely difficult questions?

Thank you in advance."

I just have not been able to land any internships due to the competition and my GPA not being high enough. I do have internships in other areas, but just not finance related or in financial institutions. I will be commencing my last semester next year, and I will be looking for a full-time position. 

I have decided that I would like to get into roles in risk (preferably credit, but operational is fine as well) or compliance (arguably BO). Is it still possible without any prior experience in similar roles or in a banking environment? Another option I would consider would be to take up a ops role first before going trying to move into risk or compliance - how feasible is this realistically? Would taking up an internship after graduation in risk/compliance be better in the long run?  

Came across the linkedin profiles of some friends in university, and I realised that I am way way behind them in terms of internships. Some of them already have 2-4 finance related internships while I have none. In addition some of them have already completed their CFA1. This serves as a huge slap across the face for me - What can I do to catch up and make myself more attractive to prospective employers despite my obvious lack of experience (and GPA)? Would taking the CFA be useful in landing jobs in risk?

I interviewed with Google a couple of years ago for a PhD internship and got rejected (I thought I did well). I applied again this year by submitting my resume online. However, I got an email from a recruiter saying they decided not to proceed with my application.

My research is purely theoretical, hence I don't have a lot of programming projects on my resume. Since I interviewed with Google a couple years ago, I did only one big programming project (which I included on my resume). I believe this might have been a reason for the rejection.

However, I have a few friends who work at Google. I wonder if I would have got an interview if I had one of them refer me. I was sure I would get an interview by just submitting my resume online since that's how I got my interview last time, and I didn't want to bother my friends. In hindsight, that sounds stupid. So, I am wondering if I should ask one of my friends to refer me now and whether that would lead to a different outcome. I initially wanted to just move on, but now I am just wondering what's the worst that can happen (I just get rejected again)?

We were all pretty good friends and decided to live together and it has gone smoothly overall. I've always had a problem with our house being pretty poorly taken care of, but haven't really made a big deal over it until recently. People just don't do dishes and leave messes everywhere, the usual stuff. I have asthma and they smoke and vape in the house, or at least some of them do, and their friends who stop by do as well. I have had to put my foot down on smoking blunts in the house and they stopped and actually said ""If you want us to stop smoking in the house completely, just say the word, we don't want you to feel uncomfortable in the house."" I said I'm fine with that because at that time it really didn't feel like it was bothering my asthma that much.

I was gone this whole summer for an internship, and when I came back I realized how sick being in that house makes me. It also might be them smoking more than usual. It directly affects my asthma and I can feel it flaring up all the time. I also noticed that the house is generally more dirty than before I left. I tried to set an example and do my share of cleaning but it didn't do much. One morning I woke up and while getting ready for work I noticed smoke/vapor coming through the vents and into my personal room. I walked out into the living room and my roommate and his friend were vaping and the living room was densely packed with smoke -- I could hardly see across the room. On top of this the house was filthy from the night before. It was a struggle to make food because there was so much shit in the way.

I figured that I had no reason to be upset because I hadn't explicitly said I had a problem with any of this, but figured it was time to. So I basically sent what I thought was a very mature and respectful (but still assertive) message to our group chat for the house. I basically said that the level of smoking in the house is to the point that it is making me feel genuinely sick because of my asthma, and if they could at least tone it down I would really appreciate it. I also mentioned in the message that we should take care of the house better. I said that I know I'm not the perfect roommate either, but that our house is disgusting compared to even other college houses. 

No one responded. When I got off work I ended up meeting with one of my roommates who I'm better friends with than the rest of them. He told me that everyone seemed to take issue with my message. Basically they all talked shit on me behind my back after I sent it. I felt really disrespected and just went home and went to bed. I stayed mostly in my room and didn't really talk to anyone when I did go upstairs. They definitely knew that I was pissed about how they reacted to it and no one said anything. One of the more petty roommates definitely enjoyed me being upset about it, making little comments as I passed through the living room. 

They also bought a new bong and seem to be smoking just as much as before, and I still feel sick. They did start taking better care of the house for a little bit, probably because our landlord happened to stop by a few days after I sent the message and proceeded to threaten to evict us. 

I just don't know how to handle this. They are genuinely my friends, probably except for the one guy. It's weird to be at odds with everyone in the house and I've mostly gone back to hanging out with them, but I still feel pretty disrespected and pretty angry. I want to handle this maturely but I don't know how. I thought I did go about it the mature way, so I don't know."

I have recently completed my IT degree (majored in networking), but need to carry out a 6 month work placement in order to complete my diploma and graduate. I have had a few friends apply for Internships last year and a lot of them seem to have been a bit disappointed in what they did at the business/organisation. I take it that many of the businesses that took them on, placed them where they were short in numbers and pigeon holed them. Many friends were placed in consulting/sales roles, when they had completed Programming and Networking majors.

I understand this from a business point of view, and it completely makes sense. For me, I would like to purely focus on IT, which has led me to a fork in the road where I can start to apply for Helpdesk positions and hopefully try to work my way in with their networking team and get some proper IT experience. Or I can apply for an Internship at a business and possibly have to put up with 6-9 months of things I don't really wan't to do, just to have a nice CV with a good business on it. Am I being too ignorant about the Internship thing? It just seems like most businesses take advantage of free employees and have a different agenda set for Interns?
Thanks in advance for your help/replies :)

TL;DR Should I apply for a helpdesk and get some real IT experience, or possibly get pigeon holed in a non-IT sector with an Internship?"

I'm in need of some advice, and would also just like to discuss this somewhere because it's bothering me.

I like programming and I'm currently in my 3rd year doing my internship. The first year of programming was great, it was all new and I learned alot. The teachers I had where interested and tried to help by discussibg with you.

The second year I feel like I learned nothing at all. The teachers made you figure out everything yourself, and I feel like I got lost alot because the material was progressing fast.

I notice that I have a strong urge to come up with clean and optimal solutions, but I have trouble finding different solutions and implementing them. i want to know how it works instead of just ""using"" it. If I don't, I lack the view of the total picture.

In my internship I feel like everyone is very competitive and wanting to be the smartest while I just really want to learn.
I'm really wondering if I'm cut out to be a coder since the competitiveness stresses me out, and I feel like I'm picking stuff up slower than others.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? And does anyone have advice on how to learn/implement things faster?"

I got a job offer, which is good, and they want me to start in two weeks. I'm graduating in late December, as long as I pass everything (and hopefully I will...I passed all my core classes but engineering econ and prob stats have me by the balls). I feel inferior.

I see other people, and their grades (my boyfriend sits on youtube all day and has a 3.92 gpa) and I think to myself ""why am i such shit"". And I know it's because despite the hell I've been through during college, I needed to step up and I couldn't.

And now, I'm wondering what I can do post degree to make things better. I want to learn more, and keep competitive, so that even if my job doesn't go well (I'm going into R&amp;D and I think I'm going to love it, but who knows) I don't fall into a pit of despair.

Its Thanksgiving break and I have two job offers. I canceled all my other interviews because I'm going to accept one of these. These are places where I would definitely have signed off on if I didn't have the other.

The first is the one I'm leaning towards: It is with a three letter intel agency in DC doing something I think I would really enjoy and be good at. There are opportunities to travel and work overseas which is really attractive to me. The catch is that it is conditional on me receiving a high security clearance, I don't see there being any issues with it BUT anything could happen (I'd have to get polygraphed) and they can pull their offer at anytime if they find anything they don't like. The salary for this one is $68k but I'm hoping to get it up to at least $75k (b/c of my other offer).

The second is with a national lab also in the DC area, I'd be doing something similar to what i did in a past internship (and I enjoyed). This job is unconditional and final, I have it as soon as a sign the acceptance letter. The salary for this one is $80.5k.

I really want to do the first one, even though it is a massive risk (I did some googling and about 9% of job offers are pulled during the clearance process). But hey its good to take risks right? My parents think it would be extremely stupid to do this and that I should accept the job with a higher salary immediately.

There is a third option, one that I really don't want to do. I have another onsite interview with Raytheon that i haven't canceled and I would definitely get the offer if i decide to do it. I could accept the first option and the third and then renege when my offer becomes final. This provides a safety net, but I just think its a terrible thing to do.

When I went there they said they were pretty sure they weren't offering internships but to send my information. I met with two people in the company, one who added me on her LinkedIn account and was a programmer and I also met the CFO of the company who gave me her e-mail.

I have been trying to get together some mobile game apps to send along with my resume as I feel it would be the only thing they would really want to see, but I don't have a whole lot to show, maybe 4 small projects total and that's all. I'm debating whether to wait longer and create a better mobile app project to send along as an example of my skills, or to send in my resume now while they still remember me coming in.

 I get my associates degree in December and have already taken a number of upper-division programming courses at a CSU, but my overall GPA is rather poor at about a 2.3. I am however at least in the Honors program for my mobile programming class.


I'm worried I won't be able to send in a qualified enough resume but it would be my dream to get to work for this place and hope I can get help from this sub on what I should do/what I should send. Thank you for reading this."

I have already taken the introductory programming courses for the degree and did well in them. The AS contains all the foundational courses: Data structures, algorithms, organization and I can finish it in the next two semesters. I am also working on different projects in my free time. I don't necessarily have the funds to go after a bachelors or a Masters at the moment, but if it is necessary now I will do it. My plan was to finish the AS, try to get a job and maybe do a masters online once I gain more experience.

Because I already have a bachelors, would I still be disqualified with an AS in CS? I took some high level math and physics courses for my bachelors degree, but I'm guessing employers care about the designation quite a bit, though I have heard that programming is meritocratic than other fields, which are more stringent on designations.

Come July 25, I show to the court and the clerk explains that we must be available for the next three days and guarantee ourselves to be available for the following 7-8 business days if we are selected to be on the trial. Well, the internship program I was in was sending nine interns to Oakland, CA for a business trip, all expenses paid on August 4th. I could stay the three days for jury selection but I couldn't guarantee my availability if I was selected for trial, and once again I had to postpone.

I'm extremely interested in computer architecture, integrated circuits, and embedded systems.

Current UCLA EE senior. Overall GPA: 3.51, major GPA: 3.72.
Work experience: Apple Mac hardware engineering, Tesla power electronics engineering, and a UCLA research lab. My &gt; 3.5 GPA qualifies me for UCLA's guaranteed admission into their MS program. 
(For reference, apparently the undergrad overall GPA average is around a 2.8)



So long story short, I took the GRE today and did not do great. (160 quant, 160 verbal.) 


Part of the reason is that I haven't had significant amount of time to prep. I have a family member who is very sick and doctors found out that I have a heart condition very early on this quarter, so I've been in and out of appointments. These two issues have coupled to create a general state of unhappiness so I wasn't in the best state of mind taking this test. I've scored 330+ on practice exams so I think I could have done better with more prep and a better mindset.



I'm from the bay area and I'd love to attend Stanford for the EE MS program. I've proven my engineering capabilities by getting return offers (for internship and full time) from Apple, Tesla, and Amazon. I have designed circuits that have made it into Macbook Pros, and Tesla's Model S and X. I've conducted independent research on stock trading algorithms, written backtesting simulators in C++, and am currently in the preliminary design stages of what may be worthy enough to pursue as a startup.



I've been much more successful in industry than in academics, evidenced by the fact that a lot of my ideas have bypassed multiple layers of the management hierarchy and made it into products directly. I have to work very hard to get the grades I do, but I'm capable of doing well. It's too late now to retake the GRE since all the testing centers near me are booked until after Stanford's submission deadline. My score is not good relative to my competition and my GPA is lower. I have three strong letters of rec (2 professor, 1 manager from industry). Do I still stand a chance? If so, would it be worth explaining my situation to someone at Stanford? I live close enough to just walk over there.

I'm failing my math courses, I'm doing ok in my CS courses, and honestly, if I continue at this rate, I probably won't end up finishing my degree (its only going to get tougher...). However, I have 2 internships under my belt (for those unfamiliar, UW gives us 6 coops total), both at really big companies in Canada, and my next one will probably be in the US since I already had ~4 interviews with big names in cali but I suck at technical interviewing (I'm planning on spending next coop getting better at that).

I don't want to spend the next year or so failing out of CS. I have decided I should probably do one of the following:

1. Defer a year of school and find 3 coops during that year to do. This would put me at 4 coops total. During my 3rd coop, I would apply for full time jobs, and drop out completely. This seems like the safest and only way I will drop out completely. My only issue here is getting a H1B visa without a degree (how hard is this?). 

1. Switch into an Economics degree. I have 2 close friends both doing Economics (at UWaterloo) and the courses seem very interesting, much more interesting than math/CS courses. However, I really enjoy coding. The workload seems significantly lighter for econ and I would probably spend a ton of time on side projects. My only issue here is how hard would it be to find a developer job with an econ degree (specifically in the US) assuming I am just as good as the people with a BCS at web dev (what all my side projects are, as well as both coops).

Well, a city in the desert. Sunniest place on earth in fact. We get rain maybe once or twice a year, and when there is, people rarely leave their house just from the unfamiliarity.   The point is, this is is a really hot, really dry place. 

&amp;nbsp;
Last summer, I worked at a water park. The first this city ever had. Honestly, it seemed like a no-brainer to build a water park in literally the sunniest city on earth, but seeing how this place was run and how much water was used, it's no wonder why it isn't doing very well today. The job was relatively easy, and I got to work outside all summer. It was scorching hot even in the water and the shade. Luckily my position was at the top of one of the slides so I was under a shade and I could sit in the top of the slide when it was slow to cool off. I went through at least five or six water bottles during my shift to stave off the heat, but I did end the summer with a really sweat tan. I actually really enjoyed this job. 

&amp;nbsp;
The shifts were long from open to close. I was usually exhausted, and something about the chemical cocktail they put in the water felt heavy on my skin. I always went home straight to the shower.  This shower always felt amazing. The cool water seemed to stay on my skin well after the shower despite it not being humid at all, and I always enjoyed that.  

&amp;nbsp;
Following these showers I would play some video games and go to bed. This is where the weird stuff comes in. During the time I worked at the water park I had the same dream almost every night. It started with the sound of dripping water. Not like you would hear from a faucet, more like you would hear dropping off of someone when they get out of the pool. Then, I would feel myself floating in darkness. Not weightless, but floating nonetheless. Everything existed in shadows in the dream. I could make out parts of my room but it would shift suddenly, like jell-o or the ripples from Jurassic Park. After a bit, I could hear someone calling me. A siren-like voice, beautiful but with an underlying malevolence. I would wake up covered in sweat and late for work.

&amp;nbsp;
I didn't think much of it. It was just my brain reacting to the days of nothing but water and girls in bikinis at the park, I thought. I quit when school started again, and I never went back since I got a job somewhere else. Recently though, I took an internship in Washington and was exposed to rain on an almost daily basis. Maybe it's just that it reminds me of the park, but the dreams have come back more vivid than ever. In the darkness I can feel the voice now has a shape. A shadowy shape that I could not describe if I tried. I sometimes hear the voice when I'm awake now. It's stronger in the rain. Almost as if the voice carried in each drop. When I get out of the rain, my skin stays wet for hours and I find myself drinking more water than I ever did that summer. Walking barefoot through my apartment leaves wet footprints on the hardwood. I don't know what's happening to me. I don't know if there is something in the water. I don't know if this is something new or something that's been there since I was born. Maybe the desert just kept things dry? 

&amp;nbsp;
The only thing I do know, is that every time I walk out into the rain or drive near the ocean, I feel such a longing, almost a nostalgia, a loss. There's an opening for an internship out at sea for six months. I don't know if that would help or take me to a point of no return. But I think I have to know. "

I am a sophomore comp sci major, who recently got their first internship this coming summer. The main language I will be using is java, and I am really really excited to get some valuable knowledge and experience in the workplace. However, I consider myself a beginner programmer- looking at code, I can understand what is going on, and can explain it, and while I can program (what I consider) basic tasks, if given a blank slate and a job, I find difficulty figuring out where to start. This makes me a bit nervous, as I want to be as valuable to my employer as possible, and am afraid I will not be able to pull my own weight at my internship. Thankfully, I have a bit of time to ease this worry in the coming months. I have taken all intro programming classes, but feel like all classes and online tutorials seem to stop at the same point. What can I do to further my knowledge in a language I have taken all intro college courses on? I am beginning to just work on online projects daily, and while it is helping, I want to see if there's anything else I should/could be doing."

Any advice or insight would be much appreciated!


I got my bachelor's degree in Information Systems Management from a well known public state university in my area of the USA (not prestigious but well known throughout the state). I graduated last December but I stayed at my restaurant job I had worked during school for several years and have been looking actively for an entry level position since June. I was not able to do an internship during school. I have tried searching for internships after I graduated, but nearly all have being a currently enrolled student as the top requirement.


The main areas my major focused on were programming and database management/theory. I learned the basics of OOP, (C#, .NET, used MS Visual Studio) and SQL, as well as the fundamentals of a few other langugages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++ - as well as the basic principles of relational databases and normalization, etc. There were a couple networking courses but nothing of substance was taught.


Since beginning to search for entry level IT positions in June I have applied to hundreds, probably even thousands of jobs and have only been able to secure 2 in person interviews. At times I have been asked to speak on what projects I completed during my schooling, but there were none, only small assignments.


I use websites like Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice, CareerBuilder, Monster, Simplyhired and also check company websites directly. It seems that 95% of jobs that are labeled as ""entry level"" have 1-3 or sometimes as much as 5 years of experience required or prefered. Even if I had been able to do a couple of summer internships, this seemingly would still not satisfy the experience requirement for these so-called ""entry level"" positions. I do not use cover letters when applying due to the fact I have nothing relevant to include besides generic personal details. I am contacted by recruiters from staffing firms almost daily telling me about a certain position they have open that I might be a good fit for and I give them permission to send my resume, but never hear back.

I understand I am in a tough spot due to not having any professional experience, but is it really this bad? I am beginning to have serious doubts about whether I will be able to find a job in this field. At this point I think my best bet would be to focus on finding a support/helpdesk role rather than a database/developer role. Would you guys agree? I have had my resume looked at by the experts at my university career center and they approve - so I don't think my resume is an issue. Any and all advice would be appreciated! I envy you guys!"

So, after a while of looking I finally found an internship that seems pretty OK for what I want to do (I want to get my masters in Machine Learning) but to be frank it seems kind of unusual what they want and some aspects of the offer raise red flags. The official title makes me a ""Financial data intern"" mostly working with their database system (I guess the whole thing is built in C# and SQL.) During the interview, however, they said they wanted someone who would be there ""for a couple years as learning the system is very intense and takes a while.""    
    
Why have an internship position for ""a couple years?"" I'm only a sophomore and honestly do not plan on looking too many other places for work during the time period, but the whole thing kind of feels like just an underpaid junior position with a shitty title. I'm fine with that (to some degree) but if I do jump ship early, what are the consequences I'd be likely to be hit with? What are some of the pitfalls I'm not seeing? It sounds good to me to have a part time position offering 20+ as I'm in school and already have another shitty P/T job. My bills are gonna be paid and I'll be getting experience but I can't help feeling like there's something I'm missing.    
    
You guys seem to be grounded and have a reasonable expectation of the industry as a whole so any feedback would be appreciated."

First of all, this subreddit has been extremely helpful with my internships and full-time opportunities. I am so grateful there are people here that want to help others. I just want to thank everyone who helps provide advice about cs careers! 

So, I'm wrapping up my final semester right now.

I have an opportunity to work with a great company (company A) where I know I can grow as an engineer.

I also have been waiting for months to go to final rounds with another company (company B), and there's nothing I can do about the date of this interview (I even have to miss a final exam).

Company A asked me for expected salary and I have no idea how to even answer that. I also know that if company B offers me a job I would most likely accept if it was on a very specific team, otherwise I'm going to accept the offer from company A ASAP.

2 questions:

1. How can I make sure company A doesn't hate me for wanting to interview with company B? I just spoke to the recruiter and she didn't sound too enthusiastic.
2. How do I go about discussing salaries with Company A? I have never had to think about this, but I don't want to get the shorter end of the stick.

Thanks in advance for reading and your advice.

So I graduated from college with a B.S. in Chemistry and a minor in Computer Science last spring and started working for a software company in San Francisco in September (I took a few months off between school and work to visit my family in Europe and also explore some countries I had not been to). My offer was $103k/yr salary with $10k signing bonus and no stock (private company). 

I was keeping up with interviews while working at that company in my spare time. In January I got an offer from a different company that I had wanted to work for while I was in college but was denied an internship and even full time job there multiple times. Of course, I happily accepted the offer and negotiated to $120k/yr, $35k signing bonus, and no stock (again, private company). So I started working there in late January.

Now it is November and I yet again have an offer on the table that it seems would be a shame to refuse. It's an offer for $132k/yr, $40k signing bonus, and $60k RSU. They told me that I have until December 17th to accept the offer. This company is also a very good company IMO and I would love to work there, but the only thing holding me back is the fact that I am unsure if it will affect me in the long run. In the future will companies find it strange that I worked full time for three different companies in a little over a year?

I definitely do not want to affect my future by switching jobs too often. If I go to this company then I will probably stay there for a while as they are starting to become very popular but their office is also very nice and relaxing, and the 6 hour workdays are a plus IMO. I just want to make sure it won't be a big deal having switched companies so much initially."

I'm looking for some advice regarding a decision I need to make. I was lucky enough to receive an offer for a 2017 Winter internship with Amazon and am now trying to decide which team I would like to work with. I have two options, and I'm not sure which would be better.

The first option is with Kindle Free Time in Seattle. I'm not really sure what kind of technologies they work with, but I know it's an established product/team and it would be at headquarters.

The second option is with a completely new team in Boston. The product is linked with AWS and I'd be working with Elastic Search, SQS/Kinesis, Dynamo DB and SWF. They described the team members in a way that sounded fast-paced and high-impact.

Right now I'm considering Boston more strongly mostly because of the location. I don't know anyone in Seattle (or the west coast) but I have a lot of friends in Boston. Boston is also closer to where I go to college, and I'd like to be able to visit my friends and girlfriend as often as possible. I also think working on a small team/new product would be an exciting experience, but I'm afraid that it may be a total flop.

2012: Graduated my BA in psychology, decided not to pursue Honors (necessary for a masters) because I thought I wanted to help people more directly and my psychology program was training me to be a researcher. Decide to see what the world holds for me with my new degree and seek a position to pay the bills while I try to get a feel for what I want in life. I find it impossible to find a job, even a minimum wage one, at full time and end up working a part time postion that pays $1 over minimum wage. It's enough for me to live with two friends in a basement appartment. 

2013: Spent the year working 2 part time jobs and getting volunteer hours to apply to the Bachelor of Social Work program (BSW) so I can be a social worker for the Canadian Military. This was a difficult time financially and I had to sell a lot of my stuff on amazon; namely my collection of books and video games. 

2014: Get rejected from BSW program. Have a minor existential crisis. Decide I don't want to work in mental health anymore and that it wasn't going to make me happy. I was only pursuing that career out of a sense of responsibility. Working first full time job at 24 (after quitting previous ones).

2015: Pursue CHRP (Certified Human Resources Professional) designation. Spend the year going to school part time and working full time.  I chose this field because It appeared to be growing, and the education was one year part time. Getting a CHRP would get me a one year paid internship. 

2016: Almost finished certification (just need to pass legal exam) but get promoted to manager position at work. My current job pays more than the internships/contract work I'd be facing for years as a CHRP, and there's a lot of room for upward mobility. Right now the plan is to keep my current career and use the CHRP as a backup in case I really hate my career or don't get promoted to a position I want. I'm 27 and make 30k a year. 

Today I wake up and really want to get a Masters in Psychology. 

I dont know, I feel like I'm stuck in a Loop. I don't really know what I want or what motivates me. "

**The question**: I'm taking 5 CS classes (this is normal) next semester and one filler class; if I take a Systems Software class next semester and another one the semester after that, my minor in Electrical Engineering could become a double major in Computer Engineering based on the classes I've already taken. **Are there significant benefits to having this double major (CoE + CS) rather than the CS + electrical engineering minor?** I don't want a job in hardware/firmware.

1. Beginning a new craft so late in the game is daunting. I feel like I'd be 8-10 years behind people my age.
2. It has been quite some time since I've taken a math course. I always had a high aptitude in math, but I feel very rusty. 
3. I have been reading on this sub and it seems that the salaries, job availability, and overall enjoyability of the field is not what I initially thought.

In conclusion, I feel like my previous degree and my years in the ""real world"" will give me an advantage when going back to school. I know how college works, and I know how important it is to get internships in school to be marketable upon graduation. 

HOWEVER: Am I naive? Am I idealizing the field? What the heck should I do? Any wisdom or insight would be enormously appreciated. Thanks for your time!

5eutkv,98,2016-11-25,I quit my shitty part time job just now!,Kaygarthedestroyer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5eutkv/i_quit_my_shitty_part_time_job_just_now/,"I quit my stupid job today and I thought I'd just vent here and validate myself because I feel a little bad. But also completely relived. 

It was one of those jobs that just made you dread going there everyday. I only worked 4 days before my mom passed away this month and I took two weeks off and came back.
My boss was such a weird dude and clearly an asshole but I figured he'd be maybe more sensitive since I was going through all that but of course, like most bosses, he continued to be an ass. 

This is the focal point of me quitting because he owns the place and no one else is ever there just me and him and maybe one other coworker. 

For example: 
He sat in his little office (this is a clothing boutique btw in a large city) and was on facebook the whole time. So I would have to greet customers and follow them around basically. They'd ask me questions that I didn't know the answer to (he purposely didn't tell me things because he wanted to ""handle"" it) so I HAD to ask him everything and it was just really weird for me and the customer, that I had to keep poking my head in and he never came out to greet them. 

He was so hard to talk to and would make funny jokes and I'd joke back and he wouldn't laugh or anything and just have a completely straight face. 

He would suck up to certain people that come in and then be an ass to other people that were being really nice to him. 

He was like obsessed with his dog that he brought in and would be playing with him while customers were there and he'd be short with them to get back to playing with his dog? He also would get weirdly visibly upset with people that didn't pet his dog, some lady called his dog the wrong name and he like, aggressively corrected her???  Idk 
That's just odd not really assholish.

As an asshole boss, he would for example say things like ""you don't ever need to straighten up the sale rack it will get messy anyways..."" to the next day saying ""you really think that looks acceptable?"" And make me straighten it up. 

He once yelled at me in front of customers about how messy the jewelry case was when I had just gotten back, like it was my fault? And I had to clean it while customers were there and I couldn't even interact with them. 


He would only give me 15 min lunch breaks and once made me get him his lunch which cut into my break so I didn't get to eat. 


I knew I worked weekends but it was never clear what days and what times and I had to ask him the day before. I once asked him if I was working till close and he just said no and kept doing what he was doing. So I just had no idea what time I was working till and I ended up being sent home an hour before close. Couldn't he have just said that???? 


The main thing that I really hated about that job though was the sales part. I've worked in retail before but never like this where you basically have to babysit the customer and follow them around. Now I'm definitely biased because I hate when stores do that but I really can't imagine that that kind of tactic is what gets people to buy stuff. I'd say it worked for about 1 out of every 8 customers. 

The one day that I really decided to quit was my last day last week when some dude came in and I asked him if he needed help but he said he was just occupying himself until his girlfriend meets him for lunch. Ok cool. So you literally don't need any help. Fine, I'll leave you alone. He ends up trying on a sweater so I give him a fitting room. 

I left him alone in there for maybe 3 mins and my other coworker asks how he's doing and he says it's too small yadda yadda might come back later yadda yadda explains the lunch thing and leaves. 

My boss calls me into the office to say that I lost that sale for him because I didn't ask that guy if he needed help (which I did). And how if I don't follow his instructions and I might not last at this job if I keep that up. He started raising his voice at me as I tried to explain my reasoning (dumb move, I know) and he just wasn't having it. 

So I felt really defeated and like he didn't respect me at all only cared about making sales and blamed me for something that was completely out of my hands. I was really good with customers for the rest of the day but that just wasn't satisfying in any way. I thought making him proud would make the job worthwhile but it wasn't and that's when I knew I needed to quit. 

As far as finding another job, I'm already doing an internship and my mom just passed so I have enough on my plate and my family has enough money to keep us afloat for now but I'm not really worried.  
Anyways.... just thought I'd vent because I quit via email and made the excuse about my mom and school work and I felt bad but I needed to get it off my chest. 

Has anyone else had any similar experiences with a shit part time job? 

TLDR;  boss was an asshole and I assessed that it was not worth it for my mental health and I decided to quit."

tldr: I've never made less than 25k a year, and now that I don't make enough money to put myself through school I don't know what to do. This isn't enough information to answer the question, but its the closest tldr I can make. I don't know if I should do the programming boot camp or if I should continue on with school.

At 19 I joined the Army, prior to that I was making 25k a year at walmart a job I had since I was 15. I put myself through some school while I was in the Army. I made about 40k (when counting for the food and housing that I got for free.) I got through about 30 college credits in this frame of time in psychology/philosophy.

At 23 I got out of the military, I supported myself with money I made while in the military until I found my first job. I continued my education during this frame of time up to about 74 college credits. I got a job working in the field in psych and fucking hated it. Job shadowing, and working directly with people who had MR. I made about 60k a year while doing this (lots of overtime...lots of it.) Due to family issues I simply couldn't stay in my home town. Its a long story, but lets just leave it at my family are pieces of shit (drug addicts, ect.) (Fun little side note I became bi-lingual while I was in the military...english and german)

At 25 I moved to a new city 3.5 hours away from my home town. I felt refreshed initially and enrolled in a new program. I quickly started suffering from depression for a variety of reasons, mostly family related. I was using the GI bill, and mostly depleted it during this frame of time. I applied to probably 30-40 jobs that all had ""Were hiring"" signs up in the windows. I couldn't even make it to the interview process, and when I did they asked me about why I moved most of them seemed shocked that I would walk away from a job paying 60k a year to get a new degree, and a new lease on life. I ended up living off of student loans and the GI bill for about 2 years. Depression was causing me to fail classes. I got nowhere in two years. The school I was going to literally took my depression and GI bill and an opportunity to just suck the money right out of me. I did get over my depression and thats how I got directly where I am now:

I wound up getting a dead-end job, but by this time it was too late. Had the same thing happened two years earlier I would be in a position to put myself through more school, despite running out of the GI Bill. The money wasn't enough to carry on with working, it couldn't even pay my bills, and the hours were horrendous. I ended up quitting to go back to school on a boat that I knew wouldn't make it to land (e.g. the GI Bill). I'm at a point where the GI bill won't take me to the end of my current degree (I need 56 credits. At best I can get 30.) I can't get a job paying me enough to matter (anything greater than 10 an hour. In this city minimum wage needs to be at least 15 an hour. And thats only if the standard of living doesn't increase) I found a programming boot camp  which touts that they ""Guarantee a job, after completion of a three month course."" I've read about it a bit and it sounds like bullshit. Lots of their alumni don't have jobs in the field of programming, or anything remotely IT related.

I'm at a point where I'm ready to give the fuck up. At every other turn in life (though I'm leaving it out) I've had an incredibly hard time. Harder than most. Just using family life as an example, I worked with a guy from a third world country while in the military and the descriptions of my home life were worse than some of the shit he's seen in a third world country by his own account. In the Army I was surrounded by people who all had severe anti-social problems, and an incompetent chain of command (e.g. The chain of command wouldn't take action when I had a guy in out unit threatening to kill me every day.) I feel like I've put in all this effort for no reason. That at the end of the day the ship I'm on is going to sink with me on it regardless of what I do. While to some extent this is my fault (Loans, ect.) its not completely my fault as I was depressed and had no one to help me when I initially became depressed. I've also had absolutely no mentors in life. Most of the lesson's I've learned I learned the hard way.

My girlfriend thinks I should stay in school, but I'm going to run out of money. The programming boot camp touts a lot, but after looking at their alumni, most of them *didn't* get a paying job, and those who did didn't get one in tech. They got a job working as an intern, or a job that wasn't in tech. They do have a few alumni there that did get tech jobs paying 40k as 'junior' programmers, but they have been in tech their entire life. 

I don't know what to do with myself at this point. I need these things out of a job so I can finish school:

A. A job that pays *at least* 12.5 an hour.

B. Provides me enough time at home to take 2 college courses at a time.

C. A way to do this with in the next 3 months.

As a total side note, I can see why a lot of these younger kids in school are freaking out on professors. They are supposed to be getting an education and they are trying to do that, but the school is just trying to do whatever it takes to get money out of them, education be damned."

5evycv,2,2016-11-25,Help me choose my first co-op as a sophomore!,reflective_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5evycv/help_me_choose_my_first_coop_as_a_sophomore/,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice on which co-op job offer I should take. I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Engineering and I'm interested in both hardware and software. At my school, we have a program where students go on these 6 month long paid internships called co-ops and I'm currently choosing between some offers that I've been given. 

For readability, I'm going to list the pros and cons out in bullet format

Company 1:
3d printing company / startup

* 30-60 min away, I'd have to get a car (which my parents are willing to help cover the cost of)

* I'd be doing a lot of hardware and software development and would be learning a lot and be exposed to a lot (electrical design, programming, circuit design, etc)

* pays via a monthly stipend, and comes out slightly less per month than company 2 (approximates to around 484 less per month)

* more open office space type of work, really well funded startup

* the people who interviewed me were very peculiar, didn't smile once during the interview and asked very ""weird"" / abstract questions 

Company 2: Well known research and development company that works with the government

* about 30 ish minutes away, can commute via subway which is really nice

* I'd be doing software testing essentially, writing code to test the test code and running lots of simulations

* pays a bit more than company 1 and also pays hourly 

* really nice area, cubicle sort of work

* interview was weird in the sense that they didn't really ask me any technical questions, but rather just about one of my experiences and spent most of the ""interview"" telling me about the company 

Essentially, I guess what it comes down to is that I have to choose between one job thats cool where I'd learn about hardware and software, both of which I am interested in, but is far away that I'd have to drive to every day (and I can probably carpool), versus a job that i can commute to via subway but might potentially be boring (software testing/simulation), but pays well and is in a nice area and I'd learn a lot about how good code is written.

If any of you have any input/perspective to offer, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!"

I started programming at the age of 11, went to some competitions here and there and got into a high school where one of the main subjects is programming. Lately I was thinking of interning at some local IT company and I couldn't really find any that explicitly offer internships for high scholars, they are mostly for university students.  
Now here are my questions:  
  
 - What do companies expect you to know? Do you have to know , for example, C/C++ incredibly good to get an internship or do you need some mediocre knowledge?  
 - Do you need to have some kind of projects you worked on before in order for them to hire you, and if so which kinds are more desirable?  
 - Do companies actually have any incentive to hire high scholars as interns as we are a couple of years away from becoming full time workers they can profit from?

Also, I'd like to know if below listed topics we learned in school are useful:  
  
 - Backtracking  
 - Dynamic Programming  
 - Lists  
 - Binary trees  
 - Graphs  
  
Anyway, I'd appreciate any clarification on how interning works. Thank you for reading and I'm sorry if I made any grammatical mistakes as English is not my native language.

I am in the final processes of interviewing with Cloudera, and since I have a deadline very soon, upon receiving the offer, I wouldn't have much time to make a decision, so I want to know what I'm going to do in case I get the offer.

Cloudera is located in Palo Alto, and Optum is located in Schaumburg, Illinois. While Cloudera, I would assume, is the more prestigious company to work for, I have a very heavy preference to be in Optum's location for personal reasons. 

I am currently a freshman, and this will be my second internship -- my first one is at Capital One this spring. So my question is, is Cloudera worth going across the country for, and forgoing other personal preferences as well (long-distance with girlfriend, as opposed to being very close)?

My main concern about my decision, while I'm sure I will learn plenty from either of these companies, and while this may not be the most noble reason, is what is the difference each would make on my resume -- and would Capital One + either be enough come sophomore year to get interviews at big tech companies?

If Capital One and Optum is enough to get interviews at great companies, I would likely go with Optum.

5expz8,6,2016-11-25,Got teaching credential immediately after finishing BS in Engineering. I think I made a huge mistake. Where can I go from here?,smp501,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5expz8/got_teaching_credential_immediately_after/,"Background: I graduated in 2014 with a BS in mechanical engineering and a 3.6 GPA. I also did a 1-year co-op with a manufacturing company during that time. I only went into engineering because I was top of my class and great at math and science (and my dad is an engineer). I honestly hated every minute of it (including the co-op), but didn't change majors because I had a scholarship and I didn't want to be a ""quitter"" (I know, stupid immature bullshit). Immediately after graduating I enrolled in a 1-year master's program to get a teaching credential. It came with a scholarship that requires me to teach public school for two years or else it becomes a loan. Sounds great, right?

Now I'm seriously beginning to think I fucked up big time. I really enjoyed student teaching and there are aspects of my job that I love, but I can't see myself doing this for long at all. Here's my analysis:

* Things I like about teaching - working with high school students who want to learn. I teach high and low level math and a career/internship class. I love helping students find their passion and seeing them grow. The fact that I am around people. In my engineering internship, I was either at a cubicle fighting AutoCAD/MS Excel or working with cold, dead machines all day everyday. I was still immature and had not really started ""coming out of my shell"" during this time, so I had this juvenile idea that ""I don't need other people to be happy"" (I was also really depressed - something that left me when I left engineering). I don't mind the administrative stuff either. I actually kind of like balancing schedules, planning events, having hard deadlines to work with. I like the theory behind education, working with and analyzing data. I like reading up on the latest trends in education and trying (with what little say I actually have) to implement it. I love working with big systems with lots of moving parts and trying to figure out how to make it work better. I am also a decent public speaker and I have no problem presenting to large, medium, and small groups.

* What I don't mind about teaching - long hours. Other than my internship (where I clocked out at 5:00 exactly), I haven't really ever not worked 50+ hours per week. I currently go in an hour early and stay til around 6 every day, just because those outside hours are quiet and let me actually get shit done. I'll stay as late as I need to but I do everything I can to not bring stuff home. I don't mind working with (most) parents, dealing with (most) administrators, etc. We are encouraged to take kids on a lot of field trips, so I have to make a lot of cold contacts with people to try to set things up. I have no problem doing this.

* What I don't like about teaching - Grading. curriculum planning (our school decided to try a new teaching model, but does not have any real curriculum material available to us so we have to make it up ourselves). The content. Honestly I teach math simply because I had enough math credits and anything else would have added a year to my credential program. I don't have the love of math that my colleagues do. I got into teaching to teach students, not because I am some kind of math wizard. Shitty students who have no intention of learning, have never been taught respect, and whose grades I am responsible for. As a lifelong high achiever in school, not doing the work was never an option. I took plenty of classes I hated but I always had to try. I have kids who have grades in the single digits because they turn nothing in and miss class left and right. I have a ""you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink"" attitude. I hate to waste time dealing with those that refuse to learn because I feel like I am stealing time from those who do.

Despite all of the ""don't likes,"" I think I could put up with it except for one thing - the salary. I make shit money - less than I did as an engineering co-op (i.e. no degree).

I mentioned earlier that I don't mind the long hours. However, when my take home pay comes out to about $10/hour, I really start to mind (current gross is $38k).

I am about to get married (to another teacher), and the reality of it all is hitting me like a ton of bricks. A colleague of mine was supposed to come back from maternity leave this month, but she had complications and may have to take the rest of the year. The reality of this is that if my bride-to-be ends up in the same situation, I honestly don't think I will be able to support her and a newborn. This horrifies me. My own family has to come first.

At this point I am definitely going to finish out this year and next year (I have about 25k in debt and I don't want to add another 15), but that might be it. Considering what I like and dislike about this job and my last, I am thinking that some type of business position might be better for me. I like data and numbers, but I like working with people, mentoring, and leading too.

I'm only 25 and I know that it's far from too late to change careers again, but this time I don't want to dump money into a 3rd degree to find out if I like it. People have mentioned using an MBA to get out of teaching, but I would much rather spend some time in the business world first. I would like to eventually go into some kind of management position, but I know that I need to get some more experience first.

5exrwu,0,2016-11-25,Got teaching credential immediately after finishing BS in Engineering. I think I made a huge mistake. Where do I go from here? [x-post to /r/careerguidance],smp501,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/5exrwu/got_teaching_credential_immediately_after/,"Background: I graduated in 2014 with a BS in mechanical engineering and a 3.6 GPA. I also did a 1-year co-op with a manufacturing company during that time. I only went into engineering because I was top of my class and great at math and science (and my dad is an engineer). I honestly hated every minute of it (including the co-op), but didn't change majors because I had a scholarship and I didn't want to be a ""quitter"" (I know, stupid immature bullshit). Immediately after graduating I enrolled in a 1-year master's program to get a teaching credential. It came with a scholarship that requires me to teach public school for two years or else it becomes a loan. Sounds great, right?

Now I'm seriously beginning to think I fucked up big time. I really enjoyed student teaching and there are aspects of my job that I love, but I can't see myself doing this for long at all. Here's my analysis:

* Things I like about teaching - working with high school students who want to learn. I teach high and low level math and a career/internship class. I love helping students find their passion and seeing them grow. The fact that I am around people. In my engineering internship, I was either at a cubicle fighting AutoCAD/MS Excel or working with cold, dead machines all day everyday. I was still immature and had not really started ""coming out of my shell"" during this time, so I had this juvenile idea that ""I don't need other people to be happy"" (I was also really depressed - something that left me when I left engineering). I don't mind the administrative stuff either. I actually kind of like balancing schedules, planning events, having hard deadlines to work with. I like the theory behind education, working with and analyzing data. I like reading up on the latest trends in education and trying (with what little say I actually have) to implement it. I love working with big systems with lots of moving parts and trying to figure out how to make it work better. I am also a decent public speaker and I have no problem presenting to large, medium, and small groups.

* What I don't mind about teaching - long hours. Other than my internship (where I clocked out at 5:00 exactly), I haven't really ever not worked 50+ hours per week. I currently go in an hour early and stay til around 6 every day, just because those outside hours are quiet and let me actually get shit done. I'll stay as late as I need to but I do everything I can to not bring stuff home. I don't mind working with (most) parents, dealing with (most) administrators, etc. We are encouraged to take kids on a lot of field trips, so I have to make a lot of cold contacts with people to try to set things up. I have no problem doing this.

* What I don't like about teaching - Grading. curriculum planning (our school decided to try a new teaching model, but does not have any real curriculum material available to us so we have to make it up ourselves). The content. Honestly I teach math simply because I had enough math credits and anything else would have added a year to my credential program. I don't have the love of math that my colleagues do. I got into teaching to teach students, not because I am some kind of math wizard. Shitty students who have no intention of learning, have never been taught respect, and whose grades I am responsible for. As a lifelong high achiever in school, not doing the work was never an option. I took plenty of classes I hated but I always had to try. I have kids who have grades in the single digits because they turn nothing in and miss class left and right. I have a ""you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink"" attitude. I hate to waste time dealing with those that refuse to learn because I feel like I am stealing time from those who do.

Despite all of the ""don't likes,"" I think I could put up with it except for one thing - the salary. I make shit money - less than I did as an engineering co-op (i.e. no degree). There are teachers in my building who tell me that their paycheck has actually shrunk in the last 5 years (not to mention teachers in neighboring districts were frozen on the same step for several years, shrinking their income even more).

5f09as,476,2016-11-26,"[MA] I'm the person who reported the porn on RCN/CNN. It really happened, and now I don't know what to do.",scaredpornreporter,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5f09as/ma_im_the_person_who_reported_the_porn_on_rcncnn/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm the poor sucker who tweeted about porn playing on CNN on Thanksgiving in Boston. It's been a really fucked up 24 hours and I wanted to know if this is something that I can take any kind of legal action on. I have no idea if emotional distress is something you can sue for, but any and all advice is welcome.

Here's exactly what happened. 

At 10:30 PM on Thanksgiving, I turned on my television. I have RCN, which is a regional cable provider in MA. Using the guide, I selected the Parts Unknown marathon. Instead of CNN, there was graphic pornography playing. I immediately checked to see if I had the right channel. I did. I called my fiance into the room. We laughed about it, took a bunch of pictures, texted them to a bunch of our friends, and flipped to a movie on another channel. Between 10:30 - 11 PM, we switched back to CNN a few times to see if the porn was still playing. It was. We switched back around 11, and the entire channel had gone blank, displaying an error code. No other channels were impacted by this. 

Between 10:30 and 11, I checked Twitter and Reddit to see if anyone else had reported the porn. No one else did. So, I tweeted about it, tagging @RCNconnects, asking if anyone else in Boston saw it. I tweeted a few more times, including tagging a local news aggregator, @universalhub. I included pictures, and made a few jokes about how many an angry intern broadcast the porn. I engaged with a few friends and strangers on Twitter, and then went to bed. 

Overnight, this thing blew up. ibtimes.co.uk published the first non-local article about it, claiming that *all* of Boston viewers were affected. I was asleep when this was published, and so was not available for comment. From there it went viral--everyone was talking about it. I got a million requests for interviews, which I mostly declined (I did answer a few questions from Buzzfeed because they were very nice). However, when people started realizing that it was one reporter (me), things got really ugly. I was accused in the media of making up the story, and started receiving death threats on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. I was accused of being a shill for the liberal media, for trying to get attention, for trying to manipulate the news to my benefit. I turned my Twitter private after I started receiving threats of sexual violence, and that was taken as an admission of guilt. This is still happening. 

Through all of this, RCN refused to help me. I did DM with them on Twitter for a little while to get help in resetting my TiVo box, but after that they went dark. Yesterday evening, they made a public statement that they investigated and determined it never happened. But the thing is, they never reached out to me, never let me send them the pictures my fiance and I took, and now I'm being vilified in the media for simply trying to find out if the rest of Boston was seeing hardcore porn on CNN like I was. 

So, my question is, what can I do? A few people have suggested I get a lawyer. Is this even something I can try to sue RCN about? All I want is an acknowledgement from them that yes, this really happened to an isolated user. I want the death and rape threats to stop. I did file a complaint with the FCC, but I am not sure if I should take this further or in a different direction. 

Thanks for your help. I'm happy to answer any questions. "

So I'm currently doing a yearlong internship at eBay Canada as a Strategy and Analytics intern (mix of SQL, Hive, R, Excel, Tableau, Google Analytics) but I have been looking for a summer 2017 internship in Data Science since I want to break into that industry eventually. I realize that a lot of the comments on this sub point towards Data Science being a field for a Masters/PhD holder but I think that is more in line for research-oriented jobs or those where the projects are very time/resource heavy (e.g. the DataSci team at my company is focusing on redefining our search algorithms, which is like a 2 year project).

I am more interested in jobs that are ""advanced analytics"" i.e. jobs with applied ML/Data Mining techniques, for example the following few jobs:

* [Knewton - Data Science Internship](https://jobs.lever.co/knewton/79090e31-dc2c-4445-b443-88aed9c68f3e)

My background is in Industrial/Systems Engineering, so I have taken a fair amount of courses in Statistics, Operations Research, Programming etc. I am also currently taking some online courses in Machine Learning (e.g. [Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and the [MIT Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-2) and I hope to follow up with some Kaggle competitions to get some more experience

People, including my professors and former supervisors at work will say things like, ""Oh! You're still here, or ""I thought you graduated already"".

I am in my third year electrical engineering in Toronto, Canada. I recently got an internship that starts in May 2017 for 16 months. During the interview, the manager was explaining the ASIC design process, starting from RTL and going to physical design and so on until tape out. 

Then, he told me what his team does is, they get less important yet needed circuits (Intellectual Property) from external sources and use them in their own chips (GPU/CPU/PCI/etc). What his team does is, they make sure that those IPs actually work, and comply to the specifications and designs that this company gives them (or something like that) and that it can integrate into their chips, and that they don't do RTL and things like that. and for example if the IP doesnt work, it will involve report typing to explain the issues, using simulations etc to show them what we mean when we say it doesnt work.
 
He also said that i would be analyzing hybrid circuits (ie. look like logic gates but really arents, depending on where you put the input/output in mosfets, etc)


The job description as at the end. Now, my question is, after reading the description + reading what the guy told me during the interview which differs slightly from the description, does it seem like a physical verification job? or ASIC design job? are the ""WHAT YOU WILL LEARN"" actually useful and used in the industry? (i dont know what some of them mean, but will learn them in the job). 
Can what I learn from this job be applied in other jobs in microsystems engineering in real life? I am just worried that i will be wasting a year of my life doing just testing/report writing.

Please enlighten me, thank you very much.

I've gotten a bunch of offers and i've narrowed it down to 2 places. These are places where I would definitely have signed off on if I didn't have the other. I'm in engineering but not a CS/ECE major, but both of these are software engineering positions (i took a fuckton of cs classes).

1) The first is the one I'm leaning towards: It is with a three letter intel agency in DC doing something I think I would really enjoy and be good at. There are opportunities to travel and work overseas which is really attractive to me. The catch is that it is conditional on me receiving a high security clearance, I don't see there being any issues with it BUT anything could happen (I'd have to get polygraphed) and they can pull their offer at anytime if they find anything they don't like. The salary for this one is 10K less than option 2, I'm totally fine with taking less money for this job though.

2) The second is with a national lab also in the DC area, I'd be doing something similar to what i did in a past internship (and I enjoyed). This job is unconditional and final, I have it as soon as a sign the acceptance letter. The salary on the higher end of what i was expecting and 10k more than option 1.

I really want to do the first one, even though it is a massive risk (I did some googling and about 9% of job offers are pulled during the clearance process). But hey its good to take risks right? My parents think it would be extremely stupid to do this and that I should accept the job with a higher salary immediately.

3) There is a third option, one that I really don't want to do. I could accept the first option and another job offer, and then renege when my offer with job 1 becomes final. This provides a safety net, but theres a 91% chance I would renege and I would be burning a bridge. 

What would you do?"

Are there events or ""parties"" within these companies? I'm just worried it will be a never ending circle of work, sit in the apartment, sleep.

It's been 5 weeks now, and I haven't heard back. I'm not sure what to do now. 

This is the only internship I can find for a web development related position that I'm at all qualified for. I'm kind of struggling to find something, I need to really get in the industry before I graduate :/

I've narrowed it down to the two listed below. This will be my last internship so any suggestions of preferring one over the other are welcome.

1) SE Intern at leading search engine company - machine learning project - team matching got me matched up with my prospective manager.  
 Pros - Not surprisingly, he knew exactly what he was talking about, was really motivating throughout our talks and had an open mind when i suggested some small changes to some of his project ideas. I could see myself learning a lot if i join them this summer. Also, have never interned at a pure tech firm/at bay area before so would love to do so!

 Cons - They does not have a direct return offer policy, instead you go through ""exit"" interviews and i've seen a lot of smart people at school not make it through those. If i were to return as a full timer, the impact factor for a starting position is generally low in such a huge company.

2) Quant Researcher intern at a leading hedgefund in Chicago - project not decided yet.
 Pros - Known to a pretty intensive program which i see as a fun challenge to take up and also try to get in par with the rest(who mostly come from a more math background than me - pure CS). Additionally, its a lot more personalized since the intake numbers are quite few so a lot more attention is paid to pairing you up with a team(which will only be done after i sign) and making sure you learn.

 Cons - Previously interned there as an SE intern so might not add much diversity to my resume(although i didn't mind that earlier, i'm told i should be taking that into account). If i were to return as a full timer, Chicago winters are going to constantly remind me on the better weather opportunities that i've passed up on :(

P.S. - I understand that ""quant researcher"" is a broad term but i expect to be working on a project which needs a skillset similar to the one required for the tech internship project.

I've put this decision off for as long as i could and can't delay it any longer. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I've worked the field as an intern for 2 straight summers at a high profile company and got a job out of college at a different high profile company and have worked here for a year. I have done research in this field including one publication that was awarded at a in- field symposium. 

Okay, now that backgrounds out of the way, I need a break and am thinking taking a one year break just to try and travel a little and fulfill some personal goals. Would it be career suicide to quit now for this break and try to find a job again maybe a year give or take some months later? I am worried if I quit at this early stage it may be hard to get back into an engineering career due to that one year 'gap'."

It's part time and does not pay benefits but it was close to twice the pay I was making prior to. And it's in my field of study, which is crucial to have as a doctoral student. I passed up an assistantship for this position because on paper it looks 1,000 times better. And I thought I would be more likely to be better off in the job market. I've done some internships, but mainly my experience is in academia, which is not what I plan to do. 

Fast forward a few months, the role is not consistent with what I was told it would be, I have to pay over $300 a month in marketplace insurance premiums and none of my doctors or meds are covered. They promised me full time hours a few months in (with benefits) but that is not going to happen because the other girl I work with raised hell about not having enough hours. She was an intern previously so it's understandable, but it was not conveyed to me there would be a pecking order in who receives more hours/benefits. There is no work life balance, people are texting each other 24/7 because my bosses are always out of town. It's obvious I don't belong here but I feel so stuck. 

The issue is, this is my dream company, and eventually I was hoping to work my way up. It might burn a bridge if I quit, but I found a job on campus. 

It would be half the pay, but would cover my tuition and health insurance. It would be a pretty mindless position, that I am overqualified for but in a sense it might be better for my mental well being. I could still do my research and work, there would be plenty of time for that. In fact, I might even be more productive because of the convenience. Any advice? 

I realize I am lucky to have a job and be in this position to choose, but I also must say, I am torn on what decision to make. All of my professors would tell me not to leave, my family tells me not to leave because of the money, but worse case scenario, I can take out loans if I need to. At this point I have a lot of educational debt accumulated from doing a Ph.D. I am just trying to reach candidacy. Then school will be significantly cheaper and I can work more hours. I am in so much debt now, I realistically do not think even a small pay cut will make much of a difference at this point. I have been educating myself on my loan payment options but I'm just really frustrated. "

So I have to do some catch up. I'm currently taking 18 credits Cal 1, Physics 1, Programing class and Digital Fundamentals. In high school the only difficult class I had was my honors math classes and they barely any work, so I did not have to do a lot of work and had 3.9 GPA when I graduated. 

Freshman year of College I would always hear the professor say ever hour in class is equal to 2 hours at home and that was not the case for my last year. But this year I'm taking 18 credit and right now it's hitting me like a truck. 

I have never had a grade lower than B minus in my life but now I have a D minus in my physics class. I don't know if I will be able to get it up to a C and it's making really stressed which is making me depressed and that is making my grades in other classes lower as well. 

My biggest problem is that I used to do my homework last minute because it was so easy but now I can't do that and it has been difficult because it has turned to a habit of always leaving my homework to the last minute and because I have so much I can't finish and hurts my grades. 

I found this sub Reddit and the more I read the more I felt more stupid compared to all of the people here. You guys have internships, CO OPs, work and good grades.

If some of you that have/had had Ds or lower, how did you deal with it?

Also I really really want to do Software Engineering. 

Sorry for the long post any type of help would be appreciated.

I suffer from insecurity issues and when I graduated school in Dec 2015 with a degree in Electrical engineering, no internship, co-op or experience, I didn't apply to places for 5 months because I felt really dumb. Possibly the most idiotic and worst engineer and nobody wants me. I have a 3.00 GPA but I'm so pitifully ashamed of it.

I've been working at retail for about 8 months. Since the beginning of August, I've applied to 87 places exact and I only heard back from 3 places for interviews. 1 didn't pan out. I'm waiting on 2 of them but I'm not expecting much since it's been 1 week+. I've gotten 15 straight out rejection letters.

I had my heart set on one place and put all my basket on one place because I really really wanted it and I put my focus and attention to that one company but it's been 2 weeks+ since the interview. The interview was on the 10th of this month. They told me at the end of the interview, ""We have a few candidates that we need to interview. Expect an answer from us in 2 weeks."" Thinking bout it now, that sort of sounds like a rejection statement. Two weeks pass by and it's thanksgiving holiday. The company has off on Thursday and Friday. I plan on calling on monday to see the status of my application. I've read on glassdoor that a lot of individuals got offers within a week. (They never said what time frame that they would get it.) I've read on glassdoor that some individuals heard back after 2-3 weeks and like 1-2 people got it a month later.

For the whole situation with hearing back, I heard that companies vary. Big companies take several weeks. A lot of people hear back in a few days or a week. My friend who had an interview with Boeing got an offer 6 days after. However, I don't know if he were told the time frame or the situation in when to expect an answer. I've heard people say they got an offer 2-3 weeks after or worst case scenario 2 months after. I honestly don't know what to think.

I don't know what to do. My parents are quietly disappointed in me. They support me but they are disappointed. They tell me to go back to grad school but I don't want to spend any more (of my parent's) money nor have the drive or will to go back to school and study. But if I can't find a job, should I just go back to school? Applying online sucks a lot and I'm feeling less and less motivated to continue on.

I've applied to 70+ companies using Indeed and I've been getting more responses from Monster but not much. I use the same resume but I custom tailor my cover letter. I get a lot of differing opinions on this and I don't know what to think. It feels like custom tailoring my resume every damn time is just such a time sink and a complete waste of time because in the end, I don't have experience or a lot of relevant experience since I'm just a fresh graduate. I had my resume tailored by my uncle who is doing incredibly well. He graduated from MIT and has done a lot of interviews. He says my resume looks great (minus the experience part) and I've been doing everything he told me to but I still can't get anything.

I can't give up. But I'm growing ever so paranoid and depressed and feeling incredibly worthless. I don't know what to do.
For those thinking that I'm having a pity party, I don't want sympathy. I don't care if you won't give me sympathy because I don't have experience. It's not the point of my situation. What is done is done. All I want is something genuine. Any advice, tips and/or stories?"

5f8wdv,756,2016-11-27,"""Please buy yourself a £130 router for £50.""",artofcode-,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5f8wdv/please_buy_yourself_a_130_router_for_50/,"LTL, FTP, and all that. To be clear, this isn't a customer complaint though some of it may seem that way - spoiler: I end up sorting the issues out with a contrived solution myself.

I've spent a number of years being family and friends' go-to tech support, which has left me with excellent Google-fu and a mind for unconventional solutions. I recently started university (Computer Science) about 150 miles away from my home in $LargeUKCity. So, of course, new house, new landlord, except the contract's in my name now. Scary, right?

It's a 7-person house, split over three floors (2 ground, 3 first, and 2 second). Everything went swimmingly well for oh, about an hour. At which point we discovered the landlord hadn't arranged for anyone to come and do the incredibly technical job of putting the router in for us. In short: we had no Internet.

At this point I should probably add some detail about $Landlord. $Landlord was a small company - one man, his wife, an assistant, and an intern (third-year Business &amp; Management student who knew how to check her emails and that was about it). None of them knew tech very well, so they left whatever they could to their contractors - the builders who refurbished the house over the summer, for example (who returned several times over the first few weeks to finish the things they hadn't done... small things, like the hob and oven not working), or the electricians (who also returned in the first few weeks... to assess the electrician who wired the house to start with). They were all... rather anxious, shall we say, about letting students anywhere near any technology they had, in case it broke and they couldn't fix it.

So, first day, we have no Internet. Excellent. (For context, this is a cable fibre service from $BigISP.) Because we had strict instructions not to ""mess with the electronics"" (really?), I make a call to $Landlord, and get $Intern on the phone.

&gt; **$Intern:** Hello, you've reached $Landlord, $Intern speaking, how can I help?  
&gt; **$Me:** This is $Me at $Address. Our router has been left unconnected. I'd connect it, but your boss left us instructions not to mess with the electronics.  
&gt; **$Intern:** Oh no no, don't connect it yourself. We'll send the builders to connect it - how does Thursday next week sound?  
&gt; *It's Saturday.*  
&gt; **$Me:** I appreciate the offer but all 7 of us are starting our courses on Monday, and will need access to online resources. I'm quite happy to connect it myself and call you back if I need any more details, I'd just like to check with you first.  
&gt; **$Intern:** No, don't touch it! $Boss doesn't want the equipment to get damaged. We'll send the builders as early as possible, probably Tuesday or Wednesday.  
&gt; **$Me:** *having previously told them what I study, am now a touch peeved that they think I'm incompetent* Thanks, but we'll need service earlier than that. I'll connect it up tonight, and I'll take liability for any damage that occurs.

Some spluttering happened, followed by a prompt hanging-up. They called on Monday morning to check what was happening. I'd connected up, no problems, and no damage. They slowly started to trust me with tech after this.

Fast forward to about three weeks ago, and the Internet had been playing up for the past month-and-a-half. Sporadically kicking devices from the network, dropping out for extended periods of time, and no service at all on the top floor (they ended up buying themselves Powerline kits). I'd been through every setting on the router's control panel, and couldn't find a thing wrong. Apart from the fact that we were trying to serve 35 devices on a router designed for no more than 10.

I sent $Intern an email (she was our Designated Contact), detailing the issues and explaining that we needed a new router. On a gamble, I also explained that as the house was a 7-person house and students have more than one device per person, they should have provided a router that would be capable of serving more than 10 devices. They didn't buy that strategy, unfortunately, and the return email told me that as the router was an ISP-provided router, they'd be contacting the ISP to see about obtaining a replacement.

Two days later, the ISP offered them £50 to sort the problem out themselves (""here's £50, find yourselves a new router""). That got forwarded to me. I spent a good while searching but couldn't come up with a single router that advertised itself as supporting 35 devices for under £50 (the cheapest was a Netgear something-or-other at £130), and relayed that information back.

&gt; **$Intern (email):** I'm sorry but £50 is all we can offer. $ISP has also made it clear they will not be sending an installation team, so you'll need to do this yourself.

So, armed with nothing but a £50 budget and Google-fu, I went hunting...

...and came back with a contrived solution involving 21 metres of Ethernet cable, a switch, and two new routers. Under £50. Which, to my amazement, $Landlord approved.

I spent a couple hours the day after the deliveries arrived installing everything. The original router remained in place. I connected the switch to the original router, and then one metre of the Ethernet cable went from the switch to one of the new routers. The other 20 metres I spent an hour cable-clipping from the switch along skirting boards and door frames up the stairs so that I could put the second new router on the first floor, and we'd finally have signal on the top floor. I connected everything up, powered on, and to a large smile from me, it all worked first time.

You'll be pleased to hear that I also spent some time securing the whole thing - good passwords on both networks, changed the admin credentials, disabled WPS, etc etc. We now rest happy on 50 Mbps connections.

**TL;DR:** Landlord gives me £50 to solve a £130 problem, and I manage it by mangling networks in a way that many people here will want to lynch me for. *But it works.*

EDIT: $Landlord sold the property to a new landlord shortly afterwards - people who are slightly more technical, and offered to pay me for fixing the issues. Free money - I won't object."

I graduated in May with a bachelors in CS. I applied for about 4 months before I got a job and it got pretty depressing sitting at home doing about nothing. 

I was applying in many different states including MA, NY, CT, WA, CA, CO and NC. No dice. I applied reluctantly near home in KY (I was very against this at the time but was getting desperate). I landed an interview that same week and got the job the same day I interviewed. The pay is pretty bad honestly, I feel insanely undervalued. I commute about 2 hours every day for this not so great pay and honestly I am not learning a lot. I am mostly employing what I already know. It's a small company and I am actually the only programmer here. There isn't really anyone to learn from in those terms. When I'm between projects I keep myself busy and I have been teaching myself new stuff, but sometimes it is just better to learn from more experienced people.

Everyone at work is very nice to me and my boss is a really cool guy that doesn't care what I do as long as I get the job done. 


So here are pros/cons

Pros:

Everyone is nice, boss is pretty chill, I get to live at home rent free for now. I will say that my parents are moving in a year so I won't have that luxury after that.

Cons:

Just plain bad pay, nobody to really learn from (self teaching mostly), I don't really see an opportunity to move up here, not so great commute (which I wouldn't mind if there were less other cons), and I really hate living here.

I have been focusing more on NY recently (because I went to school in CT and frequented NY a lot and have a lot of family there too) and I would very much love to get a job there. Preferably as some sort of full stack/front end web developer. I have most of my internship and current job experience with C# type applications though. (I wouldn't be opposed to getting another job like this, but I much prefer the web stuff as I feel like I am best at it).

I'm hitting the 3 month mark soon at my current job and I already want out honestly. How long do you think I should stay here before I start applying again out of state? I don't have a contract, rather the contract is at-will meaning I can leave at any time. I was thinking that I start applying seriously at 6-8 months? I have sent out an application here or there since I've started, but very little. Maybe like once a week or something when I reflect on this job.

I understand everyone has to start somewhere, but I would prefer that somewhere to be somewhere else right now. I should be thankful, I have friends that are still looking and nearing the 6-7? month mark I believe. But again. I am trying to think about 

My career,

My pay,

and where I want to live where I will be happiest. 

I also attached my resume if anyone would like to critique it (not necessary, but if you're feeling generous!): http://imgur.com/a/oQ28K

I also have a website, but I won't list that here. If for some reason you want to see it please ask and I will PM you.

I told the engineer that I was and we had around a 20 minute phone call where we went over what I would be doing during the internship if I did accept it and some behavioral interview stuff. He then said he would send a recommendation to HR to send me an offer letter - does this mean that I've got a verbal offer? And how long does it take for them to extend an official offer letter?

Additionally, Intel is a hardware company but I'm really interested in software and mostly back-end development. The engineer said during the internship I would writing Python code to test hardware and some other stuff (I'm not too sure what it was - my memory is a bit hazy). But I'm afraid I won't get an internship with any other company that's as big as Intel. If I do get an offer, should I take it?

I recently just got accepted to Google's EP. I was wondering what I can do now, up until I start, to improve and be successful at the internship? I am sophomore currently, if that makes a difference.

**Background**: I'm currently working on my BS + MS in computer science and a minor in electrical engineering (which I've already completed). I'd like a software or embedded software/hardware job in the Bay Area (CA) when I graduate, and have had 5 internships in engineering at one company, might go back for a 6th in their software department this next summer. 

I'm taking 5 CS classes (this is normal) next semester and one filler class; if I take a Systems Software class next semester and another one the semester after that, my minor in Electrical Engineering could become a double major in Computer Engineering based on the classes I've already taken. 

Since I have the time in my schedule, I'm also pursuing an AI + ML cert with my MS degree. I'm hoping the CoE/CS/AI+ML background will open up some doors for me upon graduation. 


**Question:** Those of you who double majored in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, what made you decide to do it and how has it shaped your career path? "

It could be Business, it could be CS/IT, it could be something else potentially. Please let me know if you think it should be changed and I'll re-flair it.*

[Here's the link to the PDF.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3QizC5aOsV4Z3NzMWlfbWt6enc/view?usp=sharing)

This is the end result of lurking here for a long time and combining suggestions from several templates and resources. The Profile section and the relevant coursework will of course get modified to match the skills the job description mentioned, but this is my best hack at it before any application-specific changes. 

I do have some additional work experience, but it's typical teenager-summer-job stuff and I'd rather eschew it for more of the meat.

---

Some things I'd like to change but am a little stuck on: 

- In ""Grew to fill a void in the team..."", I'd like to be a little stronger - maybe ""Took initiative to expand responsibilites"", but that doesn't sound quite right. What else could I say here?

- I want to make it clearer that I'm pretty damn good with Excel - IF(), SUMIF()/COUNTIF(), VLOOKUP()/HLOOKUP(), INDEX(MATCH()), pivot tables/charts, slicers, conditional formatting; no VBA yet, but I'm working on it. The bullet points further down do a good job with that, but what's a better way to quickly describe this in-line in the Profile, beyond ""advanced experience with Excel,"" which can mean basically anything?

- The second point under Intern is a bit weak, but my work at that time was pretty anaemic in terms of the ""wow"" factor. How could I best punch it up a bit?

Any other criticisms are welcome as well - thank you so much for the time and attention!"

I have held two previous internships, one of which was with Bloomberg. I have a job offer at a big four Silicon Valley company (google, facebook, microsoft, apple) for a PM internship position.

I feel like I have sacrificed enough of my mental health for my classes and prepping for these job interviews and I have had enough. I know it's just an internship, but it's the type that typically can convert into a full time offer. Can I essentially slack off for the remainder of college to preserve my sanity/health and when the summer rolls by, focus on securing a full time offer at the company? Or is my strategy off? "
5fd3xy,2,2016-11-28,How should I explain a 1+ year gap?,werzor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fd3xy/how_should_i_explain_a_1_year_gap/,"I graduated from college 18 months ago. I haven't had a job since graduating, so I'm wondering how I should tackle the question when an interviewer asks.

Honestly... the reasons for the gap aren't so good.

- Shortly after graduating, my gastrointestinal system started acting up (rapid weight loss, nausea, etc), and I went to see a few doctors. They did some tests over the span of a few months, but ultimately didn't find anything wrong. I didn't want to start a new job at the time because it was between all the tests, even though I felt OK most days.

- Even after the tests finished, I wasn't sure that I really wanted a job... I only applied to a few close-by jobs during the time since I don't feel comfortable going too far away from home.

- In the meantime, I didn't do much by way of extracurricular activities... No volunteer work, no travel... Just a few online Coursera courses, which I took for free (so no certificate, either). The rest of the time was spent doing my own thing (not relevant to CS/software, unfortunately).

Everyone I've talked to so far recommended not talking about being sick, since it's still ""undiagnosed"" and I still have problems with it sometimes (mostly nausea). 

Since it's been over a year, I'm thinking the gap will just get tougher and tougher to explain, so I guess I need to find any sort of CS-relevant job now. (I've mostly been looking at entry-level stuff, or even internships.)

How should I explain the gap as it is now?"
5fdg5m,49,2016-11-28,Ghosts are not my biggest fear.,yoink1777,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5fdg5m/ghosts_are_not_my_biggest_fear/,"I suppose this all started with my girlfriend’s “haunted” apartment. I say haunted, but in all honesty, that was her belief and hers alone; I’ve always been quite disinclined to believe in the supernatural. I was never the one shaking in his boots, when my dad would tell me and my brothers ghost stories around the campfire, but even still, I have to admit that there were some very peculiar things that transpired at my girlfriend’s apartment.

About a month after she moved into her new place, she started complaining to me about little things happening: hearing footsteps at night, things being in different places than where she left them, hearing soft breathing when she was alone. You know, just your typical ghost stuff. I always just brushed it off, assuming she wasn’t used to living without any roommates and wasn’t used to her new apartment. I started staying the night with her pretty often, and I remember very specifically the first night that I started to believe something was up.


I was in bed next to Ava when I heard the footsteps. Ava stirred beside me, and I knew she was awake. 
“You hear that too, right?” She whispered, as she pulled herself tight against me. 
“Don’t worry, babe. It’s probably nothing. I’ll go check it out.” I whispered back, only half believing what I said. 

The footsteps quieted, and the only thing I could hear now was my heart rhythmically malleating my rib cage. I whispered to Ava to stay right where she was. I grabbed the .22 that I had brought over, and crept up to the door and threw it open. I couldn’t make out much in the darkness, so I flicked on the lights and found absolutely nothing. I checked the rest of the kitchen and peeked in the bathroom but only found a whole lot more of nothing. 
“There’s nothing out there. It must have been someone walking around on the floor above us. You can go back to bed.” I reported as I walked back into the bedroom.

I still locked the door when I came back in though. And I still held Ava especially tight as my mind drifted off to far away places, because skeptical of ghost or not, I swear somehow I knew there was something wrong right then and there. 

The next day we were a little shaken, so we decided to take a trip down to our favorite spot, a secluded little beach surrounded by a mangrove preserve. Before we left, I decided it would probably be best to relinquish my bowels before venturing out to a beach in the middle of nowhere. Sitting on the toilet, I heard Ava call out to me.
	
“Hey James, have you seen my keys?”
	
“No. I haven’t seen them since yesterday.”

Well haunted or not, this is one hell of an apartment, I thought as I looked around the bathroom. It was furnished with candles and pictures of little Italian towns. There was even a huge closet next to the shower that could be filled with towels, soap, shampoo, and what have you. Sure as hell a luxurious apartment. Ava came over and opened the door as I was washing my hands.

“I haven’t seen them since yesterday, either.” She said with a frown. “And we can’t leave without locking up.” 
We retraced steps, but came up empty. We checked out the entire apartment and found nothing. Finally, I rechecked the bathroom, and there they were. Right by the sink. 
“Found them, babe!” 
“I never ever put them here. I swear this place is haunted.” She muttered. “Let’s go. I want to get out of this place.” 

We spent the entire day holding each other and watching the waves stroke the shore. We set up a blanket and felt so small as the sun started to disappear into where the sea becomes the sky. The day’s last rays of sunlight danced on Ava’s dirty blond hair, and I couldn’t help kissing her. Next thing I know she’s wrapped around me, and we’re wrapped up in the darkness of the night. 
“Let’s go back to the car. I don’t want to get you all sandy.” she whispered with a smirk. Her breath tickled my face, and I could smell the winter mint gum she always chewed.

We walked back to the car hand in hand. We were the only car parked outside of a little shack that rented out kayaks during the day. The road that led to the beach was a straight shot to the shore, but there was also a cul-de-sac off to the side, tucked into the mangrove forest where the shack was situated. 


The less clothing we had on, the more the windows started to fog as we messed around in the back seat. Ava’s hand’s fluttered around the strings of my bathing suit, but then she quickly pulled them away.
“Shit! Look someone’s coming.”
I look up to see headlights. There was a car coming down the road. It turned into the cul-de-sac, and we could see it was a beat-up pickup truck. 
“Babe, put some clothes on, this might be private property.” Ava, said as she threw a shirt at me. 
But whoever was in the truck didn’t bother us. Hell, maybe it was just another couple looking for a spot to bang. The truck lurched around the entire cul-de-sac, stopping only briefly to look at us. 


“Well, uhh, that was weird. But let’s get back to it.” I chuckled while Ava kissed my neck. But after another five minutes or so, the truck came back, and did the same thing, and again we stopped only to watch It slowly circle the cul-de-sac. When it happened for the third time, Ava groaned as she saw it. 
“The truck is coming, again.”

 I was getting pretty tired of this shit. 
	
“Well the truck isn’t what’s supposed to be coming right now. There not going to do anything anyways, so let’s just ignore it.” 
	

And with that it was settled. The truck left the cul-de-sac, and the outside world disappeared to us. We held hands and locked eyes as our bodies fused together. I winced with pain and turned my head to the side as she gave me a deep scratch down my back. That’s when I saw him. There was a man standing right outside the side window staring and standing dead still. He was dressed in a hoodie with a ragged flannel over it. He had a huge frame, but that was about the only distinguishable feature because he wore a hat and his hood up so that shadows enshrouded his face.


“holy shit! Put on clothes babe. Put on clothes. There’s someone outside.” I ordered as I scrambled off of her. 
	

“Roll down the window, once we get our clothes on, babe. He probably just wants us to leave.” Ava said, trying to hide how flustered she was. 


“Well, he sure as hell doesn’t look like he wants to chit chat.” I responded. “I mean look at him, he’s still just standing and staring. Not that I blame him, you do have a pretty nice rack.” I burst out laughing, but Ava didn’t think it was so funny. She threw on her shirt and started to reach over to roll down the window, when suddenly the man leaned forward and pressed the brim of his hat against the window. The darkness from the hood still obscured the view of his face, but you could tell he was facing at Ava. He cocked his head sideways and pointed a finger right at Ava, then retracted away from the window and took a step back. 


“Lock the door… lock the doors right now.” Ava said. 
I looked around to find the lock button in the darkness. I finally found it, and the locks clicked shut. I looked back up to the window, but couldn’t see very far into the darkness because of the fog on the window. I opened the door, gripping the baseball bat that I keep in the car with white knuckles. But the man had disappeared, and the only thing I heard was the sound of a truck driving off into the distance. 

	

“Do you have any idea who that could have been?” I asked Ava as I handed her some coffee. She had decided to stay the night at my place after that strange encounter, and I couldn’t blame her. Despite the unnerving nature of what happened, I tried to offer some more optimistic explanations.


“You know maybe he was just the owner of the kayak shop, and he wanted to scare us off. Maybe he thought we were trying to steal something.”

Ava was sitting on the coach in the fetal position with her hands wrapped tightly around the coffee mug. She pulled a tissue from her pocket and stuffed her winter mint gum into it, before taking a sip of her coffee. She looked up at me, and I could see her eyes were a bit red. 
	

“I think I know who it was,” she said. “A man from work that I met about two months ago. Right before you and I started dating.”
	

Ava interned at a private practice for clinical psychology. She was trying to build up a little work experience before pursuing her dream of going back to school and getting her masters then opening up her own private practice. She did a little bit of everything at her job, everything from paperwork to making the obligatory intern coffee runs. She even got to sit in on some therapy sessions, and I know she really enjoyed that. She also really loved her boss, Dr. Higley. I’ve never met him, but he seems to be a great guy from what I’ve heard. The type of guy who really cares about everyone around him. Anyways, I couldn’t really imagine anyone from her work doing something like that, but I listened as she continued.
	

“There was a man who would come in to see Dr. Higley pretty often. I would see him around the building and catch him looking at me every now and then, but I didn’t think much of it. We started having small talk every now and then, and then one day when I was walking to my car he approached me, said we should go out for coffee some time. Kyle was his name, and well he was brave enough to ask me out, but something about him just gave me bad vibes, so I told him it was probably best if we didn’t because it could get messy mixing work and dating. He didn’t really know how to take it. He just kind of stood there for a second, opened his mouth as if to say something, but nothing came out. His lips just quivered as he tried to form words. After a while, he turned around and darted off. I dreaded the inevitable awkwardness of seeing him at work after that, but he never came back.” 
	

“That was a pretty long time ago, Ava. Are you sure he was that hurt by a little rejection?”
	

“Yes. I’m getting there, babe. You see, after I turned him down, I got a text talking about how he couldn’t believe I would embarrass him like that, and how insulted he was yada yada yada.”
	
“How’d he get your number?” I chimed in.
	
“I’m not sure. I think it was through facebook. I used to have my number in my facebook information, and he knew my name, so that would be my guess.”
	
“Well, what happened after that?” I asked.
	
“Nothing really. I didn’t respond, and I never heard from him again. But look James, I think I should just stay here with you tonight, and then pick Dr. Higley’s brain about Kyle tomorrow. I know he is pretty adamant on patient confidentiality, but if I tell him the situation I think I can squeeze some information out of him about what this guy’s problem is, and if he really would hurt us.”



Ok. It’s 6:30. She really should be back by now. I thought to myself. My finger nails were starting to hurt from incessantly tapping the table I was sitting at. I’d called her three times and got nothing, so I decided to give Dr. Higley’s office number a call. I found the contact in my phone, and he picked up after a few rings. 
	
“Hello, Dr. Marten Higley speaking.”
	
“Hi, Dr. Higley. I’m sorry to bother you at work, but this is Ava’s boyfriend James, and I was just trying to get in touch with her.”
	
“Oh. Yes. James, I’ve heard plenty of good things about you. But I’m afraid I’m not entirely sure of Ava’s whereabouts. She stuck around after everyone left because she had a few personal questions for me. However, she left the office about a half hour ago.” 
	

It felt like there was a weight in my stomach when I heard that. If she left a half hour ago, there is no reason she shouldn’t be back by now. I grabbed my wallet, ran down to my car, started the car, and started dialing 911 when I finally get a text from Ava:
	
Sorry, babe. I was driving back to your place, when I realized I’m going to need to grab some more clothes from my place for tomorrow. Would you mind meeting me at my apartment? I don’t want to go in by myself.
	

The heavy feeling in my stomach subsided when I saw her text. I replied, then started on my way to her place. I tried calling her on the way, but she wouldn’t pick up for some reason.
	
I got to her place, and panic started to set in when I didn’t see her car. I raced up to her door, and found it was unlocked. 
	

“who the fuck is in here?!” I screamed into the apartment. 	
But the only response was utter silence. I dashed to Ava’s bedroom and grabbed the .22 that I had left on the nightstand. Clutching the gun, I checked the rest of the apartment, but it was empty. As I passed by the bathroom again, I noticed something different. The closet in the bathroom was open. I walked into the room, and looked in the closet. It was empty except for multiple wrappers from cereal bars and other various discarded food scraps. 
“Holy shit. I think I would have preferred ghosts.” I muttered.
I went back out to the kitchen to grab my keys that I had thrown onto the table, and that’s when I noticed what Kyle had left for me to find. On the table, there was a picture of Ava sleeping with a message scribbled on it – if you call the police, I’ll kill her. 


Okay there has to be a way I can find out where she is, I thought. I decided on texting her phone. Kyle must have it, and he must have sent me the text to get me here, pretending to be Ava. I grabbed my phone, and despite my hands shaking like I had Parkinson’s, I wrote this: I won’t call the police. Just tell me what you want, and we can work something out. Just please don’t hurt her.
 Eventually I got this text back: Come to the beach. You’re next.
I grabbed my keys and my .22 and dashed to out to the car.

	

My tires screamed as I made the sharp turn into the cul-de-sac. I threw the car into park right in front of the kayak rental shack, jumped out of the car, and started yelling Ava’s name. The only response I could hear was the sound of a mosquito buzzing around my ear. After about a minute of yelling, I saw a flashlight blinking at me from about forty feet deep in the mangrove forest. I kept the gun hidden as I started to make my way through the convoluted roots of the mangroves. 
	

The cover of the mangroves created a new kind of darkness. The kind of darkness that could swallow you whole if you weren’t careful. I could just barely see enough to avoid getting my feet caught in the mess of tangled roots that, in some areas, rose up from almost every inch of the muddy ground.  All of a sudden, I heard a deep, gravelly voice from behind me.
	
“Are you scared, James? Are you scared of the dark?”
	
I twirled around to see the shadowy outline of Kyle’s huge frame looming ten feet away from me. 
	

“Where is she?!” I demanded.
	
“Don’t worry. She might be still alive.” He chuckled as he took a step towards me. 
	
I pointed the gun at him, and I could feel my hand shaking with fear as I aimed. 

“Don’t come any closer. I’ll…I’ll fucking kill you!” I screamed. But he didn’t stop. He got within five feet of me and stopped right where there was a break in the canopy, and a few rays of moonlight shined onto him. He was wearing that same old hoodie and hat. The moonlight also revealed the shine of a knife big enough to go all the way through me. 

There wasn’t any time to think once I saw the knife. I pointed the gun right at his gut, and pulled the trigger. I expected the forest to explode with light and sound, but nothing happened. I tried it again and again, but every time, the gun responded with just a meager click. 
“Fuck…fuck…” I started to stumble backwards, whacking the gun with my hand, hoping some concussive maintenance could get it to fire. I look up to see Kyle reach into his pocket and then hold his fist out in front of him. He opened his fist, and I watched the .22 caliber bullets fall to the ground. I tried to turn and run, but my foot caught on a root, and I tumbled to the ground, and just as I fell I heard Kyle charge towards me. I grabbed a handful of dirt and flung it at his face. The dirt caught him just before he was in striking distance, and he let out a yell. It wasn’t enough to stop him though. With the blade of the knife facing down in his fist he swung down at me. At the same time, I landed a kick to his thigh that sent him stumbling backwards. The knife still grazed my inner thigh, though, and I felt the burn of the knife separating skin.	


I managed to get up in a split second and put some distance between us before he could strike again. I dodged root after root until I saw a four-foot-long piece of drift wood on the ground, and an idea popped into my head. I stumbled down, and let out a yelp, making it look as if I rolled an ankle. I could hear Kyle stomping through the mud behind me. When the footsteps were close enough I made an attempt to get up, but then tumbled back down, pretending my ankle couldn’t support me. I knelt still on the ground and found the piece of drift wood with my hands. I gripped it and waited for Kyle to get close enough. When the footfall was close enough I stood up and whipped around, brandishing the piece of drift wood. Kyle had the knife raise in his right hand ready to come down on me. I spotted it and swung the wood across my body at it. The wood connected right at Kyle’s knuckles, and I saw the knife fly out of his hand. I saw Kyle’s head follow the knife as it flew to the ground, and before he could even turn his head back to face me, I landed another blow right on his temple. The wood was moving so fast I heard it cut through the air, and I felt it splinter as it connected with his temple. He fell to the ground, and I was on him in an instant. Pinning his arms with my knees, I landed punch after punch, screaming “ARE YOU SCARED, MOTHER FUCKER?! ARE YOU SCARED OF THE DARK?” I punched until I couldn’t feel my knuckles, and then I punched some more. 


When I stood up, it looked like Kyle wouldn’t be conscious for a while. I searched his body and found the flashlight he had, then found the knife that was on the ground a few feet away. I made my way out of the forest as quickly as I could manage. The cut on my leg wasn’t too deep, but it was bleeding pretty profusely. 


Back at the cul-de-sac I saw where Kyle’s dilapidated truck was and immediately checked to see if Ava was in it. I looked all around the interior of the car but there were no indicators of where she could be.  I started scouring the area around the truck, checking every inch of ground with the flashlight, hoping to find something – anything. And that’s when I saw the light of the flashlight reflecting off the shiny wrapper of a piece of gum in the middle of the road. It looked just like the winter mint gum Ava always chewed. 

Maybe… just maybe… I thought as I ran up to the gum and started looking for another piece in the vicinity. About twenty feet down the road I noticed another shiny wrapper and ran to it. It was the same winter mint gum. I followed the trail down the road and into the mangrove forest, but after a bit of trudging through the forest I lost the trail. Either she ran out of pieces or the incoming tide washed them away. The water was now about two inches high, and the tide was rushing in fast. 

I screamed her name into the darkness, and thank God I got an answer. It was a strained hum from off in the distance. It was quiet, but undeniably a response. I moved towards the sound and the flashlight finally caught something. It was Ava, and she was lying face-down in the mud. 

I scrambled over to her, and as I got closer I saw her hands and feet were tied down tightly to mangrove roots. Her mouth was duct taped shut, and half of her face was submerged in the dirty water. She had her head twisted to the side as far as it could go, and her nose was just barely out of the water. A few minutes longer, and her head would have been completely underwater.
I cut her lose with the knife, and embraced her as the tears flooded out of our eyes.



This all happened about a year ago, but I haven’t even shared the most unsettling detail yet. You see, we called the police, and helped them search for Kyle's unconscious body once they arrived, but we never found it. He must have woken up and stumbled deep into the preserve. Multiple search teams never found him, and hell maybe he swam out into the ocean and drowned, or maybe he got away and is living on the streets somewhere. Anyways, Ava has since moved to Miami to get her masters, and I came with her. Turns out Dr. Higley had diagnosed Kyle with neuroticism, paranoid schizophrenia, and a laundry list of other problems. It feels good to be living across the state from where this all happened, but there's still a part of me that is scared of the dark. A part of me that snaps awake at the sound of footfall at night. A part of me that expects to roll over at night and see him standing there...because deep down I know he's still out there somewhere.

I was recently offered a PM internship at a great company for the upcoming summer, which I'm really excited about and plan on accepting before it expires this Thursday. 

However, last summer I interned at a local software company doing software development. The internship went well, and they invited me to continue my internship during the school year part time, which I accepted. 

The main problem is I am not really sure when/how I should tell my current employers that I will not be returning next summer. They have not mentioned next summer to me at all, but I assume they might want me to be back based on them extending my internship. I feel like I should tell them soon after accepting the other offer, in order to give them a fair shot to get another intern to replace me. 

Can anyone give me some advice on what to do? Thanks in advance.

I want to apply for an internship for the summer and am trying to figure out if I am going to be outclassed by others applying for the same positions as me. The college I attend has a small Computer Science department and the course load has overall been light, so it leaves me to worry that I may not be up to par with my peers. I have a 3.69 gpa and have a decent understanding of both c++ and java.

I understand inheritance/polymorphism, functions, file IO, classes among other basic topics, and understand/can use linked list/double linked list, hash tables, binary trees, stacks, ques, arrays, and vectors and a few sorting algorithms to go with it. 

How important are topics and knowledge from assembly language/operating systems? I took the classes and passed but a lot of the material from this went in one ear and out the other sadly.

Are there any key tools/information I should learn before attempting to get an internship and getting in an interview? Overall I'm trying to figure out if I have a little bit of impostor syndrome or if there are things that I actually need to know and have been missed in my education.

So I'm second year University student. I'm currently in applied physics program. Last year in spring I found myself somekind of intership that is relevant to my studies. It is in laser micromachining field. Although just before I found it I wanted to apply for intership in software engineering for summer but my knowledge of programming wasn't good enough. So instead of working some job like waiter or something like that, I took that Intership in laser micromachining. During summer I did some practical work like working with laser and optics elements. I kinda enjoyed that. From fall I continued being involved in this field. I got employed in physics and technology science center for 1/4 time for minimum wage. Since summer I wasn't doing any practical work, just learning, attending seminars for students that work there too and we are also doing book club on relevant subject. By the way I enjoy physics overall but don't get very good grades only because i don't get myself studying enough. I don't know if it is because I'm lazy or I don't like undergraduate physics as much. So If i stay there and work hard i could see myself having good career there but from time to time I get this feeling and a lot of thoughts that I don't enjoy this that much. I'm thinking that maybe I would like programming more. But I came so far there, got great opportunity, so it would be weird if i just dropped it and other people that supervise me wouldn't see it coming and it would be weird for them too. So I'm really stuck in my thoughts about what should I do. If I left this work if can call it this way, I would probably would like to get into programming, i have some basic knowledge of few languages and probably could get internship or work for summer. If I stay I will continue deepen my knowledge in laser micromachining and optics. But i don't know if I can see myself being like somekind of researcher in the long run. And I probably would think from time to time again that I don't think that I actually want to do it. 

Sorry for such long text and for not quite correct english grammar.

tl;dr - I'm involved in internship/work in physics/engineering branch and I don't think if I enjoy it. If I left it would be a big deal because nobody would have seen it coming and it is very good opportunity for me because not anybody could be in my place, so I got lucky. If I left I would probably ditch physics career but stay in university and go for programming.

I hate struggling with these thoughts and really would like to get sincere and comprehensive reply. Thanks!

5ffafu,3,2016-11-28,How much difference does your Adderall prescription make?,Helga_22,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5ffafu/how_much_difference_does_your_adderall/,"-First time joining a support group. Yay for positive action.

**TL;DR**   {Long story short. After some struggle I have begun to embrace my ADHD identity. I have a counsellor and I am now taking 20 mg of adderall. The difference isn't significant.  What experiences have you guys had with medication in college? How much difference does your Adderall prescription make?}

 **BACKGROUND:**  As a child my parents discovered my ADHD and tried pretty much every medication except Adderall. We moved and I no longer received medication. I made it through Jr. High and two years of high school with out medication. I became a fan of lists and an expert procrastinator. My Junior year I tried strattera, convinced that it caused the blues I stoped taking it. I made it through high school with difficulty but maintained a decent GPA and was very busy.

**CHALLENGE:**   Now I am a Sophomore in college and I’m hitting a wall. I want to earn a Biological Sciences degree and continue to what is next.

**COLLEGE:** Freshman year was rough but exciting. I passed enough classes to continue as a sophomore. Although my second semester GPA was low enough to knock me down to the warning status on scholarships.  
      I forgave myself and promised myself that the next year would be better, after having learned so much about myself and college. 
    That summer I entered my first real relationship and a successful busy internship. Then I jumped into my third semester of college retaking two of my failed classes. Now I’m a part of many academic groups, and have scholarships all depending on my GPA. Yet I can not crank out the work or focus needed to achieve that GPA.

**CONFLICT:**    I began to build immense pressure and anger with myself. I no longer laughed readily or freely shared my energy. I wanted to implode. I also hated myself for dragging my ever loving boyfriend through my constant, intense, and confusing breakdowns. I did not consider my ADHD legit and began to fear I did not want my ambitions bad enough, that I was a lazy and looking for excuses. Here I was with everything set up for me, yet I was making things harder for myself. 
    
**ACTION:**    I went to student health and counseling and after my Dad recommended that I seek medication for my ADHD (he also has ADHD). After about a month I had a prescription for Adderall.

**CURRENTLY:**    Now I am up to the 20 mg dose. When I take it sometimes I notice my heart goes faster and my need for food strikes harder. Sometimes it seems to help me level out and perk up in my environment, but I have not done better at staying on task or focusing in class. I have more support but I’m still failing to do what I sit down to do. I continue to throw time in the air that I can not afford to waste.
      Working with myself can be so frustrating, despite this I can see growth. I’m learning to embrace myself positively, and understand more about ADHD.

**QUESTIONS:** What experiences have you guys had with medication in college? 
  How much difference (if applicable) does your adderall prescription make?

A little background on me, I'm a graduate student pursuing a degree in Information Systems Technology. My undergraduate degree is not in CS or IST.

I am a incoming junior in a BS in CS program and a non traditional student (I'm 26). I also have a solid work history from the time I was 18 until 24(military).  My career before college had nothing to do with CS. I am dying to re-enter the workforce and finish out my degree at night and I feel like a coding bootcamp could land me that entry level developer job I dream about. I feel like there are many others in a similar situation to me that feel the same draw to bootcamps even though there is a light at the end of the CS degree tunnel.  To sum it up I was wondering if the classes/knowledge I already have under my belt (object oriented principles, data structures, sql/database design, all maths for BS in CS complete, algorithms, etc...) plus the more practical skills I would learn in a bootcamp could land me a job as a junior dev?  Or... am I just being an impatient idiot and I should just put my head down and finish out the 3 semesters of school do an internship etc?  

Thanks for any responses just searching for some guidance.

side note: The GI bill will pay for the coding bootcamp so funding is not an issue (Uncle Sam is the richest of rich Dads)
side note 2: I love the programming we CS majors learn in school, it is challenging and rewarding. The skills I have learned have been invaluable when learning new things on my own.

Also extortion, thuggery, goondaism, nepotism, corruption in the highest places",Randiathrowaway1,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fhhum/maruti_and_the_blatant_crony_capitalism_of_the/," all starts with Maa ka Ladla, Sanjay aka Sterilization king Gandhi returning back home from a 3 year internship stint at Rolls Royce in the UK. Even this must have been only because of Maa ka influence because, in keeping with family tradition he never completed college. In case you are wondering, Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv, Sonia all at some point in their life joined some college or uni, but never completed it. In Rajiv and Sanjay's case, they just sucked at studies. Indira, was supposedly a very good student, but ill health came in her way. Anyways, moving back to the topic, Sanjay bhaiya returns from the UK, all full of ideas for a People's Car!

Now, the small hitch is, Indira had pretty much nationalised everything, and the few private companies left, like Hindustan automobiles or Premier automobiles or even Bajaj of the Chetak fame had stringent licensing norms, and buying even a chetak meant at least a year in queue after paying the money...if you were lucky. No matter, what Ladla wants, he gets.

In 1971, with ZERO experience in this field, no degree, no nothing, the GoI awarded a contract to this unknown entity to produce 50k cars (when even as late as 1991, India had a total car sales of some 100,000, in the 70's, this was around 30k units per year). No tender, no competition...nothing! Cronyism max...and it is just the start.

The moment this was done, everybody had to fall head over heels to satisfy the Prince. So, the Congress CM of Haryana promptly offered all the land the Prince wanted. But it was in a sad place in Haryana...our Prince had his eyes set on prime farm land and land belonging to the ordinance factory....Land Acquisition bill you say? Naw, rules didn't apply to his empress son. Land was acquired at dirt cheap prices, the army made to give up its land and the factory was put up.

Now, they offered a prototype for testing...it failed all the tests, but no matter, safety mafety....the contract was upheld!

Bad? It gets worse.

Industrialists were literally extorted into buying shares of this company...if you didn't, you had family members thrown into jail till you paid up. Listing rules for the share market were outright broken to allow special provisions to this company. If you had applied to be a dealer, you were shit out of luck as you were threatened to buy shares (literally using goons and threat of violence) in the company...or else. Even if you were not applying to be a dealer, you were fucked. Some random guy, applying with the Harayana Govt to buy some land...was told that he had to buy shares in the company, or kiss his licenses good bye...he got the shares!

Businessmen who complained...including to the then Minister of state for finance, our Hon President Mr Mukherjee (who did nothing) were then arrested under various acts, including the infamous MISA. Yes, if you protested, you saw jail time bitch!

Cement, Iron and Steel procured to build the complex (strict quotas were in place for anybody without the Gandhi surname) were then promptly resold in the market for a profit, and more quotas kept getting alloted to this company.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Many share holders listed never existed, huge monies were laundered through this sham of a company, many of Sanjay Gandhi's official documentation and requests were never dated or signed. Minutes of shareholder meets either were manipulated or didn't exist at all....it boggles the mind what the Gandhi family could do and still can tbh in its solo, singleminded quest for power and money.

After the Janata Gov took power, they rightfully scrapped this company, established a commission, whose report you can read [here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/141617759/Report-of-A-C-Gupta-Commission-of-Inquiry-on-Maruti-Affairs-31-05-1979).

This is why when Rahul Gandhi or his supporters talk about crony capitalism, I launch a full blown belly laugh! Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv (our man was the lead negotiator for an aircraft fighter deal...talk about being brazen), Sonia (Augusta) are all the biggest crony capitalists of them all."

So I've been working at a big company on their projects team (focusing on CRM and Data warehousing) for one of their business domains for almost 3 years (I started my internship in 2nd year). I started out as an intern before receiving what was essentially a title change and took on more responsibility while in school for my undergraduate degree. I've led projects and also been mostly a generalist (integrations, ETLs, process design, business cases) I was salaried and got paid during my exam periods and my manager allowed me time off which offered a lot of flexibility. 

My pay annualized is something around 38k? 

I've done some research via glassdoor and the job title I received states that technology project analyst earn something in the range of 50-60k + cash bonuses. 

I know there is no set formula for calculating your worth but is a 58% increase a huge step change? I'm not too sure how to strategically plan going forward. As I'll be graduating this April, should I be doing interviews right now to gauge offers or should I have this discussion with my manager now (I'm on contract until then).

I realized that my resume wasn't very good part way through, because a high GPA and only 1 internship with research projects doesn't seem to trump personal projects. 

I ended up interviewing with some pretty good companies, and have a couple of offers (100k Bay Area). 

Now, I have already pushed back the deadlines for all these, because I have been waiting on this tech company in Seattle. Location was a big deal for me, and I wanted to see if they wanted me. I ended up getting ""rejected"" after a video interview, but then a few weeks later, received an email, telling me they wanted to fly me out for the on site. However, these are in January, and they are completely booked. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, except for hope that they manage to fit me in within the next two weeks (unlikely). I don't want to be that person that accepts an offer, then changes their mind, nor do I want to be the person that goes on site with no intention of accepting the job. 

I'm not sure what to do, because I really want to work in Seattle, and this is also a company I want to work for (no need to warn me about anything their work life balance, etc ). 

I want to accept the best offer I have, and then interview more in spring, hopefully with a handful of personal projects under my belt that expands my skillset.

However, the drive to work is about an hour or so, and I do that drive every other day. I honestly don't think the pay is really compensating for the drive (between the cost of gas and how long it takes, it REALLY cuts into my time, especially having to go to school and having a similar commute time). I did some quick math and pretty much found out that I'm making $50 a month with all my expenses included, and that's if I actually work all my shifts (job is VERY unconventional, so I often won't work if there's a few other coworkers there at the same time as as I don't have anything to do).

I'm fortunate to have found a part-time job in the IT field that can accommodate my schedule, but compared to working retail where I would work 20-30 hours a week, getting $10.30/hr, a much shorter drive, I'm making nothing. I know an internship is the primary focus for getting experience, but I'm not to worried about getting one. 

Should I stick it out because the job offers me permanent ""experience"" with pay (as opposed to a 12 week or so temp internship), or should I try to find work a little closer to home? I'm worried about being considered a ""job hopper"" as well since I've only been here for 4-5 months. Though I was at my first/previous job for 4 years.

I have been working full-time (as a commercial real-estate project manager) and going to school full-time for the last year or so.  Prior to that I have been working full-time and chipping away one class at a time on my prerequisites.  I will have completed all prerequisites and will transferring to a University to start the actual CS program this January.  Luckily, my wife and I have saved up enough money to allow me to quit my job and go to school full-time.

I have only recently started following this sub, but it looks like internships are pretty seasonal as most companies are expecting interns to be on a typical schedule of their school year starting in the fall.  My school year is essentially starting in January, but I still have a full ""two years"" (six quarters) worth of course work.  I expect to have summers off (and therefore time for an internship).  

My main questions are:

- Should I be qualified for an internship this coming summer? (After just two quarters of CS classes.)
- If so, when should I be applying for these internships?
- If I were to get an interview for these internships, would I need to be prepared for the data structures/algorithms type questions that seem to be common in actual job interviews?
- If I have to choose between working on personal projects and studying for coding interview questions should I choose studying for coding interviews?
- Will I have a chance at an internship at a Big 4 company with my weird school schedule?  Assuming I check all of the other boxes. (I am fortunate enough to live in the Seattle area and have some connections to a few of these companies)

The first job, the one that I already accepted, is an on-campus job working on event planning/execution and social media advertising for my school's live-on promotions team. As this is on campus, it means I wouldn't have to commute to and from the job. The job involves biweekly meetings and weekly-ish shifts running events (but that all depends week-by-week). The pay rate depends on the events we work; it's something like $50 per event we work, $75ish for larger events, and a $20 bonus if we're the head staff member on any given event.

The second job, the one that I haven't accepted yet but have received an offer for, is actually for a Public Relations internship that's closely related to my major. Offers about 15-20 hours during the spring semester, with either the same amount or possibly more during the summer (the first job is only for the spring semester). Pay rate ~~I'm not sure of, I'm assuming $10-$12 per hour~~ EDIT: just heard the pay rate for this job is actually $15/hr. The only major downside is that it's about an hour away from campus, which becomes a bigger problem during the winter if a snowstorm hits (I'm in Michigan, so those can be a wildcard). 

I'm torn as to which one I should go with, since while the second would be better for my career in the long run, it's a ways away from campus even though it pays slightly more. But, I've already accepted the first one but am concerned regarding its longevity (I'd still need to find another internship for the summer). What are your guys' thoughts?"

I was told to come here for suggestions as to what laptop I should buy.  I currently have a Macbook Pro and want to switch to Windows as more games can run on it, so I would like to buy a gaming laptop that is on sale for Cyber Monday for a reasonable price.

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
USA, preferably under $1000 USD

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life is a must.  Specifications don't have to be perfect, but just reasonable.  Absolutely no 2 in 1, it's too much of a hassle for me.

* **How important is weight to you?**
Pretty important, I would like something that is easily carryable in a backpack or gym bag.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows 10

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
13-15 inches

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
I am a video gamer and do some occasional movie/Netflix/TV show/anime watching.  I will also mostly likely need to do programming and media editing for future internships and jobs (RStudio, Eclipse, Photoshop, etc.).

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
I play 2 games mostly.  One of them is League of Legends, which is pretty well done; I can get 60 FPS at low settings on my Mac already.  The other is Blade &amp; Soul, which is infamous for horrible optimization and inability to run on multiple cores, so I need a laptop with a good CPU that has strong individual cores (because a quad core won't really help, at least not with the current client).  I get about 10-15 FPS in combat in lowest settings, 5 in very crowded zones (but this is probably attributed to the fact that I am playing on a Mac), and I would like to get about 60 on lowest settings.  I also may or may not play Overwatch in the future, and I heard that is very graphic-intensive as well.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Must have a good keyboard with capability of putting a keyboard cover.  Absolutely no touch screen.

I am pretty conflicted right now. I have 2 companies I can intern with currently. 

My head tells me to go with company 1, and my gut tells me to go with company 2. 

1 has a better hiring rate (80-90%), better starting pay, better full time pay, and is growing rapidly. My head says go with this one.

2 has a better culture (at least from what I can tell), but a worse hiring rate (55-60%), lower pay, but also more stability as a company. My gut says go here. 

Clearly, the first has a better short term outlook (more likely to hire full time, better pay, etc.), but the second one is better long term (company isn't going anywhere anytime soon, revenues don't spike or drop much year over year). 

I have two friends who i consider pretty similar to myself, one who's interned at each company. The person who went with company 1 seems pretty happy with it, and got taken on full time, though he didn't seem to be very fulfilled by the work.

The person who went with company 2 had fun and learned he hated the industry, but wasn't taken on full time and is lost in life now....

Any thoughts? I can answer more questions about these companies if needed. "
5fm1v2,1,2016-11-29,Dilemma on choosing between job offers,TeamMagmaGrunt,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5fm1v2/dilemma_on_choosing_between_job_offers/,"I've received two job offers, one of which I prematurely accepted before receiving the other job offer, and would like some advice on which one I should stick with.

The first job, the one that I already accepted, is an on-campus job working on event planning/execution and social media advertising for my school's live-on promotions team. As this is on campus, it means I wouldn't have to commute to and from the job. The job involves biweekly meetings and weekly-ish shifts running events (but that all depends week-by-week). The pay rate depends on the events we work; it's something like $50 per event we work, $75ish for larger events, and a $20 bonus if we're the head staff member on any given event.

The second job, the one that I haven't accepted yet but have received an offer for, is actually for a Public Relations internship that's closely related to my major. Offers about 15-20 hours during the spring semester, with either the same amount or possibly more during the summer (the first job is only for the spring semester). Pay rate  is actually $15/hr, so it's most likely more than I'd be making on campus. The only major downside is that it's about an hour away from campus, which becomes a bigger problem during the winter if a snowstorm hits (I'm in Michigan, so those can be a wildcard).

I'm torn as to which one I should go with, since while the second would be better for my career in the long run, it's a ways away from campus even though it pays slightly more. But, I've already accepted the first one but am concerned regarding its longevity (I'd still need to find another internship for the summer). What are your guys' thoughts?"

We've got that research project where we have a subject, and have to find research papers talking about it, and write a paper ourselves, using these resources.
It's kind of the shit project of the year, no one wants to do it, but we have to validate it. I got a crappy group, right off the bat, and got a subject I didn't want to, because I let someone in the group convince me.

Now the deadline is tomorrow, I'm the one managing the group, and I've already done so much work, I've finished my part and even more, I've told people what they had to do in a really simple way, but this bitch just won't do her part.
Everytime we have to meet up with our tutor, once every two weeks, she makes up excuses to not go, because she still doesn't understand the project, doesn't want to work, and she's afraid to face the consequences.

Earlier today I told her ""Hey, you know the deadline is tomorrow right ? We're still waiting on your part"". She dropped me a ""I don't give a fuck"", and simply walked away. I didn't even answer, I wasn't expecting this answer at all.
So, you're gonna join a group, influence its members to choose a subject you like, you end up not liking it, and you're gonna dodge work, and try to not do anything for months ?

That's why I hate group projects. Anyone can just be like ""I don't wanna work, if you guys want a good grade, you'll have to do my part."", and they use that ""grade"" and deadline pressure to get you to do the work in the end.

This project is fucking aweful, I know it. It's fucking annoying to look for specific research papers on really accurate subjects, and try to make something of it. I know we all have so many projects to do, and an internship to find. But FFS, you are not special. Everybody is in the same position, we're all in way over our heads, but we need to make time for the work, and get it done. How are you ""special"" ? What's your excuse for not having to do your share of the job, when the task is really simple, because I've been fucking bushwhacking the subject to make it clearer, and made the plan, introduction, conclusions, and some other parts.

I fucking hate this. I wish you could just tell teachers : this guy did nothing, he shouldn't get a mark at all.

Do people think they will get away with it for their whole life ? Today it's school, but tomorrow it will be work, and if you want to be successful, and keep your fucking job, you'll have to work, and stop fucking hiding, lying to people around you, and lying to yourself.

I seriously just want to slap some sense into these people.

Boss told me I would work in devops team. Currently I own Lenovo x1 carbon 1st gen with Windows 10, but it kind of lacks of RAM and storage (8gb RAM and 256gb SSD) - when I run one virtual machine + 2-3 chrome windows with ~30 tabs/window and some other apps it become really laggy and sometimes almost impossible to use. Apart from regular work I'm also developing a side machine learning project at a faculty lab, which require quite a bit of computing power (but for serious computing I use ""server farm"" at faculty).


I want:

- light laptop

- as much battery life as possible

- 13-14'' non-touch screen

- don't care about OS (probably prefer OS X as I'm already using iPhone and am really keen on integration)

- at least 16gb of RAM

- at least 512gb SSD

- price range ~2200$ (~2000€ in Slovenia/Europe)


I already checked a lot of reviews and quite a lot of reddit too regarding the models in the title.
I'm concerned that MBPr 13 2015 would get out-of-date too soon as it's already 1,5 years old. Macbook Pros 2016 are too pricey.
On the other hand any Lenovo can't deliver as much battery life as Mac. When it comes to Lenovo x1 carbon 4th gen I'm concerned about build quality - I read some reviews about cheap plastic used in the new models and keys falling off.

I'm also open to any other suggestions.

**EDIT: filling a form**

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
2000€, Slovenia/Europe

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life.

* **How important is weight to you?**
I would prefer it to be light, as I will be bringing it around to classes, work, home and student room.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Probably Mac as I would love to try integration with iPhone, but Windows or Linux are also fine.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
13 or 14 inch.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
IntelliJ, PyCharm, Virtualbox/VMWare, Sublime, MS Office and Matlab.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
No games.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I don't want touch screen, would love good keyboard and good touchpad. I also want good build quality. Fingerprint is a plus, but not a deal breaker. Don't need optical drive.

Possible career pathways?,throwaway20161993,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fnkpg/masters_in_high_performance_computing_hpc/,"Hi I would appreciate anyone that is knowledgeable in HPC to please chime in!

I live in southern Europe. I have a B.Sc. in Physics, and I'm about to start a ""master"" in High Performance Computing. I write ""master"" between quotes because that's how they call it, but it's not an actual Master's Degree (M.Sc.); it's rather a more practical course focusing on practical skills. It's also shorter than a M.Sc. (but not by much, it's 9 months courses + 6 to 9 for the thesis project). I'm worried that not doing a real M.Sc. will hinder my chances of finding a good job and making a decent career.

I'm also wondering what professional figures exist in the world of HPC, both in industry and in academia, and what title they have/need: what I've seen up to now is that they are mostly divided between engineers (who set up and manage machines) and scientists (who know how and for what applications to use them), but both these positions require at least a Master's degree, if not a PhD. I'd love to do scientific computing, because I love programming and I love science... but will I be able to do it with my curriculum? If not in academia, is there enough request in industry for non-M.Sc.s with practical experience? And will I have a decent career path or will I be stuck in junior positions for life because of my lack of titles?

Some notes in random order: * I'd rather not become a sysadmin: first because I don't have the right education for it, and second because I don't think I'd like it. If I had to choose, I'd say ""scientific software developer"" would be my ideal job. * I considered some M.Sc. programmes in Germany and Spain, and they're cool, but I'm too late to apply for this winter semester, so I'd have to wait at least 6 months to see IF they admit me, and meanwhile I would lose my place in this ""master"". * I already had some experience with HPC during my Bachelor's thesis and with a 2-months internship at a research center; that's what made me like the field. The ""master"" will also involve a lot of hands-on work, and also a project thesis as I said, so I will have some experience under my belt after it.

I'm trying to decide what I want to do, but I'm a bit lost, so I'd like to know what my possibilities will be if I pursue this route vs. a real Master's Degree.

Thanks in advance for any suggestion.

To put it simply, I like to think the primary focus of my life is actually STEM. I love everything about computer science/programming/engineering/math, and I consider it my life purpose to make amazing things. Luckily I've gotten to pursue that dream by attending Cornell and majoring in Computer Science (and hopefully also pursuing Electrical Computer Engineering), and to be honest that's all I really want. I joined an insanely amazing autonomous robotics systems project team and it's just been a dream for me, up until now.

I've felt myself very, very gradually but consistently feel lower and lower over the course of this semester (I'm a sophomore btw). At the beginning of the semester I was overwhelmed with the prospects of my really interesting classes, project team, research team, and the actual real potential for a relationship with a girl I met last semester (very much a first experience for me). Regardless, the one thing that seemed to pull me down at first was how quickly everybody around me began to engage in their great search and application for impressive summer internships. I told myself that I really wanted one, and I feel extremely qualified for one (even though I'm just a sophomore I have a lot of background in CS/ECE), for some reason the thought of having to put my credentials on paper and apply to something just absolutely terrifies me to no end. It's crippling. Two years prior when applying to colleges, I woke up every day for 1.5 months or so with crippling stress/anxiety during that October/November window most people apply to most universities in, and I could not even get myself to begin the application process. I was so freaked out, believing I was a failure for not amounting to what I thought I should be at that point and was entirely overwhelmed and intimidated hearing how everyone else's progress was. Thankfully I got to a place I love, but even after the deadlines had passed I was thrown into what my parents kept insisting was depression for a few months afterwards. I guess I've felt much of that feeling this semester, which was only amplified by the rest of my responsibilities.

Anyway, it's near the end of the semester, and things have begun to take a bit more of a darker turn than I could have anticipated. I've failed to make any progress whatsoever on my internship search, failing to even put together a resume that showcases my accomplishments and skills I know I have. I slowly participated less and less in my required writing class, being unable to turn in papers, then feeling so guilty for being so stupid that I couldn't bear the thought of waking up in the morning and looking my professor in the face while everybody else had actually done the work. I talked to that professor multiple times begging for extra time and trying to help him understand, but each precious opportunity he gave me to try to receive some credit for my nonexistent work, I blew. I've had to withdraw from the class, leaving a permanent mark on my transcript (and the second one of this sort too...).

I dropped a physics class as well, and although I was performing stunningly well in my other three classes, I've since regressed to a point where I've begin miserably failing those as well. I have officially reached the point where I have so much shame, guilt, anxiety, and overwhelming dread about how I let everything collapse for seemingly no reason that I can no longer get out of bed / my dorm at all. I have not been able to leave my dorm more than a few times total within the last month, and have not gone to class once within this period. I have become practically nocturnal as a result of not being able to bear the thought of waking up at a normal time and actually going at my day, and have been averaging eating only 1-2 meals a day. Last week I actually did leave and met with professors and my adviser and tried to explain everything, explaining that I was in no way prepared to take their upcoming exams and had no idea what to do. To my surprise, my professors were extremely willing to work with me, but time is running out very quickly for me. I've also been almost entirely ignored everybody that I talk to up here, including everyone in my classes, project teams, group project / lab partners, and that girl I felt pretty connected with from before, and it hurts so badly just to think about how horrible I have to be to pull that off.

I have two options: if it comes down to it, I can decide to take a medical leave from Cornell in which my entire transcript from this semester is wiped (and most other penalties are gone), but I would be forced to wait until next fall to return. To me, the idea of doing this is absolutely devastating as the only thing I really want in life right now is to stay here and continue studying what I love, and leaving seems to me like throwing away a year of my life and completely severing all of the extremely meaningful connections I've made here. I would have to decide this within the next two days, however. The other option is to try to make up all of the work I've not done over the last month of so and be prepared to take my finals, but each passing day of my inaction makes that seem less and less viable. All I feel like I can do right now is continuing cowering in my room, laying in my bed and trying to imagine this reality does not exist.

My largest concern of all to me, no matter how /r/iamverysmart it sounds is what I fear the most is losing my capacity to do what I love. I have real fear that my sedentary, malnourished lifestyle recently has physically and permanently damaged tissue in my brain and that I'll never be able to think as creatively and well as I did before, and that terrifies me to no end.

Thanks so much for listening, and if you think there'd be some other/better places to post this, please let me know.

While I appreciate and love them for that, there should have been a limit to their overptotectiveness. I understand that they just wanted what's best for me, and that they must have been traumatized because my eldest sister died back then from health issues. I get it. But they raised me to be very dependent on them. I remember my mother wouldn't even let me hold a knife and cook for myself. Nor would she let me go outside on my own. I thought nothing of it when I was younger, but I'm now 24 and she still treats me like I am 4.

It's starting to affect me. I've become very dependent on them. I'm scared to go outside of my own, talking to people on the phone scares me. I get easily nervous. I can't drive and take myself to places I need to go because, like I said, going outside makes me nervous. It's just so hard, I feel helpless and I couldn't do anything on my own. What's worst is that my parents are disappointed in me for not being more independent now that I am older. I know they think I'm worthless. I can read between the lines. 

I started working at our family's company as a secretary and I just sat there at a table like an idiot. My mother expects me to already know what to do in the office even if I have absolutely zero experience. I asked her to train me but she doesn't. She expects me to go around asking people what I should do. I felt like an idiot just sitting there. Even now, she just gives me small tasks even a small child with basic computer knowledge could do. It's a part time job, I get it, but even the unpaid interns were given more work than me. I felt ashamed because there were people YOUNGER than me in that office who do more important work than what I do and I still get paid for it. They think I'm worthless. i am convinced I am worthless. i can't do anything right. I'm too dependent on them and it scares me. They can't live forever, my dad's 74 already damnit. It scares me that they'll leave me and I'll be nothing. This has been bothering me for a while now and I keep wishing I could just wake up dead. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but I am sure I will never actually do anything to hurt myself. But these thoughts just won't go away... If I tell my parents I am depressed, they'll just dismiss it as a tantrum. I cried in front of them back then, and told them about everything I felt like how helpless I am and how they keep treating me like a child. They played victim and said 'you can't get mad at us, we're old already!'. I don't know anymore.

I know there are people suffering more than me, but I just don't know where to go to at this point. No one could understand me. I am still very scared for my future and I always wish I could die before my parents. "

as the title says, I recently finished my bachelors degree in Computer Science at the age of 19. It worked, because I was studying from home while still in school. I finished with a 2.0 grade, but got a 1.0 in my bachelor thesis about Software-Development. I'm from Germany btw.

Now I'm not quite sure what to do next and would love to hear your advice!
I think I should definitly persue a masters degree at some time, even if it's only to get a glimpse at real student life ;), but I want to wait atleast another year before I do that, to have some time to travel and gain some work expierence.  

* Do you think it's worth/possible to get a full scholarship at the elite universitys like MIT with my qualification? 

In the meantime (next year), I want to make some money to be able to afford travelling.

* Will I be able to get a good paying job for 6-12 months with almost no expierence other than my bachelor thesis? Or can I only hope for paid internships?

* Or maybe do you think it would be better to stay home anyway and collaborate in open source projects and do some freelancing?

I can live with my parents for the next year if I want, but apart from that they can't really help me much financally. If you have any questions feel free to ask! Thank you in advance

Edit: Grade Scale: 4.0 is worst possible, 1.0 is best"
5fqjh8,2,2016-11-30,Negotiating a pay raise closer to the local average salary,SuperSpaceNova,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fqjh8/negotiating_a_pay_raise_closer_to_the_local/,"As a little background, I began at this small company (~30 people) in my senior year of High School. I started at $10/hour as an intern, and negotiated a raise to $15/hour, then to $20/hour as an intern. This came with the ability to do my software development remotely from school, which was too far away to be physically present. There are 2 developers, myself and a senior member, and we work on separate projects, rarely directly collaborating on a project. We will however often discuss how to tackle certain problems, I'll ask his advice, and we are a team, but just working on different things.

In July, I was offered a more permanent position as a Junior Software Developer which I gladly accepted. This didn't come with a pay raise, and if I should have expected one, then that's another matter entirely. I'm not sure if I missed an opportunity or if it was wise to accept what they were offering and continue chugging along.

Using Glassdoor.com and salary.com, for my skills (2 years of full software development in the company, and a sophomore in college working towards a Computer Science major with a minor in Math), I should be compensated about $30/hour without a degree, and with my Bachelor's degree about $35/hour, so I understand my expectations aren't some six figure Google salary, which I'm fine with. 

I enjoy working at the company as I get along with everyone, can work remotely, and its only one town over from where I live, so a 15 minute drive. They also work with me and allow me to attend my local college and work around that schedule, where I put in 15-20 hours a week. I then work full time summers and vacations.

Recently, I was working on a project that took about 3 months to complete, and when reviewing the final product, the CEO decided to change a fundamental requirement, meaning we have to rewrite the software, missing our soft launch date, and taking another 2-3 months for another production-ready release. Both my manager and I are annoyed, but apparently that's the business world. To be clear, I was congratulated on my work, as I was not at fault for this change, rather, the business requirements changed.

Admittedly, I had a feeling of defeat, since now I have to rip apart my work and redesign the entire thing, since the current design does not allow us to solve the new requirement change. But this got me thinking that I should research what I should be compensated for.

I would like to negotiate to a $30/hour rate, but given my circumstances, should I wait for this project to be completed, or should I ask now? I don't know the inner workings of the business world, so does this time make a salary adjustment more or less likely?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

5fr1qs,1,2016-11-30,How do I best rebuild our lives?,DecadesofSun,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5fr1qs/how_do_i_best_rebuild_our_lives/,"Okay, so this is going to be a long-winded post. First time posting here also, so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong as far as reddit is concerned and I'll change it. There's two different stories going on here, so be warned. Anyway, here goes.

I'm a 22-year-old male with gender identity issues, a vocational degree in a field I'm not currently working in, and I have an internship with a branch of AmeriCorps working in one of the U.S.'s greatest national parks as an environmental conservationist. This is my second time working for AmeriCorps after I served in another park four years ago at 18, and between the two I'm due to have a year and a half's worth of time in AC, with a maximum of two years' time being allowed (AmeriCorps guidelines) across different agencies.

I joined AC with a group known as the MCC right out of high school and before this it was the highlight of my life. I was in a place where I could be more open about my personal issues than I had been in the past, and I enjoyed the work enough to want to continue it in the future but after the season ended, decided to try some other stuff before going back. Two weeks later, my father died right after I moved across the country, and that ruined things for the next three years. Eventually, I decided to go back to school and, rather than getting myself locked in debt like the rest of my family, earned my vocational degree for a much lower cost with the hope of going into the trades. I did well in school, but afterward the market for my craft fell through and I rejoined AC, this time with a group known as the SCA. It was a major step up for me, even if it wasn't in the field I had studied for, and again I moved halfway across the country to pursue better options.

At the same time all this is going on, my mother remarried her high school sweetheart less than a year before my father died (they had divorced and Dad was out of her life at that point). Soon afterward, she ended up having to move her own father, who is in his late eighties and riddled with Alzheimers, dementia, etc., closer to where they were living in order to help take care of him. He was in a senior home for a little while, but that soon proved to be too expensive and they eventually began looking for a place where they could live with him and she would be his caregiver. Mom and my stepdad found a house on the west coast that was perfect for all three of them, and so she quit her short-lived career as a teacher to focus on Grandpa's care.

Meanwhile in trade school, my identity problems began flaring up worse than ever and it nearly ruined my chances of getting into the industry. When I was re-accepted into AmeriCorps with the SCA instead, I was overjoyed. It meant I could be more free to be myself. Not only that, but I was offered another position in a third partner with AmeriCorps, call it the WCC, and between the three groups (MCC&gt;SCA&gt;WCC) I was set to complete my full two years' worth of AmeriCorps as noted, across three different national parks. It was the best news I've received in years.

Then it happened. Halfway through the SCA internship, my stepfather was killed, leaving Mom taking care of her father by herself with me gone and the rest of our family spread out in other areas of the country. It was like losing my biological father all over again. I had to leave the internship for a month to help take care of Mom and Grandpa, and when I finally returned to work I did so knowing Mom would be alone until I got back. At that point it didn't matter what my own hopes were, all that mattered (and still matters now) is that I'm there for her as best as I can be. We're honestly just waiting for her father to pass on so she can be free to rebuild her life. I know that sounds cruel, but it's the truth. In addition to that, my accepted position with the WCC is now on the line and my future in conservation is limited because I only have a vocational degree, not a bachelors' degree. 

Basically at this point I have two options. My internship with SCA is set to end in the spring, and Mom and I have both agreed for me to move back closer to her when it ends to help her out until Grandpa is gone. I can either honor my obligation to the WCC at that point and serve six months' more in AmeriCorps, thus completing my full two years and earning the full education awards they provide, which I need to pay off my vocational degree. It would mean, however, that I'm away from Mom for six months' longer right when she needs me the most, and none of our other family are available to help. The only benefit for her would be that I'd be much closer to home and could see her more often, and it would allow me in-state residency to go back to complete my bachelors' at my dream school.

Option two: I complete the SCA but forego WCC, thus bringing my AC time to a year and a half. I wouldn't have the education award I'm after from the WCC, but I would be able to not only deal with my identity issues that much sooner instead of putting my own needs off for the sake of the job, but also be there for Mom more readily. Not only that, but I'd be able to go back to school elsewhere at 23 instead of waiting until I'm 24, which was the plan I was on until my stepdad died. It's not the best option, but it would allow me to pursue goals outside of conservation a little bit quicker. I'd just have to find a job closer to home (not likely part of AmeriCorps, I'm afraid) and I'd be able to go back to college while helping Mom at the same time.

I'm honestly torn and I really shouldn't be. I keep telling myself that family comes first and that being there for her and Grandpa should be more important than anything I want, and that includes my own identity issues and the possibility of transitioning before he passes. She definitely needs someone else in her life to help out, and with my stepdad gone I'm the only one who can really do it. But if I don't do this final stretch next year with AC, I'll lose not only the opportunity to serve in my favorite park, the one I fell in love with years ago, but also the opportunity to enroll in my dream school and pursue a transition there. I'd be less than a state away from Mom, so I'd be there for her a lot more than I am now, but that's still more time where we're both on our own without help from one another. I feel trapped either way, and she's even more so. I have to get back in school wherever I end up- the voc. degree has proven to be near useless and I can't continue in conservation past AmeriCorps without additional education first. I'm hoping to leave conservation after either SCA or WCC for awhile anyway, but I still hope to go out on a high note and see this through till the end.

**TL;DR: Dad and stepdad are dead, both right after I moved halfway across the country. Mom is stuck taking care of Grandpa alone, my first degree is useless, I need to go back to school soon but also kind of need to complete the internships I have scheduled first before I can do that, or even hope to transition because loltrans. Mom's life is in shambles, I don't know what to do.**

I know this is a lot, but if there's anyone out there who has struggled with similar issues, even just one of these problems, and has a way around any of it I would love to hear your input. Thanks for reading this far."

5frk3h,3,2016-11-30,Is this normal?,suchsweetsorrow,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/5frk3h/is_this_normal/,"I just got fired from an internship in the publishing industry. I was fired, with no explanation other than that I had made a series of small mistakes. They sent an email, and did not ask to see me in person. 

My father passed away earlier in the semester and I was almost fired then because of how distracted I felt. I took a break, came back, and asked them to let me know if I continued to be distracted. I was given no warning the second time, which was about 2 months after his death. 

I'm also worried because I feel as though they are going to talk about me. They would say ""Fucking Alice (their last intern, not her real name) was a fucking terrible intern,"" and ""Fucking Alice was useless."" In front of me and the other intern. When I told my boss that my father passed, she immediately told the other intern and the accountant without my permission. Similarly, one of the interns didn't come to work after Trump's election because her family is undocumented. She sent this information in an email to my boss, who immediately told me. I don't think I have a right to this information. 

I know I did make mistakes, and I know they behaved rudely towards me. But is rudeness the norm in the face of mistakes? A few people have been telling me, this is what the industry is like. I just want to know: do I have a right to be outraged, or should I be steeling myself for future internships or jobs like this? Is this similar to anyone else's experience, particularly in the publishing industry?"

There’s really no nice way to put it.  I graduated with a B.A. in English Lit, but since I commuted and worked all through school, I hadn’t had the time to make any kind of professional connections or take an internship or anything like that.  To make matters worse, I graduated at the height of the recession.  There were absolutely no jobs related to my degree in the area, and there still aren’t.  As a result, I tried to take advantage of my long time hobby, computers.  

I was able to get a very low paying entry level IT position that expected me to know every aspect of IT as well as programming and operate on a nonexistent budget.  Worse yet, the commute to the job added over three additional hours to my already extended workday and cost a fortune in gas.  It also taught me exactly how much I hate being stuck behind a desk.  So, I left believing that there would certainly be better opportunities.  

I spent all of my time applying to jobs and trying to teach myself whatever in-demand skills I could.  That wasn’t enough.  I couldn’t find any full time work, especially not in my area.  At that point, I turned my attention towards remote and freelance work.

That’s what I’ve been doing since, rather unsuccessfully.  I’ve been able to squeak out a meager income from a combination writing for content mills and low paying websites and making the occasional WordPress website.  It’s been about the equivalent of working part time at a minimum wage job.  Over the course of that time my car’s lease ended, and I couldn’t afford a new one, so I have no car.  I’ve been looking for any kind of work that I can get, but can’t find anything nearby, and neither freelance business has taken off.  To put it mildly, I’m stuck.

Now, I’m in my late 20’s and my career is a total non-starter.  I love writing, and I wish that I could do that and make a decent living, but I can’t seem to figure out how.  I like technology and programming.  I’m actually really good with Linux servers, and I know several programming languages and web technologies at a beginner to mid level.  I wouldn’t mind doing that either, but I don’t have any qualifications.  I don’t know which to invest the most effort in or if investing any more effort is even worth it.  I need to work freelance or remote at first at this point.  I can’t get another car, and there is no work other than garbage level retail positions anywhere around me.  I don’t mind working hard.  I’ve been doing that all along, but my efforts have been mostly wasted.  I just need someone to point me in the right direction and say, “Do these things and you will succeed.”  Does anyone have any advice or insights into how I can get out of this massive rut?"

I am a undergraduate student in my sophomore year here studying Government, B.A. and Urban Studies, B.A. I've been looking into both programs and I can't seem to tell any difference in terms of outcome. 

It appears you both get the same certificate, but I can't exactly tell what's separating the two in terms of outcome. One thing I noticed is that the course work for UTeach Urban Teachers is only 18 hours, while UTeach Liberal Arts would've been about 42 hours for me (since you have to take all the required coursework within your major, such as all the history, geography, etc., that I wouldn't be required to take otherwise). 

For anyone participating in the UTeach Liberal Arts program, are they pretty strict about the requirements within your major (like the coursework that isn't directly related to education, such as specific history courses and specific geography courses, etc)? Because that is my main problem with the program compared to UTeach Urban Studies, because it looks like UTeach Urban Teachers doesn't require all that, so I would graduate quicker.

I also noticed that UTeach Urban Teachers sets you up with a paid internship during the summer in Austin, but UTeach Liberal Arts doesn't seem to do anything like that.

**Overall, it looks like UTeach Urban Teachers is more on-the-field based certificate while UTeach Liberal Arts is more learning by professors? Is this right or no?**
