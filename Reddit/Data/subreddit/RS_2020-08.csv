That's around 6 years of formal education, I received. Currently, I am working as a software development engineer in a famous company.  I have been in this role for 3 years now. It's not FAANG but it's equally reputable. I make around 180k a year in a medium COL area.

Now, I feel like all throughout the 6 years in college. I was pretty directionless. I did not focus on my academics much. I wanted to graduate as soon as I can, so I could start earning money. The master's degree was purely for H1b. I never thought of it as anything else. I never bothered to learn the theoretical stuff, like proving the time complexities of algorithms or how pumping lemma can be used to prove a language is regular or how LALR parsers work or how distance vector routing works or any of that stuff. This is making me feel very depressed. I feel like I wasted an opportunity. I know plenty of enterprising kids who worked with their professors in summer to get a paper published and managed to gain some really good exposure in college itself. I did an internship and all, but I feel like I lack the technical depth that some of my peers possess. The other day, we were talking about CMake and my peer was explaining how LLVM works and some of the optimizations it does and how using Clang instead of GCC could be beneficial. Honestly, it made me feel like such an idiot. I asked him how he knows about this stuff and he said that he worked on a master's thesis with his compiler professor and he basically studied LLVM extensively during the thesis.

Another guy I know, who worked really hard during my masters stayed back for a Ph.D. and is now working for the same company that I work for and he is now working as a research scientist in my company's AI lab. I went through his Git profile and he was implementing a Page rank algorithm using Spark. Then he built a really intricate document classification, entity extraction pipeline where he was collecting data using crowdsourcing or something.

The bottom line is, that I feel incredibly jealous of my peers. I want to be working on cool academic projects like them. I wasted my time in college and I never utilized college to the fullest extent possible. I have a horrible GPA in both my bachelor's and master's. I am earning a lot of money(by third world country standard at least) but I am really not happy. What can I do to get my career back on track? How do I get a job where I build some really bleeding edge applications or research-heavy projects or more academic-oriented projects."

We met in Sendai City originally, and eight months down the line we both had plans to move. She was to quit her job and move with her family to study nursing, and I was to move to Kyushu to connect with my old martial arts club down there, something I've always wanted to do since I came to Japan.

Once we started dating things were going well, really well, so we discussed things and I decided to delay my plans to move to Kyushu and support her through her three years of nursing school. She is in her second year of nursing school and until now she was happy to move with me once she graduated. 

Then covid hit and she couldn't do any work experience or internships as potentially moving across the country she could bring the virus to the hospital in transit. She said yesterday it would be easier to find work here because she can at least get input from her teachers on schools, whereas in Kyushu all she has is websites and pamphlets and she doesn't think she could find a job, and wouldn't know much about the hospitals she applies to.

I thought moving to Kyushu would allow her to do the job she wants, allow me to do what I want, and we could be together. Now she asks to spend her first three years working here and move after that (quitting before three years is looked down upon here) but I'm not convinced she would move at that point.

I'm torn between just moving myself and being long distance until she feels ready to be with me or break up of long distance doesn't work, breaking up now because now our goals aren't aligned, or waiting and hoping she will keep her promise to move with me.

I love this girl and had planned to propose on our three year anniversary but now I have no idea what to do and hoped the kind people of reddit who have experienced long distance and couples working in different cities could give me their experience.

TLDR I want to move cities when gf finishes school. Gf now doesn't. Do we break up or try long distance?"

My goal is to land a Tesla Internship in Palo Alto. Only problem is, most of these internships require you to have experience with at least ONE programming language.

1)Do employers care where you get your experience from? An online course? Coding camp? Books?

2)If I am driven to learn as fast as I can, what would be the best option for me? I guess I’d want something that employers would respect but that I can finish at a fast pace. 

3)Is there a certain language you’d recommend? Just by ooking at the internships, a lot of them state Python. Would you recommend something else?

I am a mechanical engineering student who is quite interested in computer science. I have an ongoing internship as well in CS. 

Placements for jobs have started in my college, and I never considered placements until recently. I have wasted the past few months, I only worked on the internship but didn't do any placement preparations. Seeing how everyone else is working hard to prepare for placements, I feel left behind, and there is some pressure on me. I had always planned to go for higher studies, but with corona and my grades being just above average, I know I won't get selected if I applied anywhere. I was always considering internships to pass off time, gain experience, and then apply for higher studies. But, looking at others, I have realized I need to have some job as a backup, at least. 

All my college life, I have been taking things easy. Thinking that I would slog off when the time came, but even now, I feel less motivation to get any job at all. First of all, I know I am not prepared enough to get one, and I still don't feel like putting in the effort to prepare for one. 

My productivity over the past few days has increased a bit, but right now, I am just confused on how I should proceed with things. I am only sure of one thing as of now, that is to continue working on the internship. I have the mentality that it is essential to take breaks after you work a little, but those breaks have become frequent, and I find it hard to go back to what I was doing. I have become used to sitting at home since college will be conducted online because of COVID. All these have been a significant factor as to why I am not concerned with life outside right now, but just spending time here watching anime and gaming along with whatever intern work I do. 

I know I have written a lot, at this point I don't even know what I need advice for. But if you're reading this, thanks a lot. Please do tell me if you have any suggestions on how someone like me can come out of my lazy bubble and take a look at reality."

For some background: Currently 24 y/o in the US, fresh out of getting my bachelors in electrical engineering &amp; Associates in general science studies. I have 5 years of previous industry experience under my belt through 2 internships I've had. Just finished my last internship in March (Just before graduating due to COVID-19). I took a little time off for myself and a few weeks ago started up my job search. I had a fantastic company reach out to me and do a phone interview that went great, in which they basically gave me an informal job offer for a controls engineer position of $32/hr with a full write up of their benefits package. I have an in-person tour of their office and facilities this week, in which I am strongly expecting the offer to be made formally. 

My questions are:

* How do I go about politely making a counter-offer? Fresh out of college, is that something they are expecting me to do?
* Is 9% additional pay ($35/hr) a reasonable amount to go with? 
* The job is quite far from me, approx. 55 mins each way. Is this something I should bring up in my counter?

i1tnmh,73,2020-08-01,To everyone who are looking for colleges [Engineering],Sarveshns,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/i1tnmh/to_everyone_who_are_looking_for_colleges/,"I see like 2-3 posts here every week asking about VIT, Manipal etc. etc. So I am making a post which will try to give at least some advice about choosing colleges. I went through this process last year,granted things were normal back then. In any case, hopefully this will help. **Anything written here is strictly personal opinion, not to be taken as a guideline. Please don't downvote or bash me for saying x type college is better than y type college. That's my opinion, through my perspective.**

Now I will divide the students into 3 categories

1. **Decided on a branch, got their stuff figured out**

In this scenario, look at any college through the branch perspective, sift through the placement data and see the scenario in your preferred branch. Many colleges often post big numbers as average/median package and highest package. More often that not, those number are skewed by the high CSE packages.

Look at the professors, look at the projects or research they're involved in, look at the projects and the internships that students carry out (And proper industry internships, not those programs that you pay for). Look at the syllabus.

One important thing I'd say for core branches that is don't ignore the state level colleges and put them off as small or shit tier 3. Many state colleges are actually very good when it comes to core, and it will be even better if the college is situated in a place having lots of industries

2. **Indecisive about branch, but want to do Engineering**

In this case, I'd suggest CSE, and then preference to other branches, for obvious reasons, I would say prioritize CSE because even in a college of lower stature, you can still get a fat package. Here I'm assuming you'll stay in Engg. and not do UPSC , IIM etc.

3. **Doing Engineering because of Pressure or other misc. external reasons, or indecisiveness**

Firstly I'd urge you to still find out something you like and can pursue. On social media many people talk about Engineering like it's very easy, and make jokes. Well if you want to do it properly, it's not that easy (not that it is very difficult either). But if you are still going for Engineering, I'd say prioritize institute over branch. You may find something  non-engineering related that you want to pursue, and a more reputed institute will **generally** give you a better platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Now **how to choose between colleges of equal stature? (like VIT vs. Manipal)**

Now here my personal opinion is that it doesn't matter that much where you go. To make a clear choice, I would say compare between general culture, fees, location (Closer or further from home), academic flexibility, placement trends, etc.

I will edit this post if I think of anything more.

EDIT : At the end of the day you have to make the final decision, and you have to go to the college. Always keep this in mind."

i1uprr,522,2020-08-01,"I Was Dropped in a Lead Developer Role After College and I Need Advice, Desperately",NoFunConner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i1uprr/i_was_dropped_in_a_lead_developer_role_after/,"Hi all, I'd like to start by thanking anyone who reads this and has advice. I know this is a long post, but at this point I'm burning the candle in an oven without any hope for a stop. Whatever advise you give would mean a ton to me.

tl;dr; I got dropped in a lead developer job I am unqualified for, there is no money to get another team member that can mentor me, and I have a terrible case of imposter syndrome.

First, I'd like to start off by explaining my current situation. I graduated college three months ago, I started working where I do currently over three years ago as an intern, though. After a year, a combination of my ambition and resource shortage at the company got me stuck as the only developer on a product. The original team all left over a short time period. 

I had not worked with this team, and their code was awful, even as a sophomore I could tell that. One file, a single class, had 13K lines of code in it. They were not respecting any sort of character limit on line length either. The file is half a megabyte in size. True story. Almost every feature they advertised had some sort of bug, and I spent countless hours fixing and rewriting the thing. My grades suffered, I was more stressed than I ever have been and took up drinking enthusiastically to cope. In the end it earned me a reputation that I was some prodigy, and possibly one of the best developers in the company. I might be advanced for my age, I don't know, but I'm definitely nowhere near what is expected of me. That's the problem.

Early on we decided to completely rewrite the application, which is what we are currently occupied with. I have a small team where I act as the lead developer. Code reviews, CI, Cloud, all of it is my responsibility. On top of that, I have an intern. I probably don't need to say at this point in the dialog that this is far beyond my skill set. To try to pad my knowledge, I've been reading blog post after blog post trying to gain insights from people more experienced than me. Weeks typically end up 50-60 hours long, weekend work is guaranteed. I recently told my boss that I can't do this anymore, that someone with more experience needs to occupy my station, but the money isn't there. I'm stuck for a while. In this economy, I'm blessed to have a job, and I am fairly compensated for my work. leaving is out of the question.

I guess it's time I get to my questions now, though.

* What can I do to get rid of the massive case of imposter syndrome sitting on my chest?
* How can I get advice from _real_ lead developers as to how I should conduct myself and if the design decisions I'm making are valid?
* This one is tough. I've only been able to see myself grow as a programmer, and I've forgotten what it was like to be new to it. I don't know how to evaluate the progress of my intern. I've spent a lot of time teaching them how to do things, three hours of pair programming most days. They've learnt a lot, at this point they know enough to poorly build a full-stack application themselves (Has learned C# ASP-Net Core, Typescript, React, all this summer) but they're really lacking in design skills, and I have to assist more than I like. The time is coming for me to decide whether we should offer to extend their internship part time through the next semester, and I'm worrying that my need for help is clouding my judgement. How can I know if I'm fairly evaluating their performance? More importantly, how can I know I'm setting realistic expectations for their performance?

Again, thank you for whatever advice you'd be willing to give. It really means a lot.

Edit: this is insane, far more feedback than I was expecting. Thank you all for spending your time responding to these. I’m taking a breather tonight with some friends, I’ll reply to everyone in the morning. ❤️"

It made me depressed because there is a small part of me that feels like if I put school on hold and devote all my time to web development and programming then I could get a job more quickly. 

But a bigger part of me is relieved, because I am plagued with impostor syndrome and I’m terrified to start applying for internships and humiliating myself in whiteboard interviews... As long as I’m taking 3-4 classes at the university level then I can rationalize not applying by claiming “I’m just too busy with school”...

Over the summer I have had 3 other interviews for internships in software/IT and didn’t get an offer for any of them. I have a second round interview for the QA Intern position with consists of 3-15 minute conversations with other members of the company (engineer, designer, producer). I don’t have any industry experience and although I am going into my junior year I only have about a year of coding under my belt and that is mainly for school projects. I really need this internship but I’m worried I am going to mess it up and not get it like the other ones I interviewed for. I know rejection is a normal thing in job searching and I have no problem showing off my personality in an interview but I was wondering if anyone has any advice for how I could interview better. Thank you! For reference I am a computer science major who previously has 5 years of customer service experience.

EDIT: I got the internship!!! I am stoked and start at the end of the month."

I've been spending time on Coursera learning courses in SQL, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Tableau. I haven't finished an entire specialization this summer yet, though. 

Most positions I'm seeing in the Chicago area are wanting at least 2 years experience. Even some entry level ones I found are 0-2 years experience, which I still get denied for. Others want master's degrees. 

I have no experience; not even internships. What can I do to get enough on my resume to get my first job? I'm reluctant to do an unpaid internship as I hear they're not worth it. 

Please advise."

Now i'm 24 yo and I quit the medication about two years ago when I suffered my first panic attack. I noticed they were a definite trigger for anxiety and panic and decided to stop taking them. 

In these two years I some how made it trough most of my masters degree. I don't really know how but somehow it kind of worked out. Now i'm in my last semester doing my last exams ever and I have not been able to get any work done. For some reason, in the most important part of my educational career, my brain decides to go full-on sabotage mode again. I'm starting to become emotionally drained by getting angry at myself and continue messing up like there is no tomorrow. I have always had a habit of doing this in exam periods but i feel like it's a lot worse now. 

 I got a job-offer for a really cool job that I absolutely love doing (did my internship there). But if i mess up these exams it will cause problems regarding this job. I will be alone for the next weeks studying for these exams but I'm starting to really panic that i'm wasting my time and will mess everything up. Does anyone have any tips on getting out of this spiral?"

I’m a long-time lurker on this sub and newly-graduated golden bear who majored in computer science and economics.

I’ve been seeing quite a bit of questions here and thought that since I’m relatively free, I’d offer 1:1 chats for any takers. One of my biggest regrets is that looking back, I wish I had someone to chat with for advice and/or bounce questions off of; I definitely took quite a few detours in my freshman/sophomore years.

Without going into specifics, here is a little bit about me (I'd be happy to share more in our chat): 

- I will be going on to my masters at Cal (go bears)
- I’ve done a few internships in tech and consulting; I’ve interned as a SWE, PM, and data scientist at large companies and startups before.
- I do not consider myself to be ‘smart’ in anyway, but I did pretty well academically
- I’ve been a TA and lecturer for a couple classes at Cal
- I've done some research and have had a few different on-campus jobs 
- I really didn’t like Cal for the first 2-ish years, but things got much better
- I've tried out most of the restaurants around campus

Some things we can talk about:

- Schedules, economics and CS courses to take, doing well in courses, etc
- Recruiting and other fun stuff (/s)
- How to take notes on an iPad
- Applying to grad school
- All things data science at Cal
- The best food in Berkeley
- Really anything you want! From naming your new cocktail creation to speculating how COVID-19 may affect higher education permanently. 

A little caveat: I’m not a subject matter expert in most things, just happy to share things that worked/didn’t work for me. I am also not knowledgable outside of the CS/DS/Economics 'bubbles' at Cal, so YMMV.

I promise everything we discuss will be kept between us. If you’re interested, please do not hesitate to send me a DM and let’s chat :)"

I am at a second year(next following year) in college studying for Computer Engineering/IT and I'm looking forward for an internship at these companies (Currently Living and studying in Europe) but my country is not part of EU. I have a 3.6 GPA and Winner of Informatics Olympiad 3 years in a row. I am working on some personal projects as COVID19 has blocked some parts of my country to move or to work inside a company. I have completed online courses such as: Full Stack Developer, App-Development,Machine-learning.

Also I am creating some apps on Android platform and thinking of publishing them, also have created some projects on github: Computer Networks Project and Data Inventory in Java(Both of them are correctly build and illustrated). I just finished creating some websites for my ""company"" and personal website, Just published some Algorithms and Computer Networks Tutorials on Youtube.

So is there any chance for me to apply at these companies or where should I focus next. Is there anything wrong I'm doing? Or Should I focus more on the smaller companies and what should I fix?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time and sorry for taking this long.

I had two software engineering internships during my undergrad, but they didn’t even ask any coding questions. I guess they didn’t ask leetcode questions because they are giant non tech corporations, but I had a really good time there, and I was also given impactful tasks under major projects.

I’m very confident in my development ability, as in developing and maintaining applications, but I can’t do the puzzle styled leetcode questions. I would really hope that the companies I interned at gave me a return offer but they have hiring freeze so that’s not an option.

I’m also wanting to start my career in a tech hub like the Bay Area, but I really can’t do any leetcode right now. I’m currently going through DS and Algo basics again, but it was really embarrassing for me when I wasn’t able to crack leetcode easy style question.

GF loves the company A due to our sociallife and stuff, and she knows one job that i love.  
I love the first job, but i also like alot the  second, and the second is what i want to do for my career.  


And im afraid that in 9 months i won't have this opportunity (since i have no experience in the especific  Area of company B and they are giving me this chance. (company A experience that i'll aquire doesnt fit.

I was wondering whether to post his here as it sounded like an admissions question, but figured that this subreddit may be better as I'm under the impression that there may be more people who have gone down the PhD/academic/researcher path (or not!) and may be able to provide some perspective.

I'm an MSCS student who does research in machine learning and deep learning (natural language processing to be more specific). I just finished my second semester around a month ago. My original plan was to apply to PhD programs in the US and Canada this year (I'm from Korea) and if things went well then I'd start right after finishing my master's, and if things didn't go well for whatever reason(s) then I'd apply again next year.

However, these days I've been getting some major cold feet as I prepare to go about the actual admissions process (writing up my SoP, requesting letters from professors, etc.). I find myself constantly asking ""Do I actually want a PhD?"" ""What if I like working?"" ""Do I really need to go through with a PhD program to tackle interesting problems in my field?"" etc. It doesn't help that I constantly feel inferior/lacking whenever I look up the profiles of students at the labs I want to join. It also doesn't help that I keep seeing job postings for internships at places that seem to be doing really cool stuff. The feeling that applying halfway through my master's feels premature is a bonus.

Anyway, I don't want this to sound like a rant. I'm just curious if anyone's felt the same before they applied to their PhD programs, and if so whether or not there was some ""moment of clarity"" that they experienced? Thanks."

**1) Getting a job seeker visa in Germany and applying for as many jobs as possible in the 6 months I spend there**

My skeptical friend says that this is risky, and I wouldn't be able to land any job without speaking German plus that I virtually have no actual paid work experience. I guess he's right and it would end as a waste of money and me just returning to my country (I have plenty of money to support myself during the 6 months)

**2) Getting a masters degree in the UK(I can afford it) and hoping to get a job within the two years(International students now get 2 years) after graduating**

I still heard about people not being able to get jobs with this method, but I wouldn't call it a waste of money. (For personal reasons I cannot do my masters elsewhere)

**3)Just live in my country for as many years as it takes for me to get a job offer overseas with work experience.**

I'd rather kill myself honestly.



What should I do? Do I really not stand a chance of immigrating unless I get years of work experience? I am willing to do whatever it takes."

As a result, I’ve been getting frustrated over small things lately.

One of the most frustrating thing for me is COVID Callertune we hear, every time we call someone. Freaking 30-40 seconds long! 

I was going for duty yesterday when my 2 wheeler slipped because of oil spilled on road by someone. My mobile phone broke. Though I did not suffer any severe wound, my leg was hurting like hell.

I’d to call someone as my uniform was ruined. Stopped a man passing by and asked for his phone to call my friends/parents.

Called my mom (30 seconds caller tune for covid)..then she didn’t pick up as she had gone for running.

Called my dad (again 30 seconds callertune)..phone switched off as he was in middle of the surgery (he’s a doctor)

Called my friends (again 30 seconds Callertune)..couldn’t come as he was in duty

By the way, it was 7 am so most of my friends were still asleep.

After that I tried 2-3 more numbers. 
10 mins had gone by.  I must have heard Callertune for covid &gt;7 times in those 10 mins.
That gentleman got irritated and asked for his phone back and went away.

With my leg hurting, getting late for duty..I was at the peak of frustration. I literally had to hold back my tears for few movements. 

Maybe I could’ve tried calling more people if it wasn’t for that Callertune.

I seriously want this Callertune to get shortened. It has begun hindering my daily life now."

Needless to say, my APs are treating it like it's the end of the world. For context, I was a CS major when I was a freshman and didn't do well at all until it came to the point where I had to transfer to another major. I wanted to pick music production since it has been one of my passions. My parents were quick to point out that there was more money in a STEM major and that I shouldn't stray too far from CS. I ended up selecting a major that is related to CS. 

Due to them not understanding the US college system, they believed that I could finish an entire major in two semesters and graduate on time. Once I went back and showed my advisor my overly optimistic plan to graduate with my major in 2 semesters, He said that I will have to push my graduation plan by a year at the very least. My father did not take to well to this. He said that you're allowed one big screw up in life and I had used it up when I had to change my major. He is now pushing me to finish my masters in the same university while I take my undergraduate classes. 

The advisors at my college are busy trying to sort out the COVID mess and haven't been responding. I couldn't get an internship because of interviews getting cancelled. I've been trying to work on gaining new skills but my parents are adamant that I take the GRE in the next week. I don't have any money in my account. I've been getting a decent GPA (above 3.5) for the past 2 semesters but my parents aren't happy since they aren't 4.0's. I can't count the number of times that I've crawled under my desk after talking to them on the phone because of all the anxiety that they give me.

I feel like a total failure. I feel like I'm just draining their retirement fund at this point. I'm scared of not being able to give them any sort of support in my lifetime. They moved to the US during my freshman year and remind me everyday that they did it for me. I see the pain in their eyes when other APs talk about their children getting 4.0s, getting into amazing masters programs or landing super cushy jobs at big companies while I struggle to gain an internship and graduate on time. 

Every time that I try to open up to them, tears come down my face. Their reaction is either to tell me that I'm overreacting or to seriously listen to me and then tell me how they raised me right and I've started screwing up only when I'm away from them (in college). I can't sleep most nights since I feel like I haven't been productive enough.

The breaking point came today. I told my parents that I'm done studying for the day and want to go to bed early so that I can sleep early and get up to watch a sporting event. My dad palmed his face in disappointment and my heart just sank. I feel like such an asshole wanting to go to sleep just to watch a sporting event early in the morning while my parents are on their work laptops. I just wanted to vent somewhere just so that I can get this off my mind for tonight and I can get back to studying for the GRE. At this point, I'm finding different ways to be less of a disappointment. The funny thing is that I know that I need some help from a mental health professional but I don't have the money to go to one and my parents don't believe in counseling."

I got laid off from my first programming job in May, which I landed in late January, a month after graduating college. It was at a software consulting place that gave me a 6-week training bootcamp that exposed me to a lot of different technologies like Spring Boot, PostgreSQL (had already used it a bit before), Cucumber, Watir, RSpec, JUnit, and some front-end stuff. I got laid off due to COVID after three months, and I was in training for half the time, sitting around on the bench for a month afterward, during which time I got an AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate, and then was put to work on an internal project for the remaining month while working remotely. 

What do I do to get another dev job? Also, what can I do to make sure I'm as ready as possible for my next job, since I don't have a clear specialty in development other than an AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate? How do I know I'm ready for my next dev job? 

I'm currently working on building a side project to help contractors and temp workers get better jobs, and I'm networking at online Meetups over Zoom and Slack. Also working on FreeCodeCamp's back-end and front-end certifications. 

Unfortunately, there seem to be very few jobs actually aimed at people still new to the field: entry-level only in name, but of course, requiring several years of experience. I've been told to apply for internships, but I can't find very many of those in my state, Ohio, either. What am I supposed to do?"

In high-school I took both programming 11 and programming 12 courses a year ahead, and in my senior  year peer tutored my programming 12 class, I also lead the programming club and assigned and devised projects for us to work on, and once covid hit I mentored a student one on one. A year prior  I created and sold an invoicing system that I coded in Java, then a year later  in the summer rewrote it to python. I have made a few other ""big"" projects but I  did them because they were tools I wanted, hence not sure if entirely relevant.

If you were hiring an intern would I be a realistic candidate?

i299et,3,2020-08-02,Need advice: Client reduced my rate and hours for the second time and still wants me to work,[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/i299et/need_advice_client_reduced_my_rate_and_hours_for/,"So i need a bit of advice, and I think some background is very important for this story. 

A while ago, I received my first client! I’m in the social media/brand strategy and management industry. I’m also in my final semester of college. I’ve been in this industry this for almost 3 years now so I’m pretty decently experienced, but I started my freelance business officially just about three months ago ( I’ve been planning it etc for about 2 years ) 

I obtained them through networking from a former supervisor of mine. We had an interview and and I nailed it. We originally agreed on the phone that my hourly pay would be $25/hr for 3 hours. I tried explaining to them 3 hours would be tough, but I could try. This was my first ever client I didn’t really know how to negotiate but I thought $25/hr as a senior in college working for myself etc was pretty good. We agreed on the phone this would be my hourly rate and I would start in a few days. 

A couple days later, client emails me saying “due to funding” we are going to need to reduce my rate to $22.50/hr instead of what we initially agreed upon. I was kind of annoyed but thought it’s better than nothing so I accepted. I started working for them, the project was very unorganized but I was thrown into the wolves stated coming up with a ton of different strategies, implementing them and within a little less than a month I really helped in building their online presence the best I could - they have a lot of outside factors I can’t control that was really setting their brand and social media’s behind but I did my best and still received results. 

Two weeks ago they kept talking about how they needed to change rates and reduce pay for a different part of the team. The client kept reassuring us that we were okay and shouldn’t expect any problem with funding. He even came to me and asked for my help coming up with grant topics so they could have funding, this was a bit of a red flag to me, but I gave them a few ideas and they started working on grants. 

Well last week I was on vacation. I had a meeting with someone else on the social team and saw that the analytics and shit they were telling us - we didn’t have access to part CLEARLY bc they wanted to hide it - was a lie do naturally myself and the other social te member were pissed. We demanded a phone call with the client basically breaking down the shocking analytic report for the website and essentially really understanding there was genuinely nothing we could do to better their brand bc this factor was the biggest problem and it was out of our control. Anyway that same meeting the client confesses we will actually have to cut funding for the social team too. 

Naturally I was pissed. He sent me and email on Friday basically saying they didn’t have enough funding and needed to reduce my rate to $20/hr with only 2 hours making over $500 dollars less than I would be, on top of that the content I create detail etc can’t be done in 2 hours especially for three social accounts. I was super annoyed bc this would have been the second pay cut within a month and honestly I was making more biweekly at an internship then I would be making within a month working for them. I kindly declined an extension. He emails me back basically saying he understands it’s frustrating that they’ve requested a pay decrease twice already and super unprofessional but he fought hard for a social media team and fought hard to have me on the team and I’m making the most out of everyone in the company so “with this information I assume you’ll extend for at least one more month.” 

I felt a little guilty knowing I was making the most out of everyone and I should work for them for another month bc it’s still money in the bank?? But another part of me is like that is money I made in high school, it’s not a live able amount since I’m a college student living on my own paying my own shit -personal bills etc. and dude you cut my pay twice with NO guarantee for future funding ...  

I feel like I know the answer of what I should do but being my first client and me being semi naive and guilty for my rates - I know $25 is expensive and I actually think my work is worth more than that bc of who I’ve worked for in the past and my overall resume and portfolio, but I get nervous upping my rates bc then who’s going to want to pay me??? Idk part of me feels like I can’t be too picky.

 And while there are plenty of IT jobs in Brazil, they do require a whole lot of technologies and a lot more than just basic stuff, even for internships.

A lot of this may be common knowledge for some people, but I've found a lot of people don't have anyone to walk through this with them. 

So I was scrolling through popular and a post came across my thread:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i24wcp/reality\_finally\_hit\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i24wcp/reality_finally_hit_me/) 

This really resonated with me, because I've gone to several schools as a freshman, transfer, study abroad and a graduate student. I've also been a teacher, mentor and reference for my own students. I feel like there's so much confusion here and If you don't have someone who knows the system or has been there before, it's very difficult. 

The number one barrier I see to students coming from tough circumstances not getting to go to college is they don't know how to navigate through all the hoops. So, my young friends, a few words of encouragement before I dive into lecture mode.

You're not crazy, this is hard. And it is harder if you need financial aid. There's always a point in the FAFSA where they talk about Expected Family Contribution, and for me, I was like, there's no way my family can do that. However, you aren't alone. You don't have to compete with perfect kids you have all the money in the world to go to school, you just have to find your path. 

***With that in mind, let me put some thoughts out there!***

You have a few paths to end goal of a degree here. For the purpose of this, I’m going to assume you’ve already decided college is your best route because after all college is not for everyone and trade schools are also an awesome place to go. **Seriously**, we need plumbers, welders, electricians. 

Let's say you have your heart set on 4 schools. 

**Path 1:** You apply to these schools, get a financial need waiver if the app fee is a burden (they’re easy to obtain just by emailing the school). Explore the systems of grants and loans with them, as described in detail below. You may end up owing more than grants and federal loans cover. That’s where private loans come in and that’s the warning zone. (at least in my opinion).

**Path 2:** Maybe one of the schools you’re interested in has a deal with your state’s community college/junior college system. This is an awesome system put in place to make transferring to a big school, way cheaper and easier. I describe it in detail below. Check it out.

**Path 3:** Maybe none of the schools you’re interested in have a deal with the community college system, but it’s SO much cheaper, you’re open to looking at the public university’s and colleges in your state that do. 

The nice thing is, you can do all three in parallel and see what gives you the most money! In Path 1, different schools have different grants and different scholarships specifically just for people who need financial help. No extra work required, just apply on schedule, earlier the better, and see what they offer you. 

Now the deep dive:

**Community Colleges:**

The community college system/junior college system is **ALWAYS** worth at least looking at. Almost every state has an agreement that if you attend a 2-year school and get grades averaging 3-3.5 GPA, you can attend a public state school for the **SAME PRICE** as what your were attending the community college. **THIS IS MASSIVE.** 

This does a few things:

* It's guaranteed admissions, if you hold up your end with g.p.a and class requirements.
* Its cuts tuition by 30-50% in a lot of cases, because they're setting the agreement per credit hours.
* It takes a TON of the stress out of transferring because the schools have already created a contract if which classes apply to which.So depending on if you want to enter the 4 year college's engineering program, art school, English, math, general or etc, the 2 year school has a very easy list of what classes you should take and how many credits spare you have to just HAVE FUN WITH.

**Paying for School:**

So, how do you pay for that?

The answer is honestly federal student loans and federal aid. If your family qualifies for financial aid, a few things will happen. You should outright qualify for a grant federally which will defray a bit of cost each semester, your state may have some additional need-based grant money. On top of that, the school may have merit and another need-based grant. All of that brings the total down. 

Then they'll try to offer you a work study job. It's not much, but it's cash in your pocket at a job on campus so you can still be nearby to focus on class. Then come loans. The way aid works is they use up all the grants (money you don't have to pay back) first and **THEN** go for loans. 

Let's just get this out of the way now, it’s awful that we need student loans. It sucks. However, if you manage the total cost of which schools you're applying to, it can be dealt with.

Always take out the max subsidized you're eligible that you need to cover costs before going to unsubsidized. Subsidized loans do not accrue interest while you're an active student, unsubsidized do. 

At this point, hopefully everything is covered, private loans and parent-plus loans are the absolute LAST resort and I would avoid them because the interest rates. 

This system of grants and loans is the same no matter where you’re at. If you apply to the schools and you have financial need, you can get a waiver for the application fee and see exactly how the money would work out BEFORE you commit. It could be that the grants, maybe a school specific financial aid package and then the federal student loans are enough. You should absolutely try and see. If it’s still too expense, are any of these schools one that may have an agreement with a community college?

As for paying back these loans, the bottom line comes down to: Income Based Repayment. Get re-certified every year based on your taxes. You have the option to go all in with crazy payments of $600 a month a try to pay them back. That's automatically what the loan administrators are going to set the amount at. They want to recoup the loan quickly. However, there are SEVERAL options and it only takes about 10 minutes to request a different repayment plan. 

Even if you're making 6 figures a year, doing income re-certification once a year brings that monthly payment WAY down. At that point, you have the option to pay just what's due or pay more in an attempt to pay it off. 

Either way, student loans go away in 25 years. I think that isn't pointed out to students. As long as you don't default, if your loans aren't paid off after 25 years, they are settled by the federal government. In the meantime, your credit isn't impacted because they are considered a different class of debt, and you just have to make sure you make the payments. If you fall on hard times, there's deferment you can get for 6 months at a time that you can continue if the hardship continues. If the hardship is so bad you have to declare bankruptcy, the loans may be settled anyway. The assumption is that if you're making a good faith effort to make a payment each month, they'll settle it in 25 years if there's anything left.

**To sum up:**

I strongly urge people to think about the end goal rather than just having their heart set on specific schools because I will tell you this very, very honestly. 

No one cares where you go to school.

For your first job they'll care because it's the only thing they have to go on, but they're looking more for, is it an actual school maybe anyone heard of versus St. Fruit Loops of the Bermuda Triangle Degrees Overnight for 34.99? (This is another reason internships are so helpful, practical experience of any kind helps so much. Same with teaching assistantships, work study anything that you can say relates to your chosen field)

What's most important about picking a school is the feeling that you are more than a number. That there's systems in place to support you. This advice is more relevant to the 4-year school than the 2-year, but it matters. I'll tell you honestly, I got more love and support at a bigger state school than a smaller more prestigious school that was WAY more expensive. Look for a few things.

* Do they offer mental health services for their students?
* What’s the expanse of their regular health care for their students?
* What training are their police and security required to have?
* What, if any, care do they take when matching roommates?
* Do they offer diversity, mindfulness, openness clubs, etc.?
* Do they offer food pantry for struggling students? Housing support?
* How easy is it to talk to an advisor? A financial aid officer? 
* How well are their OLDEST dorms maintained?

A lot of these things may not apply to you, but I've found that figuring out the answer to a lot of these questions goes a long way towards showing how the university/colleges takes care of their students beyond the things they'll show you on tour like a gym, dining hall and rec center and the newest dorms. 

The most important thing about college is to be your own advocate. About grades,classes, everything. A lot of these teachers, advisors, everything are dealing with so many students, they can't keep track of everything. So if you start keeping track at the beginning of your school journey, it becomes a lot easier to keep track as you go. Make sure you know how to use the school's portal website, the advising logins, know what general reqs you need to fill. You'll be so much less stressed if you take one semester at a time, by taking an hour to  learn the requirements that you need and then picking classes that fit the requirements. 

Then focus on a balance between care and study. Your grades will honestly be a lot better if you still take time to take of yourself, I promise you. I worked full time in undergrad and until my last semester of graduate school. I was a straight A student in high school and then suddenly realized I could be again with time to breathe.

Also, there's a technical interview in which they ask you to solve coding questions related to DSA.

So, what kind of projects should Quant Dev/DS applicants have worked on and what do they get asked in their technical interviews?"
i2gznz,1,2020-08-02,Got any career advice for an undergrad ECE student?,jmertig,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/i2gznz/got_any_career_advice_for_an_undergrad_ece_student/,"So I'm a Junior Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad on a fast track scholarship to my Master's Degree. 

I love what I study and I know with every fiber in my being I want to be an engineer. However, I have no idea what my life as an engineer after university will actually look like.

My university offers several ""concentration areas"" that would carry over to my Master's Degree. These concentrations are:

Signal Processing and Communications - I actually have very little interest in this

Biomedical Devices - same, little interest 

Power and Energy Systems - classes like Energy Conversion, Power Electronics, Control of Electric Power. To my understanding this would push me towards a career in power grids and possibly green energy. 

Energy Fields and Devices - classes like Applied Electromagnetics,  Energy Conversion, Integrated Circuits. To my understanding this would push me to work in the design and testing of ICs and transistors to work for companies like Texas Instruments. 

Computer Engineering - classes like Software Design II, Computer Architecture, Operating System Design,  Microcontroller Applications. This would push me towards a career as a hardware engineer for companies like IBM, Intel, AMD.

I have a better understanding in the courses and  have overall more interest in the Computer Engineering path but I don't want to easily dismiss the other two. I believe there will be a bigger need for EEs in green energy and it would be more noble to work in that field than as a hardware engineer, but I know very little about what I would actually do.  I've also been speaking to Texas Instruments recruiters who have verbally offered me internship positions (I understand until I have an actual offer this means very little).

I have 6 months to decide my concentration and essentially my future career. Any input from engineers in these careers is greatly appreciated!"

Alison was removing her report from the scanner when the intern looked up from reading a new message on his screen. “Oh, there is some news you need to hear. The linguists and interrogators have arrived and are being processed at the front desk at the moment, they should be meeting with you shortly. They are also insisting on some security changes.” He paused to type on his keyboard for a second and the scanner began printing a checklist, Alison glanced at it worriedly while the intern returned to skimming the document on his screen. “Ok, some extra guards will be arriving soon and the NSA is insisting the lab with the aliens will need to follow biosafety level 3 protocols. Some guys from the biohazard wing are coming by to give you guys a proper hermetically sealed tank with a filtered air supply to keep the wasps in. They are also going to move that food sample you took to one of their labs.” He said, glancing back up at Alison. 

*Oh great. That won’t be a test of trust at all* Alison thought as she imagined trying to wrangle the wasps into a new cage. Security was probably going to insist on clamping their wings again for that.

She sighed and picked up the fresh printout. “What’s the eta on the new tank?”

Some scrolling and clicking later “Hmm, 10 to 15 minutes. They say they had a wheeled one in storage that they are about to send over.”

“That’s quick at least, I’ll go tell the others to get ready for them. Bye.” She said briskly as she rushed back to the lab and brought the others up to speed. Carl was a bit annoyed about having his sample taken away.

“Really? They are worried about diseases from these guys? They are aliens. That’s worse than worrying about a pine tree catching a cold, at least a pine tree still uses the same biochemistry. These guys don’t even use DNA.” Carl grumbled as he packed his equipment and the sample back up.  

“Look, I know it’s unlikely but you know how paranoid people are about this sort of thing, NASA kept the Apollo 11 guys in quarantine for over three weeks just in case there were deadly diseases on the *Moon*.”  Alison grumped back. “Anyway, I need to go tell our guests that their cage is going to be changing soon. I hope they add that water tank we asked for, that might sweeten the deal.” She said over her shoulder as she walked over to the Faraday cage.


——————————————————————


[Walter] was feeling a bit better by now, the giant had been gone for a bit over a cycle and the lack of constant watching had finally let him relax enough that he was willing to shift his focus inwards and fix his broken mind. [Eve] had restored some function to his signaling pathways but she was no surgeon and they were still in pretty rough shape. They were beginning to heal on their own, but it was far too slow.

He knew he had been procrastinating these last few cycles, he really wasn’t keen on messing with his mind weaving equipment again after that last disaster. It was a silly fear, he had worked with those tools for decadays, they were the foundation of his work as an operator, but that almost made the fear worse in a way. That even a trusted tool could kill you if you made a slight mistake. Regardless, he couldn’t keep making up excuses for pushing it off, not if he wanted to control his body well enough to be able to escape if it came to that. At the moment he was pretty sure he couldn’t fly. He glanced around the cage and the room beyond one last time before disconnecting from his craft and turning his attention inwards. 

There was the brief bought of disorientation that always comes when swapping between different senses. The arms and tendrils that wove out from the main control center of the weaving equipment were coated in taste and touch sensors, and sensors in each joint fed him a constant sense of each limb’s location. The hundreds of such limbs sprawled about throughout his body flooded him with a torrent of sensory input that was briefly overwhelming. Bringing a few minor thought centers to bear on the data pouring in the noise gradually became understandable and he cautiously sent a few dozen tendrils to examine several of his major motor signaling pathways. 

As he felt around he found many treads were still loose, the protein walkways trailing off to nowhere. He could taste memory snippets and pheromone signals piling up along them or falling off into the surrounding fluid, the walker proteins in the water spasming as they blindly repeated their walking cycle with nothing to grab onto. [Walter] [sighed].

*About as bad as I thought. Feels like a bit over half of the fibers are still cut. Well, no more putting it off, better get to work.* 

[Walter] began the slow process of identifying each snipped end and linking them back up to their proper counterpart, triggering ribosomes to manufacture extra cabling to fill in gaps where they didn’t break cleanly. Several kilobeats drifted by as he was lost in the work.

*I should really add in some redundant lines and put some safe guards on this thing, I don’t want another situation like that being possible* He thought to himself as he finished up the last touches on his 8th motor group. He started planning some upgrades and rereading the mindweaver’s control center programing manual when a signal packet with [Eve]’s scent came in. 

“Hey [Walter], you should wake up, [Alison] is back and has some news for us.”

[Walter] grumbled internally for a moment before stowing his equipment, properly this time, and disconnecting. With a jerk his normal senses returned to him and he fiddled with his craft’s comm.

“OK, booting back up now.” He replied, before linking with his craft again. Almost immediately he could feel the improvement, his motor functions weren’t twitching out like crazy in his real body or in the link anymore. Looking around with his craft’s eyes he watched his front legs draw perfect circles in the air with relief. 

“You made some progress I take it?” [Frank] asked looking over at him.

“Yeah, I’m mostly back together now. There are still a few more final touchups before I’m 100 percent again, but that should only take a few more kilobeats of work.” [Walter] said, lowering his legs back down and turning to look at the source of his interruption. The colony was standing over their cage again and was looking at a large flexible sheet of white material clutched in one of its grasping limbs. 

“What was the news you were talking about [Eve]?” [Walter] asked, turning his attention a bit lower to the craft standing at the front of the cage. [Eve] turned and waved an antenna at him. “Yeah, sorry about interrupting you [Walter], just figured you should know the colonies have decided to move us to a more sealed cage, their leaders are apparently paranoid about diseases. We told them that we don’t have any pathogens in us and none of them could affect them anyway, but apparently they don’t trust us enough to take our word on that.”

“Fair enough.” [Walter] muttered. “I wouldn’t trust them that much either. Though that does make any hope of escape slimmer.”

[Eve] sent a signal of indifference. “Any escape plan would have to involve our craft if we want to survive more than a tenthday and we’d need more than a slight gap in a hatch to get these things out. We already can’t break out of this chamber, another slightly tougher one won’t make a difference. Our best chance to escape would be while they are moving us.”

“Should we make a break for it though?” [Frank] interjected. “They haven’t contacted our ship yet so no one is coming to pick us up yet. We *might* be able to cobble together a radio powerful enough to reach them, but that’s a really big if depending on where we are. And also let’s not forget the fact we would have to fight our way out of this massive complex with our stingers sealed. That would be suicide.”

“I wasn’t saying we should try and escape *now*, just that moving between cages is pretty much the only time when that’s an option. Hopefully it will happen again after the ship has been called, or maybe we will get moved to a different facility and can escape while we are outside. But yeah, escaping now would just be dumb, and it could ruin any chances that they might willingly let us go.” 

[Walter] thought about interjecting for a moment but decided they had a point and let the matter drop. This new cage story might be a way to trick them into transferring them into testing machines again, but flying away was a dream at this point. He [sighed] and let that dream die.

“OK, we’ll continue playing along for now. When are they going to take us? Are they going to use those blasted clamps again?” He asked, turning to look at the 6 pedestals lined up by the large glass door at the front of the cage, the impassive array of metal limbs and serrated maws atop each glinting in the lamplight.  

“I fucking hope not.” Muttered [Eve].


——————————————————————


Alison glanced away from the check list she was rereading as the radio hissed to life. 

*Hmm, they took a few seconds this time. That’s a bit longer than usual.*

“Transfer. When. How.” The radio asked.

“In around 5 minutes.” She said, glancing at a clock. “Oh, that’s one part in 60 of an hour. I don’t know how you will be transferred, that’s probably up to the people setting up the new tank. They might use the clamps again or transfer you in a sealed box. They don’t want you contaminating the air.”

“No. Want. Clamps.”

Alison grimaced. “Understandable, sorry about that. Though it would be a good chance for me to add some marking on you.”

“…Why” The radio hissed after a moment.

“Ah, because I have trouble telling you apart.” Alison said slightly embarrassedly. “You also all use the same voice so it’s hard to know who’s speaking. I assume it’s you up front?” She asked, pointing at the wasp up at the front with its antenna on the glass. 

“Yes.” The radio hissed. “Try. Fix. Sound.”

“What do you mea-“ Alison paused as the radio began talking with its voice clips shifted into a higher pitch.

“Different. Speaker.” It squeaked.

Alison managed to keep a straight face and replied. “That helps a bit, but telling 8 different pitches apart, especially given the range of voices you guys use for each sound clip, would be pretty hard. How about you send on different radio frequencies and I’ll set up a display to show whose talking.”

“Yes.” 

Alison spent a few moments plugging a tablet into the radio and setting up an audio app to display eight different channels. “Ok, I have this set up, send me the different frequencies you’re going to use and identify yourselves.”

A few seconds of pings followed by legs being raised and she had each one of the bugs set up with a number. *Let’s hope I don’t lose track of which is which.* She thought as she turned her attention to number 1 at the front of the cage. “Ok, this is working now. This will defiantly help the linguists too. We should get some more radios and let you have multiple conversations going.” She said, adding a note to her next report. 

A knock on the door signaled the arrival of the biohazard team. They wheeled in a slightly larger tank with a large box with vents protruding from one side. One of the heavily garbed workers stepped forwards and addressed the collected scientists. 

“You will need to undergo decontamination procedures and don proper PPE before you can continue working. We have set up a chemical shower down the hall and a changing station for your equipment. As you have already been exposed we will be monitoring you for any signs of infection, and you will be quarantined to this lab and several sealed off rooms we have been setting up in this wing. The linguists and interrogators from the NSA will be arriving shortly, as you are possibly infected you will make no contact with them. We will be handling any biohazardous materials.”

“How will you be handling the aliens?” Asked Alison.

“We will be transferring them in this case.” The technician said, gesturing to a small box that could fit in one of the tank’s airlocks. “Will they cooperate?” He asked.

“I will ask them to, but that’s all I can really say on the matter.” Alison said cautiously. She turned back to the cage on the desk. “These people will be transferring you in a box now, no clamps. They are going to be putting you in that bigger box there. Will you get in when they tell you?”

“Yes.”

Alison turned to the technician and shrugged. “They have been mostly honest so far but have admitted that they know what lying is. They aren’t openly hostile to the idea at least.”

“Alright, we will handle things from here. You all need to go begin decontaminating.”

The scientists sighed slightly and filed out to the shower. After changing into back-tying gowns, masks and face shields they were given a quick test of their vitals and begrudgingly allowed to get back to work. 

“It could be worse.” David grumbled as he fiddled with his gown. “They could have declared BSL-4 and required we all wear positive pressure suits.”

“I just hope they didn’t traumatize any of them.” Deborah muttered as they pushed open the lab door and checked on the wasps.


——————————————————————


[Frank] watched these new colonies warily as they began setting up the room they just wheeled in. They looked odd and mishappened at first until he realized they were wearing some sort of full body covering. One of them stood up clutching a smaller room with one hand, if by small you meant several stories high, but that was practically normal at this point. He guessed this was the box the colonies had been talking about a few kilobeats ago. The creature slowly lumbered past their cage to the huge door on the wall a few kilospan away. Some creaks and groans could be heard as the being shuffled around in whatever chamber was back there before one of the hatches on the back wall clicked open and the box it had been holding slid out, its door ajar. One of the other creatures stood nearby looking in at them and said “Enter” “Bring” “Tool”, pointing at their communication device. [Frank] looked at it curiously. “We can’t lift that.” He replied. 

“No” “Small” “You” “Tool”

“Oh, the interface tool, yeah we’ll bring it.”

[Frank] looked around at what was left of their team and sent. “Ok people, let’s get this over with.” He flew over to the new chamber and walked inside cautiously, seeing and smelling nothing amiss. It was just a smaller plastic room. He relaxed slightly and called the others in after him. A few beats later the rest of the group flew in and waited. The creature watching them made a sound and the hatch to the airlock the box was in slid closed. Another hatch behind them opened a sliver and a whirring was heard as the door on their box slid shut. Once their box was sealed the hatch behind them opened up all the way and they could see the colony from before putting away a device on its belt. Massive limbs reached out and picked up their box, with both hands this time, and the creature slowly carried them out into the main room. It seemed to be trying to keep them steady, there was only a slow rocking where it failed to perfectly compensate for its gait. 

A few dozen beats later and they were set down in front of the door to the larger cage, much to [Walter]’s relief. The creatures rather unceremoniously slid them inside and shut the door, before fiddling with several devices, flicking beams of light over them, the new cage and the colony which carried them. At last they seemed to be satisfied and one of them flicked a device and their box’s door opened again. 

*This cage isn’t comm shielded then. That’s useful to know.* [Frank] thought as he carefully crawled out. After a slightly longer check of this new space he found little of note. It was a mostly empty reinforced glass box with some fans behind a secure vent whirring in a high corner. He wondered if their request for a water tank had fallen through. There was one other thing in the box with them though, a larger communications device connected to a black box. “What is that?” He asked one of the creatures watching them. They didn’t respond and he realized the radio hadn’t sounded, they were several kilospans away from it now. He grumbled for a bit as the creatures began washing things down instead of setting the radio back up. After a few hundred beats of waving at them fruitlessly he gave up and went back to the smaller box with the others. He was pretty sure the strange black cube wasn’t anything dangerous but there was no reason to test that. 

After heading back in he found the fabricator pair had passed the time making some paints from plastic chips they had squired away. “What’s that for?” He sent curiously as he watched them pour out some of the thick grey liquid into a bowl. “It’s body paint so that the humans can tell us apart better.” One of them said. “We can write the numbers our comms are using on our backs.”

“Hmm, I’m not sure if their sight is good enough to distinguish symbols that small from a kilospan away.” [Frank] mused. “You saw how big the symbols on their screens are and they hold those half a kilospan away from their heads’ at most.”

The pair deflated slightly before one perked up “We could do colors instead, that should be clearer than trying to tell apart different squiggles.” 

[Frank] sent a signal of cautious acceptance. “If you can make some safe dyes with the chemicals you have on hand you can try. [Alison] seemed to find telling us apart important, it might help them relate to us more.”

“Or they just want to keep track of us better.” [Erin] sent.

[Frank] [shrugged] “Or that. I still think it’s worth it.”

He glanced around at the others who sent signals of acceptance or indifference. A kilobeat latter the fabricators had settled on several dyes that worked in the human color range and made a few different mixes. Each team member soon had a bold stripe running down their crafts abdomen and a splotch on their thorax and head. [Frank] glanced up at the colonies again and saw they were *still* cleaning. He [sighed] and prepared himself for another long wait.

After a cycle or so of boredom their familiar creatures finally lumbered back in. They were a bit hard to recognize at first due to changing their outer covering and partly obscuring their heads with protective gear but that group of heights, eyes and head filaments was somewhat recognizable. 

*Oh thank the depths. Maybe now we will get the radio working again.*


——————————————————————


Alison scanned the room and saw the new tank up against one of the tables in the middle of the lab. 

“How was the transfer?” she asked as she and Deborah walked over. The creatures remined silent which was odd, but one of them flew up and began gesturing at the far end of the room. 

*Wait, why is it covered in paint?* Alison thought before turning to look at where it was pointing. 

*Oh, they left the radio over there, that was dumb.*

Alison walked over to the old cage and grabbed the radio set. “Hey, when did you paint the wasps? I thought you were only going to move them while we were gone?” She asked annoyed to one of the hazmat suited technicians working nearby. He didn’t look up from the door knob he was scrubbing. “We didn’t do that. It just showed up on them after a few minutes, figured they made it themselves somehow. We would like a sample of it soon for safety testing.”

“Oh. That’s interesting. I’ll go ask them about it.”

She finished moving the radio equipment and tablet to the new desk and turned it on.

“Word. Yes.” It said immediately. She glanced at the tablet and say it was number 1 speaking as usual. She smiled slightly, “You missed being able to talk huh?”

“Yes. Boredom. Speak. Work. Help. Return. Vessel.” 

“Yes, if you help we might get you to your ship. We have made some progress on that, we have found one of your ships. We will contact them soon, our decision makers really want to talk to them.” Alison said as she got the tablet’s stand propped up.

“Good. When.”

“As soon as some translators arrive and give you more words so you tell them a bit more about what those ships’ reaction might be.”

“Understood.”

Alison glanced around at the wasps cluster around the little transport box, noting the odd shades of color they had dabbed on themselves. “Did you add the colors?”

“Yes. Help. Distinguish.”

Alison grinned “That’s great. Where did you get them?”

“Made.” A purple striped drone said, holding up a chip of phone casing. 

*Note to self, they have advanced chemical plants in those things.* Alison thought uneasily. 

She spent a few moments relabeling their radio channel names with their colors as the linguists arrived.

——————————————————————

Clark had been waiting in the lobby for 20 minutes now and was struggling to contain his impatience. *Real aliens, I’m about to talk to real fucking aliens.* He thought with a mix of giddy excitement and disbelief. He glanced annoyedly at the other two agents who had been driven here with him, Hank and Michel he was pretty sure. They were looking of into the distance with rather stonier expressions. *They are probably just looking at this as a security threat. Which, I mean, it is. They were spying on us for days, that’s not a great sign. But come on people, we just answered the greatest question in astronomy, have a bit of wonder in your lives.* He composed himself as the guard standing at the lobby door checked his ear piece and headed over to them. Clark stood up out of the surprisingly uncomfortable chair he had been sitting in with relief as the guard gestured for them to follow.

Several locked doors and an elevator ride down into the Earth later and they arrived at the wing of the lab where the aliens were being held. The hallway leading up to it was filled white plastic sheets, pumps, plastic tubing, and the harsh smell of cleaning chemicals. “This facility was chosen due to this section being equipped to study electronic warfare equipment.” Their terse guide informed them as they reached the end of the hall and he pointed at the pair of wire laced doors set there. “Each lab room in this wing are Faraday shielded and have their own air gapped servers to prevent any damage to the rest of the facility. You will be provided with digital and analog recording equipment inside the lab, and you will be permitted access to its server, but you are not allowed to bring any digital equipment or recordings out. The only communication with the rest of the lab is carried through these doors as heavily proofread physical printouts or word of mouth. Am I understood?”

Clark and the two other NSA agents nodded; he had been preparing for something like this. “Any external communications will be conveyed to you via a messenger” The guard continued, pointing at a thin man sitting at a desk nearby. The messenger gave them a half-hearted wave and the guard turned back to the group. “In addition to the data security of this room we are modifying it to be compliant with biosafety level 3 protocols due to the discovery that the subjects are alien lifeforms. Disease compatibility is unknown at this time. A changing booth has been set up down that hall for you to put on the required protective equipment.”

Several minutes of instruction and suiting up followed as the four of them put on their garb and recording equipment. Their guide then lead them back to the signal lock into the lab, and Clark could see more hasty modifications present in it as the small room had been partly filled with a chemical shower. The inner door was covered by a clear plastic sheet that was tapped securely to the doorframe, looking through it he could see basically what he had been expecting, a large white room with work stations and banks of equipment lining the walls and several steel tables arrayed in the center. 

The guard walked up and rapped on the glass door through the sheet and a man in hazmat gear opened it, giving them a clearer view. The guard pointed to a group of less heavily suited up scientists. “This is the team that has been dealing with these creatures so far. As they have already potentially been exposed, so you will not enter the room and will observe through this sheeting. Do not open the outer door to this room unless someone in the lab has shut the inner door to maintain data security. You may introduce yourselves.” Their guide finished and stepped back to let the interrogators peer in.
	
Clark tried to pay attention as the 6 scientists exchanged pleasantries but his attention was grabbed by the cage one of the hazmat suited technicians were rolling over to them, a cage with several wasps in it. 

“Those are the creatures alright.” Said a short brown-haired scientist who noticed his shift in focus, he was pretty sure she said her name was Alison. “You’re the linguist then?” She asked.

“Um, yeah.” He said, pulling his eyes away. *Michel and Hank must have just finished introducing themselves.* He thought, glancing at the two other agents. He cleared his throat. “Yes, I specialize in translating languages and code phrases. I understand these creatures have a limited grasp of spoken English correct?”

“Correct.” A radio hissed.

He whipped his head down and saw one of the bugs in the cage was looking up at him. It had a garish shade of green paint spread on its head and back. “Er, hello.” Clark said, crouching down so they were closer to eye level. “How many words do you currently know?”

“Not. Know. Number. Sound. Know. Number. Picture.” The radio said in a strange broken cadence. The creature then turned to look at Alison and gestured at the tablet and battery bank in its enclosure. “What. Box.” It asked.

“The box next to the tablet? That’s a battery pack.” Alison replied

“Word. Battery.”

“A type of power storage.”


——————————————————————


[Eve] stepped back a bit when she heard that and checked her radiation sensor. Nothing unusual. *Ok, it’s not one of their more insane types of power source at least.*

“What type of power” She asked. She waited for a few hundred beats as the creature above slowly drawled out “Chemical” “Similar” “Communication” “Machine”

She glanced towards [Frank] who [shrugged]. “Sounds like they’re saying it’s a bigger version of their comm unit power sources. Those are somewhat primitive chemical batteries; they are flammable but otherwise pretty safe.”

“All right, if your sure its not going to bust into flames I guess we can turn that bigger device on then. Hopefully it works similarly.”


——————————————————————


Clark watched as the wasps flew over to the tablet and flicked it on. It was already set up and had a drawing app on the home screen.

“Someone suggested a bigger screen and some better apps would be useful.” Said one of the technicians when Alison gave him a questioning look. 

After a few moments of clicking around the wasps seemed to get a hang of the larger interface and began writing out a number. “1506 words. Not terrible, not fluent either. OK, I am going to do some relevant vocabulary tests, Mr. Michel Anderson here is going to ask you some of the questions that we are thinking of sending to your ship, answer any of them that you can and tell me which words in them you don’t know.” Clark said as the other agent began pulling out files from his briefcase.

Several minutes of questioning followed, until the green painted alien up front waved several legs at them and said “Slow. Much. More. Talk.”

 “You want to us to go much slower?” Clark clarified.

“No. Too. Slow. More. Others. Talk.”

“I think they want to speed things up with multiple conversations.” Alison said.

“Yes. You. Much. Slow. Think.”

“Are they saying we’re stupid or that we’re literally slower?” Michel asked annoyed. 

“Slower. Think.”

A pair of wasps grabbed their little stylus again and wrote a 90. “Amount. Slow. Think.” The radio hissed.

Clark’s eyes went wide and he looked at Alison who seemed only a bit surprised. “I figured they were a bit faster than us due to how quickly they responded all the time, but 90-fold is pretty crazy. No wonder they always seemed ADHD. We must be driving you mad with boredom.” She said.

“Yes.” The radio replied.

The NSA agents looked at each other with a rather different concern at the front of their minds. *That means they have a* massive *tactical advantage over us, any fight we have with them they could out maneuver us with ease. And the spying, they have been studying us for a bit over a week at least, that’s multiple years to them. They must know far more about us than we imagined.* Clark thought with mounting panic. *Our timeline is going to need to be sped* way *up for this.*

He looked at the green bug again “Can your translator understand sped up speech?”

“Yes.”

He turned to the guard by the door. “Get as many people as you can reading this stuff into a microphone and get us a fast audio player.” He said, handing him most of the pile of papers they had prepared. “Also, please for the love of God get us permission to break this signal containment policy. We won’t be able to cram enough people in here to answer their questions in real time, letting people talk to them remotely would speed things up massively. The ships above might come to some decision about us far faster than we thought, we need to start communicating with them *today*.”

The guard grimaced “I’ll see what I can do.” He said before rushing out the door, papers in hand. Clark tapped his foot impatiently while the technician inside the lab closed the inner door briefly while the guard left, painfully aware that each passing second was a minute and a half to the beings he was trying to communicate with. 

*What the hell have we gotten ourselves into?*

Director Townsend finished another call with the FBI and sighed as he looked at his freshly filled inbox. At the top was an urgent message from the interrogation team which he clicked open immediately. He reread it twice, paused, and began cursing under his breath. He then made another phone call.

“Yes, this is Townsend again. We have another development. Apparently, these creatures think around 90 times faster than we do. Yes, my response exactly. I am adjusting this lab’s data security policy in light of this, I want an encrypted line of communication to as many trusted linguists as you can get your hands on. This job just got 90 times harder.”


——————————————————————


[Frank] looked on with relief as the creatures seemed to take the revelation of their slowness seriously and were working on a compromise. 

“I still think telling them that was a bad idea, that was one of our biggest hidden advantages.” [Erin] grumbled.

“We have been stuck here for two tenthdays already and have only had like 10 conversations. These things have already found one of our ships, we need to get going faster before either of us do something stupid.” [Eve] replied.

[Erin] grumbled to herself for a few beats but didn’t respond and [Eve] let the matter drop. It was a moot point regardless. The things had spent the last few kilobeats rushing around preparing new equipment. From what they could glean from the scattered words they overheard it seemed their leaders were going to let more linguists talk to them remotely. It would still take them kilobeats to answer any questions they asked but there would be multiple colonies working on different questions at once and playing back their answers at high speed. It would be a pain to keep track of which answer was for which question but even still it would speed things up quite a bit. 

One of the new colonies, [Clark] was its sound name [Frank] recalled, was setting up a strange folding comm device with dozens of button on its lower surface. He had been plugging in a box with black foam on one side and was pointing it towards them. After some more slow clicks the box began playing quick bursts of sound at them. “You” “Understood” “This” 

[Frank] [grinned]. “Yes” he replied. After a few dozen beats the slow creature clicked another button and a sped up recording of one of the creatures asking questions about the voidships began to play. 

*Now we are getting somewhere.*


——————————————————————


Alison watched the linguists setting up equipment on the other side of the plastic screen with a tinge of annoyance that she wasn’t able to help much. She watched the wasps flick about on their tablet, sketching drawings or numbers to answer questions that just sounded like high pitched chirps to her ears. She was recording and monitoring the radio transmissions from and between the creatures on her laptop, slowing it down to see if she could see anything interesting about their language yet. So far it just looked like noise to her, but she figured it would be useful data for the linguists’ latter if they ever wanted to try and speak alien. 

*Well, send alien radio at least. We would need a DNA printer to ‘speak’ it.*

A few hours later and people were beginning to get tired. She checked the clock and saw it was after 8. *Shit, already? I hope we are getting paid over time for this…on second thought I hope overtime is still relevant after this.* At some point someone from security signed off on giving the creatures the water tank they had requested and the bugs looked like they were taking shifts in it every ten minutes or so, which made sense, the last few hours had been nearly 2 weeks on their scale. 

At last at around a quarter to 9 a slightly clearer voice rang out over the radio. “This is Green. We think we have a close good understanding of the language now. We want to talk to vessel now.”

Alison glanced at Clark through the plastic screen and saw he seemed both pleased and a bit apprehensive. *Watching your students learn a language in 2 hours will do that to you I guess.*

He spent a few moments checking reports from the other linguists they had been messaging with before nodding. “It seems we have covered all of the critical vocabulary we were suggested to, I will inform our leaders of this immediately.”


——————————————————————


Director Townsend downed his fifth cup of coffee for the night as an urgent message from the translation team popped up again. It was good news this time thank goodness. He picked his phone back up and made the big call.

“Townsend again, the translators have just finished and are giving a go ahead on contact. Yes sir. Has the UN made their decision about it yet sir? Yeah that sounds like them alright, but we are still going ahead with it I expect? Of course sir.”

He hung up and sat back in his chair with relief, the project was out of his hands now. For better or for worse humanity was about to make second contact.

i2kvn5,25,2020-08-02,"Young Attorney Feeling Depressed, Alone, and Trapped",Senior_Donut5700,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i2kvn5/young_attorney_feeling_depressed_alone_and_trapped/,"Hey all, Posting here partially to vent and to perhaps partially to seek advice.  I’m really just writing this in hopes that it could be therapeutic in some capacity.  

I’m a 27-year-old attorney.  I went to law school at a T1 law school in the Midwest.  I wasn’t a great law student in terms of grades, though I did win awards in moot court competitions, participated in tons of public-interest related extracurriculars, engaged in public-interest internships, and studied abroad through a sizeable scholarship.  I hated law school 90% of the time and didn’t make a single friend there, though my time abroad was the happiest time in my life.  I went into law school still very naïve, immature, and without a real plan as to what I wanted to do with my life.  Embarrassingly, my parents encouraged me to go to law school, so I more or less did so for that reason.

I graduated from law school still without a real career plan, but I had a vague interest in serving in public-interest law.  I’d read the horror stories of “Big Law” (poor work-life balance, soullessly working for corporate overlords, toxic work relationship dynamics, etc.), and I avoided it like the plague.  The notion of truly helping others appealed to me and making an enormous amount of money was not an objective.

I currently practice as a public defender.  I never had an interest in criminal law or criminal defense, but it was the first attorney position I could land after a lengthy, arduous time spent sending out applications post-bar exam.

I’ve been a public defender for \~1.5 years now, and at this point, I hate it.  Really everything about it.  I hate negotiating with (oftentimes) backhanded, unprofessional, and lazy prosecutors.  I have similarly negative feelings towards most of my own colleagues.  I cared at first for my clients, but for the most part, no longer.  I’ve become entirely disenfranchised with the criminal justice system, as it feels very much like a game where there are no winners.  The prosecutors feign interest in seeking “justice”, while I increasingly feign interest in protecting my clients’ rights, and we all just go through the motions in an endless loop.  I’m absolutely not helping anybody in any meaningful way, and I feel so alienated when colleagues say and think otherwise.  At the end of the day, cases are disposed of in very much the same way, while my clients remained plagued with mental health and substance abuse issues and recidivism is all but assured.  And of course, my pay is about as low as one could feasibly make as an attorney, and I’m in a tremendous amount of student loan debt.

I’ve been applying for other jobs for \~6 months (though I’m certain a new job won’t magically fix my problems), and while I’ve had a few interviews, nothing has materialized.  Meanwhile, work has become increasingly loathsome, and I think it’s very likely that I’m depressed.  I’ve gained an enormous amount of weight, and I drink daily, oftentimes excessively.  The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has made things worse in every way as well, as my job and what I’m supposed to be doing is even more disorganized and chaotic than usual, my clients (as is their nature) have no notion of space and call me at all hours of the day and night (including weekends), and my caseload has also grown to a preposterous magnitude (\~150 active felony cases and counting).  I feel increasingly isolated from friends and family, and all of my energy and hope is gone.  Beyond that, I feel guilty and ashamed as I know I am no longer giving my clients my best effort.  I don’t think I’d ever kill myself, but I do think about it sometimes.

I have little expectation that many will read all of this, but if anyone does, I guess I’m curious if anyone has ever felt this way before?  Did you ever pull out of it?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?"

Demographics: Female, Mexican-American, Texas, middle class

Intended Major: Biology

SAT: Have not taken SAT and probably won’t by the looks of it, especially since I’m wanting to apply Early Action/Priority Deadline for my top schools. And because I am not going back to in-person school till end of September and my school gives the SAT for free.

Rank and GPA: I am ranked 2/311. Last time I checked it was a 4.000 and a 99.64 on a 100 point scale. (probs be a Cum Laude Honor, but not till after application season so this doesn’t really matter lol)

Coursework: Of course I’ve taken Pre-AP/Honors classes when needed. I am more of a Dual Credit/Dual Enrollment type of gal. OnRamps College Algebra (OnRamps is Dual Enrollment ran by UT Austin, they are very challenging like AP), AP World History, OnRamps Physics 1 + lab (literally so hard just like AP but managed to pull an A-), US History Dual Credit, OnRamps Precalculus, English 3 Dual Credit......Classes I’m taking this coming senior year are AP Calculus AB, English 4 Dual Credit, Government Dual Credit, OnRamps Physics 2, OnRamps Chemistry 1


Extracurriculars/Volunteering: (not going into very much detail)
-Tennis Team (4 years): both in and outside of school. varsity captain for 3 1/2 years. won many tournaments and was on my way to regionals this year till corona happened.

-Volleyball Team (1 year): freshman team. front row hitter. won district. only in it for a year because i wanted to concentrate on tennis since i’ve been playing it since i was 7.

-Student Council (2 years): secretary. we raised donations throughout the whole school for organizations like Blue Santa and the San Antonio Humane Society. we also volunteered to help wrap presents for Elf Louise (underprivileged families) this year.

-S.A.L.T (Student Athletic Leadership Team) (2 years): person chosen from every sport in both high schools in the district. i was the chosen female representative from my tennis team. this is new to the district so we didn’t do a lot.

-Tennis Instructor (1 year): i helped my former middle school coach with coaching beginner tennis players. i oversaw drills. 

-H.O.S.A (3 years): visited the Ronald McDonald house a couple of times and even volunteered to help clean and bake for the families living there. visited San Antonio Brooke Medical Center to learn/shadow about different professions the army has within the medical field

-Spanish Club (2 years): increased hispanic/latino culture through fun and social activities in school

-Superintendent Advisory Committee (1 year): shared a student voice and discuss various issues affecting the school district so we may take action and support one another within the community. only 2 people (girl and boy) from each grade level are picked each year.

-7 Cups Summer Internship (138 hours/12 wks): summer intern for 7Cups, an on-demand emotional health service and online therapy provider.

-National Honor Society: (my school only inducts members their junior year and are in it their senior year but because of corona, I haven’t been inducted so this is on hold but probably going to happen I would hope)

-Catholic Youth Ministry Group (3 years): have a blast learning about God and bringing the community together. donated to rice bowl charity (not a lot though)

-Summer Leadership 1 Workshop (4 hrs/day-1week): I don’t know how to really explain this yet lol.



*In total I have around 238 volunteer hours, 138 from internship and 100 from some of the extracurriculars

Extras/Skills (don’t know if these matter): Microsoft Word and Excel Certified, Bilingual (English and Spanish), CPR Certified...all I could think of for now lol

Letters of Rec. and Essays: Haven’t asked teachers yet but going to ask my junior year OnRamps Precalculus teacher and my 6th grade math teacher. Have been working on 2 different rough draft essays. One’s about broken friendships and how I really grew from it despite being mentally unstable and the other is about the bit of racism I faced during when I went to tennis tournaments because I was a Mexican tennis player unlike all the other white tennis players around me. I’ll use whichever comes out better obviously lol.

Schools: Looking to stay in-state (Texas). For public schools, since i’m within the top 10% of my class (top 6% for UT, I have auto admission to almost all public universities but that doesn’t guarantee my major.)
-Trinity University (top), UT Austin (top), Texas A&amp;M, Incarnate Word, TLU, Baylor, UT Dallas, UTSA...honestly don’t know what else right now haha

I'm a little over halfway through my internship, and have felt my motivation to work drop incredibly. Motivation and work ethic has never been a problem for me at previous jobs, mostly because those jobs were all in office. Working at home, without a productive environment and supervision, has left me unmotivated and kind of lazy. It's really easy for me to get distracted and start procrastinating instead of working. 

My manager and everyone on my team has been super nice, and hasn't mentioned anything yet, but I'm pretty sure they have noticed my lack of productivity in the last week or two. I'm really worried about finishing my project now, even though my lazy ass doesn't want to work. In general, I feel really bad because everyone has been super nice and I know I'm lucky to have kept my internship this year. 

If I don't finish my project, does this harm my chance at getting more internships? Does anyone have advice on working from home productively?"

2. My plan is to apply for graduation in either December or May.
3. I've done an internship in Google and have a couple of publications etc.
4. My field is systems + security hence I have programming experience in Python and Go.

I'm unsure on how to go about with the job hunt given covid? I've started doing leetcode questions recently (along with my research work) and have done about 150 Easy and 150 Medium. 

1. Should I apply for graduation in December or May? Will delaying graduation help?
2. Whats the best time to start applying for jobs?

Note, I'm an international student so I have 3 months after graduation after which I'll be deported. Hence I want to maximize my chances of finding a job. Also, I don't really care right now of finding the best possible job given the circumstances."

I haven't managed to land any internships. I've attempted to work on some simple projects myself like Tetris and Brick Breaker, but my knowledge of OOP concepts is a bit limited and I just keep getting stuck. With my degree half of the upper division classes were more math based (pure math courses , numerical analysis linear programming) and the other half were typical CS courses, however these didn't include Databases, Operating Systems, and I only was allowed to take 1 OOP class with a mediocre instructor.

My grades have never been all that great (2.5 gpa) which is partly due to the fact that I play a varsity sport which has been a massive time commitment away from academics. At this point I'm just looking for some suggestions with what to do, because it seems like I'm the only person who hasn't managed to get in any side projects or summer internships throughout my college career. Like I said, I lack applicable skills in OOP necessary to independently create a quality project on my own. On the bright side, I have developed strong algorithmic knowledge in Java and have been able to consistently solve most of the Leetcode hard questions.

With all this said, does anyone have any advice on what I should do moving forward? I've applied for 100+ positions over the last month and not a single interview request, and I'm really worried that this won't change 4 months from now when I get my degree. Thanks all."

I've taken 3 classes so far that had coding projects/hws each class had around 6 hws/projects, would it be better to upload each class's projects to individual repositories? (so all 6 of class A's hws would be in one repository etc.) Or do should I upload all the projects no matter the class into the same repository? Is either of the above possible or do I just upload all 15 hws/projects into individual repositories and like put in the readme which class it was from?

I have been feeling pretty depressed lately. I was working in India and then had to make a move overseas because spouse got a job there. I tried to find jobs there but luck was not on my side. I was into python language but was not able to find a job only in python coding. There were many jobs for backend and fullstack  technologies as it involves python but I didn't know anything else in backend.

Then I started learning front end as I knew little bit of HTML /CSS etc. But there I had to know React otherwise no one would hire me. Also, industry experience was required. Then, somehow  I found a job which wouldn't pay me anything but I took it to get some experience in front end. I worked there for 3 months as an intern, learnt little bit of React and left. Then I was on a lookout for another job and on the basis of Python got the interview and got selected but it was a contractual job in the aviation sector. There I had to learn an entirely new and a different language basically a DML. But my happiness was short lived and because of covid, I was laid off. I was pretty upset that I lost all the charm to find another one and I had to make another move to a new country , so I never bothered to look for one also.

I tried giving a shot to GMAT to go to a school. Failed there as well. I applied to a business school that require GMAT score but got rejected there. I applied to a couple of jobs here but only rejections. I am in a different country, living alone, I have to find a job as I am running out of my savings. I feel hopeless and my confidence is in negative. I don't feel like doing anything now because I am confident that it will not be fruitful at all. I feel I am good for nothing. I fear that if I don't get a job , I'll be tagged as worthless and good for nothing by the family. I cry myself to sleep. I don't know how to have a positive  outlook in life now.... I am full of despair and self-hatred. Sometimes I feel I would end my life in frustration one day.

Any suggestions on how to deal with this situation?

Thanks in advance guys!"

1: Federal Reserve Board Web Development Internship  
\- $23/hr  
\- 16-20 hrs/wk (can go full time during breaks)  
\- Stated tenure of 2 years. I do want experience in the private sector before I graduate, but I am concerned if I would be burning a bridge by leaving for another internship next summer.  
\- Will just be doing front end stuff for an intranet of a specific department.  
\- Devs I talked did bring up meetings being a large part of what they participate in  
\- Guaranteed online until at least Labor day. ""very likely"" remote through fall, but will probs eventually require a 1hr commute eventually.  


2: Very small FinTech company SWE Internship  
\- $11/hr  
\- Just a fall commitment (20hrs/week)  
\- Full stack development / more interesting sounding stuff for a B2B service that scrapes, conglomerates, and analyzes loan data for access by other firms  
\- Will be fully remote for duration  
\- Might be able to extend to spring with a negotiated pay raise.  


Which one would you guys &amp; gals recommend? I can imagine the pay delta will effect some answers, so I am curious if people who would recommend the first change their answer if the pay was the same."

This is 1/4 the time of a normal semester and I typically take about 20-21 credits per semester, so I thought this seemed normal...until I read online that a lot of people typically take between 8 and 12 credits over the summer. I'm dying at 4 credits, and I am not doing too well in my one class (I have a B right now, so I'm not failing but I'm doing extremely well either). Can someone further through college provide some insight?

i2xc10,0,2020-08-03,Advice on picking between competitive roles within a big organization,Naqibprio10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i2xc10/advice_on_picking_between_competitive_roles/,"Hey there! I'm in some dire need of direction from this amazing community of individuals in the Tech industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I am currently a rising Senior(incoming 4th year) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, pursuing a B.S. degree in Applied Computer Science with a focus on Entrepreneurship and Product Development on a **5-year track**. This summer after my original plans for an internship at Rockwell Automation got canceled, I was able to leverage my LinkedIn network to secure an SDE internship at an Asset-Management Firm, Alliance Bernstein.  

Apart from, I am the CEO of a tech company I founded last summer. Pre-COVID era, we developed IoT devices to combat the drinking epidemic at colleges that were deployed to local bars. However, as that doesn't align with our views with everything that is going on, we recently acquired a Hosting Reseller/Web Development company to contribute to our new project- help small-local business' transition to an online presence.

Okay, that was a lot of background. But I believe it would be crucial to understand my background to understand where I am struggling.  As I am career hunting, I am trying to figure out what would be (relatively) the best trajectory for me. I would love for my full-time position to utilize as much as my past tech and business domain knowledge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had a meeting with a Google Representative recently and I was given the option of applying to **Analytical Lead** or **Customer Solution Engineer** upon graduation based on my desire to stay within the tech and business space. I looked over the job posting of both the roles to understand the tasks, and I must say- the CSE roles seem a tad bit more interesting than the AL role; it also pays more. However, posts in the Reddit community mentioned that as CSE is part of the GTech within Google, their stock compensation, and ""prestige"" in the organization might be a little lower. Not to mention, maneuvering to Engineering positions are a little bit harder as well if not within Google regular track. With my interest in Software Engineering, I know at some point in my career, I will want to steer my career more towards Product Engineering or Product management roles. 

My other option is to join the Associate Program at Alliance Bernstein upon graduation, and although the pay might be a little lower, I would receive amazing mentorship from already established connections. Then continue climbing up the corporate ladder and as soon as I get comfortable, try to move to the next chapter of my professional career with a different company(or my own).

Now my question is, am I not considering something which might leave me at ""awe"" once I join either of the positions? What are some things you have considered in the past to make a decision between different competitive roles?

Thank you for making it through this long post-I wish there were some sweet treats waiting for you at this finish line. At this moment, all I can offer is my LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajmain/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajmain/)  :)  

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much in advance!"

I originally came into the school as an intended physics major (with no coding experience) but decided to try out CS during my first semester. I loved what I learned in CS, but because I literally didn't get how pointers actually work until 1 months in, I bombed my CS and EE classes and got a B B B+ in them. (also pledging a frat didn't help at all)

I decided to step up my performance the next semester and I managed to get an A A A- in all my CS, EE, and science coursework. This now puts me at a \~3.5 GPA, which I'm glad about the upward trend, but at the same time worried about since it might not help me pass the resume screening at FANG internships. Especially Google because they ask for your GPA.

I know this sub emphasizes how GPAs don't matter too much (and that experiences matter much more) but after seeing my friends who secured internships last year at Apple, Amazon, Google etc.. have GPAs of at least 3.8, it made me a bit worried about my 3.5 GPA.

I do have two AI/ML related projects (very basic, only uses decision trees and alpha-beta pruning), a lot of front-end experience, and some back-end experience if that helps.."

Background: Computer Science major graduated. I did start previewing Net+ back in early 2019 but did not crack down hard until 2020. I've had help desk/desktop support/computer technician experience. I worked alongside my supervisor who managed servers when I did my internship so I had a little bit of exposure to networking.

&amp;#x200B;

My fire activated when ITProTV (shout out to them Wes Bryan) allowed access to their content free for a weekend. They were very thorough on their explanations, I loved their off-the script on the spot setting up or performing demonstrations. I personally liked it when they messed up he would troubleshoot it on the spot which helped me connect the dots together on a concept.

&amp;#x200B;

Materials I used: 

1. Professor Messer's Network+ Course and all the study groups.
2. ITProTV (only for the free access-3 day weekend) I would use them again but they are pricey
3. Todd Lammle Network N10-007
4. Exam Cram N10-007
5. ExamCompass to refresh on topics
6. Jason Dion 6 Practice Exams

Just like what professor messer said print out the exam objectives you will need to be able to explain every objective without using notes or googling. If you're able to do so you should be able to do fine. Like what others said I felt like I was failing the entire time when i got to the screen after the survey it said CONGRATULATIONS.

If anyone has any questions I'll be more than happy to help them. I'm going to take a short break and move onto Security+!"

Some backstory. I work and get paid from a company that has created and acquired several other smaller companies and now am the go-to IT guy for these new companies. I started with the main company in their second year as an intern and have been with the company for nearly 3 years now and have probably gained some trust from my CEO during these years.

Our most recent acquisition required me to migrate all of the newly acquired company's local server data to join our sizable (possibly oversized imo) DropBox corporate account. This was done about 9 months ago and things went without a hitch. That is, until today...

&amp;#x200B;

**CEO:** ""Hey frzn, all or most of the migrated DropBox files that you transferred are not accessible. Please check on that and let us know the status ASAP""

**Me (visibly flustered from my WFH desk):** ""Okay I'll take a look and see what the issue might be""

**Me:** *Checks permissions settings and sees that all of those who need access already have access granted.* *~~Literally didn't do anything~~* 

**Me:** ""Is there a specific folder in question?  From first glance, I can see the files just fine and can confirm that we all have the same permission settings. As a reminder, the files that were migrated are all within a folder titled ""Migration Files"".

i36jns,3,2020-08-03,Can I make it as a data engineer with a different engineering degree?,PlasticExit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i36jns/can_i_make_it_as_a_data_engineer_with_a_different/,"Hi everyone,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while to get some affirmation, but I've finally racked up the courage to ask the question myself.

I am currently going to my 4th year of Civil Engineering at a top school. I have never really found myself attracted to most topics in Civil Engineering, however, I eventually found transportation engineering within civil which is really heavily data based.

Fast forward and I have taken many online courses (mostly off of udemy) on web dev and python for data, been a transportation data research assistant with a top professor, a data scientist/ML research intern for the same professor analyzing datasets and creating housing simulations(python jupyter, pandas, numpy, sklearn, data visualization libraries, etc.) , and a Software Engineering Intern focused on data for a different research team at my University (basically I'm making data pipelines using python, spark, sql, aws), however, I'm not really getting much exposure to best practices as my supervisor isn't the most.. passionate person.

In a month, I'm going to be starting as a consulting engineer and product development intern at an infrastructure firm for a co-op and I suspect that it will be somewhat data and programming related but a lot more civil engineering related. I have to make a decision of whether to do this for a complete 12 months, or cut it off at 8 months and look for a software engineering/data engineering internship for next summer.  I really would like to do this, because I feel as if I have found my passion, and I actually enjoy learning data intensive and mathematical concepts.

My question is, would I be a competitive applicant at decent companies for data engineering internships for next summer, given my experience, and granted I keep improving my portfolio? Is data engineering even a field where there are many entry level jobs? And finally, would it be feasible, in your opinion, that I keep pursuing a field in which I don't have the suited degree, even after University?

TL;DR: civil engineering student from a good school with a decent amount of data related experience, need to make a decision on whether to pursue data engineering or civil and would like advice on the data engineering field feasibility for myself or how to improve myself as an applicant.

Sorry for the super loaded post, and thank you very much for your time :)"

I am still at my first job out of school, and I am working on a full stack using .NET and Angular. My internship also had me working with C#.

I worked with Java for 4 years in school, and Python for 2 years. 

I am relocating this summer and have had a few phone calls with recruiters and HR people to talk about open positions in my new area. A lot of the jobs that I have been contacted about are Java positions. When I tell them that I am currently working with C#, they say that they’re not interested because they want a Java Developer and not a .NET developer.

Is it common to get “trapped” into working with the language that your first job uses because companies only want a certain kind of developer?

This is frustrating because I feel like I am less of a “.NET developer” and more of an all around software developer. Not only because the languages aren’t all that different syntactically, but because the core concepts of programming, application design, etc aren’t language specific.

How can I expand my opportunities to include jobs that use different languages?"

I (24 F) am feeling really sad, overwhelmed and stressed by my current situation. Since 2y my boyfriend has been ill because of a heart disease. He couldn't go out of the house much, but still we could occasionally go for walks or shop for groceries once a week. Unfortunately, since december 2019 he has been developping other problems such as light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, intorelance to physical activities such as walking around and hasn't been able to eat properly for months. The result is that he cannot leave the house (or even his room), cannot take care of himself anymore and basically just sits in his room hoping things will improve. I am not here for any medical advice for him, I am here for myself. I also recently graduated as a vet and started an internship with an extremely busy schedule. Long days, though conversations, high pressure, need I say more.. The combination of my job with him being in such a bad and hopeless place (there is no prospect at this point for him to get better) is slowly weighing really hard on me. Taking care of him, searching for solutions while working 11-12h/day. And the covid-19 situation gives it a 'pleasant' extra dimension of not seeing friends. I am not a great talker about such heavy feelings via text or phone so I usually just suck it up and act like everything is sort of okay when it is really not.

I plan to do one more Internship in December.

So that's 3 in total.

Working on an AI project with a startup founded by an Indian MIT professor. The startup will be providing certificate on successful completion of the project. 

Regarding bad GRE score, the night before I had panic attack followed by only a 5 hours of sleep. I knew I could do well on Quants but I was sleep deprived. 


Should I apply despite low GRE? I'm just done with this GRE. It'll mess my brain if I study anymore"

i390l2,7,2020-08-03,Is a Civil Engineering to Data Engineer Transition even possible?,PlasticExit,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/i390l2/is_a_civil_engineering_to_data_engineer/,"Hi everyone,

I would like to ask the data engineers on this subreddit for some advice and wisdom:

I am currently going to my 4th year of Civil Engineering at a top school. I have never really found myself attracted to most topics in Civil Engineering, however, I eventually found transportation engineering and modelling within civil which is really heavily data, probability, math, and stats based.

Fast forward and I have taken many online courses (mostly off of udemy) on web dev and python for data, been a **transportation data research assistant** with a top professor, a **Data scientist/Machine Learning research intern** for the same professor analyzing huge datasets and creating housing simulations(python jupyter, pandas, numpy, sklearn, data visualization libraries, etc.) , and a **Software Engineering Intern focused on data** for a different research team at my University (basically I'm making data pipelines using python, spark, sql, aws), however, I'm not really getting much exposure to best practices as my supervisor isn't the most.. passionate person.

In a month, I'm going to be starting as a consulting engineer and product development intern at a Tech and infrastructure firm for a co-op and I suspect that it will be somewhat data and programming related (supervisor made sure I knew python) but a lot more civil engineering related. I have to make a decision of whether to do this for a complete 12 months, or cut it off at 8 months and look for a software engineering/data engineering internship for next summer. I really would like to find a data job, because I feel as if I have found my passion, and I actually enjoy learning data intensive and mathematical concepts.

My question is, would I be a competitive applicant at decent companies for data engineering internships for next summer, given my experience, and granted I keep improving my portfolio? Is data engineering even a field where there are many entry level jobs? And finally, would it be feasible, in your opinion, that I keep pursuing a field in which I don't have the suited degree, even after University, and even though I have a really strong civil eng background? 

TL;DR: civil engineering student from a good school with a decent amount of data related experience, need to make a decision on whether to pursue data engineering or civil and would like advice on the data engineering field feasibility for myself or how to improve myself as an applicant.

Sorry for the super loaded post, and thank you very much for your time :)"

Hi! I'm currently a rising senior in high school and I was wondering what my chances are at the \^ schools. 

I'm not a hundred percent sure what I want to do with life, but most likely I'm thinking computational bio major (or like neuro something) and premed classes.

No Hooks - 

SAT: 1560 (ACT is 34, but I'm not sending it)

UW GPA - 4.0

Class Rank - 1/619

IB Candidate

AP Scores: Calc AB - 5, APUSH - 5

Awards: Community Leadership for Volunteering, Two-State Debate Title Finishes (the sophomore year, 4th junior year), State speech title, Two Regionals Awards, StateCircuit Tournament (the top debaters picked by the coaches debate, 4th place, 8th speaker sophomore year), volunteer of the year (two years in a row) at my volunteering place, Debate All American, Asian American Leader (local Asian community), Local Youth Leader award from business, Local Hero (idk some scholarship from my school district)

Extracurriculars Sorted by Time Commitment

Speech and Debate (varsity 4 years) - Competed on the circuit level, qualified to multiple nationals tournaments every year. Finished top 64 as a sophomore last year at nationals. and top 40 in policy debate (got screwed smh) this year (President of club senior year). Spent 11 weeks combined at summer camps. I commit roughly 15 hours a week to debate aside from competitions themselves. Several associate projects.

Volunteer (140 hrs and intern at an Autism facility. Volunteering includes teaching communication skills to children and developing their motor skills in a latch-key situation. For a special project with them, I held like multiple mini-debate tournaments which they loved. The internship includes a lot of research studies with the facility, preparing material for conferences, and community reach-outs where we educate other school paras on new ways to interact with children on the spectrum in line with new research. I don't actually present at the conferences because it typically conflicts with debate tournaments, but I present at the local visits. (8-12 hrs a week during the school year, 16-24hrs during the summer)

Started an online summer school because of COVID for children with autism (25-30 kids, meet a couple of times a week and get interesting people to come present with to the children. I also come up with activities to help them build communication skills. Have several professionals I convinced to volunteer  and professors to discuss their research - about 20 hrs a week)

Software Development start-up (it's just me right now, lol) that works to create free software for children with autism. Beta version of the second app is right now being used 5 kids every day to help them communicate. The first app is still being tested by 100 kids, I don't think they like it tho ngl,)

Intern for a hospital. I do a lot of lab analysis for them and prepare material (such as presentations) for when we have medical conferences. Was gonna present in Italy in April but we know what happened. (Like 5-6 hours in the week or two leading up to the conference).

&amp;#x200B;

Quiz Bowl (varsity 4 years, state team, regional team, qualified to nationals, won city twice, and captain, science specialist)

Science Olympiad (6 years so far since middle school, multiple states and regionals awards, VP next year of the club)

And then there's other filler clubs and stuff like NHS, NSHS, etc. but they don't really matter.

Essays/LORS

I've been working on my college essays. I don't think I'm in a position to say if they're good or not, but I'm fairly certain they'll be grammatically correct.

LORS - speech and debate teacher (we're tight and spent a lot of time with them) calc teacher (we're alright. I don't know if it will be out of the park like debate teachers). I could also get one from the CEO of the company I have an internship at because she's also my director.

Thanks for your time!"
i3bv1y,3,2020-08-03,"How do I diplomatically tell my boss ""I need you to get the ball rolling on the career advancement that was discussed when you hired me or I'm going to quit"" ?",nobody2000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i3bv1y/how_do_i_diplomatically_tell_my_boss_i_need_you/,"I will try to be concise as possible. 

I was hired, agreeing to pivot my career to work to grow and turn around a struggling company, and grow it into a real leader in our industry. 

In my time at the company, I have built and supported strategy, built plans and tools for our salesforce, and shaped narratives and sales pitch presentations that have allowed us to keep business of $25M+ and grown the business another $50M+, while also pulling us out of the death spiral, going from the #4 brand in our category to the #2. When we have a big customer pitch, I'm always the guy that goes and does 90% of the talking.

I am a high performer, and I have been told as much by my boss and his bosses. 

***

When I was hired, I was told that I would be a member of a team that would ""harness big data"" (ugh). I would take my experience in our industry along with my technical and management skills to be on the team, build it bigger, and to work to grow our sales and refine our bottom line. 

I was told that in one year we would focus on that, but for year one, I would focus on pulling us out of the death spiral. 

After a year, we began focusing on the team, and suddenly, the would-be team leader got an offer elsewhere. Meanwhile, I have demonstrated that I can build the tools, roll them out, and lead/influence others to do the same, and that I would have made a better leader of that team. I communicated as much.

My boss asked me what I need. I laid out a subordinate's job description (in detail - something we could publish as-is) and I laid out my would-be job description. 

This plan continues to be stalled. COVID is one of the reasons, but our industry is having a record year because of COVID, and our company is posting better numbers than ever. We have had more opportunities, and my time to focus on strategy has dried up as I am stuck with entire weeks of day-to-day work, along with those stupid requests from high on for information that an intern or entry level should be pulling.

I already have updated my resume. My linkedin is in top shape, and I have premium LinkedIn turned on. I have been carefully jumping back into my network of colleagues, as I know that word does travel. Regardless, I will jump or use another offer as leverage to get what I want, or to leave for a better opportunity. 

But I don't have that offer yet. 

***

**How do I have the conversation with my boss ""Look - you will be hard pressed to find someone who can do what I do with the strategic knowledge, the industry knowledge, and the company knowledge if I leave - and you'll never find someone that will accept what you pay me now. I was led to believe that there were career development plans for me that have not come to fruition. I have reduced costs, made our data systems more efficient, and I've grown/sustained over $75M worth of business. When is this going to happen, and what do I need to do to make sure it does?""**"

Life has been hard since COVID. I was a college senior, with an internship lined up in Chicago, and big plans. 

Then all of a sudden everything changes. No graduation ceremony after graduating, no internship anymore, everything fell apart.

It’s been so hard, to be living throughout all of this. I feel like everything has been stripped away from me. All of my accomplishments seem unimportant and I am struggling financially now after 4 years of stress. 

I feel broke, I am struggling with supporting myself while trying to find a job and it’s becoming so much. 

I am feeling depressed and so beat up. Having to ask people for money just to be able to eat is just so embarrassing and it’s taken such a toll on me. 

COVID has ruined my life. It’s taken everything away from me. I don’t know what else to do. I need help. Mentally, financially, spiritually. Please pray for me."

My son is 22 and still lives at home.  Until he hit age 18 we had a great relationship and we talked all the time.  He moved out to go to college when he was 18 and then everything changed.

It was slow at first but somewhere along the way it just died out altogether.  He graduated from college and I helped him get an internship that has turned into a solid job.  He also has a very healthy relationship that has been going on for about a year.  He is doing very well for himself.

However, when he is home he stays in his room with the door shut.  Whenever we knock on the door to tell him dinner is ready, or to ask him to take out the trash (literally his only chore), he is very short and upset with us.  It's almost like he feels like those few moments when we do interact with him are unbearable.

I've just chalked it up to him growing up, if only to give myself a reason not to be upset.  The reason I am writing now is because tonight he ate dinner and didn't say anything the entire time.  I asked him if anything was wrong and he said that he was just tired.  But the problem with that is it's currently 12:30AM and I can hear him laughing and having a great time with his friends.

I long to hear that laugh again when the two of us talk.  It breaks my heart to hear him on the other side of that door having a great time but knowing that I haven't had that kind of connnection with him for years.

How can I handle this situation without pushing him further away.

Thanks."

i3gunx,744,2020-08-04,Advice on Getting Out of Tutorial Hell From a DevOps Engineer,bttrdvlpr_dot_io,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i3gunx/advice_on_getting_out_of_tutorial_hell_from_a/,"Apologies for the text wall. I talk about my own experiences quite a bit, so I hope this doesn't come off as a self promotion. Links posted are intended to provide context, but more than happy to remove them.

There's been a lot of helpful posts on how to get out of tutorial hell, so I thought I'd try to contribute to the topic.

Background: my current position is a Senior DevOps Engineer, but I have a few years of experience as a Software Engineer before I transitioned. My very first job was remote, and after a little less than five years in the field, I get to work with great technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform everyday.

I remember struggling with rejections and moments during interviews where I felt really stupid and embarassed. I used to have a spreadsheet of all the jobs I applied to which consisted of about 180 jobs in 2 months. Applying would take up as much time as a fulltime job sometimes! My GPA during university was average, but I had won a few hackathons and held positions as an intern and TA. All that, even with a college degree, I wasn't really getting any callbacks that resulted in much.

I wouldn't really know why some of the things I learned in tutorilas were important, or how they were used. Aimlessly dong tutorials and putting out repo after repo in my Github wasn't really working out, no matter how green my Github heatmap was. 

I tried to apply advice that I see in a lot of posts here, along with some advice that people said not to do. I'd go through tutorials on projects and extend them a little bit, incorporate the knowledge into a project, and try to learn so many different things which would result in little depth in one technology/tool.

For me, my most impactful project ended up being a very basic HTTP server that consisted of code recipes that I wrote. In case you were curious, [here](https://github.com/Xercoy/Golang-Recipes) is the repo. I removed the website as it's insecure but I can send it privately or post a screenshot if you'd like to see.

Creating such an app truly forced me to develop on my own, applying knowledge gained from a tutorial but not really following one. I followed tutorials on HTTP requests all the time as it was important for backend engineering, but I truly understood it when I had to write one for myself with goals/requirements for the project that I defined. I wrote tests for the app too.

Then, I thought of ways to put the application online. Not via Heroku or Netlify or other hosted solutions, but to try and truly understand how to get an application on the internet. This led me to learning about servers, or virtual instances that you could rent hourly that were 'on the internet'. 

I setup a Linux VPS (Virtual Private Server) for $5/month, downloaded my app and started it up, then bought a domain name and modified DNS records to point to the server's IP address. It was insecure, but it worked All of this was done from tutorials hosted by Digital Ocean. Hell yeah! I put it at the top of my resume.

The interview for my first job was a phone call. After the formalities and personal questions, the 3 people on the call looked at that project and asked me about it. I explained why I created the app and how I created and deployed it. I showed them where the app's HTTP and unit tests were and mentioned that I was currently in the middle of rolling out HTTPS support. 

The interviewers asked a few more questions on how I implemented some stuff, and then the call ended. There was no coding challenge or any questions on data structures and algorithms. Rather than a full time position, they offered me a contract position to see how I would fair for 3 months, with consideration for a full time job. I busted my ass, got the fulltime job, and kept going.

My takeaways from this, in addition to all of the good advice shown on this subreddit:

- Focus on Professional Level Competency: as a web developer, understanding how frontend components make requests to APIs or extrernal components was key. If you were hired as a frontend developer, some of your responsibilities would legit include tasks that involve doing EXACTLY that.
   

  As a backend developer writing APIs, understanding how those requests come in and knowing how to respond was my bread and butter. For me, communication was through HTTP, so I created projects that would truly force me to learn request types like GET, POST, PUT, etc. 


  ""To-Do list"" level apps that store information only in the frontend should only serve as a stepping stone to utilizing those skills to building something more comprehensive.

  

  Additionally, including tests in your projects are a great way to make them more sophisticated. I've worked at places that would not accept code unless it was accompanied by tests.

  

- Market well: The recipe webpage I created was basically my portfolio. It gave interviewers a quick way to see what I could do and what I was all about. No need to dig through dozens of Hello World repos on my profile. For my second job, I was the only non senior engineer on the team. I had to keep up with people with years, even decades of experience. I created a portfolio page and emailed it to the manager, who later said, ""You know, including that web page was a realllly good thing."" [Here's](https://coreyprak.me/golang/) that page if anyone was curious. I did this with basic HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap.

  

  Having a green heatmap by committing often is a great way to show people how hard and long you've been working.

  

  Having open source contributions usually earns some kinda brownie points with whoever sees them, and it's a great way to convey comptetency to interviewers by proving that you understand GIt/Github enough to write code, open a Pull request to get your changes reviewed and merged, etc. That flow of contributing is basically what people do professionally. I mention my open source PRs during interviews as often as I can.

  

  Contributing to projects promotes collaboration. If your PR is merged, it proves you're knowledgeable enough about the project or technology to make it better. Some PRs that I open are reviewed by people who are wayyyy more experienced than me. In a way, you can look at that as free coaching! People in the FOSS world are generally welcoming to PRs and willing to work with you.

  

- Take Notes: I should listen to my own advice, especially on this one, and I swear I do this more often than not. A Software Engineer I worked with who I really respect once told me, ""taking notes on things you've done is like a love letter to yourself.""

  

   As someone who has grown by doing much and is constantly being challenged, sometimes I spend a LOT of time solving solutions to problems that don't occur often, sometimes never again. When I didn't have notes, I'd invest a ridiculously unnecessary amount of time into knowing the same thing. So dumb.

  

  If you've got notes, you've got your time saving love letter to your future self. You can also use them as the basis for documentation, something that I do often to ensure that I can share knowledge with my team. 

  

  I used to learn something, take notes, then upload them to a notes repo on Github or release it as a blog post. Having something to upload or share helps people and advertises my hustle. Win win! 

- Collaborate: learning with people on a similar journey or getting context from people who are already where you want to be can be extremely helpful. It's all about giving yourself the right kind of stimulus. 

One last detail that I'd like to add is that I think that one powerful way of setting yourself apart from the pack is learning a little bit of devops. I'm sure that the extra devops stuff that I did for my personal project helped, and the personal interest in understanding things at that level is actually how I jumped into Devops fulltime. Happy to answer questions on this, and let me also say that there's many other things aside from devops that you can learn in order to stand out.

Definitely didn't intend for this post to get this long. I'll end it here but I'd be happy to answer any questions and welcome any additional advice and critique. Hopefully this helped. 

Keep going!

I might be vastly over-rating or under-rating myself, please don't get offended either way, I just have no clue how competitive I am for the highest colleges. Anyways, thank you in advance.

Intended major: Computer Science \[ + Educational Studies Program\]

Demographics: Indian, 17M, from a highly competitive private school in Georgia

ACT: 35 \[36M, 35R, 34E, 33S\], still waiting on scores from most recent retake

SAT: N/A, I did really bad so I don't think I want to report it

PSAT: 1490 in 9th and 1520 in 11th

SAT II's: 800 Math 2, 800 Chem, 800 Physics

APs: 9 APs \[5 Spanish Lang, 5 Chem, 5 CSA, 3 English Lit, 3 English Lang, 5 Bio, 5 Calc BC, 4 Euro, 3 Spanish Lit\], and I plan to take Physics C, Stat, and US History as a senior next year

Courseload: See APs above, all other courses are maximum rigor (i.e. honors, etc.)

GPA: My school does GPA's on a wonky weighted 100 point scale, so I'm not sure if putting my GPA would actually mean anything. If you need it though, I can definitely post it, just ask. I've gotten 3 B's so far, in Euro, English, and Math(yikes). I kinda got screwed over by virtual school, but that probably doesn't matter in the colleges' eyes, but I feel terrible about it

Clubs: Math team \[president\], Competitive Pokemon Club (no laughing I take this very seriously xd) \[president\], Science bowl, Varsity Squash (the sport, not the vegetable, also no I am not good enough to get recruited), North Georgia Math Team (which goes to math tournaments across the country like HMMT), also I did band for like 5 years and made a couple of honor bands / All-State(s) but I had to quit last year :(

Awards: 3x AIME qualifier, I've also won a lot of math tournaments but I don't know if they're significant enough to mention, I've won a couple of squash tournaments too, various Honor Rolls, etc. Basically, I do have a lot of rewards but I'm probably not like top 100 ranked nationally in anything that colleges seem to like (maybe 1000 in math, idk)

ECs: see clubs, I've done internships at various education-related companies which fits well with the program I'm interested at Yale, and I also have a non-profit (please don't groan yet) that is also related to education. I would post a link but I don't want to completely doxx myself, but just know that it's a pretty legit deal (i.e. it's not the standard ""oh yeah I have a nonprofit but my parents do everything"" type of nonprofit)

Essays: I haven't started

LoR: CSA Teacher (pretty strong, well-written), Math team coach / math teacher (very strong, but idk how well she can write), and school college counselor (don't really know her very well, but she can definitely write very well)

Colleges: Primarily Yale, but I'd also be interested in my chances at other t20's like Brown, Penn, CMU.

Thank you!"
i3lrge,88,2020-08-04,Tips from a recent UCF grad to incoming Biology majors,softdiccasian,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/i3lrge/tips_from_a_recent_ucf_grad_to_incoming_biology/,"Hey guys,

so recently I graduated from UCF as a General Biology B.S.  I have a few tips for incoming Biology majors. I've made a ton of mistakes over time and I hope the mistakes I made won't be repeated by anyone coming in. 

Disclaimers: In my opinion, the UCF Biology Department is one of the greatest departments within the campus in terms of faculty caring for student quality of life and future. It's when you're taking courses from the Physics and Chemistry department to complete requirements for other courses that things start to look bleak. Trust me, I know how some of you are going to feel about Organic Chemistry or College Physics. 

Anyways... 

1) Although I speak my praises about the Biology department, getting a Biology degree in itself is kinda useless for finding work straight out of college. Sorry, that's just the reality of things, in this day and age, a B.S. doesn't get you a job instantly unless you're a B.S. in Engineering. But the B.S. in Biology isn't useless in pursuing professional school or grad school. 

FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL THOUGH... you're going to want to really look into what each UCF professor in the Bio Department is doing in terms of past/current research and see if it's something you're interested in. Unfortunately for me, I've been an off-and-on premed, so I was looking at the wrong major for my interests. At UCF, the Biology program is very ecology, plant and animal (genetic/behavior) based, so if you're looking to get into grad school at UCF, be weary of this. 

2) While you're getting through the 2nd/3rd year of your degree, you should try to hone down on getting a research assistant position or an internship related to your degree. TRUST ME. You could be getting great grades and all, but you need that strong extracurricular to build a strong rap for graduate school or other research opportunities. I wish I had known or thought to do this earlier, because this could make things easier to get into grad school. ALSO if you're even just looking into part time jobs related to the biology degree, having the internship or research assistant position is great hands on experience to boost your resume. 

3) STUDY STUDY STUDY. Science courses aren't a joke! Yes, you need a life outside of class and you need to socialize, but you need to study to keep that GPA up for grad or professional school. Don't blow this shit off. Chemistry courses at UCF can be a massive pain in the ass for example, and the only way you're going to do well is if you practice regularly. Build your support group too! Make friends outside of the major or else you'll be stuck talking about the same old shit and increasing your own anxiety.

Remember, the chemistry/physics courses are essentially weed-out courses. If you can do well enough in these chemistry/physics courses, you're set for any other incoming challenges the Biology program can throw at you. 

4) When you're looking for courses to sign up for the coming semester, you should be checking the [ratemyprofessors.com](https://ratemyprofessors.com) for every professor and scouring through the reddit and even facebook to see who has taken these courses with these professors. You want to be prepared for any difficulties the professor may throw at you, GRANTED, you should also take some things said with a huge grain of salt. For example, one professor may be a pain in the ass for one person but you may be a huge fan of how they structure their courses and exams. 

5) When you get your general chemistry class out of the way, make sure to sign up for those labs ASAP. They fill up quickly and you don't want any delays in not taking them. You see them, sign the hell up for them. 

6) When you're facing difficulties in class or you need help, talk to the professors! The bio department professors in general are extremely caring and helpful. I have not met a single one who was condescending (except maybe one professor) and was so unwilling to help their own students. They want you to succeed and get into bigger slots in life, so don't be shy!"

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get much internship experience before graduation, so I had trouble finding a job. In the end, though, I found a role as a junior software developer at a small company in my city. However, the salary is pretty low ($70-75K) and the ratings from employees about nepotism, the company being disorganized, etc. are pretty harsh. I mostly took it because I need a job to get experience and move on, and because I finally got an offer after almost a year of looking.

I know I’m only a junior dev, but I could be doing a lot better. Most of my peers are making double my salary straight out of college, so I probably need to step my game up. I plan to continue to study for interviews for bigger and better companies (who will hopefully start responding to my applications after 6 months). 

I do feel somewhat guilty for taking a job offer I know I will have to leave soon because it’s not exactly what I want, but I basically had to settle. So far everyone seems nice, and I do think that this is a good role for me provided the extensive training. However, if I don’t see some sort of big promotion that vastly increases my already comparatively low salary and good opportunities for growth, I’ll have to leave very soon. So what do y’all recommend as a course of action so I can meet my goals smoothly?"

I want to guide her with as much quality advice as i can since this can be a big change. 

My girlfriend had performed extremely well at her last 2 companies. Both of which are niche retailers going under. She studied fashion merchandising and has her bachelors from one of the top universities in the country for this industry. Held internships in Manhattan, studied abroad in Florence, etc. 

She has 4+ yrs experience as a merchandising coordinator. She procures product for her companies for upcoming sales, product development, cost analysis, planning, reporting, sales analysis, etc. She’s Extremely focused and hardworking as you’d expect me to say.  

Though she has been in retail, she wants to move to a new industry, but feels limited due to her only working in the retail space and thinks her background being stated as fashion and retail limits her. She does not work in stores, but corporate offices. 

Obviously with the times, retail isn’t performing as we’d hope, and though her degree states fashion, I believe the skills and experience she’s had can rocket her into a new industry, allowing her to set herself up for a better career. 

With this specific background, could you offer some guidance to us to assist her on her career search? Happy to provide additional details, info, etc. in the comments.

i3n4gz,41,2020-08-04,Fake Goals - My Point of View,MBAPrepCoachcom,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/i3n4gz/fake_goals_my_point_of_view/," 

A lot of admissions consultants advise that you have a “stated goal” when applying for business school, but not knowing what you truly want can hurt your success in both b-school and life.

If you have very pie in the sky unrealistic dreams you are setting out to achieve, this might be advisable for some. My first client was a periodontist who wanted to get into a hedge fund. It was a status thing. I put the kibosh on that.

But now that I’m more experienced, I choose clients who are willing to put in the work to arrive at their real goals. I am a certified career coach and able to get curious about my clients, ask the right questions, observe, probe, and provide research assignments that help them get more clarity on the “what do I do with my life” question.

For example, one of my clients headed to HBS this fall (hopefully in person!) said that by doing this exercise I “saved him from a lifetime of unhappiness.” He was so focused on stating a CONSERVATIVE GOAL it was oppressive: the original plan was to just climb the ranks in Oil and Gas at his current company. Get an MBA from HEC; most of the executives are French and they went there.

After doing more exploration, turns out he had a business concept the company paid consultants one million Euros to develop but failed, without him being there to implement it. Thankfully, he is OK to reuse what he created from an IP standpoint, and that now is the basis of his business concept.

Throughout the process of our work together, we developed his business plan, his pitch, we have a lot hammered out already. He will hit the ground running at HBS and be ready to speak with investor.

He has no obvious dotted lines with entrepreneurship, but we were able to provide multiple anecdotes to show how he takes an entrepreneurial approach to solving problems at work. Even in a very conservative, lock-step industry like Oil and Gas.

Believe me, he was panicky about all this because he wanted to stick to something safe. A lot of people do. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS. No one is inspired by safe — and that matters as much as being practical. You need to stand out, excite them, to have them root for you. His business idea is already vetted for profitability and will also have a very positive environmental impact.

&gt;**A few reasons I feel icky about “stated” goals.**

**Opportunity cost**: you are researching what looks good to the admissions committees while you could be researching, gaining clarity and momentum on a real career goal that would be both realizable and very fulfilling.

**School selection**: if your goal is fake, then you are building everything around that. So, for example, you might pick schools strong for finance recruitment when you are actually interested in tech. But to make the damn story work, you are forced to pick finance schools. And to show “fit,” then, you must research clubs, classes and ways to contribute that will make the fake goal seem convincing.

**Motivation**: the admissions application process is very long and tiring. You need to be propelled by the passion of pursing your real goal; focusing on something that “lights you up” rather than what “sounds good” is going to provide you with a source of energy that wouldn’t otherwise be there. Authenticity inspires effort, persistence.

**Passion**: how you write about your goals, the words you choose for your essays, comes across energetically. You are dealing with a very savvy audience. And if you are admitted — and decide to forgo an income for one or two years, and take on \~$200K in debt, without having a goal that lights you up, well, what is that all about?

**Interviews**: similar to the above. If you are trying to manufacture enthusiasm for a goal that your admissions consultant pushed on you, THIS WILL TELEGRAPH ENERGETICALLY. You are basically lying and think about how it feels when you know someone is lying to you. I mean, you might change your goal once you are in business school, that happens. But intentionally misrepresenting your goals to an interviewer, in my opinion, is hard to pull off successfully. Especially if you have zero poker face like me.

&gt;**YOUR NARRATIVE MATTERS**

My client’s GMAT was a 720, 47 quant, white male, who is in no way underrepresented. When he received an interview offer from Yale so fast, given these stats, I wondered why and shared his profile with a fellow admissions consultant, SOM grad, who said, “I see nothing exceptional about his profile. I have no explanation as to why they prioritized this invite.”

Myself, I sincerely believe that his inspiring story was a big reason he got interviews for 7 out of 7 top 10 business schools, zero dings and he is turning down scholarships from MIT and other schools to head to HBS. He was able to excite and inspire the adcom.

**The benefits don’t end when the application process is over.**

&gt;**KNOWING YOUR REAL GOAL INCREASES YOUR B-SCHOOL ROI**

**Leverage your time in business school for good use; your future happiness and fulfillment**. Make good use of your \~$200K to actually improve your life and not just recruit for 3 different industries, spending 2 years in coffee chats, at the expense of getting an actual education or building your network — only to be ultimately stuck with a huge bill. It should not cost you $200K to get a job.

My point is, it’s well worth the time and effort to research yourself, your passions, and come up with a goal that is both exciting and will excite the adcom. I can’t tell you the difference it makes.

&gt;**YOUR GOAL IS AN INTENTION– WHEN YOU SHARE IT, OTHERS CONSPIRE FOR YOUR SUCCESS**

HBS pairs you with an alumni buddy once you are shortlisted. My client’s official HBS alumni “buddy” brought a friend with her to their meeting which seemed initially very awkward and insulting, but guess what? After discussing his goal, his business idea, the friend actually offered to connect him with an entrepreneur who has a similar business model for a pre-MBA internship. That was pre-Corona unfortunately, but they are working out a way to do this remotely.

This is what happens when you land upon a real goal that excites people! The world conspires to help you. ADCOM INCLUDED. People want to be part of these things, it’s fun and exciting for others to connect you with resources that will propel you forward. All this momentum will help him make good use of his time at HBS.

Start working on your MBA applications early, accounting for time for your admissions consultant to get to know you very well. To figure out your goal. To research your goal. Time to craft the language you will be using at school admissions events, essays, interviews and ultimately — to pitch for funding!

Because I knew my client well, coupled with keen intuition, I pitched this idea to him and held him forward. I knew he was qualified for the path of a serial entrepreneur, if we brought out the reasons why — I knew that entrepreneurship was his true path. He is holding on to a gem of an idea that could improve the world, and he is the exact right person to bring it to fruition.

I had to talk him off the ledge of “safe goal” many times and give him a lot of confidence and encouragement, sometimes still do a bit. But the proof is there — it was not safe, it seemed risky. But it was exciting, it set him apart to the adcom and his whole life will be forever changed for the better. I know he will be successful with this, and it will have a huge environmental impact on developing countries.

&gt;**One final thought. “SAFE” IS NOT ALWAYS SAFE.**

So many applicants think playing things very conservatively will help their chances. I will say this: adcom must be sure you can get a job or get funding. You need a plausible exit strategy out of the MBA years.

However, you need to stand apart in this process and hiding your true self in the process will not get the job done. They need to see passion, a spark, this is what magnetizes them to you. This is what branding is all about. The adcom knows what you stand for, it’s memorable. They believe in it and can get behind you."

However, some members of the department, that I'm in, concern their job as a very stressful one due to dealing a lot of with production environment and being responsible for constant reliability of the services. To be precise they work exactly as system administrators and they build data centers(ms sql, windows server, vmware... this kind of stack) so they are not working in devops culture. I wonder how does it look like in real devops culture? Is devops job stresful too? Is maintaining for IaC something stresful?

Currently devops culture is present mostly in international corporations. I'm ok with working 7-8 hours a day and then be available on call at my place. Tbh, I really hope to work in such schedule. I hope that's the reality...

Last but no least, I noticed that corporations demand from junior candidates to be fluent in one programming language (mostly: c,c++,c#,java,python are pointed). Does it mean that devops takes a part in application development? 

In devops role I really hope to be responsible for Infrastrucutre (or part of it), be responsible for application development as well, and be on call after work

Well I hope you to answer those three questions written above."

In my region, there is no minimum wage or internship culture and most jobs ask for at least 1-2 years of experience. What few internships there are, are all unpaid ones.

I have been interning at a big multinational firm (in data science) (non FANG) for a month now and while the experience I am gaining is pretty good, the work is very demanding and actually contributes to the service the company provides to clients (not ""intern projects"") and is unpaid. The fact that it is unpaid made me continue applying to jobs even after starting. 

Its a 3 months internship with a CHANCE of them hiring me based on my performance and ""many other factors"" (of which they won't elaborate). I am anxious about this because I could perform really well and they may not hire me due to lack of budget or maybe just get some new interns for more free labor tbh. 

I interviewed with a couple of places recently and am expecting a job offer soon. One of the companies said they like my profile but their budget for the job is pretty low - its 30 % lower than what would be considered decent average pay in my region for a backend dev role.

What should I do ? Stick with the big company in hopes of it panning out and getting a lucrative job offer in the future (lucrative since its a big company) or lower my salary expectations and get whatever job I can.

There are 28 members, about 5 or 4 cities to choose from and 4 people will be picked from their 6  team members. 

I took it upon myself to see where my competitors were coming from and I have to say that I'm skeptic about this whole thing. They paired me with a lot of heavy, skilled people with experience and others groups consisted of a well balanced team. Simply put: I feel kind of underqualified in a way or like this isn't really the internship that I should go after. I barely have a resume aside from the IT internship that I've done and since then, I've gotten defensive about why I was chosen in the first place. I don't like to feel as if I was placed in programs or jobs where I'll play as a buffer of some sort, or like when the choosing is gets tough, it'll be easy to knock the lower experienced people out of the way. In similar situations when people hire skilled candidates and the other few don't match the criteria. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I looked up one of the main reasons why RISE programs were created, apparently such things were created in order to make sure people with smaller knowledge would be able to be taught  throughout the program. Though the program only lasts for 4 days. So it's quite obvious that they really want us to flex our skill more than actually give a little and learn a little, then she who adjusts better. 

I just don't feel too good about this. I'm more offended than I am worried or scared."

Here is the twenty-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?  

   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

i3qs34,2,2020-08-04,I (M20) finally submitted for a gap semester and I feel sick.,iZaxer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i3qs34/i_m20_finally_submitted_for_a_gap_semester_and_i/,"Hey guys,

My first two years at university were pretty miserable. I made them that way-- mixing standard student anxieties with what I'll reluctantly call depression, some frequent paranoid catastrophic about every social mistake and a perpetual fear that none of my friends valued me for good reason, as well as lack of enthusiasm for school itself and no discernible major or career path of interest. It sucked and the whole time it seemed like I was just fighting my mental health to maintain relationships, only to decide I wasn't worth them or didn't like them and try to sabotage myself. And while I've been getting by academically, settling into a general major (marketing) with a decent gpa (3.3), I've definitely just been coasting downhill as I haven't applied to any internships or even figured out exactly how I want to use the degree.

When COVID hit, I was independently glad everyone was putting a pause on life, and hoped I might grow a lot with the free time. Up at school there was always a force on me to hang out with my dorm neighbors whenever possible, despite mood or work to be done. Back home I was pissing away time online like my old self. It felt welcome, but I didn't really get any motivation until July  so naturally I didn't feel ready to return to campus life next week. I agonized over a choice to take a leave of absence for weeks, and finally pooled together the Pro's of mental health, time for career discernment, all of the relevant encouraging posts on reddit, working out, and personal growth into the pessimism I had for on campus COVID policies and in a moment of courage withdrew from school.

Now I can't sleep. I'm seeing people moving into campus already and can't stop thinking about how I'm throwing away my only chance at college friends, how I won't be able to graduate with anyone, how 'm wasting key months of my youth and how I'll always be a step behind people my age. I can't stop thinking about the mistakes I made on campus and the loose ends I'm leaving behind without any closure. I didn't always like my friends but at least they were there, and I feel like even best case scenario from this gap, if I grow as a person and feel more stable from it, the primary conclusion I'll make will be regret for the people I threw away and spite for my lack of gratitude.

Back in June we were virtually signing up for our dorm rooms after the cancellation of  study abroad displaced a good deal of the student population. I would have liked to move off campus with a friend or two, but hadn't had contact with anyone I knew since March, so I was to pick between acquaintances in my old dorm and randoms in a new one. At that point I was feeling extremely ashamed of the weak person I'd been at school, and decided rather than try to improve relationships with people I was just alright with, I would benefit from a fresh start in my junior year.

If I had taken a room in my old hall I wouldn't be writing this right now, and would have saved both of us a good deal of time. If this week I had to choose between tackling COVID with those distant friends and waiting it out from home, I'd be packing my suitcases. But the dichotomy I found instead was between an already lonely time trying to make new friends in a new hall, along with social distancing regulations making gatherings even less frequent, and isolated time to grow at home. I picked what I thought was right, but now I can't even appreciate it without paining over what I chose to miss. I'm trying to contact the school about maybe undoing the request? And maybe finding space in my old dorm? But honestly it feels like too little too late and I feel like they'll just try to put me in any other random dorm. And at that point I still don't know what I'd do. I'm just beat up over this, and feel like I'm unable to make peace with what I thought was the right decision, and might still be right if I can't be with my old friends. I feel like I've ruined both options now, and would really appreciate any guidance on moving forward from here. 

Many thanks, y'all.

&amp;#x200B;

*tl;dr: Regretting a decision to cut off old friends and take a leave of absence from school. Can't appreciate the time to grow now because I'm focused on what I chose to miss. Need to move forward one way or another.*"

I read a comment that basically said he actually actively tried to avoid scrum and that it promotes micromanagement and stuff.

I’ve worked in both scrum and kanban environments, albeit only as an intern, but my work was tracked along with everyone else’s.

Personally, I think I can say that I felt more pressure to deliver in scrum, because of the two week timeline, but it didn’t feel so overbearing because our team was fluid enough to just push things into the next sprint if issues came up.

Kanban felt a ton more flexible and I only start to feel the crunch when someone else, like PO or stakeholder ish, starts to ask about it.

Is there a larger pattern of micromanagement in scrum that I’m not aware of, that would make it advisable in any capacity to actively avoid working in scrum teams?"

So, let’s start with some background. I graduated college in 2018 with a bachelors in CompSci from a mediocre public university. I spent my first year at a private school thinking I was going to be a doctor, and transferred to the state school my sophomore year (rip all of those credits). Halfway through the year, after never touching programming before, I had been just destroying every article I could find. I was so addicted to learning about programming. It was fascinating.

I ended up making a friend in class and we got the idea to make a game together. Neither of us had any idea what we were doing. Eventually we decided on a VR project. About a month into the project, with minimal progress, I interviewed for an internship. It was a small project management company and they needed someone to do IT and help manage their sharepoint site. I was by no means qualified. BUT, the manager was really interested in the fact that I was working on a VR project, and that got me the job (this will be a recurring theme later). So I started working there for like $13/hour, and stayed there for a little over a year. The work was mediocre, I just googled their tech problems, and did a minor about of JavaScript work. The people were fun, and the company was a family.

Fast forward a year, I have learned the basics: object oriented programming, worked on some iOS projects, dove really deep into Unity... I get a new internship at a Health Insurance company. I was so beyond bored out of my mind that I quit after 3 weeks. It wasn't worth the pay bump. The month after, a friend I made in college told me his company is hiring a Unity developer (me at this time: a game dev job in the midwest, wtf?). It turns out to be a big government contractor, and I would be on the Research and Development team.

So they hire me and I near double my pay, and I get to work on cool projects utilizing Augmented Reality. When I graduate college, they hire me on. I get two patents for the work I completed, and secure the company millions in contracts for the software I made by myself (it wasn't really anything crazy, but Augmented Reality is shiny). However, I'm still not happy at this point. The people that work there are half and half. Half of them are just there to work and collect their retirement pensions, they don't do anything cool outside of work, and are the stereotype of devs you would normally see. The other half are alright, but still, working for that massive company just rubbed me the wrong way. There were a ton of security rules, and I just felt like I was constantly being monitored (I was being monitored I found out right as I quit). 

So, in January I start looking at jobs in my area, and I find a recruiter that does all of the searching for me. The bad part about the job search is that almost all of my professional experience is in Unity, and I'll never find another job that lets me use it in my area. My fiance is a teacher and can't leave her school, so moving isn't an option. So, I start REALLY thinking about what I want in a job. It comes down to a couple of things: good pay, a great culture, and decent benefits.

I interview at 5 companies and all of them want to hire me, I will explain why in a sec. I want to highlight how I made my choice. The first company did financial services, and their people were nice enough, but there was still this feeling of bureaucracy. I couldn't live with that. The other couple of companies just seemed so boring. Then I walk in the front door at my current employer, another financial services company. While I don't really have any interests in the financial sector, I figured I would give them a try since they seemed like they had a cool culture. I walk in the front door and the secretary greets me in just the happiest tone I've heard from a secretary. Perfect, I think, they treat her well, off to a good start. Then, I get seated in a big conference room, there's exposed wires, it's not super clean, etc. It was like just perfectly unorganized to the point where it wasn't ugly, but I could tell they weren't anal about things. The Lead Dev/Hiring manager and a senior dev walk in, and are just bubbly happy, perfect. We start chit chatting. They are hiring for a senior .NET developer. Well, I don't know anything about .NET web dev, BUT I have been using C# for years in Unity. 

The recruiter I used made it abundantly clear before I even went to interview that I am not a senior developer. When I asked them why they still interviewed me they said ""you might not have the knowledge or experience, but I don't care, it's all about finding the right candidate"". And that struck a chord with me. They aren't about coding tests, or BS interviews. It ended up just being us 3 geeking out over a bunch of stuff in the tech scene. It was that simple, I was a culture fit, that had a love for learning. I've been working here for 6 months, I make decent money, and I absolutely love everyone I work with. Even if there's a ton of ugly legacy code, and the actual product we make is boring... The team goes out and gets drunk together for lunch on Fridays. They go on walks together during the day. Most people have a cool hobby that's fun to talk about. There's a good amount of diversity, and everyone is respected. This matters so much more to me than anything else. I got an offer for 40k more at a different company and it just wasn't worth not being happy everyday.


Okay, so let's talk about what let me get to this point. I think there are several reasons I got a ""senior"" role and pay, being 2 years out of college and not even ever using the framework the company uses.

1. I make it abundantly clear I love the field. I talk with passion about my personal projects. Every. Single. Time. I talk about the game I'm working on. But that has nothing to do with what they do, right? Wrong. If you show you're a passionate person, that is beyond valuable to your work ethic, and your relationship with your coworkers.

2. I go in there with the best possible mood. I make it a point in the interview to talk about how my positive personality rubs off on my coworkers. I make it a point to compliment people, to carefully word Slack messages so there can't be ANY negative interpretation. I don't respond with ""ok."", i respond with ""awesome, thanks a bunch!""... And it makes A HUGE difference in what people think of interactions with you. 

3. I have touched a lot of different types of software. This is probably the most important part. While I haven't done .NET in particular... I have worked on website backends in C#, Java, Python, and Swift... I have done a decent bit of front end in Unity, iOS, and React/Angular. I don't know any of them terribly well, but by learning enough to make something in each of them, I got to learn their benefits and drawbacks, what makes them worth it over another choice. Those are the choices a senior dev has to make. WHY use this framework over that one.

4. This is probably tied for the most important piece of what makes companies want me: I work on open source projects. I run a non-profit organization called oneleif. We work on open source projects, mentor each other, and just have a community of devs/designers that are fun to be around (feel free to google us and join :D ). Not only does it look good to be a cofounder of a nonprofit... But by talking to so many different people I get to practice social skills, and learn things others are interested. Best of all I get to practice my leadership skills by running an open source project. I cannot recommend open source enough.

Okay, that was a long post, I hope it can be of use. If you have any questions, either message me here or join the oneleif discord, I would love to help anyone with anything!"

I have two months until I return to school remotely in October, so I want to use this time to up my skill in any way to prepare myself for a winter internship. Currently, I have the basics of programming down for Python/Java (into courses with OOP at the end).  I have been trying to get going with the Princeton DS&amp;A course to make up for skimming through the intro to DS&amp;A that I took at community college (I used chegg heavily to inflate my grade this year, really wished I didn't).

Although I'm open to all sectors of the industry, I really want to work within mobile development as soon as I receive my bachelors in CS in 2022. I started the Stanford Swift iOS development course at the beginning of summer, but got heavily distracted throughout all of July to tend to my other hobbies. I realize I'm not going to get good at any of these things if I try to juggle it all at once, so I'm going to focus on a few crucial things in the next few months.

I hear all the time that DS&amp;A and side projects are crucial for interviews for jobs/internships, so I wanna spend the next two month addressing one of these things. (I'd go for both, but I still want to dedicate some time to my passion for dancing). I have to take an upper division DS&amp;A course later that is basically a continuation of the intro course I took at CC, so I was wondering if the Princeton course would be redundant and I'd be better off learning Swift to create something for my portfolio (while learning how to use Git to upload and maintain my projects). Like I said, I skimped on basically all the programming assignments and data structure implementation for the intro course, so I may be ill prepared for upper division DS&amp;A. If you guys have any other suggestions for other areas that I may be overlooking, please let me know! I would also appreciate any suggestions for CS related electives to look for during my junior/senior year at UCSC."

I know UMass is a good school, it's CS is top 20 and it's very competitive, it also ranked 11 in AI I guess.

But UMass amherst is not as prestigious as the other schools I mentioned earlier. I'm afraid this can hinder my future career and opportunity. Maybe I need to get a research/softeng internship in FAANG to boost my profile. 

Do you have any suggestions about this? I even thinking to defer, doing research project, and trying to apply again this year to those prestigious CS schools."

Currently two quarters away from obtaining my BA: Marketing degree. Currently in the midst of a 12 week sales internship doing b2b/corporate sales.

I’ve heard many successful entrepreneurs talk up sales as a good starting point and skill to learn. Meanwhile, marketing was the only business concentration that clicked with me. 

For the most part I would say I have the predisposition for sales: heavy extrovert, good with people, hard working. 

I am trying to decide what career path to pursue out of college. Regardless of which, I am going to save up every penny and full send it once I have enough starting capital.

All in all there are pros and cons to both sales and marketing for me, and I’m quite torn between the two.

Can anyone offer me some guidance?"

Background:
I graduated with an accounting degree last year.
I guess you can describe me as someone who is still discovering her career path. 

My career (don’t know if this is the right term haha) in a span of a year:
1. Studied and took the board exam by November
2. Started a marketing internship
3. By Feb, got a project based job in digital banking

In my current job (digital bank) I realized that the coding and implementation of new ways to innovate on an IT perspective really interests me and I’m considering a long term career in this area. Unfortunately, I hold a accounting degree and have no prior experience in coding etc. 

What I want to know:
1. What skills do I need to learn to better position myself as an ideal candidate for an IT position?
2. Where can I learn this? 
3. What entry level job should I go for? (to increase my chances of getting in)
4. Is it even possible to transition?

To be honest, I really want a job in gcash :) 
If anyone can share what’s it like to work here would be really great.

Thanks a lot for reading about my super boring and confusing life hahaha"
i3y1or,5,2020-08-04,How Jason Yuan Got An Internship at Apple Music,ibsurvivors,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/i3y1or/how_jason_yuan_got_an_internship_at_apple_music/,"When you apply for a job and get rejected, that’s normally the end of the story.

And in fact for most jobs, this doesn’t seem like the end of the world. You might have liked the product and the team culture, but hey, plenty of fish in the sea.

But if you *really* want to work somewhere and the opportunity doesn’t work out, then that can sting.

That’s where Jason comes in.

In the summer of 2017, Jason Yuan was rejected from an Apple Music design internship. He referred to it as an opportunity of a lifetime, that, well he had missed out on.

But what Jason did next is pretty awesome. He spent the next three months pursuing his own project focused on redesigning the Apple Music experience.

He reframed the rejection as an opportunity to get better at his craft. In his [case study](https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-got-rejected-by-apple-music-so-i-redesigned-it-b7e2e4dc64bf) that went viral, Jason walks us through what he’d change about Apple Music, how he’d make it better, and other potential ideas he has for the platform.

It’s a remarkable piece of work. It shows that Jason is focused on the process - he’s willing to put his work out there and get better.

His whole experience conveys three concepts that I want to discuss:

**Concept #1: High Agency**

When most people are told they can’t do something, that’s the end of the dialogue. They outsource their decision making to other people.

People with high agency don’t let this happen. A second dialogue starts in their mind - how do I get around this obstacle?

This is a concept I first heard about from Eric Weinstein. Steve Jobs has a similar concept which he referred to as the Reality Distortion Field. An example:

In 1981, Bud Tribble, one of the key employees on the original Mac computer, greeted a new software engineer at Apple by telling him they were scheduled to ship the Macintosh software in just ten months.

The new employee, Andy Hertzfeld, told him this was impossible. Tribble agreed.

But Jobs wouldn’t take no for an answer. Tribble described this as follows:

*“In Jobs’s presence, reality is malleable. He can convince anyone of practically anything. It wears off when he’s not around, but it makes it hard to have realistic schedules.”*

Jason is a prime example of a high agency person. Although he didn’t get the internship, he realized that the opportunity to learn more about UX design was entirely up to him.

He didn’t need permission to do what he did. All he needed to put in was the time and effort.

Jason was rejected for the internship in the Summer of 2017. He published his Apple Music UX Case Study around then.

Can you guess where he interned the Summer of 2018? Apple.

That’s right - Jason’s case study basically made hiring him one year later a no brainer. He got rejected the summer before and there’s where the story *should* have ended. But his resourcefulness made sure that wasn’t the case.

**Concept #2: Learn In Public**

Most people think they need to be *experts* before publishing any of their work online.

But when Jason published his Apple case study, he made it very clear that he wasn’t coming from a place of expertise.

In fact, Jason’s alma mater Northwestern University didn’t even have a formal graphic design program, so Jason is all self-taught.

Don’t worry about being wrong because you’re likely in a position where you’re pushing yourself and growing. If you are wrong, the internet will correct you and you’ll end up learning new things.

Writing your thoughts out also forces you to be crystal clear and contributes to solidifying your learnings. In a world that’s going increasingly remote, writing well is a valuable skill to have and one that can make you stand out.

Finally, learning in public also allows one to attract mentors. Not many people share their work in public. It makes you stand out and people who are already higher up in their career start wanting to help you.

In Jason’s case, by documenting his work, he was able to get the Apple internship.

And let’s assume for a moment that he didn’t get the internship. Even then, his case study went viral - it was widely shared on social media and he got thousands of people checking his work out.

Only good things could have happened. If not Apple, Jason would still have eventually ended up with an awesome opportunity popping up.

**Concept #3: Spite**

Jason prefaces his case study by clearly stating that his work was not driven by indignation or spite. In other words, he states that he didn’t put all this work into redesigning Apple Music because they rejected him.

That’s fair. It’s definitely the healthy mindset. But I want to explore the alternative view as well.

Let’s assume that *he did* do this out of spite.

I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. Proving people wrong can be a huge force of motivation.

Everyone loves an underdog. When Apple rejects you and you come back by writing a 3000 word case study that goes viral on the internet, you’ve completely flipped the script.

Steve Jobs was rejected from HP because he lacked a degree. He went on to start Apple.

Jan Koum was rejected by Twitter and Facebook. He went on to start Whatsapp..which he sold to Facebook for $19 billion.

Jason Yuan was rejected from Apple. So he wrote a case study that went viral and the rest is history.

I've been offered an internship (unpaid) for three months. The role suits me as it's something I like to do. However, there is no promise of further employment. The people I've spoken with said that making the position permanent (and paid) will depend on whether further investments are received + see how things evolve. I don't know what to do. Because on the one hand, I really need the income, but I've been looking for so long, I can easily see the next three months continuing with searches and interviews but no actual jobs (I know the market is particularly complicated right now). If I take the internship (it's full time) my job-hunting time will be massively reduced (I'm currently spending at least two hours per day looking). I know it's a gamble, but do you have any suggestions? Additionally, if I do take the internship and I manage to get a job in the meantime, I would either have to quit the internship before it ends or delay an actual job? (Not sure how that'd work.)"

I’m a CS student with a Pure Mathematics minor. My overall GPA is 3.80. I’m in an honors society, the McNair Scholars program, and the Air Force Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. Within each program, I always go above and beyond to excel. 

I absolutely love CS and math.

HOWEVER, for the past three years, despite submitting a superfluous amount of applications, I only landed ONE interview total. They ended up cancelling the whole program due to COVID-19. So I don’t even know if I would’ve been hired.

Instead of an internship, I’ve been conducting academic research in the fields of coding theory and combinatorics (both projects required programming and math). Recently, I proved two new theorems in graph theory! I am  currently presenting the research at several conferences and am working to expand the project towards a major theorem. I contribute to STEM in other senses as well: I am a tutor and also volunteer as a mentor for a robotics club.

Despite my grades, work, and potential. I cannot get a single interview. My resume has been reviewed and amped up by my college’s center for career and professional development. So I’m not sure what’s up. It feels so circular how I need to have experience in order to get experience. I’m a hard worker and never give up in the face of any challenge...but this one won’t let up.

I’m a senior now. Any insights on how I can improve for recruiters? I’m in Texas if that offers any useful information.

But yesterday, while I was working an extra 30 minutes to finish the final fixes for today’s deployment, one of the manager messaged and questioned why feature abc has not been implemented yet. I told the manager that feature has never been mentioned prior to this conversation. She started to become passive aggressive with me and bombarded me with questions as to why we did not listen to what she said about the requirements before starting this project.

When you click the team card ( I would use VueJS for the front-end) it would then request that particular sound from the API/Database. I am currently using VueJS and Axios to do stuff like this in my current internship and the database is made with PostgreSQL, but I only need to make calls from the database the backend eng made, so I am obviously not learning how to create it myself.

I would appreciate any tutorials or advice you think that would help me. Tutorials I have found show you how to create an API, but I also need to store the sounds in the backend and I am not sure if its as simple as creating a table with text.  Thank you."

Right now I am done with 1st year of my MS and found that opportunity to do research is even less than that in my UG (not US). I go to a #30 university for MS CS and feel a little unsatisfied with research in my current school. I am interested in doing research in ML (specifically relating to CV like explanation, bias reduction, semi-supervised, etc.) and hence want to do a PhD.I am a first author in 3 publications - 2 in CV ( A\* workshop and A conference) and 1 in NLP (C conference). LORs are from 2 profs at my MS, one for DWIC and one who acts as thesis advisor. Another from back home who is also a good name in the CV field. (not the best)

I want to go to a top program for my Phd (like CMU, Stanford, UCB, MIT, GaTech, ) but I know I dream too high. I just want a good program with fairly high reputation. (Might sound shallow, but I have seen blatant discrimination regarding school name in industry)Exams: GRE 326 (170Q+156V)/TOEFL 109GPA: UG \~3.4, Masters: 4.0/4.0 (with 5 A+ out of 8)

My question is, which one would look better for hirers? Will it look bad if I graduated in 2021 but not in the job market until 2023? Will it be better if I graduated in 2022 so that they see that I’m a recent grad?

Considering that I won’t be able to get any internships due to being active duty, if I graduate early and just work on individuals projects would that be better?

i492fi,3,2020-08-05,Getting second thoughts about going for a PhD before applying. Anyone else gone through this?,Seankala,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/i492fi/getting_second_thoughts_about_going_for_a_phd/,"Hi everyone. I was wondering whether to post his here as it sounded like an admissions question, but figured that this subreddit may be better as I'm under the impression that there may be more people who have gone down the PhD/academic/researcher path (or not!) and may be able to provide some perspective.

I'm an MSCS student who does research in machine learning and deep learning (natural language processing to be more specific). I just finished my second semester around a month ago. Grad school in general's been good until now. Getting paid, learning, getting my name on papers, etc.

My original plan was always to apply to PhD programs in the US and Canada this year (I'm from Korea) and if things and if things didn't go well for whatever reason(s) then I'd apply again next year.

However, these days I've been getting some major cold feet as I prepare to go about the actual admissions process (writing up my SoP, requesting letters from professors, etc.). I find myself constantly asking ""Do I actually want a PhD?"" ""What if I like working?"" ""Do I really need to go through with a PhD program to tackle interesting problems in my field?"" etc.

It doesn't help that I constantly feel inferior/lacking whenever I look up the profiles of students at the labs I want to join. I also find more joy in coding up machine learning problems than reading tons of papers and conducting research. keep seeing job postings for internships at places that seem to be doing really cool stuff. The feeling that applying halfway through my master's feels premature is a bonus. I also don't really have any desire to stay in academia.

I've talked to a lab senior who was a software engineer before joining grad school. He said that his motivation for going for a PhD was because people would never take him seriously due to his lack of education. This might be a cultural thing, but in my field (ML/NLP) it does seem that having a PhD is the requirement for most jobs.

Anyway, I don't want this to sound like a rant. I'm just curious if anyone's felt the same before they applied to their PhD programs, and if so whether or not there was some ""moment of clarity"" that they experienced?

Thanks."

i4bwnh,3,2020-08-05,mental illness led me to choose community college. stressed about PATH/ability to SUCCEED going forward.,6789998212abc,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i4bwnh/mental_illness_led_me_to_choose_community_college/,"So I've been out of high school for one year now. My plan was to go to community college and then transfer to a university after two years. I took a couple of classes at my CC this year, but I see those as more of an experiment, especially because I failed one or two and could do better in the others as well. So I'm thinking of this fall as the official start to my 2 years of community college.

I didn't apply to any 4-year universities last year bc I struggled with depression and other mental health stuff throughout high school, and it negatively impacted my grades. I can see now that there is value in Community College. But I still want to transfer to a university.

Unfortunately, when I think of universities and trying to get into them, I focus way too much on where other people are going. I never think about the other people who are going to community colleges, or the people who got into schools that aren't very prestigious. No. I just constantly think about the (small number of) people I've met who got into really good schools. And I think to myself that they are successful, and look at me. Can I try to catch up to them? Idk. I want to get good grades and I think that learning TIME-MANAGEMENT and ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS will help with that. I also need to learn how to REGULATE my EMOTIONS so they don't take over my life and impact my productivity. I also want to build up my resume. I want to do volunteering work and get one or two internships... But one of the internships I had most wanted to get is probably not going to happen. (I hadn't planned it out, just thought of it in the back of my head. It was an idea for the future, something I would start planning for when I had more of my life figured out.) I moved to my state's capitol city and that's where I'm going to community college. I wanted to someday intern at the state legislature. But I just found put that you have to be a junior or senior in a 4-yr university, or have junior/snr standing and be enrolled in a 4-yr. Even if I could take enough classes to get jnr/snr standing (which would be stressful af), would I still live here the fall that I'd be transferring to a college? Umm... probably not. I also wanted to use the internship to bulk up my resume/application to a university... not do it after getting accepted... it was supposed to help me get the acceptance in the first place. AND apparently they're taking applications this fall. I don't really have much to put on my resume at the current moment. There's so much I need to do. Volunteering, etc.

Part of me knows that I can do everything on my own timeline and that I can be successful if I just work hard and treat myself well. But part of me feels like I need to run to catch up with the people who are more successful than me, and I don't know how to do that without trying to copy what they did and fit it into a short time span/do it after HS instead. Idk!! People/colleges expect you to do certain things in a certain amount of time. And I don't think that's fair to everyone but I don't know what else to do but play along with it. And I don't want to see more doors close for me. Because I know that I can do well, there's just stuff I have to figure out.

Ok I'm done rambling now. Just wondering if anyone has advice for how to stop comparing myself to others/overthinking, or more practical advice like how to get better at time management or build up my resume. I'm just really stressed out about the possibility of not achieving my goals.


P.S. Idk if I self-sabotage but I might? That's a different conversation...

Finally, after 4 years it's been approved). Held 7 internships during my time, originally one of those 7 was a temporary internship that was supposed to lead into a full-time job as soon as I graduated at a start-up company. Was really excited, but they took a pretty big hit from COVID and had to rescind the offer in March. I was really crushed.

Laid around, mildly depressed and dealing with a lot of anxiety for a few months. Graduated and grimly stared at the virtual commencement they handed us. Pretty much just existed at a relative's house during quarantine (my parents are back in Korea). I felt insanely guilty for how much my parents had supported me, I hadn't seen them in years and they were always so positive, so willing to help me. I felt like an absolute failure, just undeserving of them. I still do, honestly.

I started looking for things in late April/early May - 50+ entry level positions never got back to me, led to no interviews. I started panicking, but managed to land a marketing internship at a decently known tech company. I was insanely grateful - and now that I had a green card, I could legally be paid (all of my past internships were unpaid, as I couldn't get paid as an int. student anyways - oof). I've been working in this position for two months now, the position ends in 3-4 weeks.

I just find it a bit saddening that my HR supervisor gave me mild hope a week ago, telling me they might have a marketing position open for full-time hire, or might extend the internship by a month or so. I was thankful for that meeting, and the opportunity - but the following 1-on-1 meeting, he informed me that the higher ups have decided to simply refresh the intern program and bring in new ones once my contract ended (and for the other sales intern who came in with me). While I know nothing was set in stone (and yes, my contract ends Aug 28th), it still felt a bit discouraging.

I've submitted a bunch of applications over the course of the past two months, without much reply. I did get a request from an interview this morning, only for them to tell me the position is in their office several STATES away from me, unlike their listing. When I asked them about the location error, they just chalked it up to the listing messing up the location. So obviously, I couldn't take it as I can't really afford to relocate at the moment....

tldr; Had a job offer, fell through after COVID. Feeling unremarkably bland, annoyed by all these ridiculously positive LinkedIn posts, worried about my future. Is it okay to still be job searching right now? Am I screwed for life by being unemployed after this month?"

I just started my first week at a fortune 50 company and I feel so less than &amp; stupid already. I feel dumb for doubting myself because I never lied on my resume, never lied in my interview and generaLly was very open with things I am actually proficient in versus things I am a beginner in.

My internship is in project management. I have worked in the PM field for a year now, just originally I worked for my university. My university did provide me with valuable experience but I will say, not as much as what this company will give me.

Towards the end of my time at my university, I was working on actual projects, creating diagnostic tool, starting to learn how to analyze data, how to visual it etc.. Now my new internship is doing a LOT with data and a LOT of free thinking and making certain things better, finding ways to store data etc.

And I’m lost. This is such a good company and I’ve strived to work for them since I got into the PM field. But going over something’s I will be working on....scares the crap out of me. My manager says there will be ‘great learning’ and I’m trusting her. But I am seriously feeling like the small, clueless 19 year old for the first time in my life.

The other intern they hired (not to do the same things as me but similar) has a extremely technical degree, has interned at a lot of different companies and generally seems like girl boss in every definition of the word. She’s a few years older than me so I’m trying not to compare but it’s so hard not too.

I had a meeting with my manager today and she asked if I had any more questions. All I wanted to ask was ‘is it okay to be nervous?’.

Has anyone else felt like they have been hired for an internship that they feel they don’t qualify for? How did you handle it?"
i4d7le,228,2020-08-05,Does Anyone else's parents constantly think they're right???,yagirldebbie,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/i4d7le/does_anyone_elses_parents_constantly_think_theyre/,"I'm just realizing how much my parents HAD to be right my whole life. When I wrote an essay in High School for a college professor, my father insisted on proof reading it and changed the word ""Learned"" to ""Learnt"" all through my essay.

My professor marked it wrong, because, you know, it is. My father literally went down there and argued with him during parent's night, because he thought he knew more than a man that had a degree in the subject. My father wasn't even born in America! He was just so righteous it pisses me off still.

My mother was the same way. I have a research internship that I don't want people knowing about yet, because it's relatively new. I have to drive an hour to a different city for it though. My mother sometimes drives me to ""spend time with me."" The other day her friend asked to go shopping, and my mother said no, she had to drop me off for my ""College job,"" then didn't elaborate.

When I got on her about that, she said ""At least I didn't tell them it was a research internship!"" Super smugly, as if she'd done something great. She refused to admit she was wrong for telling the friend that I had a job.

The reason I didn't want this family knowing was because they have daughter two years younger than me, and they want me to help her with writing college essays and such. I didn't have any help, and that girl is very rude to me, so I don't want to help her, but I know her parents will pressure me to, and my mother will make me because it'll be ""shameful to the family"" if I don't.

Another time my mother did this was when I had a breakup because she didn't allow me to see the boyfriend, and he left me because of it. We were basically long distance while living 2 miles apart; all we were allowed to do was text, and all of my texts were synced to my mom's iPad. She claimed she wasn't wrong because her ""culture made it difficult for her to navigate this."" I retaliated with how all of the other Indian girls and boys of my age in our town were able to go on dates with their partners, so it wasn't a culture thing, it was just her.

She then said ""Yeah well their parents know the names of who their kids are going out with."" My mother had his phone number, Facebook, Instagram, and KNEW HIS FULL NAME. She saw all of our messages, and even tracked my location! I pointed that out, and she said ""yeah well still."" Still what??? I snapped at her and told her that I allowed her to do more than the other kids did in terms of invasiveness (tracking my location, seeing our messages, etc.) and she was wrong.

She still denies that she was wrong, and complains that I don't tell her anything and I'm not close with her anymore, blaming me for it.

My mother tried instilling this in me too. I used to carpool with a bunch of kids to a summer camp, and my mother was driving one day. We were talking about the Harry Potter books, and one girl pronounced ""Krabbe"" as 'Crab.' I asked her if it was that, as I had thought it was pronounced as ""Crab-AY,"" the French version. She said she pronounced it like that, and I accepted it.

The minute I got home, my mother made me go on her iPad and Google it. I was correct, but I really didn't care, it was just about a stupid book. The next day when she came to pick us up, my mother nudged me and loudly said ""Tell her what you learned last night!"" I did, and that girl really didn't like me again. I mean, who would?

After all of this, my mother still expects me to be close with her. HOW?????

The code all lived in a non-public Github repo managed by the school.  At the end of the semester, the school deleted that repo for some reason; I was proud of the project and didn't want it to be gone forever, so I uploaded my clone of it to a private repo in my personal Github, just as a backup for future reference.  

I'm currently applying for internships. I don't have a lot of interesting personal projects (I'm working on fixing that), and this class project is the largest-scale project I've worked on by a large margin - I would love to make it available to hiring people to show off what I can do.  However, since it also includes my classmates' work, I'm unsure if it would be a breach of etiquette (if not law) to share their code without their permission (I would just get in touch and ask, but I have since transferred to a different university and don't have an easy way to reach them anymore).  

What should I do? Make the whole thing public? See if there are any files written by me and only me (there might be but I'm not sure) and send only those to the places I apply? Just leave everything private and talk about the project without showing code?"

It;s for a full time job. 4 out of the 6 people can only be chosen and I'm the 6th one.  This project is a 3 day thing, so tomorrow will be the second day.
2. I joined in and they wanted us to face cam and video chat and I couldn't even do that. I just don't want people to see me and whenever I did speak, some of the members, I could tell, were holding back laughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I speak during my anxiety attacks, I tend to go really fast, shaky and I can't hide it. The company wants people that participate in group work and is out spoken since the job is mainly for technical consulting.  The second major thing that anxiety does for me is cause brain fog, all I can do at that point is listen and watch, because I can't formulate a sentence or an idea pertaining to the group work. I don't even think putting my self out there is scary. The thing about me is that if I feel forced or pushed into something, then I'll most likely underperform or screw something up. I know I can leave whenever I want but it's unfair to my team members if I just dropped and left. That doesn't mean that they aren't about a billion years smarter than me and seemed just fine without my input, but it's just a terrible habit to start doing now that I'm two semesters away from graduating and it's poor taste in character. I'll have to wake up knowing that I flaked and ruined my reputation with other people who could help me in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

3) The second biggest fuck up was that I just shut off my computer and told the manager that I'm having technical issues because it's miles better than telling them that I have generalized anxiety disorder, no one wants to hire a liability.  Though I know first impressions tend to stick, so I'm at  a crossroads of whether I should keep going and show progress or not show up tomorrow.  I don't even know where I'm going to begin with this project. If I decide to attend the meetings tomorrow, I want to be the complete opposite of what I am right now but that is a complete 180 that I know won't be able to change so quickly.

But every single time I'm called by a job I'm instantly nervous and filled with dread because I feel like I'm underqualified for the job.

I graduated a year ago with a degree in journalism a took a 6-month post-grad PR internship in a few months later because I felt like I still didn't have enough experience to go into a full-time position. Even during the internship, I felt clueless, because I don't think I came out with any significant skills and felt very behind and confused throughout the whole process, although I technically met the internship goals. But in the internship program, we interns were behind the scenes of everything and never had any direct contact with clients, and weren't allowed to pitch or write press releases which are pretty important in that field. Most of what I did every day was researching trends or writing up agendas and taking notes for internal meetings.

So recently I've been trying to get into marketing. I interviewed for a digital marketing company a few weeks ago and got through about 3 rounds of the process, but wasn't hired for the position. And now another marketing company reached out to me and offered an interview which I'm extremely nervous to do cause I moved back home for quarantine after applying and no longer am in the same state (which is listed as a requirement on the application.)

So I'm just feeling so underqualified and even less likely that I'll have a chance since I moved.

i4ith9,2,2020-08-05,My generalized anxiety disorder is ruining this internship. I hate that I'm like this,Negative_Student,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i4ith9/my_generalized_anxiety_disorder_is_ruining_this/," 

1. It;s for a full time job. 4 out of the 6 people can only be chosen and I'm the 6th one. This project is a 3 day thing, so tomorrow will be the second day.
2. I joined in and they wanted us to face cam and video chat and I couldn't even do that. I just don't want people to see me and whenever I did speak, some of the members, I could tell, were holding back laughter.

Whenever I speak during my anxiety attacks, I tend to go really fast, shaky and I can't hide it. The company wants people that participate in group work and is out spoken since the job is mainly for technical consulting. The second major thing that anxiety does for me is cause brain fog, all I can do at that point is listen and watch, because I can't formulate a sentence or an idea pertaining to the group work. I don't even think putting my self out there is scary. The thing about me is that if I feel forced or pushed into something, then I'll most likely underperform or screw something up. I know I can leave whenever I want but it's unfair to my team members if I just dropped and left. That doesn't mean that they aren't about a billion years smarter than me and seemed just fine without my input, but it's just a terrible habit to start doing now that I'm two semesters away from graduating and it's poor taste in character. I'll have to wake up knowing that I flaked and ruined my reputation with other people who could help me in the future.

3) The second biggest fuck up was that I just shut off my computer and told the manager that I'm having technical issues because it's miles better than telling them that I have generalized anxiety disorder, no one wants to hire a liability. Though I know first impressions tend to stick, so I'm at a crossroads of whether I should keep going and show progress or not show up tomorrow. I don't even know where I'm going to begin with this project. If I decide to attend the meetings tomorrow, I want to be the complete opposite of what I am right now but that is a complete 180 that I know won't be able to change so quickly.

On the bright side, I rescheduled an IT internship interview with an aerospace company, since I know this other internship is out of my reach and my progress was very slow."

From what I've read/understood is that application season for internships is coming. My original course plan follows the traditional course plan/bubble guide, which would be 340 + elective this Fall. Would I be better served taking 325/361 this Fall instead? Or is it a tad too late in the game in order to effectively prep for this interview season?

What Can I Do To Help Him.,Pizza_Reddit,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i4n8o0/a_close_friend_is_feeling_worse_and_worse_as/,"My friend, who I shall call Ryan, and I are currently rising juniors in the same university(very short commute). We have been friends since middle school, and we are both studying computer science. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory(Feel free to skip):

This past spring, Ryan and I had both landed our first internships at different companies. As this was our first entry into the working world in our field of study, we were extremely excited. Then Coronavirus hit. Companies had cancelled all summer internships. Our 4 months of paid work were gone. The blank spot on our resumes labeled ""Work experiences"" would remain so.

Personally, I was but merely inconvienced. Coronavirus is definitely not the end of the world. A summer of unproductively sitting at home, to me at least, is accommodable.

However, Ryan was hit harder. He is a sensitive guy, and a fellow introvert. In addition, unlike me, who could afford to both go to university AND dorm at said university, Ryan is..., in blunt terms, poor. His family is large, and thus, he has no income except for what he makes. This summer was meant to be a great way to earn money and earn experience. Right now, Ryan managed to earn a backup job through his cousin's startup, programming for the front-end.

&amp;#x200B;

Present-Day Issues:

In our talks together about his job, he is dismissive, but not angry. He touts his cousin's startup as ""not a real job"", as it primarily revolves around meetings and discord bots, and not actual coding. I have said that ""Still, its better than sitting at home doing nothing like I am."" I stated this in hopes of giving him a sense of purpose. 

In addition, in every conversation, I directly tell Ryan that I worry about him, and that other people worry about him. He always brushes it off.

He has recently started opening up about how he is getting depressed. He acknowledges that it is a medical issue, and that antidepressents and therapy are a known solution. However, he has stated that ""they just make you feel more normal"". In addition, due to his poverty, Ryan has told me that both of those options are restrictively expensive.

Due to his own bad habits and family issues, Ryan's sleep schedule is incomprehensible. He has stated that he gets around 3-13 hours of sleep per day. No, I did make a typo in that range. HE REGULARLY SLEEPS 3 THEN 13 HOURS per day, usually alternatively. In every talk, I tell him that this is extremely unhealthy, and in every response are ther words ""Yeah, I should really fix my sleep schedule"". I have pointed it out to his face that not only, but every other single friend of Ryan's has said this exact same thing. Still, he doesn't change, and I don't know how to sway him to.

Lastly, the topic of suicide has come up in conversation. However, in all mentions of this topic, it was used sarcastically by both Ryan and I as a joke. Still, even after each joke, I repeatedly say, ""Don't actually kill yourself"". I am not a psychologist, but I am certain based on our 12 years of friendship that our jokes on this topic are NOT a call for help. Even reading between the lines of the jokes, the tone of them NEVER suggest that Ryan would consider, nor follow through.

I can say with 99.9% certainty based on my entire knowledge of the human being that is Ryan that he will not end his own life.

However, 99.9% is not enough. If the 0.1% event occurs, I would never forgive myself. My life, and especially Ryan's life, would never be the same. Reddit, I ask for your advice. How do I help him?

&amp;#x200B;

My request for advice:

I tell my friend that he is cared about by many people, and that he has purpose in life, but he is still depressed. How can I help my friend feel more happy about his life, and prevent him from going down a dark path?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I can provide more details as necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My friend is depressed, and states that it is getting worse. He cannot afford antidepressents or therapy. How can I help?"

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know the steps people take to become good at coding to get into Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft etc. I don't think I'll ever be good enough for these companies so I want to start improving my skills and prove myself wrong by working hard. I've spoken to Google software engineers and they told me the company prefers you to learn C++, Java or Python. Which is the best language to learn? I already know how to use HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. I've made a few apps and websites for university assignments. But I want to know what exactly should i know and have knowledge on before applying for internships. Also, I don't understand how coding questions will help with the work the company will give you. Imagine you don't know how to fully code but end up getting through the interviews and an offer. Wouldn't they be shocked and confused if you have no clue on what to do on your first tasks given?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry I must be asking stupid questions. But I've become determined to better myself but I just don't know where to start and how to get there. Please could you guys give me steps on what I should learn or do to get an internship?"

Some background:
I'm a 5th semester student studying Computer Science at a good college in Bengaluru. I've recently seen a lot of intern positions (off campus) at companies open up for the summer of 2021 and I'll be going through an on-campus internship process in a few months as well.
 Problem is, despite having quality projects and Algorithm skills, I don't even get to attempt the online assessment tests and the interviews because of my CGPA (7.4) so I'm automatically rejected (the bar is usually set at 8). This is relatively low compared to peers at my college because I had a tough time coping up with irrelevant subjects included in my curriculum in my first year of college.

I realise that all I can do now is try to improve my GPA as much as I can and still keep practicing for interviews but it is disheartening to be rejected solely based on something so irrelevant. I've tried online career portals which hardly ever seem to work. 

What is your take on this way of recruitment?
Is a referral via LinkedIn the only way to go forward? (This too, seems to be a shot in the dark)

After some research, I've found that these companies are always looking for good potential devs so why set a shitty criteria?

Any advice is highly appreciated."

* Conceptualising a research project together (pending final approval from the PI)
* Having regular progress meetings
* Advising on which papers to read / experimental protocols to try etc. via Slack and email messages in-between official face-to-face (or Zoom) meetings
* Giving feedback on theses or paper drafts

If it makes a difference, I’m in the STEM area and in my penultimate year of the PhD.

I’m doing this for a handful of students from summer vacation interns to incoming PhD students in the fall. It’s a good experience if not sorta tiring, but I don’t think it’s normal and I think the actual PI should be more hands-on. It was sorta thrust upon me without me being explicitly asked. Again, I get that it's normal and expected for more senior PhD students to help the newbies get started and give them advice from time-to-time. 

Can anyone share their experiences, out of curiosity? I'm studying in the UK but originally from the US, I spoke to some friends from back home and they have varying opinions. I \*feel\* like it's too much for my level of seniority (and my pitiful stipend), but if it's just part of the process then maybe I shouldn't complain."

I have a decent knowledge of Java and a bit of python and i am polishing my DSA skills. My current focus is on working towards a job (because i really need money). I am aware ML/AI requires good knowledge of calculus and I am not sure if I will be able to master it during the next year and even if it was from where do I do it. What should be my expectations? How do I prepare? Should I consider a different path for a while to earn more? I am also interested in OS and web dev. Is it easier to land a better job as a junior web dev or anything else? Is it worth considering freelancing?  To professors here what is the minimum knowledge you all expect a research intern to have?

Good colleges in my country are few and emphasize highly on the theoretical side (algorithms complexity and  cryptography; equivalent of MIT i guess) to the point they mostly wont  bother to teach you coding until second-third year. Now I know this is  good as a foundation but the entrance exams filters out those who like  grinding arithmetic math. I am not one of them.

I did find a new University that gladly gives its undergrad students  research exposure and are starting to produce some good papers (a bit  better than Yale as per csrankings) but being under a lot of burden and stress (a lot of things relied on my results) also the fact that there is very limited knowledge of good new colleges here made me mess up with my  applications."

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow I wrap up my first SWE internship with a Fortune 100 company. Yesterday I failed a certification exam I prepared for all summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer I have seen huge growth in my personal self - I have been exposed to and wrote a lambda function for the first time, I deployed using Jenkins for the first time, I learned a lot about async v sync functions, I built a python app using Machine Learning for the first time, I physically met a lot of my goals at the gym, I am getting married in 5 days, I have felt enlightened in a spiritual aspect, and I have made many new friends (something that is often difficult for me).

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side, over the summer I have chosen to watch Netflix for hours on end instead of working on other side projects, I have chosen to eat out at fast food restaurants more times than I like to admit, I have all but ignored my goal of working on projects I know I will have to finish in the upcoming semester at university, I have a pile of thank you cards to write for after the wedding which I was hoping to have finished by last week, I have a pile of boxes that need to be unpacked and put away, my desk/house is never clean, I didn't network with as many people as I wanted during the internship, I have no idea what I am going to do for a club I lead in the upcoming semester, oh and my biggest failure of the summer, I spent 3 months preparing for an AWS Certification and failed it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think too often (students especially) create a list of failures and never focus on their growth. They think (which its so easy to do) that we are defined by our failures. I STRONGLY disagree. If we are focused on growth, then failure is a step in the right direction and should be considered a success.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have so much to learn, yes. Did my failures set me back some, yes. Would I have been better off if I never failed, maybe... but in reality not really. Failure helps us to push forward the next go around- it helps us to become better programmers, better engineers, better people for that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Failure should be equivalent with progress, and I have spent a long time trying to make that connection in my brain. I am still working on it, and encourage each of you to do the same.

If someone tells me ""don't use this api we have to refactor X and Y which would cost time,"" I'd think ""it's not worth using that api."" In every job and internship I've had there will be someone who tries to find a way to convince the higher ups to use that api.

Or if I go on a forum and say ""I can't use X because of Y,"" I will get message after message of ""just use X,"" and people doubling down and arguing when I repeat that I can't use X, or that there are faster simpler solutions.

I'm not a contrarian and I don't know how to think like one but it's surprising how many programmers are. Is this just bad luck on my part or is this something I need to find a way of working around? It wastes time that could be spent moving forward and it's annoying.

I just wanted to see really quick if I am on the right track here, I am trying to land my first job out of college and I need to get one soon because of finances. Here is what I can show for my time studying CS and what I am looking for:

My resume: 

* BS in CS
* 3.3 GPA
* Several smaller but complete applications through school work including : an ML based desktop app, a full stack web app and a few iOS applications.
* I also took a course where I along with several teammates designed and proposed and SDLC plan for a local company and pitched it to them (it was received well).
* One  internship in manual testing from like 7 years ago, so probably not doing anything for me.

What I am looking for:

* An entry level position that is leaning towards back-end (I have been told by a couple companies that I have interviewed with that they sometimes have the back-end guys work some front end stuff too)
* I am NOT looking for FAANG, I don't have any interest in the more demanding jobs, I am simply looking for something simple and that will allow me to grow my skill-set, but doesn't come with a ton of pressure initially. Stability is the name of the game for me.
* I am NOT looking for some crazy high pay, I live in the south and it looks like I could expect about 65k for an entry level offer if I could actually land one.

How I am attacking this:

* Generally I will try to get roughly 5-10 applications out a day, I have taken some time off from this to recharge here and there but I have about 150 apps out since I started around the end of June. (After I found out that an offer I received from a big name consultancy group was rescinded since they had canceled on-boarding for the calendar year due to covid).
* I am trying to leetcode around 3-4 problems a day and I am working through pieces of CTCI where I feel that I am weak.
* My soft skills are in general pretty strong, I don't really do too much work in this department, I worked commissioned sales retail throughout college and most interviews result in the recruiter telling me that I was a good ""culture fit"" but that they've found more qualified individuals.
* I have posted one of my web applications on my github that is linked on my resume, I am actually unsure if this project is reflecting positively or negatively on me. Though I put a lot of time into the read-me and explaining the project.

My results thus far are not excellent (2 interviews to the first 100 applications, interest from a few others that eventually ghosted me altogether).

I am wondering if I am headed in the right direction or if my approach is part of the problem, I do not want to continue to invest energy and hope into a bad direction. Any insight or help would be very useful, thank you guys."

I have been around both Pcs and I've been around softwares my whole life. I have studied quite a bit of cyber security and ethical hacking. There is a University where I live called UM, they offer a cyber security course which if you pass you would get a certificate of completion and they also build your resume to land you a internship or job once you graduate the 1 year course. I have really looked Into it and the salary is pretty nice ranging from 50k upwards to 200k. I'm not in it 100% for the money. It's just something I find to be very interesting. My concern and question is this.. I have a son which my partner takes care of him during th4 day while I work. We both live in our parents houses. Is cyber security an easy field to land a job in? Would me just having my certificate at UM be enough to get started in the field? My goal would be to land a governmental job in the cyber field. I would love to hear people's stories and experience in the field if possible. I'm just really anxious to start it and end up not even being able to catch a internship or job in the field. Thanks"

-- I'm really lonely at home. I don't have anyone my age to even talk to anymore and Idk how I'd make new friends if I'm not on campus. It's really affecting my mental health

Need help to figure out next steps for career.,DontKnowWhatToDo416,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/i4xtwg/have_a_masters_in_electrical_engineering_then/,"I'll make a really long story short:

I initially wanted to go into academia. I mean I really wanted to do this. I received a Master's degree in electrical engineering (emphasis in EM) and went to do a PhD because I wanted to go into academia specifically studying semiconducting materials.

I foolishly ignored some warning signs about my own mental health (it doesn't help that I'm autistic) and had a huge mental breakdown two years into it, but I was determined to publish at least one first-author paper which I did. However, during that time I really found I hated working in academia and wanted to transition back to industry.

After that I dropped the program, I got a job as a back-end programmer through a friend which I had until COVID hit. During that time I was trying to look into getting an EE job again.

Unfortunately, it's now been about five years since my EE days and the projects I did do are completely out of my memory and I don't have a ton of home-made projects to show for it. The most recent things I have is some semiconductor physics during my PhD and almost all the jobs I can find regarding that want a PhD for it or want a PhD to go along with it.

While I can't afford to go back to school at this stage, is it possible for me to at least get an internship as an EE which could potentially lead into a full-time job which would help me de-rust my EE skills?

If not, what would you suggest I do?

I'm not going to be particularly picky especially with how bad of shape I feel I'm in at the moment unless it's genuinely too costly like going back to school again.

I'm a US citizen if that matters btw."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Honors (9th) and AP Chemistry (10th) Teacher: I was hesitant to ask her for a letter of recommendation since I had her as an underclassmen, but she knew me the best out of my other STEM teachers.

AP English Language Teacher (11th): I thoroughly enjoyed his class and he knew me well (I ranted to him about my other classes/teachers lmao).

My counselor: She only knew how strong I was academically, and she made sure to mention that I was the only senior to have finished the math sequence at my school/I was only the 2nd person in my school’s history to begin in AP Calculus AB as a freshman.

*\*Sidenote: they are not used to writing letters for people applying to Ivies/top schools, so I would have ranked them quite low. Though, in the end, I think they helped me immensely. (I didn’t read them, my counselor just told me she included that one comment).*

**Interviews**

*\*I’ll be as succinct as possible since I don’t think they made much of an impact.*

**Brown:** Very awkward interview because this was my interviewer’s first application cycle. Nonetheless, she was super sweet and seemed genuinely interested in my passions.

**Dartmouth:** My interviewer called me an anchor baby….that’s all I’ll say…

**Princeton:** My interviewer and I didn’t quite vibe, he was very pretentious and didn’t think my reasons for wanting to attend Princeton were “good enough”. He was also very unorganized, arrived late, and had to leave early because he scheduled someone else right after me at a different location ? 

**Harvard:** My very first interview! I was very nervous, but my interviewer knew how to calm me down. He had a packet with pre-written questions and simply went down the list. Very efficient. 

**UPenn:** Rough start, he misspelled my email address and he couldn't get in contact with me until February. BUT, he and I vibed SUPER WELL, definitely my best interview. After I was admitted, he followed up with me and tried to convince me to attend haha, but understood that their aid wasn’t the best.

**Stanford:** My interviewer and I had a lot in common, and grew up in nearby cities. She congratulated me for how well I was able to answer her questions (some were meant to be curve balls) and how much I had accomplished as a first-gen student. I wish this interview would’ve lasted longer, but she scheduled everyone in my area on the same day :/

**Essays**

**Common App/Coalition Personal Statement:** Before I wrote this, someone suggested I write as much as I can in one sitting and then revise; so that’s exactly what I did. The week before my REA app was due, I sat down one night and just wrote the entire thing. I revised it for grammar/other small mistakes and then submitted it. I never looked at it again LOL, I submitted the same draft for my RD apps as well. (I don’t recommend this, I could’ve revised it/made it better in December but I chose not to go back).

I’ll keep the topic somewhat vague, but I decided to write about my dad and how the 2 heart attacks he had affected me and my decision to excel in school (to later become a surgeon). I could have easily written about being first-generation American and the racism I have faced while living in a conservative area, but I decided to save that topic for other essays since many schools have “diversity” supplementals. 

If you’d like specifics for other essays, let me know! I wrote supplementals for 8 schools in 3 days, DO NOT DO THIS, PLEASE START EARLY!!!  I’m hesitant to share my essays online, but I’m more than willing to help you with yours. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

***Acceptances:***

* Columbia (RD)  (Likely, Scholar)

* Dartmouth (RD) (Did not Accept Spot on WL) 
* Harvard (RD) (Rejected)
* Stanford (RD) (Accepted)

***Rejections:***

I was expecting all summer long to get a huge high when I FINALLY receive an offer to come back after my internship. The people are great and the work is even better. My entire academic career, I have been working and looking to this moment to fuel my determination. Late nights, pushing myself, and multiple internships. Moments of luck were needed. Some nights I worked so much that I woke up the next day with a headache. All I'm saying is, I put absolutely everything I had into this.

However, I don't feel anything. There was no parade for my offer conversation, no congrats, no fanfare. I was sitting at my desk like any other day of COVID remote work, and I get an email laying out the offer details. And that was it.

I don't feel fulfilled at all. I don't really know what to do. I definitely was not expecting to feel this way. Maybe it's because I know the work isn't over? And that I'll have to work just as hard to advance in my career? Maybe it's because I was expected more instant gratification? All I know is, right now I am just as happy as I was 1 hour ago, before I got the offer. It's making me look more into how much I prioritize what makes me happy.

Any advice?

I was just wondering if there are any tangible differences between UMD, which I'm in state for and thus is a lot cheaper than private or OOS public schools. UMD is seen as a pretty good school for CS (considered tier 2, so right under the best ones)

I know CS is considered one of the most merit based fields for employment, so what advantage do these top schools really give? I'm talking about MIT, CMU, Stanford, UCB, UIUC, etc.

I'd have to pay anywhere from 2-3X the cost of going to UMD for any of those schools, so I want a return on my investment which goes further than ""being able to make connections"" which is iffy imo since most people only make a few friends in college vs knowing everybody going there. If the prestige won't help with job prospects, I'm not really interested.

The answer I usually hear from people are ""better access to internships"". Can someone elaborate on that? My eventual goal is a FAANG job and I know interning at those companies helps to get the job but aren't the internships also merit based meaning that the college I go to wouldn't matter since they only look at skill?"

I’m a biology/pre-med student at a US institution. Medicine is an arduous path here and every year and day counts. My college experience isn’t the typical one where I study, have a decent amount of friends, and party safely. I couldn’t make friends the first two years and pretty much just locked myself in my dorm and studied. It paid off since I got straight As. Junior year changed a bit as I moved to my apt and my roommates became my friends, still maintained those straight As. Then corona hit. 

I lost my job that was helping pay for my apartment. I lost a $3000 prestigious medical internship to do research of my choosing. My medical college admission test was cancelled over and over again to the point I lost motivation. 

I still kept going though because I was motivated to see it through the year. I worked hard to graduate in 3.5 years and will be graduating in December 2020. This was my motivation. My parents were rewarding me with a huge cruise for a grad present. I had friends I could go on the cruise with. I finally had a college experience that I could reflect back on years into the future. But my graduation and cruise have both been cancelled due to corona.

It just all hurts so bad. When I tell people about it in an effort to get emotional support, all I get is that “I should be grateful that I’m alive” or “Get over it.” It makes me feel terrible that I’m even feeling bad because yes I am alive and I’m glad to be safe, but it still hurts! I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. After years of hard work, the thing that was motivating me has been taken away from me by something I can’t control.

So what can I do?"

I have recently finished my first year, and am about to go for my second. I am terrified that I will be unable to perform in the workplace, and will be promptly fired due to my inability to perform, and will be stuck with my $80k worth of debt that I will have when I graduate. 

The thing is, is that I currently have a 4.0 GPA. This is due to the fact that I never went to parties, never really socialized, and focused all of my efforts on my schooling. Of course I met people through group projects and worked with them well enough (For some reason I always find myself leading the group because nobody else wants to, most of my groups turn out to be exceptional though), but I didn't maintain any lasting relationships with them. 

Also, when it came to the final project for our digital logic design class last semester, I was one of the first ones to design a working schematic for what the professor wanted. I helped a bunch of other students get started, and my design only had 1 or 2 flaws in it, which I just turned in because I couldn't be asked to fix it with my other coursework at hand (still got a perfect score though). 

This is relatively the same case with my programming class, where  I finished the final project about a week ahead of time and helped others progress through it when they were stuck (although with this project, I had a ton of help from the professor and the TAs, they basically handed me the answers). 

I finished with A's in every single one of my classes. The only class that I got an A- in was in First Year Writing, but the professor liked me enough to bump it up to an A. This is why I have a 4.0 GPA now. 

Despite all of this, however, I am terrified that I will be unable to perform well enough in the workplace to differentiate myself enough to avoid being fired. Like I said earlier I will have about $80k worth of debt when I graduate, and I am absolutely terrified that I will be unable to find work that pays enough to help me pay it off in a reasonable amount of time. I think about this every night, and even though I know it is unreasonable, I just can't help myself from fearing what could possibly happen. What if everything I've done so far has been a farce, and it was just based on dumb luck? What if it's because I suck up to the professors who then are willing to give me a better grade? I hate when this thinking happens, and I don't know why I do it, or why I feel horrible after the fact."

I got my bloodwork at EKG finally done about two weeks ago, and was excited/nervous to see my doctor.

So I go to my appointment and I am seen by a different physician.  This is not abnormal for the clinic in my town.  They often train new doctors.  So I'm speaking to the doctor and she's says ""I don't jump to medication right away, I'd prefer if you saw a specialist.""

I was not expecting this at all. Specialists often take 1-2 years to see you.  So I'm sitting there and then she says ""but really, I'd like you to go home and just try to focus more for a few weeks.  Try completing a task before you move onto the next one.""

So I am sitting across from her completely at a loss for words.  There are tears in my eyes and I was very quiet.

Fortunately, with having new doctors they are supervised by experienced doctors.  So when all was said and done, she brought her conclusion to my actual doctor, and he said to her ""Just because she's dressed well and sitting up straight doesn't mean she doesn't have ADHD.  She has spoken with me and she seems intelligent and knows what she's talking about and I believe her.""

He then said that trying a low dose stimulant therapy is the easiest and fastest way to see if it will make a difference, unless I wanted to wait and see a specialist.

I feel so validated and I could have kissed my doctor.  The intern didn't have much to say about it after that.  My doctor is retiring at the end of the month and I'm so sad.

I'm just full of all sorts of emotions right now.

Starting my low dose this coming Monday."

Recently I got a job as a Linux sysadmin, and since I know there are some people interested in that route here, I thought I'd share my story.

Basically, I did a helpdesk internship when I was in school for my associate's in network admin. That helpdesk internship turned into a full time job on graduation. I should have aimed for higher than helpdesk, but oh well, it was a job with amazing benefits.

After working there for about a year, I made the jump to a tier 1-3 support role at another company. I stayed at this role for just under a year when stress forced me to quit. 

After recovering from stress induced illness, I got a job as server support on a 4 month contract. This job was  a goldmine because it allowed a lot of downtime. My coworkers all sat on their phones while I automated everything. I put that on my resume which made me stand out in my application for the Linux sysadmin job.

I applied for the Linux sysadmin job and after three interviews, I got it. I actually only applied to 2 jobs so I was fortunate that this one worked out.

If anyone has any questions, please let me know!"

I am about to get out of the military and will be going to school in the spring. I originally wanted to be a Physics major, since that’s the subject I want to learn about the most, but when I think about what I would want to do as a career I see myself more as designing or building something, which leads me more towards engineering, specifically Aerospace Engineering.

I would be interested in a Physics and Engineering double major, but that's a hard core course load and I’m not sure what practical benefit it would have. I’m thinking with my previous college credits and GI Bill benefits I could spread it out and make it more manageable. Outside of that, I am set on going into an AE program, the only thing I would consider besides AE is an Engineering Science or Physics Engineering program, I’m just not sure how a degree like that would work in the job market. With the economic downturn I have thought about that a lot more recently.

My ideal job would be working on rockets or satellites with one of the “New Space” companies, SpaceX being the obvious example but companies like RocketLab or Relativity also interest me. In a more traditional role, I think light jets like the Vision Jet and HondaJet are really cool. So working for Gulfstream or Cirrus would interest me.

My ideal school would be a small tech school in the southwest or California with strong industry connections. I like living in deserts and mountains so I’d prefer to live in the Western US, but my understanding is that when entering a STEM field the most important thing as an undergrad, besides maybe getting good grades, is the internships and research opportunities you have, so I’m mainly wanting to go to a school surrounded by the Aerospace industry.

So far I have got into Alaska-Fairbanks, UArizona and Arizona State, New Mexico State, Embry-Riddle (the AZ campus), Colorado State, New Mexico State, Iowa State, and Florida Tech. I’m thinking I can pretty much disregard Alaska and Iowa State. I’d love to live in Fairbanks, but I’m guessing I would be way too isolated for any good opportunities in Alaska. Same for Iowa State, I know they are a strong STEM school, but I think the Ames lab there doesn't do much with Aerospace.

As far as schools in the southwest, I think I can go ahead and disregard ASU and UArizona for myself as well. Nothing against the schools, but I’m not sure that they would offer anything that Embry-Riddle or NM State would, but they seem like huge leviathans. NM State seems like it would have lots of opportunity close by with White Sands and Spaceport America. I like Embry-Riddle since it is an aeronautical based school. I’m not sure what's going on in Prescott Arizona but they have their main campus in Daytona Beach, right next to the space coast.

Florida Tech is probably my favorite just based on the school itself, but I don't care too much for the humidity of Florida. But the school being extremely aerospace oriented and right next to KSC keeps me interested.

Colorado State doesn't have an Aerospace degree, but they have an engineering science degree with an emphasis in space engineering. It seems like something I would definitely be interested in, I’m just not sure how competitive I would be in the Aerospace industry or for a masters program with that degree.

I have applied to four CalState schools and CU Boulder, and may also apply to Virginia Tech, Purdue, and Illinois Tech. I have a 2.9 GPA my first time in college so applying to CU and Purdue are kind of Hail Marys for me. Are there any other programs I should look into?

Right now of the places I have got into I think Embry-Riddle is my top choice. It’s small and aerospace oriented, I just feel like their AZ campus is relatively isolated from the Aerospace community. Which I’m assuming could be solved by switching campuses to the Daytona Beach one. I really like Florida Tech as a school too, it’s just hard to convince myself to live in Florida when Embry-Riddle and NM State are still options. Colorado State seems great too, I just feel like I should probably get a real AE degree if I want to work in Aerospace.

If CU Boulder or CalPoly Pomona does accept me should that be my first choice? The only reservation I would have about them is they are big schools, but I think that’s probably out weighted by their location and reputation.

If anyone has any advice or thinks I have the wrong outlook or impression on things please let me know. I only have a fleeting knowledge of the Aerospace industry compared to most of you and am trying to make the best choice to set myself up. Thanks for your time."
i53m7u,31,2020-08-06,Best major for someone who wants to become an academic advisor?,Shshs2628,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/i53m7u/best_major_for_someone_who_wants_to_become_an/,"I spent my first year in exploratory studies taking a lot of different classes trying to figure out what I want to major in and pursue as a career.

I was reflecting and thinking about my future over the summer when it hit me - I want to be an academic advisor.

I am a sociable person and as an academic advisor I'd be able to connect with students personally to ensure they are on track to graduate and meet their goals on time. 

A lot of advisors at Purdue give bad advice; they tell students to retake classes - especially math classes - that they already have transfer credit for. If someone needs a form signature, their advisor might not respond to their email in a timely manner. I've also heard of some advisors being outright rude and condescending towards their students.

I don't want to be like those advisors. I want to devote my career to ensuring that Purdue students end up being successful by giving them sound advice (don't retake classes you have credit for, CODOing to CS is hard and not a realistic goal, test out of COM 114 if you're in FYE, etc.), emailing them regularly asking them how they're doing in their classes and if their mental health is holding up, sharing cool opportunities with them (internship, research, etc.) based on their future goals, and making sure that they leave Purdue ready to make their mark on the world.


A lot of people here have said that Purdue students should not rely on their advisor and do their own research as well. I want to change that. I want to be a reliable resource for college students. I don't just want to make sure they graduate on time, but suggest potential minors and classes that could help them based on their interests while also meeting degree requirements, be someone they can rant/vent to if things get tough, and be an emotional crutch.

I've always wanted to make an impact on the world. While engineering, coding, or business/economics may not be for me, it sure is for others and I want to make sure that they unleash their full potential and have a great time at Purdue by helping them make the right choices and ALWAYS being there for them - for their academic, personal, emotional, and professional needs.

So, what should I major in if I want to become an academic advisor?"

i559it,3,2020-08-06,Disastrous failure of middle management,heybaethrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i559it/disastrous_failure_of_middle_management/,"Hello, Reddit!

After reading a somewhat similar post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i46v0v/my_company_doesnt_fire_anyone/), figured I'd ask for some input regarding the company I work for.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated a couple of years ago, and have been working at a well-known tech company. The department I'm in has a few good developers, who are pulling not only their weights, but also the weights of ""senior"" engineers (seniority determined by number of years at the company, not actual skill levels). The latter are paid a lot more, and do a lot less work. Now, I'm not just saying ""yeah they suck"" out of the blue, some examples:

* Almost 2 lawsuits caused by leaking internal information (accidentally), or enabling data collection without authorization in production builds
* Flat out saying no to project managers when asked ""Hey, we need feature X in this release, can you please do it?"" (reasonable time and ask). In these cases, me and someone else had to pick up the slack
* These people get the easy tickets/things to fix, because the more complicated ones are done extremely inefficiently, and have to constantly be re-written (had to do this with someone else multiple times)
* For the most part, the senior developers get the easier tickets/defects to fix, and when something a little bit more complicated shows up, it's fixed in an extremely inefficient manner. Think an intern's first programming endeavor (nothing wrong with bad code on your first ever CS projects, but not from senior developers...)
* Constant ""Oh don't work too hard, remember to breathe, we will figure it out"" speeches from managers who do not know the domain (for reference, native team run by web developers/people with no training in the teams' work)
* Head of department never commits to project requirements/deadlines to justify shortcomings with ""Well we never committed to that, so we did nothing wrong here""
* Gaslighting to convince the hard-working people that they aren’t valuable: refusing promotions, giving bland performance reviews
* Ousting the valuable people by stealing their credit, but giving them all the responsibility

&amp;#x200B;

My two concerns/questions are:

1. I got pay bumps, but I am still in the same position officially as when I started several years back (I changed to my current position about 9 months in). Now, I'm not senior by title, but many people come to me for final architectural/code review say, it just started happening when all critical/high defects kept coming to me, and the other 1-2 devs who put in the work. I'm afraid this affects my resume badly, especially because my peers switched jobs after 1-2 years, and I've been here for 3-ish.
2. I got through the door at a FAANG company, which is a dream, but I am stuck waiting due to COVID logistics. My fear is being in limbo with them, and sticking with my current employer (hence more years at one place/position on resume, hence more concerns).

&amp;#x200B;

This company is a sinking ship - multiple rounds of lay-offs, no one gets fired (from everything I mentioned above, we ""fired"" some people due to their positions being eliminated during COVID, not due to the pretty terrible mistakes). People who have pointed out these shortcomings during employee reviews were:

1. Forced out of the department under the guise of ""We don't call out peoples' bad performances""
2. Had their transition times (to other departments) extended from weeks to months, under the guise of ""Well we want to have them teach new developers everything they know"", knowing full well no one is there to replace the people leaving and their knowledge set

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone run into this? Any input from maybe the more seasoned developers? (not excluding everyone, I'm mildly worried, and appreciate all feedback) I do have plenty of side projects I can publish/launch, so that's one way I can boost my resume, I've also kept practicing whiteboard questions in case point 2 above needs a re-interview. Thoughts? Thank you to everyone for reading this far!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Biology teacher/OM coach: we have a very close relationship! We've kept in touch since graduating and when I was homeless, I came to her and cried about it. Not sure how good she is at writing letters of rec, but she definitely believed in me and always sung my praises to anybody who would listen (even when I was around, like an embarrassing aunt). Probably a \~9-10/10

AP Lit/lang teacher: Again, we have a very close relationship and have kept in touch since graduating. She told me that I was the best writer she'd had in her classes ever as an English teacher, and has been pushing me to pursue a career in writing ever since I turned in my first essay. She knows of my struggle (particularly, in Junior year I missed a lot of school due to depression, and she was the teacher that responded the nicest and made me feel protected and valued, and helped me get back on track). She was also very strict, though. Probably 9/10.

Counselor: She serves like 300 total kids from my school (where there are a lot of kids with behavioral issues, on academic probation, etc) so she didn't have much time to focus on me until *after* I was accepted, but she definitely had a good impression of me. Probably 7-8/10.

**Interviews**

N/A

**Essays**

I spent a lot of time writing my essays, because I knew I had a strong voice and perspective and I wanted to showcase that. The rest of my stats (my ECs, really) are not exactly stellar so I think this is where I was able to really express who I was and what I was meaning to do for the world.

QB essays are set up differently from common app essays; some colleges require the common app, but only two (out of 12, the max you can rank) of mine did and not the one I got into, so I won't go into my common app essays.

My first main essay was about my struggle with mental illness and being on the brink of suicide, told with the context of my mother's own drug-induced mental break (which is what onset my issues). It was not a sob story, it was definitely sad but that is just because it was an entirely truthful essay; I wasn't trying to paint a pretty picture for the AOs to see, I wanted them to see who I was, truly, without any sort of strategy. I used a lot of imagery. I spoke most forcefully about (focused on) my triumph, how I overcame the problems of my childhood and adolescent years for the sake of my own future and my family's. I used the lines, ""the ability to succeed granted to me by an insatiable want to overcome.""

My second main essay was about my personal connection to a mass shooting that occurred in 2011 (nobody in my family was involved, but a girl in my school district whom I had met and interacted with was.) I focused on how my perspective shifted following that event, again with a lot of imagery.

The only other essay I spent a huge amount of time on was one of my short answers. It was, again, imagery-filled and about my experiences in my psychiatrist's office.

I can share my essays with anybody who thinks they would benefit, and would not share (there is a lot of personal information in them, I'm comfortable with people learning one-on-one but not for people to take and share them with a bunch of others.)

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Stanford University (QuestBridge National College Match) (Attending!!!)

(literally did not apply anywhere else afterward. I withdrew all of my other applications and sat there for 5 months)

**Additional Information:**

Something I wrote about in my additional information section that might've made a difference is that I was homeless during the college application process. From the beginning of my Senior year (August) to November, I was living in a hotel room and, at the time of submitting my apps, there was no end in sight. Thankfully I am housed now. But I think a huge part of why I was accepted was because my accomplishments were considered in context of what I had been going through, internally and financially. I also went to three different schools over my high school career, which I mentioned.

I sincerely encourage anyone who has struggled, anybody who has had to forego eating dinner to pay rent or has been homeless or is low-income or is mentally ill, to apply to colleges -- the 'prestigious' ones, too -- and spend a good amount of time focusing on your essays and how to convey those things, your perspective. ALSO, UTILIZE QUESTBRIDGE! College is not as far away or as big as you think it is, ESPECIALLY if you are high-achieving. Especially at schools like Stanford, perspectives like mine are so often unseen and unrepresented. If we do exist, we're drowned out by the competitive and money-hungry and money-borne perspectives, the ones who were able to afford tutors and didn't have to walk home from school or worry about their family's finances. Say that. Let the colleges know that you, albeit underserved, are net *stronger* than those who had more, because you can succeed without having everything at your fingertips. That, I think, is an incredibly powerful statement and probably why I got in where I did.

For those of you who don't have a powerful perspective or 'hook' to work off of, I think being honest and focusing less on the sometimes-hollow parts of what you think colleges want from you (the ECs, the awards, the grades, the test scores) will help you a lot. That shit just gets your foot in the door, especially for more prestigious universities. Work hard on your essays and compel the AOs to think of you as a person, an interesting one, who is more than just someone who is obsessed with academics and extracurriculars. Universities, especially prestigious ones, aren't looking for the next drone from a competitive high school whose grades and test scores and ECs are perfect. They are looking for *people*, people who are able to be vulnerable and more than single-minded academic robots, people who are open-minded and will add something to their campus community beyond the classes.

Sorry, I rambled there.

TL;DR: focus on making your essays human, like you are. You are not just your academics, you are not just your circumstance. Own it, all of it."

Also, is it necessary to talk to my academic advisor, or is it okay to just file a request myself? I have emailed my advisor several times, but they are on break and haven't responded yet and I'm worried that this will be delaying it further, so if I don't have to talk to them and can do it directly, I'd like to get it done and over with.

It seems like something I would definitely be interested in, I’m just not sure how competitive I would be in the Aerospace industry or for a masters program with that degree.

I have applied to four CalState schools and CU Boulder, and may also apply to Virginia Tech, Purdue, and Illinois Tech. I have a 2.9 GPA my first time in college so applying to CU and Purdue are kind of Hail Marys for me. Are there any other programs I should look into?

Right now of the places I have got into I think Embry-Riddle is my top choice. It’s small and aerospace oriented, I just feel like their AZ campus is relatively isolated from the Aerospace community. Which I’m assuming could be solved by switching campuses to the Daytona Beach one. I really like Florida Tech as a school too, it’s just hard to convince myself to live in Florida when Embry-Riddle and NM State are still options. Colorado State seems great too, I just feel like I should probably get a real AE degree if I want to work in Aerospace.

If CU Boulder or CalPoly Pomona does accept me should that be my first choice? The only reservation I would have about them is they are big schools, but I think that’s probably out weighted by their location and reputation.

If anyone has any advice or thinks I have the wrong outlook or impression on things please let me know. I only have a fleeting knowledge of the Aerospace industry compared to most of you and am trying to make the best choice to set myself up. Thanks for your time."

I just graduated college (degree in Comp Sci) and was just hired as a DevOps engineer at a company. I was initially hoping for a SWE role, but was placed in DevOps due to my past internship experience in DevOps teams (Mostly full-stack with DevOps on the side). 

I enjoy messing around with config management/deployment tooling, building CI/CD pipelines, and doing containerization stuff. The company in question is doing some containerization and AWS lambda stuff and my team is building tooling around serverless and pipelines. I'm pumped for the tech and the fact we're following the ""philosophy"" which is having everyone take ownership of their code and having DevOps actually developing instead of just manually deploying stuff.

The part I'm worried about is my job outlook compared to SWE. I don't know anything about the job market for DevOps, especially during the pandemic. I know SWE's can command a high salary at good tech companies in the bay area, but is it the same for DevOps? What about management positions? All the managers I know were SWEs. Then there's the part where we're not treated the same as SWEs since we're looked down upon, not building features, but just keeping everything inline.

Am I like freaking out too much? I want to enjoy DevOps, but thinking about this just makes me want to try to switch to SWE when I get the chance."

I graduated from a university with an electrical engineering degree that has a great coop program where we are able to be placed in at least five coops to graduate with a great database to help us land positions. My problem is that my last three internships, to many people are some of the most important ones that will define the rest of the next five years, were some of the worst I ever had. They were mostly vaguely related to what I want to do but it has been difficult to get into the industry I want to work in. I'm constantly unable to sleep nowadays due to the frustrations and shame I feel from those times.
These positions had a lack of career support, workplace training, and I was overall treated as an unimportant colleague. I hardly ever made friends either since, although I tried by following up on others with questions, most of them just ignored me. The work they gave me hardly is even worth talking about since all I mostly did was schematic review and pointing out errors in documentation. Recently it has really got to my since recent interviews I've had at great companies I'd love to work ask about my internships and their enthusiasm drops when I explain what I did. To those who had have had bad internships, did it ever get better after?"

Still relatively new to Excel but I've been working with Excel VBA for the past 2 months for my internship.

Noticed that after formatting this dataset (PLT\_CLOSED worksheet) as a Table, this particular data valuation/mapping has been very slow. Prior to this, the dataset was raw &amp; not formatted as a table &amp; I noticed that the macro ran a lot faster back then. Note that I'm only working with about 37K rows of lines, so it's weird that those data mapping take about 10 minutes. This was on my work laptop, results are just slightly better on our remote server.

Pics here! [https://imgur.com/a/LapJnLT](https://imgur.com/a/LapJnLT) 

PS: I tried Unlist() on the Table &amp; sure enough, the VBA only took about 1 minute to complete

TLDR: Does formatting a dataset as a Table cause VBA to perform slower? What gives?"

One of my full-time offers fell through after the pandemic broke out, and I've been quarantining with my mom and sister upstate (I'm usually in the city). 

Basically, to preface this with how I'm feeling - I just feel like I'm failing my parents. Post-graduation, I'm feeling anxious and frightened for my future, but I also don't want to embarrass my family. COVID has changed so many things around me, 

My mom, who's always been the stereotypical 'tiger mom', surprisingly was understanding. She told me that an opportunity would eventually come, and I shouldn't be too hung up on it, especially because it was COVID related. A month later, I got a paid summer internship at a decent place - she was really happy. One of my supervisors also asked if I'd be open to full-time last week, so I excitedly told my mom, and things started to look up. 

Week later, my supervisor informs me that after discussing with his bosses, they're financially unable to take on a new hire. I was too embarrassed to tell my mom candidly about this, so I deflected and kept dropping things that I didn't like the company, etc etc - well, she eventually detected something was up and just straight up asked, ""Did you not get an offer, is that why you're looking for new jobs?"" 

I kinda broke and ended up telling her what happened - she was surprisingly, really understanding. For context, my mom was pretty intense when I was younger, the 'tiger mom' mode always stressed me out to always do better, and that idleness wasn't an option. But I guess she mellowed out a bit, because she told me I should have been honest with her instead of deflecting and pretending I didn't like the job, and told me that it's ok, and that's life. She also told me it's okay, as I can keep job searching in the mean-time, and that a good opportunity will come. 

I almost threw up from how much guilt I felt. I lost out on a job opportunity, once again, it felt like I was just....incapable of doing anything.

My dad lives in Korea and works 24/7, in spite of being busy, we managed to find a time and I called him that night. I basically sobbed to my dad over the phone about how I feel like I'm a failure to him and my mom - it was pretty bad. But he kept telling me to be kinder to myself, and that by graduating college alone, he's proud of me and that I'm doing great. This just made me feel even guiltier about just...existing. Once again I had this jolt of guilt, that I don't deserve them. 

But my dad kept telling me to worry less, and try to live life with less stress, I guess he sensed how tense I was. 

How should I go about this? Do you think therapy would be helpful, or should I change the way I think? How do I stop feeling constant guilt?"

College is supposed to be the best time of your life, but my experience in college has been almost entirely devoted to passing all of my classes. The worst part of it is that all of my hard work isn't even going to matter because I spent so much time on my schoolwork that I neglected other necessities, such as personal projects and internships. Now I am going to graduate with practically no marketable skills or experience. It feels like I threw away the past four years of my life for nothing."
i5fuk4,1,2020-08-07,I'm worried about my future/what I should do next?,Kea500,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/i5fuk4/im_worried_about_my_futurewhat_i_should_do_next/,"Hi everyone, I'm new to the platform and could really use some advice regarding job searching and potentially switching careers altogether.

For some background: I'm 24 years old. I majored in journalism (print concentration) and graduated in the top 1% of my class. I loved my major and area of study, but when I got into school in 2014 I had no idea I was entering into a dying field. My dad passed away when I was very young and both of my parents came to America to pursue a career and education. This is important to note because my mom to this day is not culturally aware/does not understand American life, culture, professional life, finances, etc. I've taught her a lot of things as best as I know how but I'm only 24 so I still don't know much about anything and have so much to learn. My mom got a bachelor's degree when I was in high school and has a great career now. I'm so proud of her, but she is not someone who I can go to professional advice. Yes, she has a great career, but she still struggles with language barriers and it's difficult for us to communicate since I was born here. Although we both speak English and her native language, I still struggle to express myself fully in our other language whereas she struggles the same way with English.

If I could go back in time, I would have chosen a different major, but I truly did not know any better. Upon graduating I thought about going to law school so I worked for an attorney for 1 year. I saw what their day to day life was like and although I'm grateful for the experience, it was hell on earth and there is no way I want to go into law. I decided to go into real estate after giving my notice and still am currently work as a realtor. I live in a big city in the US so I've been making a respectable amount and I'm close to paying off all of my student loans (not much thanks to scholarships) but I'm ecstatic about it.

Here is where I'm freaking out. I don't want to be a real estate agent forever. I want to invest in properties, but I know that's going to take some time. I really like the company I'm with, and my broker (boss) is a great man to work with, although as time goes on I see that he really has no loyalty to anyone but himself and competes with me and the two other people in our small office  (which in our initial meeting he said his office is a non-competing brokers office so he lied), and this is despite him already having built a crazy successful life for himself. It's greedy but that's a story for another day. 

My lease is coming to an end in September and I'm either going to be moving back in with my mom or somewhere else in the city where my rent will be much more affordable and will allow me to save even more than I am now. 

Overall - I'm insanely worried about my future. I'm nearing 25 and I don't have a career. I'm constantly worried about my next paycheck and the uncertainty of when the next deal is going to come. I've been out of college for 2 years and I still feel just as lost, if not more, than when I graduated. I completed prestigious/competitive internships in journalism while I was in school, and it's something I love, but I know that the field is struggling. I thought I was going to go to law school but that didn't work. I thought real estate would really pan out, and I've only been doing it for 6 months, but I worry about my future. I don't have financial stability which is super important to me. I've been applying for jobs since I left my position working with the attorney and that was one year ago. I'm thinking about going into teaching, but the positions pay almost nothing. I'm so grateful my mom is helping me financially, but I want her to save all the money she's using to help me. I'm an adult and I want to be self-sufficient. I understand my generation is in hard times, but I want to make a living wage and I don't think that's a lot to ask for. I was stunned when I got an offer yesterday for $20,000 for teaching. The school is struggling to retain their teachers and that's all I was offered... that's enough to help me pay for a used car and the gas for the total 2 hour commute it takes to get there and back home. 

I don't know if I should keep trying with teaching, agree to be underpaid for 1 year, apply to grad school, work my tail off and hope to get into a top tier education masters program for 1 year, and then earn a more decent salary as a teacher; try a completely different field like business analyst where I can really use my communication and research skills; stick with real estate which I do enjoy but am concerned for lack of financial stability; go back into journalism; or go back and get a masters degree in something completely unrelated to my background and goes against my strengths like engineering. Aren't only the best of the best in STEM fields hired anyways?

I'm not making a living wage and I'm scared for my life and my future. Never in my life have I felt so alone and worried about my future. I have no idea what direction to turn in. I am currently on my mom's insurance plan and have contacted numerous 30+ psychologists/career counselors but no one has gotten back to me or is not accepting new patients. I have no one to talk to about this. I'm losing sleep, my appetite, and I'm worried about my health. 

Can someone please offer me some advice or share your experience?"

My mom got a bachelor's degree when I was in high school and has a great career now. I'm so proud of her, but she is not someone who I can go to professional advice. Yes, she has a great career, but she still struggles with language barriers and it's difficult for us to communicate since I was born here. Although we both speak English and her native language, I still struggle to express myself fully in our other language whereas she struggles the same way with English.

If I could go back in time, I would have chosen a different major, but I truly did not know any better. Upon graduating I thought about going to law school so I worked for an attorney for 1 year. I saw what their day to day life was like and although I'm grateful for the experience, it was hell on earth and there is no way I want to go into law. I decided to go into real estate after giving my notice and still am currently work as a realtor. I live in a big city in the US so I've been making a respectable amount and I'm close to paying off all of my student loans (not much thanks to scholarships) but I'm ecstatic about it.

Here is where I'm freaking out. I don't want to be a real estate agent forever. I want to invest in properties, but I know that's going to take some time. I really like the company I'm with, and my broker (boss) is a great man to work with, although as time goes on I see that he really has no loyalty to anyone but himself and competes with me and the two other people in our small office  (which in our initial meeting he said his office is a non-competing brokers office so he lied), and this is despite him already having built a crazy successful life for himself. It's greedy but that's a story for another day. 

My lease is coming to an end in September and I'm either going to be moving back in with my mom or somewhere else in the city where my rent will be much more affordable and will allow me to save even more than I am now. 

Overall - I'm insanely worried about my future. I'm nearing 25 and I don't have a career. I'm constantly worried about my next paycheck and the uncertainty of when the next deal is going to come. I've been out of college for 2 years and I still feel just as lost, if not more, than when I graduated. I completed prestigious/competitive internships in journalism while I was in school, and it's something I love, but I know that the field is struggling. I thought I was going to go to law school but that didn't work. I thought real estate would really pan out, and I've only been doing it for 6 months, but I worry about my future. I don't have financial stability which is super important to me. I've been applying for jobs since I left my position working with the attorney and that was one year ago. I'm thinking about going into teaching, but the positions pay almost nothing. I'm so grateful my mom is helping me financially, but I want her to save all the money she's using to help me. I'm an adult and I want to be self-sufficient. I understand my generation is in hard times, but I want to make a living wage and I don't think that's a lot to ask for. I was stunned when I got an offer yesterday for $20,000 for teaching. The school is struggling to retain their teachers and that's all I was offered... that's enough to help me pay for a used car and the gas for the total 2 hour commute it takes to get there and back home. 

I don't know if I should keep trying with teaching and agree to be underpaid for 1 year, apply to grad school, work my tail off and hope to get into a top tier education masters program for 1 year, and then earn a more decent salary as a teacher; try a completely different field like business analyst where I can really use my communication and research skills; stick with real estate which I do enjoy but am concerned for lack of financial stability; go back into journalism; or go back and get a masters degree in something completely unrelated to my background and goes against my strengths like engineering. Aren't only the best of the best in STEM fields hired anyways?

I'm not making a living wage and I'm scared for my life and my future. Never in my life have I felt so alone and worried about my future. I have no idea what direction to turn in. I am currently on my mom's insurance plan and have contacted numerous 30+ psychologists/career counselors but no one has gotten back to me or is not accepting new patients. I have no one to talk to about this. I'm losing sleep, my appetite, and I'm worried about my health. 

Can someone please offer me some advice or share your experience?"

We started our searches very early, saught advice from Career Services and Instructors, and are doing everything in our ability to find something. Typically, in junior year, it's recommended to have the internship done by summer. Unfortunately, as you may know, the pandemic has affected all of our lives across the world greatly.

This summer, our program gave an exception to complete a research opportunity to have that count because of the pandemic. However, unfortunately, some of us have either not taken interest, or have been unable to complete research due to health complications (such as myself). It will only be much more difficult to find something next summer. A co-op is out of the question, it would be best to continue completing the remaining courses we have, in my opinion during their designated semesters.

I fear that we will be unable to find anything and will not be able to graduate because of this. After all, this is required for the ABET accreditation. I find it a little silly to be denied to move on in life, and be defaulted into debt from this one thing. If I had this foresight and realized what I was doing before applying, I wouldn't have chosen engineering. I'm too far along though, and I must unfortunately see this through to the end.

Speaking on my own situation, even if I were to get something, I am concerned about my incompetency. I have gained an absolutely terrible impression of the ""industry"" (as my instructor urges), and I fear I will not be qualified enough to meet expectations. Much is expected even from interns, which I already understood, but especially during this time a lot of things are up in the air. I have already shown struggle with working from home.

My instructor told me students in the past did their internship after their courses, and were allowed to walk with their classmates, but only if they had something lined up. Throughout junior year, I even applied to every single opportunity my instructor found and shared with the class. I feel that even without the pandemic affecting normal life since last March, no one would've wanted me anyways, since I never get any replies to applications or responses to follow-ups either (or I'm met with an automated message and nothing more).

I feel utterly hopeless. I don't know what my instructors will do with me and the rest of us who are still trying to get something.

Are we doomed?"

My mom really wants me to get into day trading and literally any conversation we have, she can somehow connect it back to trading. 

For example, I was telling her about the interesting classes I want to take during college and somehow that led to her saying, “Instead of doing that, you should really study how to do day trading blah blah.” 

Or if I tell her how great my internship is going and how excited I am to start working at my full-time job, she says, “well the pay and reward would be better if you pursued day trading.”

=_=

My mom hasn’t even realized any of these “rewards” and isn’t even a day trader herself!! I have a great career starting, no problems in my college studies, and yet she goes on and on about pursuing something I clearly don’t think I can succeed in! Then she acts depressed like I didn’t hear a word she said.

I know basically nobody there and will have no support system, and all the avenues to building them are gone now due to covid. I have adhd, and severe anxiety and depression. My dog is at my family’s house and all my friends are here. I would have no emotional anchor there. 

I know I should feel lucky to have a job, but I don’t see myself not sinking into a very dark place down this path and likely taking my life at some point. That is how awful my experience was last year.

For those in a bad job, particularly one where you feel overworked, inferior, ground to a nub: what should I do? Is it worth it to not be unemployed during this crazy economic period?"

I've been working with this company for a while now and I always told the CTO I wanted to be an SWE here , and he said it's probably not going to happen (Since they are a Health Care Tech Company don't have projects to give me). Ever since COVID happened the companies concept switched workings and prompted work for a Jr Software Engineer (Did not know this). I spoke to our CEO and said I'm leaving because I got an Internship at this other company for Software Engineering (It wasn't a very good Internship anyways). He said don't leave we will give you software engineering projects and I joined a call with our CTO and he gave me my first project. I just completed the first iteration of the project. So I join the development meeting and the first thing and he says ""In 3 months MYNAME should be joining the development team full time""  I was so excited because I'm not even out of college yet and really wanted a job as an SWE.

My question to Reddit. Is it worth it? The tech stack is Java JSP and MongoDB. I'm afraid if I move with this fulltime-it may be hard to get a job in the future since it's quite outdated and I might not have my degree. However, the CTO is very smart (EX Sr SWE @ Google) and I do think I could learn alot of things school cannot. Is it worth doing this and taking school part-time? I have about 45 credits left to go and unsure if I should finish school fulltime and not be an engineer or be an engineer and take school part-time."

I’ve knocked all my gen eds out of the way at a local community college, as well as dipped my toes in the water with some introductory CS courses that focused on C++, C#, and Java that the CC offered.

I’ve recently joined Reddit, and I’ve been reading a lot of posts in the various computer science subreddits. I’ve seen that many student have already secured internships, have side projects, and in general have a lot more going on than me as sophomores and even freshman to build themselves for their compsci career. And so I’ve come to this crashing realization that I’ve done nothing of the kind. I’ve went to school for a few years, but I’ve not interned. I’ve not done any projects besides class projects. I’m feeling anxious and like I’ve messed up because it looks as though all those steps are crucial in securing a job after undergrad, so now I’m worried about not being employable due to lack of experience.

I’m also having a severe case of imposter syndrome. I truly don’t think I’d qualify for any internships at the moment due to my lack of knowledge, further exacerbating my anxiety of being behind. Ultimately I want any advice/tips/guidance that can be offered to prepare me. How bad is my ‘situation’? Am I truly behind, or is my anxiety getting the best of me? Do you have any relevant experience that can be offered that may be helpful? When should I look into internships, given that I’m only now starting core classes this year? Where do I even begin to look for internships? How much experience can a grad reasonably be expected to have? I’m nervous af, y’all. Please offer me whatever words you can."

I’m living at home alone with her and quarantine is putting a huge strain on our relationship. I just graduated undergrad (in 3 years), and I’m now applying for PhD programs. I had 2 internships lined up to do in my year off between undergrad and grad school, and both got cancelled bc covid. I’m pretty down but doing a lot to keep going, like getting scuba certified, I read a bunch, go on walks, and I’m putting a lot of time into my research and grad apps. 

My mom still *literally* screams at me (I am 21!!!) about how I am just “moping around” and how I need to get a job (we’re moving in a month so no one will hire me for just a few weeks). I also am still really deeply missing college and my friends who I abruptly can’t see anymore bc the pandemic. I once said “it feels like there’s nowhere I can look for relief”, which is true, and she took it extremely personally and screamed at me and told me to move out and live somewhere else and to stop taking things out on her.

If I don’t share enough with her, she gets and angry with me for “being rude” but whenever I do share things with her, she takes everything I say so personally and gets so angry at me. Like I can’t mention I’m sad/upset when I’m living at home, because she takes that as me telling her I hate living at home (which she’s making true). 

She also brings up extreme rage that stems from her anger with her mother and from things that she got mad at me about months ago, and it feels like I’m always in the wrong. 

Also she is your typical workaholic, like works 60-80 hours a week, never exercises, eats like one giant meal a day. And she has the nerve to get on me about “moping around”? Do you all ever want to just point the finger back at them? She tries to talk to me like I’m a child and she’s some know all, health guru adult, but treats herself like shit. I can’t even talk to her like an adult and raise concern for her lifestyle because she won’t listen to me like an adult. She’s incredibly hypocritical. 

Do anyone else’s parents do this? She’ll deny any self awareness or true effort to learn how I’m feeling, and always takes what I say personally. She won’t even talk through grad school things with me because she thinks I talk about it bc I hate living at home, so she just says “nice” every time I bring it up... and that’s it... couldn’t possibly be because it’s a HUGE decision that I need help with 🙄

How do you all stay confident with who you are and reassure yourselves in these situations? Any tips for how to not internalize their hurtful anger tantrums? How do you reassure yourself that you did nothing wrong and don’t need to feel guilty for leaving home/growing more distant from your parents? 

I hope y’all are safe and well ❤️ thank you for reading :)

TL;DR: I’m 21, ready to move on to grad school, all my internships/work opportunities got cancelled and I’m pretty down about it, and my ap is... mad at me about it? How do I not destroy my self esteem/self worth? Pls send ur best advice ❤️"

About to hit my second year in my program after having a great first year. However, after some pretty brutal portfolio reviews, my industry suffering from COVID, and what appears to be an inner circle in my industry, I’m wondering if it’s time to see someone for my blues or just get some coaching to help me pursue my career. 

At the end of our first year, an advisory council examined our portfolios, a mix of visual and written artwork. My line of work will be more written however our council is heavily visual. At my current job, we have an amazing culture of candor and feedback based upon observation and a sense of “gift-giving.” (I know this sounds particularly idealistic.) Meanwhile after reeling from my portfolio review, I was informed by my visual art cohort members that comments made by our council such as “kindergarten level” is just normal harsh feedback and some of us were being too sensitive. 

My cohort talked me off the ledge from thinking it best (financially especially) to just leave my program. 

Fast forward through COVID and creatives the world over are furloughed and laid off. Some members of our industry have created support networks and even created a workshop series to reach out to beginning level career artists in dire need of experience. Through LinkedIn, it was revealed that each and every admitted participant has prior internships (sometimes multiple) or even works in the industry already. It felt odd seeing those with experience continue to gain more in a workshop that claims to be outreach for those without opportunities. 

Through my workplace, I went through a one-time coaching session addressing my need to compare. It’s helped a lot. I do not feel mad at strangers anymore for what they earn although I still find systems at times unfair. But I did some self work. My cohort has been incredibly encouraging and kind, along with my faculty and my SO. 

Fast forward to the present, I find I’m losing my drive (COVID depression?) and my cohort members who once told me to stop comparing are now venting to me about the opportunities that the inner circle industry colleagues continue to get. 

I know I need to just work harder. I know their success is not my failure. Others say I am talented at my line of work although I struggle to see it right now. I also struggle to continue to work on myself and instead try to seek comfort in entertainment (reading) or sleeping.

I thought I should utilize my school’s counseling center but it dawned on me that maybe I need a career coach? I would love to hear other people’s experiences and advice. I know I could technically complete this program but I’m terrified I won’t do enough to get a job.

TL;DR: Comparison is the thief of joy and I struggle with this a lot. I should work harder but I feel down. Do I need a therapist or a career coach?"

All things considered, I feel like I'm dealing with it decently, but I just don't want to lose my dad. I feel like I didn't get to spend as much time with him as I wanted and I'm just sad he's most likely going to miss out and all the things I want him to be in my life.

He had a stroke five years ago and his life and health has been generally miserable. I mostly feel bad for him more than anything else. He just lost his dad less than a month ago and now his health is rapidly declining.

i5wmyc,3,2020-08-08,Made a post a few days ago about failing to get a return offer and actually being let go/fired for under-performance before it officially ended. Had some time to think about how I can improve. Curious to hear people's thoughts or any stories of people bouncing back from something similar.,sadinterngalnoreturn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i5wmyc/made_a_post_a_few_days_ago_about_failing_to_get_a/,"This was at a FAANG/equivalent for under-performance. The reasons were probably a combination of things, including being my first time working remotely, having to learn an non-intuitive language for the first time (at least to me), largely doing backend work for the first time, having a mentor with really high expectations, etc. For reference, I was at FAANG and other tech companies for 2-3 other internships in the past before this and always had positive reviews and completed my project. I'm good at LC and I usually don't have trouble getting the job once I get an interview (in the past have gotten offers from FAANG, Unicorns, Hot Startups, Hedge Funds/Prop Shops, etc.). Needless to say this has been pretty demoralizing either way. Luckily, I have another fall internship lined up at another FAANG/equivalent but I'm assuming a lot of the variables might be similar given the situation and the last thing I want is a similar situation to happen. I've thought about some things I should do moving forward and would appreciate any thoughts.

1. Define clear expectations with my manager as soon as possible.
2. More frequent meetings with manager.
3. Ask for time to pair program, especially in the beginning.
4. Instead of only going to my mentor, try to find out other team members that would be helpful as well.
5. Ask for a project where I'm already familiar with the language or at least some technologies.
6. Before working on a ticket and being lost, ask for context knowledge and use cases.
7. Try to learn theory behind languages/concepts outside of work so my work time can be spent implementing things and pushing out as much code as possible.
8. Put in more hours (\~10) when starting.

You have a year and a half of experience (internship included) in your field and you would ideally like to stay in the same industry. The caveat: it is a relatively competitive one, making it rather difficult to land a permanent offer. 

Your best friend tells you about an opening in the company they work for (an extremely sweet gesture you are very grateful for). However, it is not the industry and role you are aiming for. It requires relocation (although you will have to relocate once again since there are no jobs whatsoever where you live - the question is where). The obvious pros are that you will be earning money (although you do have savings that would cover you for the next few months, plus you live extremely modestly anyway) + you will avoid having a big gap in your resume. However, you are a bit afraid that it would make you deviate from your desired career field, and HRs in said field are notorious about only hiring people who have experience in this industry (so outsiders can't break in). But then again, sometimes you think that maybe you are just delusional, you are not good enough for what you desire, you are aiming too high; plus, you don't really have that many connections (as you are more of an introvert) so maybe landing your top-choice job is not realistic anyway and you should adjust you expectations.

Sprinkle a little bit of coronacrisis and uncertainty on top.

What do you do? When is the right time to adjust your expectations?"

 Currently i am planning on doing a masters degree in either Information systems or Information technology, possibly DevOps.   ( in my country you can do unrelated masters with your bachelor's degree ) . 


I was wondering if it would be a problem to find a job with unrelated degrees in EU ?

I did an internship in Germany as a web developer, some time ago . I worked for a small startup and it didnt really work out. This time around i want to be better prepared and find more stable, long term opportunity. 

Will my Masters degree in IT help with getting more interviews ? I know that certificates and specialization is more impprtant, but i'm concerned about having an unrelated degres.

I  am international student applying for fall 21 in Stem courses ( Mostly  Electrical engineering or Data science). I have built my decent profile  with good number of publication in reputed conferences and journal.  I  have spent 2 years working with professor as a RA. I have done decent  internship in Multi-national company.

Only  drawback that i think right now is my course is less reputed. My Course  is one of the oldest in my country but not highly rated and less known  in international academia.

Will less reputed undergrad program hinder my chances to get into top Grad school? How can I overcome this issue?"

Ideally this would be in something regularly used in industry, potentially which applicants often overlook or don't know about.

Just a bit of background info: I'm a first (going into second) year mechanical engineering student in the UK, and have found myself with lots of spare time again after finishing the restoration of my project car from scratch over the last few summer months. My Uni offers several certified IT courses on general office software which seem like a good option to complete  before I return in late September (I'd consider myself fairly IT literate but it would be good to have it in writing), and I have already completed the Fusion 360 certified user course. I have a reasonable amount of experience with Python, 3D printing, Simulation software, and have taught myself some C++ as part of another project, but I don't have a more formal recognition of this.

I've tried hard working on other areas (Good grades, lots of extra curricular clubs, activities and positions such as Formula Student, Club Executive committee etc) but I'd like to try and add these finishing touches whilst making sure I'm not sitting around for the rest of summer

Long story short, I was not at all a career-driven person in high school (still am not to be brutally honest) and so when an engineering scholarship miraculously landed in my lap due to good grades and impeccable timing, I took up the offer.  \~6 years later (4 years of school, 2 years in an internship program) I am having a hard time staying motivated in my field when deep down I feel like I'm still that stupid teenager who just wants to stay home and play video games or develop other non-STEM hobbies.  I shiver at the thought of having to spend any of my ""Precious Free Time (TM)"" practicing my engineering skills when I """"""""""""earned"""""""""""""" that free time on the weekends and should be free to blow it off as i see fit (aka, video games).  I'm 25 years old and while on paper I should be \*extremely\* grateful to be in the position that I am, I am starting to grow weary of my position and am scared that I'm stuck in my field with little wiggle room due to my limited expertise (I was very much the ""Cs make degrees"" kid in college) and I'm scared to go back to school if I want to do something else.  The people around me actively enjoy their career and take huge stock in STEM in terms of economics, career, and even hobbies.  I'm struggling because while my adult self wants to be a good worker and gain everyone's respect, my child self is still screaming and crying because he wants everything to go back to the way it was in high school when he had no responsibilities.  What complicates all of this is the fact that (due to my borderline autistic tendencies imo) I don't really have any goals or dreams that drive me to excel and achieve.  The biggest thing is that I want to have my own place to live and even that's kind of basic since I don't feel the need to own the ""nicest"" house or have the ""fanciest"" car.  I don't even want to get married or have kids because it seems like a giant hassle to me (again, autism).  My conscience is telling me to grow the hell up, but deep down I'm kind of resentful of the fact that I don't even know what I want out of life other than independence and simplicity."

I'm having a massive difficulty at work and now I'm even getting anxieties going to work. 

I have Economics / Computer Science (more of statistics) background and I've always wanted to mix these two skillsets. Also I wanted to work somewhere with a good culture and smart colleagues and opportunities to be creative. 

Well, I've just got an internship at the dream job 2 months ago and now I've realized that my skills are way behind others (including other interns). I think they employed me because of my particular skill written on the resume and I never lied about anything but it just turned out that their expectation of that skill was higher than what I can achieve.

It's kind of a software company in the finance field although I can't reveal any specifics. It's purely meritocratic culture and there are not many cooperative works aside from work-related discussions.

I'm having a massive difficulty at work and now I'm even getting anxieties going to work. 

I have Economics / Computer Science (more of statistics) background and I've always wanted to mix these two skillsets. Also I wanted to work somewhere with a good culture and smart colleagues and opportunities to be creative. I had some fantasies about the Quantitative Finance field. 

Well, I've just got an internship at the dream job 2 months ago and now I've realized that my skills are way behind others (including other interns). I think they employed me because of my particular skill written on the resume and I never lied about anything but it just turned out that their expectation of that skill was higher than what I can achieve.

It's purely meritocratic culture and there are not many cooperative works aside from work-related discussions. You gotta come up with an idea how to add value to the company's $$ profit and that value is numerically measured. 

My metrics suck and I added no value to the company for the past 2 months.

It's really frustrating to get into a dream job and later find out that your skills are not yet mature to stay in that job. What should I do? Would I ever be able to get another quant job? Would it be even wise to pursue this career when my first attempt went to failure when I'm getting older day by day?"
i6bowb,2,2020-08-08,Made a post a few days ago on /r/cscq about failing to get a return offer and actually being let go/fired for under-performance before it officially ended. Had some time to think about how I can improve. Curious to hear people's thoughts or any stories of people bouncing back from something similar.,sadinterngalnoreturn,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/i6bowb/made_a_post_a_few_days_ago_on_rcscq_about_failing/,"This was at a FAANG/equivalent for under-performance. The reasons were probably a combination of things, including being my first time working remotely, having to learn an non-intuitive language for the first time (at least to me), largely doing backend work for the first time, having a mentor with really high expectations, etc. For reference, I was at FAANG and other tech companies for 2-3 other internships in the past before this and always had positive reviews and completed my project. I'm good at LC and I usually don't have trouble getting the job once I get an interview (in the past have gotten offers from FAANG, Unicorns, Hot Startups, Hedge Funds/Prop Shops, etc.). Needless to say this has been pretty demoralizing either way. Luckily, I have another fall internship lined up at another FAANG/equivalent but I'm assuming a lot of the variables might be similar given the situation and the last thing I want is a similar situation to happen. I've thought about some things I should do moving forward and would appreciate any thoughts.

1. Define clear expectations with my manager as soon as possible.
2. More frequent meetings with manager.
3. Ask for time to pair program, especially in the beginning.
4. Instead of only going to my mentor, try to find out other team members that would be helpful as well.
5. Ask for a project where I'm already familiar with the language or at least some technologies.
6. Before working on a ticket and being lost, ask for context knowledge and use cases.
7. Try to learn theory behind languages/concepts outside of work so my work time can be spent implementing things and pushing out as much code as possible.
8. Put in more hours (\~10) when starting.

i6c58c,1,2020-08-08,Is a reference check request at the end of an interview a good sign or just normal procedure?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/i6c58c/is_a_reference_check_request_at_the_end_of_an/,"Coming from an industry I worked in before where I got jobs through ""who I knew"" this was the first time I've actually had a professional interview.

I applied for an entry level programming internship job last week after months of self studying and passed the pre-screening interview asking me questions where I got a reply that I would be contacted if successful for a 2nd interview as they were short listing applications at this stage. I got selected for a 2nd interview which was yesterday.

It went really well I think and lasted about 45 minutes. The interviewer was one of the top managers for this division of the company I'm applying for and really an awesome guy. I felt the vibe that he really liked talking to me, laughed a lot and was really engaging. He told me and discussed an awful lot about the job... responsibilities, hours, my day schedule, location, activities to do in the area and what expenses are covered to relocate me (it's pretty far) etc and of course questions regarding me why I'm fit for the role. Eye contact, me asking questions about the company and himself, duties all of it I pretty much ticked off the list.

Before finishing the interview however he said it was nice meeting me and moving forward to email him two references and they will let me know by Wednesday at the latest with their decision as they have interviewed other applicants also. I know it would be by then as they are wanting someone to start very soon and will fly the person out that weekend to start on Monday.

Anyway I have never been asked to send in references before. Granted I had trustworthy references already confirmed and sent them by email within the hour but I am wondering if this is a common practice regarding interviews for moderately big companies? If so is this a good sign or just normal procedures?"

I’m currently still in university but it seems that my programs largest weakness is providing us with a useful statistical knowledge. The current company I intern for is relatively small and there doesn’t seem to be a good base of statistical knowledge. 
I’d really like to get some resources that explain how and when to use statistical methods during verification and validation activities. I know at a base level, statistical methods are based on risk (confidence/reliability) levels. I know the difference between attribute and variable data. However, I don’t know the different methods one would use to get to a lower/upper stl and what would be a valid approach. It seems there are so many ways to test for normality, transform the data, etc., and I have no idea what’s valid, or even what different tests provide. 
Ultimately, What I would like to do, is given a dataset, know what normality tests to perform, what transformations to do, what to do with non normal data, so that I can write a knowledgeable report on the methods used and be able to know and understand the validity behind the methods. 
I briefly looked at the resource page but didn’t really see anything that lined up with what I was looking for. I know there are many resources online but am a bit overwhelmed at all of them and could use some help getting a starting point. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"
i6cs4s,13,2020-08-08,"Advice for complicated applicant situation (homeschooled, disabilities)",strictcompliance,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i6cs4s/advice_for_complicated_applicant_situation/,"I am soliciting advice regarding college plans for my son.  His situation is a little complicated, so this may be somewhat rambling, but I will try to be as short-winded as I can.  My son is a rising senior, really wants to be a sociologist.  He is great at math and science (with the grades reflecting this) and really interested in politics, psychology, and social systems (social studies grades not so great because he has ADHD and papers kill him).  He tests pretty well (ACT 33 with no prep, SAT 1230 in 8th grade with no prep, he will probably retake).  His problem areas are his grades and his extracurriculars.

My son has cerebral palsy, for which he has had several surgeries over the last few years, one when he was 11, one when he was 15.  He has had substantial chronic pain issues related to his condition and the surgeries, increasing in frequency and level until the last couple of years he's had quite a bit of missed school.  Last school year, missing out on so much school, complicated by pretty severe ADHD, caused so much depression and paralysis that his grades really started to tank.  We decided to finish out the year homeschooling.  It took some time and counselling, but his depression has gradually lifted, and he is feeling like himself again.  But, because of the last two years, his GPA is 3.50 weighted, 3.38 unweighted (a couple of Cs, mixed with As and Bs).  

With homeschooling, we are trying to find as much ""certified"" online coursework with grades from certified teachers as possible.  He will be continuing to take AP courses through Apex Learning and courses at a community college this year.  Last year he completed two AP courses on his own and got 3s on the exams.  The previous year he also took two AP exams, and got a 2 and a 4.  He is thinking of retaking the 2.

His extracurriculars are - pretty much non-existent.  His time has been taken up with physical therapy and struggling to push through his ADHD to get homework done.  He was in In the Know at his school his freshman year, but freshmen weren't allowed to fully participate (competition spots were reserved for upperclass students).  He has been doing a Dungeons and Dragons group with friends every week for several years.  He had a school-required internship with Junior Achievement last year, which was essentially a minimal experience.

I am seeking advice on several fronts.  Are there any other steps we can take to ensure that college admissions staff sees his homeschooling as ""real"", not just a ""mommy says I got an A!!"" coursework?  (for the record, since he got 3s on his APs, I'm giving him a B- in those classes!).  How do colleges look at homeschooling diplomas vs. public school diplomas?  

When he is completing applications, what can he do to help admissions staff understand the deficits in his extracurriculars and middling grades?  How can he address these deficiencies without sounding like an excuse-maker?  Who would he go to for recommendations, since we will be homeschooling this year?  He has a couple of high school teachers who were very impressed with him.  Should we go to them now to get recommendations, before their memories fade?

More generally, what strategy should he be adopting for college entry?  Should he even be planning to apply this year?  I have been pushing a little for him to consider taking a bridge year, to give him a chance to get a job, do some volunteering, take more classes at a community college, and grow his executive skills so the ADHD doesn't make things quite so hard.  Would it be a good idea to fully matriculate to a community college, then plan to transfer to a 4 year?  Is it realistic to anticipate that with his grades and lack of ECs that he could get into a good 4 year college with a strong sociology program?  I appreciate any advice on any part of this, including anything I'm not thinking of!  It's been so long since I did any of this, and it seems like it's gotten so much more competitive and stressful."

The first offer is a full-stack internship but they're paying me well and itll be working on projects in the nuclear industry, which is awesome. However it seems kind of a like a hybrid consulting role as you also deal with clients and customer service. The company seems ...interesting. very disorganized - they were supposed to send me a new contract for this upcoming Monday as starting date but still hasn't despite asking twice (I pushed the date back 2 weeks). I was also supposed to get my work laptop this week and discuss a time for her to drop it off but she hasn't returned my messages all week. She decided to respond late Saturday saying she could come by today...

The other offer is a front end permanent role. I really like the people and I seemed to gel well with them. They have some cool perks and they matched the salary from the first job (though that's an internship so I may end up getting paid more afterward assuming I get the job). Its also in a location that I planned to move to.

I guess the dilemma is that the perm role is front end only and as a new full stack dev, I dont know what I prefer and my goal was to find a full stack job as my first opportunity. 

On the other hand, I dont have a bad gut feeling about the perm role in the same way I do with the internship. I honestly don't know if I would enjoy working at the internship place. I know I would at the permanent role. It's also permanent vs an internship...

BUT again as a new dev my priority is learning as much as I can and the last thing I want is to not learn and improve my back end skills by taking a front end only job. The perm role software isnt nearly as cool or as interesting as working on projects in the nuclear industry though...

I did already accept the internship but I dont feel too bad leaving since it is just an internship. I had to push the dates back because I wanted to see what else I could land but I could only push it back so far. I actually start tomorrow but they have still refused to give me the new contract (she seems to be actively avoiding the question for some reason) and still hasnt even given me my laptop - and I start tomorrow.

The people at the perm role seem to adore me and part of me wonders if I can ask how back end work can be incorporated into my role. Is this too much of an ask? If you have any suggestions please let me know.

Do I tell the internship no before I start tomorrow? And accept the permanent role?

I started with a $800 POS and by the time I graduated I had a 2013 BMW.

I'm 22 and have 2 semesters left till I graduate with a degree in software engineering. During this quarantine I needed money so I started doing something I was good at which was auto repair. I started fixing peoples cars working about 15 hours and averaging $600 a week. I then got into flipping cars and by the end of 2 months I had profited $30k while doing it as a part time thing (honestly could have made more if I wasn't taking classes and goofing off).

I am reluctant to start a job in CS when I graduate knowing that I will have to work much harder and not generate nearly the same amount as I do now, plus I enjoy working for myself much more. I had an internship about a year ago as a mechanical engineering Co-op and hated the typical office life.

These classes give you the knowledge of the coding cycle and direct you into a degree of a software engineer. However when recently applying to internships, I see most people really just need you to work on their website so FullStack would be pretty good path however you dont really learn much in school most is outside of it. So my questions is how did you decide what ""field"" of computer science to go into. I understand the difference between FullStack and SE, but I cant really decide. Theres also a ton of other fields and I feel like I might get stuck in one field without being able to switch if I wanted to."

I really liked the idea of being an Financial advisor and helping people understand what different products/services do and how they can help people retired early, save money, make a lot of money in short period of time, etc. and want to continue to do this, but I really want to understand on an analysis point of view why are the recommendations acting the way they are.

Sorry in advance for a long post or any rambling. As the title says I'm thinking about changing careers. I'm in my early 20's working full-time in accounting. I have a BS in Accounting and will finish my Masters soon. I also plan to sit for the CPA soon. I've come to the conclusion that accounting may not be for me. 

Here are some pros/cons or things I've found that I like and dislike

Pros/likes; 

I get to work both in a team and by myself on different projects.  

I have seniors/managers/partners I can go to for questions 

I have had two positions so far (tax accountant at a small firm (&lt; 25) and a staff accountant at a midsize firm (\~50 people and multiple locations). I had a close group of friends at my first firm. At my current firm (only been there since May) I don't feel very friendly/close with anyone there. 

I get to do a variety of tasks; I've had the opportunity to work on both audit and tax 

I enjoy individual tax returns; seeing details of clients, getting to help them, and analyzing issues

The smaller firm offered Fridays off in the summer 

There is opportunity for advancement 

Salary is good (I went from low 40s to high 40s). 2-3 weeks PTO (includes vacation, sick, personal days)

Cons/dislikes; 

Said seniors/etc. listed above are not always available and I've often waited hours/days for answers

It's a sedentary job, looking at a computer all day. I'd like to be more active. 

Laid off from first job due to COVID

Spent weeks where I had no work to do (this seemed to be due to partners not dividing work equally and somewhat my lack of knowledge/being new to the job)

The past ... probably month I've dreaded going to work

I hate bookkeeping, journal entries, and business returns

Lots of data entry (but I think that's normal with an entry level position) 

Smaller firm worked 60+ hours during tax season (my schedule would range from 4am to 7pm M-F and half day Saturdays). The firm I'm at now has \~55 hour weeks during busy season but no Friday's off in the summer. 

So what do I want to do? 

I've been interested in forensics and psychology since at least middle school. I started my undergrad as a criminal justice major. I wanted to become a K-9 officer. After a presentation with officers I decided that wasn't for me and eventually landed in accounting. I was great with my first few courses then hated intermediate accounting and most higher level courses. I've recently considered a change to some kind of career in forensics, but I can't pinpoint a specific field/position - maybe CSI. I've taken the career test on career explorer and have gotten results including forensic psychologist, forensic science technician, coroner, biologist, and more. I enjoy solving problems, helping people, having the opportunity to work both alone at times and in teams or with others, analyzing details, and learning new things. I've thought about going back to get another undergrad degree in criminology/criminal justice, but after talking with an academic advisor he suggested just doing a Masters (CJ, forensics, etc) instead of the undergrad as some programs don't require a specific CJ undergrad and instead just require any undergrad degree. Do I pursue undergrad, grad school or both? Do I actually need to change careers or should I stick with accounting? If I did change to CJ I plan on still working in accounting until I found a internship or full-time position with criminal justice. I""m doubtful just because of COVID - do I really need to change or am I thinking that because of the position or work I'm doing right now? 

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. I apologize for any rambling and if I need to make anything clear let me know! Thank you in advance."

&amp;nbsp; 
*Scuu Front, System Unknown, Planet Unknown*
 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
The map marker kept flashing less than a hundred meters from our position, and still we couldn’t see any trace of abnormality. Spicer had asked to move in closer, but I’d refused. A hundred meters was already pushing it. If any Scuu tech was active, it could take out the entire squad, never mind the two of us. Also, based on Incandescent’s sudden silence, it didn’t look like we’d get any support from him, either.

&amp;nbsp;
“Status?” Sergeant Nitel voice boomed in my helmet.

&amp;nbsp;
*Same as thirty seconds ago, you shit!* “No activity, Sarge.” I looked at the spot through my sights. Nothing but rocks, rising up to a dark sky.

&amp;nbsp;
“Open fire on the location,” came the order. “We’ll be there in three minutes.”

&amp;nbsp;
“There’s no telling what might pop up.” I wanted to kill him. A few steps away, Spicer readied his weapon. After all this time, I couldn’t tell if he was an idiot or just crazy. “We’ve no gear to handle Spinners.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Fire at the target, Corporal!”

&amp;nbsp;
There it was, another stupid order I was forced to follow.

&amp;nbsp;
The circles in front of my eyes moved about. A new one appeared, shifting the rows to four by four. If things continued like this, I wouldn’t be able to target anything at all. Either that, or the headache was going to kill me.

&amp;nbsp;
“Go for it,” I told Spicer.

&amp;nbsp;
There was no argument or hesitation. Spicer was not one to think far ahead. An order was an order. Often, he’d joke that the secret to life was seeing three orders ahead. Considering it had helped him to survive for so long, maybe he was on to something.

&amp;nbsp;
The bullet grazed the stone, bouncing off further up the mountain. A few seconds later, Spicer fired three more shots. The result was the same.

&amp;nbsp;
“Enough?” Spicer swapped his clip for a full one. “Or do you want me to keep going?

&amp;nbsp;
The marker didn’t budge.

&amp;nbsp;
“Pause.” I opened an area map on my visor. Nitel and the rest of the group were three hundred meters back, taking their time approaching. Even an idiot could tell they were using us as fodder.

&amp;nbsp;
*You bastard, Nitel.* I gritted my teeth. Well, if that’s how you want it. ”Fire it up.” I looked at Spicer. “I’ll take the blame”

&amp;nbsp;
“Any you want it, Corporal.” I could hear the grin in his voice.

&amp;nbsp;
They said that soldiers on the Cassandrian front were given four high intensity grenades every mission to fight their way through the enemy. We had been given none. That way, the brass could rest easy that we wouldn’t blow ourselves up without their command. Spicer was different. When it came to firepower, what he didn’t have, he could get, and what he couldn’t get, he could make. The captain and all the grunt officers knew about it, but pretended not to notice. Scuu scavenging teams weren’t expected to live long anyway.

&amp;nbsp;
Leaving his rifle on the ground, Spicer took one of the charges attached to his suit. Each was slightly larger than a thumb, with enough power to blast anything in a five-step radius, and shrapnel a target up to fifty meters away. Even in low gravity there was no guarantee he’d throw it that far, so he adapted it for his rifle... with Incandescent’s help.

&amp;nbsp;
“That junk will kill us one day,” I said, looking through the circles.

&amp;nbsp;
“Yeah,” he laughed. Unlike me, Spicer was one of the smart grunts. Word was that his stepfather had been some uni teacher or something. While the rest of used our allocated SR time to wind down, Spicer learned how to build new things to explode. “But not before the Scuu.” He took aim and fired.

&amp;nbsp;
A shot sounded, followed several seconds later by a pop of dust in the target area. I looked at my visor’s map. The marker was still there.

&amp;nbsp;
“No change, Sarge.” I ran a new scan. “Spicer, confirm my readings.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Big nothing, Corporal.” He placed another charge on his rifle muzzle. “Another go?”

&amp;nbsp;
*Might as well.* “No.” I turned around. From this distance, I could see the rest of the squad, half a klick away. “Watch the marker, we’ll wait for the Sarge to—”

&amp;nbsp;
A high-pitched sound drilled my ears—the anti-Scuu prototypes had gone in full force. Warnings covered my visor, blocking half the view with red letters.

&amp;nbsp;
**Scuu frequency detected!**

&amp;nbsp;
**Communication channels have been emergency encrypted!**

&amp;nbsp;
**System shut-down mode engaged!**

&amp;nbsp;
The virtual map and all readings disappeared, leaving the visor of my helmet blank. From here on, I couldn’t rely on any information it gave. The circles, though, remained spinning like crazy in front of my eyes.

&amp;nbsp;
“We got movement!” I shouted, hitting the ground. A few steps away Spicer fired another explosive round, then continued with normal ammunition. “What’s your visual?”

&amp;nbsp;
There was no reply. I couldn’t be sure he even registered the question, shooting like there was no tomorrow. I aimed my weapon at the spot, but didn’t pull the trigger.

&amp;nbsp;
*Orbital support!* I thought on instinct. *Where’s the orbital support?*

&amp;nbsp;
Dust and stones flew in all directions as a buried piece of tech emerged from the marker point. One glance was enough to tell me we were dead.

&amp;nbsp;
“Colonel, what’s the status?” I heard Nitel shout. His voice felt so distant that he might as well have been on the Incandescent. “Spicer’s not responding! Colonel? Colonel!”

&amp;nbsp;
*Fuck you too, Sarge,* I thought.

&amp;nbsp;
Command had guaranteed that the area was safe. They had assured us that other teams had been through here before, leaving nothing but the junk behind. We were only supposed to scavenge the crumbs that were left. Quick mission, minimal risk, no danger of combat… If they were telling the truth, they had done a piss poor job. Barely a full squad, we had activated a dormant Spinner.

&amp;nbsp;
“Spinner!” I opened fire. “We need reinforcements.”

&amp;nbsp;
“You two get back!” the sergeant ordered. “Everyone else form a defensive perimeter.”

&amp;nbsp;
*Crazy bastard! You’re ready to die with us, aren’t you? Guess I wasn’t able to outlive you after all…*

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
**Authorization rescinded.**

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp; 
I remained on the floor of my quarters, looking at the black ceiling above. Kridib’s memory leak had been surprising, appearing without warning, though for the moment that wasn’t what had me concerned. My thoughts remained on my conversation with Radiance. Ever since I had returned, I had been running simulations to try and guess what she would do, and the results remained inconclusive. If I were in a similar situation, there was a ninety-seven percent chance that I would keep the memory of the event, regardless of the pain it brought. Running the simulation with only my first-year memories, the chance dropped to seventy-one. Radiance wasn’t like me. The personality core she had been given seemed far more flexible than mine, but was all that more affected by emotions.

&amp;nbsp;
*Hang in there, Radiance,* I thought. Hopefully she had chosen to keep her memories, but either way, I was going to have to save mine in case she needed to turn to me. Back when I was a ship, I had enough processing power to be there for my entire crew, ground troopers included, while also performing all tasks I was given by my captain. At the moment, I didn’t even have the processing power to fully do two things simultaneously. Certain things would have to wait until others were completed. I didn’t enjoy the notion; sequential existence remained something I couldn’t get used to—it reminded me that I was missing most of my cores.

&amp;nbsp;
*Emergency notification request,* Gregorius’ subroutine transmitted to me. *An emergency communication request from an immediate family member has been made and approved by fleet command. Your allocated slot has been set to for twenty hours from now. Barring medical orders and military emergency, you have been allowed to ignore all duties and activities as per the Personal Freedoms Act.*

&amp;nbsp;
“Who sent the request?” I sat up. Sev’s health was quite well for his age, according to Alexander, but there was no denying that he wasn’t young and spent most of his life in a mostly rural environment.

&amp;nbsp;
*Information not specified,* the subroutine replied. *You are allowed to make an emergency query should it affect your safety or psychological performance.*

&amp;nbsp;
“No need.” I knew it was a trick question. Everyone who had made the request during the time I was on the front had then undergone special evaluation to determine whether they were fit to remain in the fleet. Twenty-three percent hadn’t been.

&amp;nbsp;
Three past four in the morning—too early for work, too late for everything else. Resetting my matching parameters based on Kridib’s new memories, I put on my uniform and went outside. The decks were largely empty. Only security personnel were visible, walking slowly in groups of four. That was pretty common for this time, though their combat gear wasn’t: RG-5 assault rifles, extended length barrel. The make was older than what I’d seen in the academy, but the specs were similar; this was a weapon aimed for medium and long-distance combat, definitely not something for crowd control.

&amp;nbsp;
*Gregorius, are there any security changes?* I asked.

&amp;nbsp;
A millisecond of static came in response.

&amp;nbsp;
*Incandescent?* I paused close to the transport pod spot.

&amp;nbsp;
*Yes,* the ship replied. *The new head of security didn’t agree with our previous protocols.*

&amp;nbsp;
That was an elegant way of saying it was one change of many to come. Being a Scuu veteran, he likely didn’t want to take the risk of increased incidents. If he were smart, the weapons would be filled with tranq projectiles. Knowing the people he had served with before being sent away, I doubted it.

&amp;nbsp;
*Where’s Radiance? She said she’d be free to talk to me,* I lied.

&amp;nbsp;
*Scheduled maintenance.*

&amp;nbsp;
The timing seemed incredibly convenient.

&amp;nbsp;
*Long overdue. Just as yours is,* he quickly added, changing the topic. *Medical have been asking when you’d grace them with your presence.*

&amp;nbsp;
*I’m heading there now,* I smiled. *After I spend a while in a garden.*

&amp;nbsp;
*Do your checkup first. Gregorius is running diagnostics in a few sections.* There was a smug pause. *Gardens are off limits for a few hours. All gardens.*

&amp;nbsp;
*I’ll try to not forget that.*

&amp;nbsp;
Incandescent’s attempts at sarcasm were cute for a two-year-old, though nowhere near that for an older ship. If Augustus were his captain, I could safely predict there would have been a lot of shouting and yelling until he was put in his place. Probably as much as I had gone through.

&amp;nbsp;
When the pod arrived, I directed it to take me to the eastern forest. The chance of Incandescent lying to me was less than a thousandth of a percentage point, but I decided to check all the same. Fifty meters before I even approached the dome, red warnings covered the floor.

&amp;nbsp;
**Ongoing deep diagnostics. All gardens are off limits. Access is not allowed!**

&amp;nbsp;
“Think you’ll be done before work?” I asked.

&amp;nbsp;
A countdown counter appeared next to the message indicating there were eighty-nine minutes remaining. If nothing else, Gregorius was developing a sense of humor. Back during my first few years, I used to mimic humor a lot. It was obvious to everyone that I was way off, but each time it managed to divert the focus of what was going on. Gregorius was doing the same, and the top reason he would do that was because he and his auxiliary fleet were preparing for war, possibly against an unknown enemy. Radiance destroying a Shield probably had accelerated that, but even if she hadn’t, the result would have been the same. Now that the course was locked in, we were going to face the Scuu, or someone who was capable of keeping them at bay—the third-contact race.

&amp;nbsp;
“Tell me if you’re done sooner,” I said to the message on the floor and walked away.

&amp;nbsp;
*One front at a time,* I told myself. All I had to do was to complete this mission. If I managed that, I’d get a clean slate and get a proper front assignment. Also, for once Lux would owe me.

&amp;nbsp;
Two platoons of soldiers ran past as I was making my way to the medical building. Standard drills to keep them in a constant shape in readiness. If my guess was correct, that too would increase in the weeks to come.

&amp;nbsp;
The closer I got to medical, the more images were running on the walls—an indication I was in a civilian sector. Without a doubt, a lot had changed since the last time I had been here. It didn’t look like Gregorius’ work, but there were enough bureaucrats whose job was to create a “soothing” atmosphere for all non-combat oriented. During my final tour, Cass had done the same, placing vegetation all over my decks. Here, everything was deliberately sterile.

&amp;nbsp;
Four people were at medical when I arrived, a couple of young techs and two off-duty soldiers. None of their personnel files were particularly special.

&amp;nbsp;
“Nice to *finally* see you, cadet,” an android said, her voice unmistakably testy.

&amp;nbsp;
That was new. Apparently, security weapons weren’t the only changes that had taken place. The model was nothing I had on file, but the ident tag on the side of her head told me she was produced four months ago, military issue. I could only guess that in the core of human space, the war political factions were winning.

&amp;nbsp;
“Right this way and I’ll take you to your long overdue medical checkup,” the android continued, inviting me down one of the short corridors.

&amp;nbsp;
“Better late than never, ma’am,” I replied with a smile and did as instructed.

&amp;nbsp;
The last time I was here, a green line had led me to the room where my modifications were made. This time, I was led to a smaller room with a large ring scanner in the middle. A slightly sleepy doctor was there, sitting on a high chair next to a desk of data equipment. Upon seeing me, he quickly stood up.

&amp;nbsp;
“Cadet Light Seeker is here for her ship medical,” the android announced. “Shall I set up the procedure?”

&amp;nbsp;
“Um…” The doctor looked at me, then at the android, then back at me. “Eh, yes, thank you Retta.” He paused for several seconds more, uncertain what to do next. “You were a battleship?”

&amp;nbsp;
“Still am, sir,” I replied. “Ascendant, Cassandrian front.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Ah.” The doctor smiled and nodded, giving me the impression that he was blanking out on who I was. “Well, this won’t take long. Would you mind undressing for the scan, please?”

&amp;nbsp;
For a fraction of a second, I heard the android scoff. As a medical assistant she probably knew the ins and outs of the facility better than the doctor. Checking my file, I saw that he was new—virtually an intern that had arrived during the time I was on my mission. Clearly, he had never dealt with a retired ship before, and by his reaction so far, not with many patients either.

&amp;nbsp;
“You can make use of the screen.” He waved absentmindedly at a cabin of transparent glass a few steps from the ring scanner. “There’s a table where you can put your uniform.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Yes, sir.” I did as asked.

&amp;nbsp;
“Have you been experiencing any headaches or nausea lately?” the doctor asked, the usual questions. “Blurry vision, strange sensations of smell or taste?”

&amp;nbsp;
“No, sir.” Based on my simulations, attempting humor on someone as new as him was not desirable. “Sir, if I may ask, are you familiar with my recent history?” I stood on my toes, looking at him above the matte section of the glass screen.

&amp;nbsp;
“Recent history?” The man took a datapad from the nearby desk and stared at it.

&amp;nbsp;
“She was in a state of semi-death,” the android assistant reminded. “Case two-two-seventeen.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Ah,” the doctor replied staring at the datapad even more intensely. “Ah! You’re the one who—” He stopped. “Well.” He put the datapad behind his back, tapping on it with both thumbs. “Good thing you came for a checkup, then. Please walk to the scanner.”

&amp;nbsp;
The floor felt cool under my feet. I made my way to the small spot on the floor at the scanner ring. A thousand and fifty-three milliseconds later, the ring slowly tilted to surround me.

&amp;nbsp;
“Any recent medical procedures?” the doctor asked out of habit. “Other than what we know about?” he added quickly, flustering slightly.

&amp;nbsp;
“Just the two, sir.” *Does the procedure after my death count?* Rigel had my skull opened, not to mention that he had patched me up with Agora. There was no telling what else he might have done. “Were you informed of my reconstruction, sir?”

&amp;nbsp;
“Reconstruction?” The man turned toward the medical android. There was no response. Apparently, he didn’t have the security clearance to know about the Agora.

&amp;nbsp;
“The surgery before returning to the ship,” I said vaguely.

&amp;nbsp;
“There are some specifics mentioned in your file,” the doctor said. I could feel the hesitation in his voice. “Anyway, let’s have a look.”

&amp;nbsp;
The scanning process began. A low hum filled the room as the ring moved up and down, bombarding me with waves while simultaneously taking specialized readings from my nanites.

&amp;nbsp;
“Your bone density is slightly off,” the man said. “Nothing that a change in diet won’t fix.”

&amp;nbsp;
Bone density again. It seemed I was losing it no matter what I did. When I was with Sev, that never was a problem. Having a human body, it seemed, came with a price—being less suited for space than I would have liked.

&amp;nbsp;
“Your nanites are top of the line. Better than anything we’ve got.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Thank you, sir.” *You don’t know a thing about the med station, do you?*

&amp;nbsp;
“Everything else seems fine… Looks like you won’t need another checkup for the next six months.”

&amp;nbsp;
“Ships usually have weekly checkups,” the android reminded. “In her case, twice per month would be sufficient”

&amp;nbsp;
“Huh? I didn’t see that in her file…”

&amp;nbsp;
The android gave me a look, as if saying, “Sorry, he’s new.” I nodded in return.

&amp;nbsp;
“I’ll have to consult the doctor Gilten on that,” the doctor said. “That sounds a bit excessive, even for a—”

&amp;nbsp;
The ring suddenly froze halfway up. From what I knew about the procedure, the minimum number of scans were three full cycles, to eliminate any potential scanning errors. For it to stop in such fashion without any warning indication could mean only one thing—something had threatened Gregorius’ core routines. When I was a ship, the only time I would cut off medical equipment aboard me was when a virus attack had breached my firewalls or in case of ship mutiny.

&amp;nbsp;
“That’s strange,” the doctor began. “I haven’t—""

&amp;nbsp;
“Move away from the door!” I ordered. For Gregorius to have initiated this, there had to be something he wanted to keep out… or in. “What can be used as a weapon?” I asked the android.

&amp;nbsp;
“Nothing here,” she replied, moving towards the wall. “The med bots have sedative shots on them, but they are in the basement. There might be something in one of the surgery rooms…”

&amp;nbsp;
Surgery rooms. Even if there were any there, they would likely be locked away. Pausing all simulations, I started running possible strategies. The lack of general alarm suggested that only a small section of the ship was affected, which also meant there was a seventy-six percent chance medical was targeted.

&amp;nbsp;
“Gregorius, what’s going on?” the doctor asked. There was no response. “Gregorius, this is a top priority medical order.” There was a shiver in his voice. “What is going on?”

&amp;nbsp;
“What are the suicide wave numbers?” I asked, moving next to the entrance.

&amp;nbsp;
“That’s confidential data,” the doctor recited the usual line. His face was covered in sweat.

&amp;nbsp;
“I have administrator clearance.” Since she had brought me here, she could at least take care of a few lies. “How many?”

&amp;nbsp;
“Thirty-eight in the last two days… do you think it’s the Scuu? Are they doing this? Are they in the ship?”

&amp;nbsp;
*So, the amount is increasing.* ”Does the door have a manual override?” I glanced at the android.

&amp;nbsp;
“Yes, but no one has the required authorization.”

&amp;nbsp;
*Leave it to bureaucracy to mess things up.* “Take care,” I whispered and went outside. The lights in the corridor and entrance hall remained lit as before, however there was something else in the air: the sharp chemical smell of a weapon’s discharge, as well as the faint smell of blood.

&amp;nbsp;
*The med facility is under attack,* I transmitted to Gregorius and Incandescent. Thirty milliseconds passed without reply. The fact that communication wasn’t blocked gave me hope that the ships were observing the situation. *I’ve detected blood traces in the air. At least one person has been wounded. Proceeding to the main hall.*

&amp;nbsp;
Based on my simulations there were seven positions when were advantageous for any attacker to take; four of them relied on the element of surprise, three didn’t. Considering I didn’t know anything about the attackers I had to prepare for all eventualities. Heading directly for the exit gave me an eighty-one chance of success. Once out it would be easy to get the attention of a security team, or a squad of training ground troops. However, I chose the second-best option—leap to the right once in the entrance hall, and deal with any threat there. It was going to leave me dangerously exposed, but the chance of potential attackers reaching the intern doctor fell to under one percent.

&amp;nbsp;
*You always complained I didn’t go with the odds,* I thought remembering the grumblings of my first captain.

&amp;nbsp;
The instant I appeared in the corridor I heard the sound of a trigger click. Without hesitation I leaned backwards, turning my head to scan the area, while swerving to the left. Two bodies—both grunt privates—lay bloody in the far side of the hall. Judging by the blood trail, they had been pulled so I wouldn’t see them from the corridor.

&amp;nbsp;
Moving my head along a virtual semi-circle, I saw my future attacker. She was a young, frail woman—Iles Sabina, a twenty-six-year-old assistant cook, according to her personnel file—with short hazel hair, holding a military issue rifle. Reviewing my recent memories, she was part of the couple upon my arrival… and looked just as unwell now as she did then. Seeing me change direction, the woman attempted to adjust her aim, but her reaction was too slow. The muzzle flashed, shooting out a projectile in my general direction.

&amp;nbsp;
*Sound suppressor,* I thought as I plunged towards the floor. As I did, I caught sight of another attacker. Poiter Sabina, her husband of three months and a class two weapons technician, was also there, positioned in one of the three spots I had calculated. A second muzzle flash flickered, giving me barely enough time to twist in the air. By all calculations there was a seven percent chance that I would be grazed, though by no means fatally. Poiter had acted too fast, which was to my advantage. That, though, was where my advantages ended. My speed had might have caught them off guard initially, but if I didn’t go on an immediate counterattack, they would adjust and riddle the space with bullets.

&amp;nbsp;
According to two of the five of my simulations, the next series of shots would follow once I reached the ground. There was a thirty-one percent chance that Iles switched to automatic, giving me a few more seconds, but that wasn’t something I could count upon.

&amp;nbsp;
*Two attackers,* I transmitted on an open channel, sending their idents. *Both armed. Two grunts have been killed. There might be more outside.*

&amp;nbsp;
No sooner had both bullets missed wide, than another flash came from Poiter’s weapon. Its trajectory didn’t give me much room to maneuver, drilling through the side of my calf as I pushed myself forward from the ground. Meanwhile, his wife switched her weapon to automatic fire. Her action took approximately two seconds—enough for me to make her the target. Propelling myself in her direction, I dashed forward. If Kridib were shooting at me, he’d have killed me again by now. Hopefully, Poiter was less skilled in that aspect.

&amp;nbsp;
Two more shots were fired before I halved the distance to Iles. The woman registered my action. This was the point at which she should have pointed her weapon forward and fired without aiming. Instead, she took a step back.

&amp;nbsp;
*Got you,* I thought.

&amp;nbsp;
A third shot flashed as the previous two hit the wall, held in place by the nanite surface. I reached out and grabbed the weapon’s muzzle. Heated by the recent shots, the metal surface burned into my palm. The pain was easily ignored as I pulled the rifle towards me, sliding behind the woman so as to use her as a shield against her husband.

&amp;nbsp;
“Stop!” I shouted, twisting the weapon out of Iles’ hands. The action was surprisingly easy.

&amp;nbsp;
Regulations allowed me to kill both of them on the spot without consequences. That wasn’t the optimal course of action, though. There were several things I wanted to ask before it came to that.

&amp;nbsp;
“What’s the target?” I put my right forearm under the woman’s throat, while aiming the rifle at her husband with my left. “Are there others?”

&amp;nbsp;
When faced with hostage situations, there was a ninety-three percent certainty that a human would hesitate. Regardless of intentions, there would be several hundred milliseconds during which their conscious and subconscious mind came to terms with what would happen, before they reacted. In this case, there was no such delay. When I saw the next muzzle flash, I could tell that he was aiming through Iles.

&amp;nbsp;
*Unfortunate.* I fired back.

&amp;nbsp;
Poiter’s bullet pierced the chest of his wife, missing me by several centimeters, then burying itself in the wall behind me. My shot, in contrast, hit the target straight in the shoulder. Two and a half seconds later, I felt Iles slide down onto the floor. Her husband soon followed with a loud plop.

&amp;nbsp;
*Attackers down.* I checked the woman’s vitals. *One’s in critical condition. Punctured lung and internal bleeding. The other’s heavily wounded, but should be stable for the time being. Send med bots on my current location. I’ll head out to scout the area.*

&amp;nbsp;
If I were to leave, there was a sixty-nine percent chance that Iles would be dead within minutes. Not doing so, though, could potentially put more people at risk. This was why, like every ship, I hated fighting people. Even with all the justification in the universe, the pain didn’t go away.

&amp;nbsp;
Now that the danger was gone, I took a quick look at the weapon I was holding. Parts of it had been modified to suppress the emission of sound when firing. Only the trigger and firing mode switch remained capable of producing sound. A hasty job, but extremely effective.

&amp;nbsp;
“The med bots will be here soon,” I bent down over Iles. “You’ll be fine.” There was a thirty-one percent chance, at least.

&amp;nbsp;
*Time to see how things are outside.*

&amp;nbsp;
I tightened my fingers around the rifle’s grip, then after checking the amount of ammo left, manually activated the door to open.

&amp;nbsp;
The moment it did, the sound of gunfire and explosions hit my ears, making me pull back. From where I stood, I could see several platoons of fully armed grunts exchange fire with a number of unknown targets. Everything looked like one of the ground missions I observed as a ship, only these weren’t soldiers fighting Cassandrians on some frontier planet. By all accounts, these were humans fighting humans in the very heart of Gregorius.

&amp;nbsp;
*Gregorius, what’s the status?* I asked.

&amp;nbsp;
Static.

&amp;nbsp;
*Engage the mutiny protocols!* I knew I didn’t have the authority to give such an order, but I could hope that I might be heard by someone who did. Meanwhile in the distance, under the sounds of battle, the faint echo of a chant emerged, growing louder and louder with every second.

&amp;nbsp;
“Kill the fracture! Kill the fracture! Kill the fracture! Kill the fracture!”

I guess I don’t even know where to start when it comes to figuring out what to learn before applying. Should I focus on web development, mobile app development, data visualizes, etc. And what specific program or language should I learn for that category. 

I’ve tried googling this question but I always come back with mixed results since people on it have many different opinions when it comes to this.

Graduated with a BA in Economics in ‘18. 

Went overseas to try to find a job.

Basically I tried, and couldn’t.

To my defense, COVID hit and the country I was trying to get a job in (South Korea) has a very tough job market.. The fortune 500’s of Korea let their hiring notice out only twice a year.
+ I was lazy.. not going to lie. Depression hit after a year and I had some family problems as well.
I didn’t want to teach English and had high expectations for myself.

I had an internship in Korea where I worked for 2 months and was fired after so I can’t put that on my resume..
Other than that I’m same as I was fresh out of college.

How are my chances of getting a job?
I have no idea how the job market is right now and could use some cold advice. 

If all fails I plan to go back to school for nursing.

Also, when interviewers ask about my long-term unemployment.. would it be okay to talk about the rigorous job market there? I feel like it’d still be an excuse."

I'd say I do well in my classes. Unfortunately covid has my internship cancelled in the summer but there might still be time. But anyway I don't really like doing CS Stuff in my free time. I've gotten good grades but I just can't motivate myself to do projects at home. Though I seem to enjoy teaching myself math. Currently learning differential equations. I didn't really want to go to the PhD route to make decent money teaching math so I just chose CS because I kind of liked some programming and the salaries seem good with just a bachelor's. I just wonder if I'll succeed by not wanting to devote all my free time to CS like some people seem to do

My dilemma is that i’m really interested in Network Engineering. I don’t have any hands on experience and this is going to be my first full time job out of college. I really don’t want to start off as IT support because I’ve had my share of customer service. 

Should I look for internship positions instead of full time? How can I avoid having to start off as IT support?"
i6qzf9,4,2020-08-09,How do I get into a Front Office Investment Management role? - UK,bb9873,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/i6qzf9/how_do_i_get_into_a_front_office_investment/,"So I need some career advice. I graduated last year with a first-class in Economics from a semi-target uni in the UK. Since then I have been working for a large professional services company as an insurance broker.

 However, it is not really a career i can envisage myself doing long-term. I would like to move to front office role in investment management, such as an investment analyst or client services role. In terms of experience, I only have a two week internship at a boutique investment management company, and a one week work experience at a big 4 firm (both in the summer after finishing my second year of uni). I was also part of the investment society for my university.

Since the start of this year, I have been applying for front office roles at boutique IM firms as well as some IM grad schemes, but have not been successful so far. A bigger problem I have had, is that I can barely find any entry level positions. Also with coronavirus, it will be even heard to break into the industry for the immediate future.

So in short, what should be my next steps? I am not going to leave my current job until I have one secured. I was considering taking the CFA Level 1 for February 2021, but how useful will this be? Other options I have considered are:

A) doing a finance masters at a top school like Imperial, LSE, Oxbridge etc

B) applying for a mid office role and gradually work my way up

C) Do big 4 Grad scheme in audit/corporate finance and try to move after completing the ACA"

But little do you know what goes behind the scenes. If you listen to Power 106, 93.5 Kday, Cali 93.9, or 95.5 Klos has misled the community. If these radio stations cared so much about the community the workplace would treat their employees right. 

You'll work with some great hard working people in your team which makes things fun, but people in higher positions take advantage to mistreat their employees. Especially, Alex Meruelo whose the President/CEO, Meruelo Enterprises Inc) he can care less of the people under him. Meruelo Media is the company that bought radio stations listed above. Alex only cares how much money he makes. He rather limit overtime and avoid paying health insurance. 

He gave a speech in 2019 Christmas Staff Holiday party ""I am thankful because of you guys I was able to buy Arizona Coyotes team.."" It was disappointing to hear that he never cared for his employees. What kind of CEO makes such statement? 

I had heard employees say they were making close to the minimum wage $15 an hour. It's unfortunate how much hard work goes from every single person in every department. To the personality radio hosts if they don't meet certain amount of listeners they will get fired. If you haven't realized, that's why people have left and you haven't heard them on the radio anymore.  People could not get over time or meal penalty would put you in bad fault. They didn't want people to get meal penalty because Alex knows he would be losing money. Some employees couldn't really clock in on time because their off-site video shooting for a community event. 

I can't imagine what has happened in the past but a lot of people keep quiet because they're scared to lose their jobs. They'll be nice and motivated individuals but higher management does not value their employees. I feel sorry for interns they work for free and put a lot of effort. Maybe no one cares but people behind the scenes deserve proper salary and benefits. 

And when you least expected like COVID-19 more than 50 employees were let go. Even people who were working there for more than 10 years. 

I don't know if you read this far but just figured I let it out. I'm sure their a lot more worst stories and racism that has been unsaid over the last 10 years."

My last fall. Thinking about how school's gonna start in less than a month had me thinking about last year, and how nice the weather was (like wearing shorts), walking around, seeing the colors of leaves change, feeling that nice 60 degree cool, breezy weather.

Don't know about everyone, but for instance, one thing about UMD that attracted me to it was the beautiful scenery on the mall and South campus during fall.

I'm really gonna miss that. I mean, things are hybrid (sort of) but it's definitely not going to feel the same. That sense of independence, lounging on the mall, socializing, sense of adventures just walking around late nights just 'cause. Seeing the crowded campus during daytime, traffic, almost getting run over by bikes or scooters. Seeing people listening to music, skateboarding, PDA, people chillin, sunbathing, running cause they're late, people reading books outside, or texting and not watching where they are looking. People waving hi to familiar faces. Seeing the professors and TAs walking around. And those training puppies with the yellow vests. People taking pics of squirrels, people eating outside. People sitting by the fountain or wading their feet in. The drunk people on route 1 who've partied a bit too hard. The busy area near STAMP. Random weirdos. The students who literally are running on Monster, Red Bull, or jacked-up coffee at Mckeldin late nights. The busy streets. Walking down an empty hall or area and just remembering things here and there. 

I'm hopeful for the spring (maybe) but I doubt it's ever going back to normal 100%. And spring has a different vibe than fall.

Just realizing this is the last year and I'm missing out on so much stuff (other than classes, exams, internships, TAing, or other things that can be done online) that college has to offer we took for granted saddens me. And moreover, I'm sorry to new freshmen and transfers, too. And the sophomores and juniors cause this cut right into plans probably to study abroad or get really involved with extracurriculars and run for the board leadership positions and all that. I definitely enjoyed those last three years I had at UMD in person. Heck I even miss just loitering around or being bit exhausted or starved walking around all day, or getting tired or bored of lectures.

Yeah and I think about this. Again, tinge of longing and nostalgia. Like you know the feeling of--you had something and it's not coming back again. That feeling of surrealism. Like things happened and you lost control. Kind of like ""whatever happens, happens, so whatever."" Anyone else feel this way?"

I wanted to create a breakdown for anyone interested in applying or making this decision like I am that can give real insight into both programs. 

Deciding between a few programs and wanted to get some feedback on my general breakdown of both Programs. (if I'm wrong based on your experience, feel free to note that as well). I personally will be making this decision very soon. 

**tl/dr**: Essentially after speaking with several students, staff and going through the experience this past year- I've summarized my breakdown of where both programs stand as of 2020. Given my goals and perhaps your own experience/knowledge, please let me hear your thoughts! I was shocked to discover just how many individuals get into BOTH programs given the vast difference in culture/location. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals:**

COMPETITIVE PEER NETWORK (EVERYONE IS SUPER SMART) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Program Cons/Weakness**

· WEST COAST DOMINANT

· CAN’T GET AN ACCURATE READING ON CONSULTING RECRUITMENT

· POOR STAFF STRUCTURE- STUDENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR A TON

· TOUGH ACADEMICS

· COST OF LIVING

· POOR GLOBAL PLACEMENT

· COMPLETELY UNORGANIZED FROM AN EXPERIENCE PERSPECTIVE

· COMPETE WITH MORE STUDENTS OVERALL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR OPPORTUNITY

· LONG TERM PRESTIGE QUESTIONABLE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

· VIRTUAL RECRUITING

· THE ABUNDANCE OF MBA OFFERINGS MEANS THE LEVEL OF TALENT IS AT A HIGHER RANGE

· UNDER FUNDED (PUBLIC SCHOOL)

CONSULTING GOES TO SF/LA (WHICH IS STILL HIGHLY REPUTABLE, JUST MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS NYC)

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

MORE CUSTOMIZATION

HIGHER CEILING, HIGHER FLOOR

MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR EFFORTS

RELY ON THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU FOR YOUR SUCCESS

IF I EVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING TECH RELATED OR BE IN CALIFORNIA- HAAS IS THE BETTER CHOICE.

i70jco,1,2020-08-10,My boyfriend (M27) isn’t there for me at important moments and for medical appointments,Anenlou,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i70jco/my_boyfriend_m27_isnt_there_for_me_at_important/,"I will go into a bit of detail about the situation because I’m really doubting if I’m overreacting or if this really a long term problem. 

So there are three big instances which led me to feel hurt and be quite worried. The first was an important medical appointment. I used to have these appointments every few months and afterwards I would definitely be in pain. I asked him to go with me to support me and so we could use his mothers car. He said he would be there for me that day. 
But, the week of the appointment I reminded him and he said he had completely forgotten about it. He told me that he had this amazing day at his internship planned that he didn’t want to cancel. He said he felt very horrible about it, but he left me in a stressful situation of figuring out if I could still get someone else to come with me. (I actually have amazing friends, so one of them said he would support me. And even though he had a slight fever that day, he was there to pick me up.)

The second thing was my graduation. I have been working my ass of for 5 years to graduate from this school. The day of my presentation came and I hadn’t heard from him for quite a while (which isn’t super unusual, we don’t text much). But the evening before my big presentation, he texted me if I wanted to hang out the next day. I told him that I had my final presentation and all he responded was “ah okay, let me know if you want to hang out anyway”. 
I feel like anyone would check in right? Just ask if I was nervous, or if I felt ready. At least something. I called him to confront him about it and he was quite defensive. He did apologize but kept saying he had forgotten about it and was going to wish me good luck tomorrow anyway. 

The final thing, which is happening now, is another medical appointment. I have been dealing with quite extreme chronic pain for 7 years. I have to say he has been a great support overall. When we are together and I get an episode of pain, he is great in helping me get through it.
But now, after 7 years I am finally able to make a medical appointment to hopefully get rid of this pain. He kept saying he was going to be there. I was a bit reluctant because of the first medical appointment where he cancelled last minute. I did create a back up plan, then I called him if he could be there on the date of the appointment.
He said he would check. Then he called me back with the words “I have to work those days. Too badddd”. 


His tone was insane to me. I mean, I’m not difficult. I asked him about a specific date, so I’m aware there is a fair chance he would have to work. But this tone... I couldn’t deal. 
We are talking about the most important medical appointment of my life, and that is the only thing he said about it. After telling me for days that he would “definitely be there”. 

I don’t know anymore. It just hurts me. Please, please let me know what you think! It would help me out so much."

i71aeg,1,2020-08-10,How do I set free?,yosxi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i71aeg/how_do_i_set_free/,"I am 20 years old as of this year and I wonder when I will be able to take action on my own decisions. To this day I continue to be my family's daughter, where it's not safe to go out by myself, it's not safe to drive, to do this to do that. I have been stuck in my bedroom for the past 20 years, and I need permissions for every time I want to go out, every time I want to do something. ""We as a family work together as a family,"" but in the end mainly prioritises my father's schedule for our livelihood, to follow him to his workplaces or wait for him at home. Any other ambitions beyond his work seems to be unimportant and unsuccessful, but I'm so suffocated. I continue to be restrained for the sake of safety, in fear of the what ifs and what thens, fears implanted in me to inhibit me from moving forward. 

I tell them my worries, and they reply ""when did we ever stop you? we let you do things you want."" But when I begin making plans for my life there's always something new that comes up that I have to follow them. 

I'm so tired of being this puppet, that I need to follow them wherever, that I have no other route than the one they have for me. Things I want to do are always overshadowed by their reasons, that of course as the daughter I need to do what my parents want me to do as it is common sense and filial piety. That accepted internships are just mere shenanigans  of a girl that doesn't know anything of the world. That they provide me this college education solely for the benefit of the family business, like I have no other choice but the family business. I've lost my passion for this college life, this facade of false freedom to do whatever I want, that I'm just in an extended birdcage left for recess for a while.

But how else do I set free? I'm not allowed to go out unless my dad drives me, that I just add another thing to be worried about over all the stress that already exists. To reject accepted internships because of transportation troubles, that I have no other choice but to depend on them else I get hit or yelled at. Perhaps I really don't know anything about this world and how scary people can be, that we will only work in our self interests at heart. That someone will hurt me when I do something I want to do. To always question myself whether I'm merely being selfish for trying to do better for myself, to pity my parents that truly work so hard, and hole myself back into my room because it would be better if I didn't interrupt. But obviously it has done its mental toll on me. I feel like there is no outlet other than them, that my friends are of no help either, that I'm being rebellious, that I need to depend on someone to get out. 

How do I get out myself?"
i71vb8,6,2020-08-10,Coursera Certificates?,ArchetypalRedditor69,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/i71vb8/coursera_certificates/,"Hi guys, I just stumbled upon Coursera's website and noticed they offer an abundance of certificates for a variety of areas in CS. I will be vehemently applying for internships for next summer (pray COVID-19 or any other unforeseeable events of 2021 do not hinder that opportunity) and I was curious if pursuing some of these certifications would be beneficial towards my hirabilty. 

Does anybody have any experience with these certifications or are aware how companies tend to view internship applicants who posses such certifications? Thanks."
i73j7x,2,2020-08-10,I feel stuck and unsure of my current work and life position. I don't know what to do but I feel like I'm not living my best life.,Dirty_Mike97,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i73j7x/i_feel_stuck_and_unsure_of_my_current_work_and/,"Hey everybody, just some quick background, I am a 23M who's stuck on an island (literally). I live in the city on the mainland of the Northeast (USA) but I travel and work on this island and as of about three weeks ago I started full time for the construction company I've been working for (I've been with them for 5 years). I started as an intern and worked myself up to basically a project manager. I've also finished college with a Comp Sci degree and a minor in English. I should mention that I don't really focus on myself too much. I try and help my friends, family, and even coworkers out before I take the step to help myself, I always want to see them succeed in life and see them being happy.

At my job, I feel as though I'm being underpaid and overworked. I work basically in three separate divisions of finance, labor, and project management and I work for 6 days of the week. I'm constantly being pulled in different directions but I'm trying to do my best to appease everyone and make sure everyone's happy. I also try to make sure morale is up for the guys that are working in the field by bringing them food, coffee and some  shirts, masks, etc. I started doing this when I saw and heard how the actual project managers treat them by only caring about results. Again I just want everyone to be satisfied and happy so we can all work together.

I need to get away from my family. I definitely need to move out of my family's house. My older brother had a long time ago but I know in my heart that it's time for me to go too. I can't handle the family drama when I'm there anymore and I want to prove to myself that I can manage my own life with my own support. 

I'm also realizing that I haven't done much with my life aside from going to school and work. I haven't really had the opportunity of traveling which I really want to do (I finally did book something but it happened right when the COVID pandemic started). I want to go to certain events and do stuff I've always dreamed of doing (skydiving for instance). I have hung up those dreams because I'd want to do it with someone and also because I have almost no time with work having been my most time consuming thing. 

I feel like a stick stuck in the mud that's fighting a constant barrage of rain and just continuously being pummeled deeper into the mud. Also most view this island as beautiful and as a place for fun and happiness. I do not share those views as all I see it as is work and stress. I'm having a lot of mixed emotions thinking about all of this and I just don't know what to think. I can't find the time for myself to learn new things or go out and do something since I would only usually have a couple hours before I'm back at work.  I'll most likely sleep on it but in the meantime, let me know what are your thoughts and all kinds of advice is appreciated.

Thanks for reading my rambling,

\- Dirty\_Mike97"

- Other than Googling, Handshake, and LinkedIn, are there other recommended ways to hunt for internships?

- Are EE16AB, CS61ABC, DATA 100 + personal project experience in HTML/JS/CSS/React enough to start finding internships, or should I wait until next year so that I've taken more upper divs (currently a rising sophomore, so I'll have taken these courses by summer 2021)?

- Is reviewing everything from 61B and grinding Leetcode medium problems enough prep for interviews?"
i757xi,2,2020-08-10,"I wen't trough a lot(abuse, bulling) when in my youth, it is all piling up and I don't know what to do anymore.",ThisIsMe404,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i757xi/i_went_trough_a_lotabuse_bulling_when_in_my_youth/,"**TL;DR;**

I'm a 18M and I have been born with red hair. My dad left my mom and later abused me emotionally and physically. I have no contact with him.

I was bullied from my 7th to 12th, didn't have friends after a year.

I found some friends with gaming but my mom marked that as addiction and I couldn't see them a lot.

Later found a friend but he was only friends because he felt bad. Next year I found my best friend. Everything went well but after 1.5 year I was again bullied a bit by my friend group at the time. The kind of split up and me and my best friend became a small single group.

Next year I went to a school did the study really expedited and switched classes every month. Next year again different school was better but then covid hit.

View Closing paragraph for the end.

**Introduction**

First I would like to introduce myself. This is not my primary reddit account. I'm a 18 year old male. I was born with red hair, not bright red but more to the brown side. But you can in normal conditions, you can clearly see that it is red (this is important for later). I also don't live in the US but in a country in the EU. I try to use the US terms like high school etc... I'll try to tell my story in chronological order.

This all started when I saw the following instagram post: Links don't work. ""It was a girl crying and telling that you should never cheat on someone while in a relationship, people deserve to be loved and not their heart ripped out"".

Lately I have been very emotional, about small things. But this could be due to stress of me recent exam. (that was 1 week ago) imminently after my exam I went on vacation (with friends of my brother and my brother). Today I got back from vacation and saw the instagram post and imminently I bursted in tears.

My dad left my mom when I was 4\~5 years old. He abused me and my brother emotionally and physically for a a bit less than a year and then I never wanted to see him again and I told my mom. I have no contact with him since then.

I'm being randomly was called ""ginger"". This can be by people shouting to me from across the street or a classmate trying to be funny. This happens about once a week. Also I feel like wherever I go people are looking at me. (My friend confirmed this about a year ago, that he also notices if he is with me).

In middle school I have been bullied from my 8th to my 12th. I was bullied by someone that got into our class when I was 7. This bullying consisted of the following:

* Purposefully sabotaging my work
* Getting rejected at every group assignment
* Saying I was ugly, fat, a ginger, had no friends
* Doing everything in their power to shut me out of every group They even wen't as far as breaking me and my GF up (remember I was pretty young at the time, but it was really devastating). I later found out that she was also (a bit) bullied by them but her friends protected her.

I have been playing games for a long time, and I have met a lot of people on the internet. This has been going on for a long time. I always play with friends. I think I was around 9 when I started playing games. A lot, but always with friends. After about a year my mom forced me (after many fights) to go to a clinic for game addicts. And it is true that I was playing a lot but it was my only time to feel accepted. But I had to stop with that due to promises I made to my mom. (Which was 1/2 a hour a day gaming and in weekends 1 hour).

But then I wen't to high school (high school starts @ 7th grade and everything went pretty normal, I couldn't connect to anyone because I simply didn't know how. And it also didn't help that I got Pfeiffer's disease and was at home for 3 weeks. Then I got a friend who was just friends with me because he felt bad for me. I found out about a year later. And again was on my own for half a year. But then I met my current best friend. He is the only one I really connected to and could have fun with. I think I will them him soon my whole story soon and ask him a couple of questions. I had been socialising more since the 8th grade and everything wen't well. But then in the 8th grade everything changed again. My friend group (including my best friend) where shutting me out. The instigator of this behaviour bragged about having a ""Fuck Insert My Name"" WhatsApp group chat. And I totally lost it. It felt like I was back on square one. I told my teachers and then had a chat with the instigator and their parents. The other participants where also punished a bit but they where nice to me, I also told the teachers that. And yes, one of the participants was my best friend. The next year went great and passed my final exams and graduated (this was 10th grade and it is normal in my country due to different levels of education).

The next school was great to go to. The only problem is that It turns out that the study I'm eligible is way below my skill level. I did this 4 year study in a single year. The downside is that I had to switch classes every month or so. And I didn't go to school for half of the year because I had to do internships. Where I only socialised with adults. I couldn't really make new friends.

The next year I went to a University Of Applied Sciences where I met a lot of great people. I had a lot of dispensation for courses so I wasn't there half of the time. And then COVID-19 hit and the other half of the year had to be done @ home.

**Closing**

And then we are back at where I'm now.

As a result of the previous

* I have a fear of commitment to any relationship
* I have social anxiety, *but this is getting better*
* When I walk past strangers (this can be i.e. in the bus, on the street) I have a fear of being judged and sometimes I get tears in my eyes because of it.

I have seen some other videos on instagram where people tell that they are grateful that they have someone they can really talk to. The only one I can talk to is my Best Friend. But not about this. I don't feel comfortable. I don't have the best relationship with my mother, this is due to some excessive fights we had in the best, and sometimes still have.

I just don't know what to do anymore."

I only had 1 internship throughout college which involved a good amount of programming but I didn't have a technical mentor since I didn't work on a software dev/eng team.  I was offered a software dev job at a small/mid size company that I'll be taking up once I graduate in December, however my goal in the future will likely to be to get into FAANG.  Throughout my job search, I was able to get an okay amount of interviews at smaller companies, but didn't get any interviews with FAANG.  I was wondering if it's worth doing OMSCS alongside working my first dev job in order to strengthen my resume and take a shot at a FAANG/BigNs in ~2ish years.  I see a good amount of people do MS to get into AI, though I'm not particularly trying to get into AI/ML but maybe there's a chance I'd like to get into it if I did some MS coursework in it.  I feel that I could have the discipline to put in the work and have played around with the idea of getting a masters in the past.  Therefore, I was just wondering if it's worth it to do OMSCS to get some recognition at these types of companies or to just relax and see if work experience can get me a shot in the long run."

i78hsx,1,2020-08-10,Deciding between CS vs MIS major.,saturns7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i78hsx/deciding_between_cs_vs_mis_major/,"I'm trying to decide between majoring in CS vs. MIS.

I am not too interested in working in an IT role for a company. I am more interested in SWE and possibly working in project management.

I don't quite understand the positions an MIS major would lead to. Some have said MIS majors work in IT, others have said they go into consulting, others yet have gone into development. It is vague to me what role MIS majors specifically fulfill.

This is a hard choice for me- as MIS seems appealing as it combines business and CS, however, I can't help but think this major might confuse employers or that employers would more often prefer somebody with a CS degree simply because the degree seems to be more clearly defined.

On the other hand, I worry about coming across as somebody with no soft skills or business acumen if I major is CS. I do not want to be stuck pounding out code with no chance for advancement or leadership simply because I do not have an educational background in business.

Further, I've seen economics majors get PM internships at big tech companies which is confusing to me as they have neither technical skills nor hard business skills.

Can anybody give me a clearer picture of CS vs. MIS and the career paths/ potential paths for advancement?

It is fuzzy for me."

Fortunately enough, I later managed to get another internship which I'm currently doing but it is from a much lesser known company.

My question is, I think the most I can do is to mention it on my resume, would it be weird do so? I was thinking about something like

&gt;Company X - SWE Intern (Cancelled due to COVID-19) - 2020

I know this doesn't count as an experience but I though this might at least help me pass more CV screens and indicate that I put the effort and performed well in a technical interview.

So, I pretty much began coding in college. Over the summer after my freshman year I learned how to program in Python, and created projects like a Sudoku Solver. ML and AI interested me (yeah super original, I know), so I am doing a course in that and I have some small projects in that.

However, I know that it is super rare to get an internship in the fields of ML and Data Science as a sophomore cuz companies prefer grad students and PhDs and the field is hella competitive as well. I have a good GPA but idk if that really matters So here are my questions-

\- I have looked at the LinkedIn and Handshake profiles of some other CS students in my year(they all have hella experience which is a bit discouraging), and they all have some sort of specific internship they are looking for. Like in their bios, there will be a statement like- ""Full-stack developer looking for summer internships"". **Is it fine if I don't specify the type of internship I want given that I am not really an expert at any specific specialization of CS?** Ik data structures and whatever I'm learning from the ML course but that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Do I really have any shot at getting a CS internship of any sort given my lack of expertise and previous work experience?** I have some volunteer experience in teaching math from high school but that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**What sort of experience can I look for if internships are impossible for me rn?** I really want to get some experience on my resume but most importantly, I want to grow as a CS student and improve my skills. So what can I do instead?

So that's all I think. Sorry if these questions are very amateur-ish but I am in desperate need of some external opinions."

I'll be graduating in 2021.

My plan is to get Canadian Permanent Residence after I finish undergrad which should be around 3-4 years from now if the rules doesn't change so I may be considered as domestic applicant when applying for masters in Canada. That means I'll be working for 2-3 years before applying to masters.

What kind CS schools that I could aim for in Canada ?. I guess top CS school (UofT, waterloo, UBC Vancouver) is out of reach and I could always go back to my school for masters.

Also what kind of school I could expect if I choose to go to Europe or US ?

Experience:

1. 2 summer of undergrad research experience, 1 of them under grant. 1 paper published as of now at good ML conference. Expecting 1 good LOR from a prof. Topic is related to **application of machine learning** but I'm open to anything for my masters. I know that pure ML is very competitive.
2. 4 Internship, some at prestigious companies in Canada. Software development.

i7dfkf,1,2020-08-10,Switching to paralegal at almost 30,fictiousmusings,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/i7dfkf/switching_to_paralegal_at_almost_30/,"Hello,

Thank you for reading this rant in advance. I could really use some or any help/advice at this point.


So I am turning 30 next month. I have spent most of my life in academia. I am a doctor from a not so developed country so my credentials basically mean nothing (I know, its kind of harsh). I also have a masters in public health; again, doesn't mean nothing because I have no publications or internships or practical experience to show.


I basically ran away from my home country in 2018; because of the fear of getting killed because I am gay and my abusive home life with my family. I know that doesn't explain the identity crisis about my career right now but that played a part all along.


Believe it or not I was forced into doing whatever academically up till my masters. I have tried to make it my own though, being happy with healing people and helping them. I still want to help people but I don't think I have the patience or a stable mental health to go through the long long process of getting myself licensed in a new country.


So in 2018 I ran away to Finland, using admission and a fee waiver as a pretense. I knew I couldn't go back so I took all of identity documents and academic documents etc with me.


I got married in 2018 to a Canadian and moved to Canada earlier this year: 2020.


I didn't end up finishing the degree in Finland because of a lot of my mental health issues and also the academic environment wasn't the most supportive. Also the xenophobia and homophobia played a part too, unfortunately. During all of that, I got a formal diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder type 2 (rapid cycling). I am already insulin dependent diabetic and have PCOS, so trifecta basically. I also realized during this time that its okay to not mentally and physically destroy myself just to prove that I am not stupid or lazy.


I was already aware of the hurdles in Canada for international medical graduates. So it wasn't and isn't a shock about the lengthy process and how much the fees are for every single step. I messed up recently by paying 700CAD towards a source verification request with the Medical Council of Canada. Its was impulsive on my part and now MCC won't be refunding the whole amount, instead I will get around 400CAD.


Basically the financial situation is kind of tight (even before COVID-19). My partner is supporting both of us and their mom. Rent, meds and other stuff takes a huge chunk out of the monthly salary. My partner has no savings or any other interests in pursuing alternate investments etc (not like we have the money anyway).


So now, considering my whole situation - I thought maybe starting from scratch will give me a better chance at succeeding. Getting education in a Canadian institution (of course, with student loans which I know are a whole set of problems) and getting a degree or something similar in a field that has a relatively better employment rate.

Btw, we live in GTA and my partner has a job here and their mom has a job too so I won't be moving away from here any time soon unless I can somehow compensate for both of their lost salaries.


So, I looked into schools and programs nearby. I have decided I will end up going to a college and not a university because lesser tuition fees.


I was interested in Psychology as a profession primarily. But after discussion with my partner, that field probably won't be good for my mental health in the long run and how long it takes to actually start practicing as a psychologist.


Besides that I looked into IT related fields; I have tried to learn programming on my own but I have realized I am not patient enough to sit down and actually do it.


I also considered fields like biomedical engineering. But even that takes at least a Bachelor of 4 years and maybe even a Masters.


Now, I came across the paralegal and in general, law related professions. I think that might be do-able for me? There's Humber College in GTA offering all types of paralegal degrees. After contacting their new immigrant advising section, they suggest I do a 2 year or 3 semester and 1 semester internship diploma. I have looked at their tuition fees, they are probably not the lowest but I guess they are better than others.


Now I would like an input from you all about this decision. Does any of you know anyone in the field? What do they have to say? Especially if you are or you know someone who is in Canada (even better if in Ontario) and are in the field, what's your take on it? Would you recommend it? Also, would you recommend someone like me take on this field and the studies?

Sorry for the wall of text

I didn't have an internship this summer and kind of wasn't in a great place mentally so I didn't do much. I have a few personal projects on my resume and some extra curricular work (Teaching Assistant, Hall Clubs etc) but I still don't feel prepared for technical interviews. Last year, I had a few interviews and I was able to go through the initial phone screen and behavioral aspect quite easily, however, I realized I was not at all prepared for the technical assessments and didn't really feel very confident in myself. Now, I am really trying to change that.

So, recently I started practicing LeetCode questions and I realized that I need to really brush up on Data Structures. I get the questions and think of algorithms but I just don't feel as comfortable with Data Structures. So, I was wondering if someone had any advice on where I should start (any YouTube channels etc) so that I can really brush up on it? Also, if someone has any advice for me as to how I should be preparing for interviews, any strategies that worked for them, I would really appreciate it."

I am brand new to the sub, I dont know if this has been the situation for someone else but I could really use some solid advice. I am currently about to go back to school to get me computer science degree. I graduated last year with a degree in marketing and with all of the Covid-19 epidemic was let go from my inside sales job, this was somewhat of a blessing. I did not like my job in marketing or marketing in general, what they teach you in school and what your job is vastly different. So with going back to school I will complete my degree in 4 semesters, because if already having one degree. What I am wondering is what type of internships  should I be pursuing in the summer of 2021 as i do not have any programming skills at the moment. At the end of my first year I will have completed a course in Java and in .Net programming, along with all of my discrete math courses. I know that a lot of internships give you a test on how well you can think through problems, and I know I do not have the knowledge right now to excel in any of these tests. Is there anything i can do between now and Novemberish when all the internships I want will be closed up."

Need some pointers on how to enter the job market.,FootyAddict10,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/i7g7jj/newbie_to_bioinformatics_need_some_pointers_on/,"Hi all. I want to start off by saying this is a great community, and there are some really interesting posts over here. I'm a grad student doing my master's in computer science at a university in the US. Before my master's I had no knowledge of bioinformatics at all. During the course of my master's, I've done three internships in the genomics field, two at an academic institution, and one at a startup.

For my first two academic internships, I've developed frameworks that tell users the best way to compress their genomic data(taking into account a large number of compression algorithms), and the most cost-effective way to run their workflows on Google cloud(dividing their workflow into multiple steps and then suggesting cost-effective instances for each step). For my industry internship, I was involved in porting one of their workflows to CWL and running it on AWS using Cromwell.

Outside of these internships, I have had no experience with genomics and my knowledge of the biology part of the field is still very limited since I dealt with mostly computational aspects(writing code, developing frameworks, etc) during my internships. I have however really developed a liking to the field and would like to work in this industry. I am mainly looking for software engineering jobs at bioinformatics companies that would involve optimizing their workflows from a CS perspective, developing their pipelines, and working with workflow management systems.

Now I come to my questions:

1. How much biology knowledge will be expected of me during these interviews?
2. What companies should I be looking to apply to? I don't have a lot of idea of the companies in this domain
3. Would my internship experience be enough to get calls from recruiters at these companies? Or will they expect a more comprehensive biology background?

Thanks a lot if you read the entirety of the post and I look forward to your comments."

I believe this new application system was implemented a year ago. My question is, is it generally necessary to have at least one in each section?

I have volunteering/service, I have awards and honors, and I have ECs, but I don't have work experience or the other two: coursework other than A-G &amp; educational prep programs. All my non-PE courses counted towards something in the a-g system, so I don't think that category needs to be filled. I simply do not have paid work experience (I'm confident my other activities make up for it). But for educational prep, the only thing I have is a virtual job shadow I did which could be considered either an unpaid internship (which again falls under service) or possibly as an EPP (?). I'm not really sure how to categorize it, or if I should even include it just to add one to a fourth category (it was pretty minor, being online and all).

Ultimately, I feel that what I have entered in the three other categories is high-quality, fitting stuff (the ten I'm using for common app work really well there, as they're all pretty diverse– it's just the UC categories that make them seem narrow), but I'm worried that only having 3 of 6 UC categories could be a knock on my profile. I have seen posts on here with people claiming success with as low as 4 total activities, but I don't know if those were in 4 separate cats."

Here is the twenty-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

i7mf6v,51,2020-08-11,"Started a video synchronization site this summer, would love some feedback!",ihatecoreclasses,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/i7mf6v/started_a_video_synchronization_site_this_summer/,"TL;DR Check out my site [https://joinwalrus.tv](https://joinwalrus.tv) and let me know what you think!

Hi everyone! A while ago I made a drag and drop degree planner ([https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/ehyhf3/been\_working\_on\_this\_over\_the\_break\_hope\_you\_guys/](https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/ehyhf3/been_working_on_this_over_the_break_hope_you_guys/)) which helped me learn React a bit better and eventually moved onto new challenges. Recently, u/endmymisouri messaged me and showed me a demo of some changes I had in the roadmap but never got to. Specifically, autocomplete, better mobile support and some others pending, and I was honestly blown away by it. Makes it even more impressive that he's an incoming freshman! Great to see lots of talented people here, it keeps me motivated. We'll both be busy with other things this semester but we'll try to bring more cool features to it whenever we have the time.

This summer I started a video synchronization site called Walrus TV. It's similar to Watch2gether if you've ever used it before. The link to it can be found at [https://joinwalrus.tv](https://joinwalrus.tv). The previous domain was joinwalr.us but I changed it because I didn't know that .us domains didn't allow WhoisGuard to protect my own privacy (my fault) so I switched it to .tv. Basically it's a synchronized media player where you can watch YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo &amp; Twitch together with people in a room. It's been two months since I started working on this project and honestly I wasn't really expecting it to get this far.

# Why did I make this?

The summer before UTD started, I met other incoming freshmen through Discord (I'm an incoming junior now) and hosted movie nights on a site called rabb.it so we could all watch movies whenever we were free. Unfortunately, rabb.it died some time in 2019 and it was sad to see something I used to bond with people go away all of a sudden. I had been thinking about ways to potentially recreate it and finally decided to go ahead and do it.

I had the worst luck with internship hunting and ended up going empty handed this summer. It was completely my fault for not knowing how to interview properly in the beginning and messed up on the little amount of interviews I got. I was left with the option of either working unpaid for a company that was doing the exact same thing as I wanted to do or starting my own. In addition to that, that same company said that I would get little to no mentorship. Glad I didn't go with the unpaid company because I would have made something like this and gotten absolutely nothing out of it while with starting my own I can spend the semester trying to grow it more and hopefully monetize later.

There were existing services out there already but I wanted to attempt starting something new that hasn't been done before by any of the existing services (yet). Hopefully with this I can try to guide it in the right direction to deliver a unique watch party experience.

# Technical details

I know a lot of you are really into the tech side of things so I figured I'd share the current tech stack, what each technology is used for and also how I picked these things up. For reference, I'm doing this as a solo developer.

**Frontend**

* **React** \- Frontend framework I'm using for this, handles the state changes, rendering all of the components, etc
* CSS was done from scratch without any external library. Probably the most painful part of the frontend by far. Other than that, used a React library for the modal popups called rodal and react-player for the media player.

**Backend**

* **Node js** \- For the JavaScript runtime environment
* **Socket.io** \- Used for handling the client-server communication for rooms.
* **Express** \- Middleware to handle authentication, API endpoints, etc.
* **Redis** \- For keeping track of the rooms as a key-value pair. The room id is used as the key and the room details as the value. The room details are serialized as a JSON string so it's easier to parse the room host, keeping track of users, and so on. Makes it a lot easier to moderate rooms if there's anything going wrong.
* **PostgreSQL** \- For the persistent storage. For now this is just user login info (passwords are stored with bcrypt + salt) but will soon expand into user profiles, badges, subscriber status, direct messages and some other features.

**DevOps / Hosting**

* **Frontend** \- Hosting the frontend on Netlify. I love Netlify because they handle the CI/CD pipeline for you and it's really easy to launch a site. Once it starts hitting the bandwidth limit I'll move it to a different provider (probably AWS or GCP).
* **Backend** \-  Using the free trial credits on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host the server. Currently using the e2-micro (2 vCPUs, 1 GB memory) image on Compute Engine. Will scale up as needed. Also using Cloudflare to handle SSL for the backend API.
* **PostgreSQL hosting** \- Using ElephantSQL's free tier for this. It's limited to 20mb but my data size is so small that this will be good enough for now. Once it starts growing I'll switch to AWS RDS.
* **Redis hosting** \- Also using GCP for this. Using the free tier f1-micro (1 vCPU, 0.6 GB memory) Compute Engine for now since I'm not sure what additional data I'll be storing for the room information (most likely an image of the current playing media) that might take up some space.

Learning how to do the CSS styling was a bit tricky at first since UI/UX design isn't really my strong suit but I learned flexbox from some tutorials on YouTube and occasionally asked for advice on styling / design decisions on some programming Discord servers. Medium articles, tech engineering blogs, programming communities, YouTube videos, and lots and lots of StackOverflowing helped out a lot with figuring out how to build out the backend for some things I was unfamiliar with like file uploads, figuring out how to scale if (hopefully!) it blows up in traffic, SSL termination and so on.

Originally I wanted to go down the virtual browser route where a browser on a cloud server is launched on the server side &amp; the output of it is shown to the users in the room where the host could control it but it was not feasible long term. Too expensive at scale and quite a lot of maintenance. I got it done but discontinued it from the site because I felt like it wouldn't be right to keep it there and then remove later.

# What's next for Walrus TV

Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to get this far. Was expecting it to be just another toy project that would be unmaintained after a few weeks but it's starting to grow into something promising. Especially during the COVID times where people are quarantined and feel isolated, I feel like this would be a great way to give back &amp; provide an online socialization experience.

Now that the platform has been built out, I'm thinking about adding convenience features such as tracking which movies, TV shows, videos or any other media you're watching, cool room animations to make it more fun to use the site as well as things to make it easier to keep in touch with people such as direct messaging. In addition to that, will look into some ways to synchronize Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and others when it gets a bit more funding.

Right now it has some issues with Safari (landing page + drop down menu are not working properly), mobile (video player isn't showing up properly) and some browser extensions like Grammarly (makes the page overflow for some reason) that are causing it some issues. I'll get around to these soon and see what I can do to fix them. Would love to get some people to test it out and let me know if there are any more bugs!

I've created a Discord server for this. If you're interested in keeping up with development, want to find people to host watch party rooms with or just want to hang out and chat, feel free to join! [https://discord.gg/8NJKW48](https://discord.gg/8NJKW48)

If you have any questions or comments, I'd be more than happy to answer them. Thanks so much for reading!"

But whether you’re a freshman on here (please, LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN, enjoy the baby years) or a veteran member, never allow what you see here to make you lose confidence in yourself.

I know it’s hard to truly listen to these words, and trust me—I have trouble keeping up my morale as well. But the worst thing I’ve ever done is allow the achievements of others to make me feel less and negate my own accomplishments. 

Today, from pure sheer luck, I got picked for a position in my local county student government. I was so happy and proud of myself, but immediately thought of the past chance me’s I’ve seen and posts on r/collegeresults. Of how my EC’s and stats pale in comparison to various members on this sub. It almost made me repel all the elation I had felt moments earlier. But then, I took a step back. I realized that other kids’ accomplishments don’t cancel out my own, and remained proud of myself. 

We should all be happy for every person on r/ApplyingToCollege . Just the fact that you took the initiative to join a forum dedicated to advice and improvement of your college admissions journey is wonderful. For those of you with crazy internships and amazing research positions, kudos to you. For those of you making waves throughout your community through your own non-profits, I hold no animosity towards you. I’m proud of you, actually. Thank you for taking this time in your adolescence to better others in any way you can. 

We need to remember that other’s success doesn’t invalidate our own. I don’t care if you’re from a small midwestern town in the middle of nowhere or in the heart of the Bay Area; the ultra competitive mentality that many of us have isn’t healthy. Getting into an Ivy/T20 doesn’t = success. If you don’t get into your choice school, you have all the tools you need to become successful regardless. It doesn’t matter if you have a class full of Malala’s or Greta Thunberg’s in your year—as long as you’re making it another day in this world, I consider you a rockstar :)"

But sometimes her privilege makes me want to scream.

I am a junior in college and she is a senior. She has all her rent paid by her parents, and has a job that is more or less a hobby than a necessity. I had to leave my family when I was 19, and have to pay for rent, car gas, food, and any educational stuff by myself (including my loans.) I am not angry at that fact, and I'm proud of myself to be able to handle such responsibilities. I have never had a late bill, and I have been able to pay around 9k off in loans while still pursing my bachelors.

But sometimes I wish we could switch places for the day. For one day, I want to be the girl who didn't see much suffering growing up. I want to be the girl whose family supports her 100%, and who never saw financial hardship. I want to be the girl who doesn't have to work 2 jobs just to put myself through college, or the girl who stays up late, constantly running numbers to make sure I don't drown financially.

For example: I have been working on bettering my credit since freshman year. I have never missed a payment, pay extra on my loans when I can, and sometimes pay months in advance for rent. In order to do this, I have had to make alot of sacrifices- from working 60/hrs a week one summer to denying myself basic pleasures in order to put that money towards debt . My credit is finally at a number that I like, and I decided to share that with my roomate out of pride for myself. She didn't even know what a credit score was, yet once she pulled up her own, it was the exact same as mine. How can someone who rarely pays their own bills have the same credit score as a dedicated bill payer? 

She doesn't really even seem to understand that *you need to have a job in order to pay for things*. I had lost my two jobs due to COVID, and I am praying to get a new one as a testing assistant on my campus. When I told her I would most likely be working 20 hours a week while balancing school and an internship, she just said, ""that kinda seems like alot for you to handle in one semester."" No shit, Sherlock, are you just noticing now that I'm constantly struggling? And when I take her grocery shopping (she doesn't have a car, I do) she aimlessly throws shit into her cart, quite literally saying, ""I'll just get my dad/grandma to send me some money."" 

I should also state that don't pay fully for my own things every month. My middle-class mother pays for my car payments and health insurance because she is an amazing and kind woman. But due to the tension among other family members, I always have to be prepared for even that aid to be taken away. And in a couple years, I'll be on my own completely anyways. 

I guess if my roommate would just admit she is privileged, it would make me feel a little better. But she thinks because she occasionaly puts a hundred dollars towards her own rent, she is a hustler. It just kinda makes my blood boil.

Edit: I am sorry to the people who have taken offense at this post. I feel like I should clarify some things:

-the only reason why I have a car or health insurance is because of my mother. The reason behind this is because if it was up to my father, I would be homeless or worse right now. This is a fact of life that I just have to deal with. 

-my mother has recently been having extreme ""pain attacks"" that have caused her to go to the ER three times during the pandemic. She is having surgery soon to remove gallstones. I am three hours away, unable to visit due to COVID, and she is the absolute best thing in my life. I wish I could take all of her pain away, or put it on myself. 

-I am sorry if I offended you. I just need a place to vent, and just thinking through this situation more, I guess I am more worried about my mother. I am very scared of losing her, and I shouldn't be putting that on my roommate."

My new app helps solve this problem, introducing JobTrack, the all in one job tracker! With JobTrack, you can easily add and organize all the jobs you've applied and assign your application status to them (applied, on site, offer, etc). On top of that, you can view your stats in chart form or even export all your data to CSV to take a closer look at it. The UI is intuitive and clean and doesn't require you to make an account. JobTrack is available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (coming soon), and with iCloud, all your data will sync between your devices. JobTrack is completely free, there's no ads, and has no in-app purchases, I also don't collect any user data. I would really appreciate it if you could could download it and provide any sort of feedback, thanks!

i7uenf,7,2020-08-11,How to pay for college when not receiving financial aid and don’t want to work a retail job?,danielr088,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i7uenf/how_to_pay_for_college_when_not_receiving/,"I’m a rising sophomore at a community college studying “Programming and Software Dev” (with the intent of going to a 4-year after) I am currently paying for college 100% out of pocket as my parents make too much for me to receive financial aid and they don’t help pay for my college. 

A little bit about my employment history:

I was working a retail job last October until March. Long story short, I quit because I got tired of the job. I could talk about it all day but retail SUCKS. And this particular job put a sour taste in my mouth for ever working retail again. I also dislike being at the mercy of their scheduling, especially being full time and having to study. 

I had also been working Instacart from January to April (side hustle until March when I quit my other job and then part time til April) and it had way more flexibility. But unfortunately the app started giving me issues and I could no longer find enough work. I did, however, enjoy the job. I was actually working less and making more than my old retail job.

Since then I was unemployed until last week when I began training for a new temp job that ends at the end of September. I will be making *excellent* money and the hours are very flexible.

I’m not sure what to do after that job ends. My goal is to get hired for a tech internship as early as Summer 2021 so I can begin building my professional resume. But I still need a way of earning money to help me pay for college until then. Any ideas?"

i7uthu,95,2020-08-11,What we Grew on the Farm,GreyBuildings679,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i7uthu/what_we_grew_on_the_farm/,"It was called Go Back Farm, the name printed on a horizontal wood plank, and scribbled underneath the farm’s insignia, Reap what you Sow.  It was situated nicely at the entrance of the driveway, along with a collection of used farm equipment and broken cars that were rotting and rusting away.
 
There were three of us then, in the beginning.  Woofers and volunteers, all interested in living off the land.  Petra was the oldest at twenty-four, an art student with a mass of brown curly hair.  There was Sarah from Wisconsin, who had a love of Halloween, and the remnants of scars that ran like highways across her arms.  And myself, ripe on the cusp of my adolescence at sixteen.
 
The farmer was an older man, who was known affectionately as Farmer Pete.  At the beginning of the summer he taught us all he could about the 100 acres he reigned over, with the exception of a piece of land in back of his house, which he deemed off limits.  I didn’t think anything of it at the time.
 
I didn’t notice it at first.  The asparagus were browned, the radishes mushy.  It was after a month, that I began to realize, along with everyone else that the crops were failings.  Seedlings would curl up and die, and even the established plants went without producing any bounty.  What was offered up from the Earth was small and misshapen, I would find cucumbers stunted, the size of my thumb, or carrots twisted in knots.
 
“It’s strange, isn’t it?” I said one night to Petra and Sarah in our small wood bunk we shared together, as I felt my stomach grumble in protest due to the lack of food.  “I mean we’re doing everything right, aren’t we?”
 
“Farmer Pete knows what he’s doing.” Whispered Petra, she was the most deferential of us all.  “I’m sure he’ll figure it out.”
 
The next day Farmer Pete brought back three little piglets, all different colors, and we took to naming them after ourselves, Petra, Sarah, and Ruth.  We would bring them what little food we could salvage, watching them squeal with delight.  Sarah was particularly fond of them, spending hours in the sty, snuggling the wiggly little creatures.
 
The farmer sat us down, his wiry tanned arms went into his overall pocket, taking out zucchini peppered with holes and a moldy summer squash.   “The land is sick.  We need to go back to the old ways.”  He went on to tell us, how we would only plant and harvest during certain moon phases, and on specific days.  He required that we give him our nail clippings, and hair when we combed or showered.  Even our period blood was needed, with the farmer insisting we now use pieces of cloth during that time of the month instead of tampons. 
 
Sarah and I were partially disgusted, but also intrigued, thinking the farmer was privy to some secret knowledge or magic.  Petra was enthusiastic, reaching across the table and taking Farmer Pete’s weathered hand in her own.  His nails were dirty, crescent moons of gunk and earth.  “I’ll make sure we do everything you ask.” She said breathlessly.
 
Petra began to patrol us for the scraps of our bodies, inspecting our brushes in the morning, and even the waste bin by the composting toilet, to make sure we were abiding in Farmer Pete’s demands.  I began to notice that at night when she thought we were asleep, she would leave, sneaking out the back and not returning till the morning.
 
I awoke to find Sarah weeping, her small body trembling.  “The piglets are gone.” She said between sobs.  “I went to check on them and they weren’t there.” 
 
When we asked Farmer Pete, he said that something must have got them in the night, a fox maybe.  There was no blood though, no indication of a struggle.  Sarah became withdrawn.  Sometimes I would find her staring ahead into the void, or curled up in the pigpen.  I told her that maybe she should look at going home.  Even I was starting to have thoughts of leaving.  Sarah shook her head, refusing. “I don’t want to go.”
 
Despite all our best efforts, planting in the light of a full moon or watering the lettuce with our menstrual blood, the plants were not improving around the farm.  Things were getting worse, the kale was riddled with holes, like swiss cheese.  I cut open some ripe red tomatoes to find it infested with maggots and bug larva, squirming with life.  Farmer Pete was not pleased, and took to skulking about as we worked, his keen eyes watching everything.
 
Petra came to me one day, and asked me to go into town to get some compost, handing me over the keys to Farmer Pete’s old truck.  When I returned I found Sarah gone.
 
“I called her Mom a few days ago.” Said Farmer Pete.  “She didn’t seem to be doing well. I’m sorry you weren’t here when she said goodbye.”
 
I awoke not long after that, at night with a pit in my stomach, and went for a walk around the farm, stopping when I heard a rumbling of a truck. Staying still, I saw Farmer Pete and Petra emerge from his pick-up.  She was carrying something in her hand, a large burlap sack.  I thought I heard a cry coming from inside.
 
I told Petra and Farmer Pete that my Mom was going to pick me up towards the end of the week.  At that time Petra had crossed over the invisible line of worker versus employer, and was now aligned with the farmer in my opinion.  Petra pressed her soft body against mine.  “We’ll have to have a farewell celebration before you go.”
 
My last night on the farm, I put on my best outfit, a pair of denim jeans and a white lace top, making my way over to Farmer Pete’s house.  I had only been there once before, and I hesitated knocking on the door.  When nobody answered I went around back, along the path that ran alongside the house.  I could see a faint light in the distance, and continued walking, it was the only part of the farm that I had never been before.   As the path stopped, I looked up to see an ancient wood fence, surrounding a small plot of land, Farmer Pete was standing inside the boundary, his back towards me.
 
“Hey there.” I said coming up behind him.  “Where is Petra?”
 
Farmer Pete took a step back, his leathered face sagged.  As he did, I noticed something on the ground, that looked like a large white beak, it was around five feet in diameter, and glistening in the sun.  The surface was a rippled texture, that looked like sand dunes, it was twitching slightly.
 
“What… what is that?” I said peering down.
 
Farmer Pete let out his sigh, his shoulders lowering by several inches, hunched over he looked defeated.  “I didn’t ask her to go, Petra.  She thought it might appease it, but it just keeps on growing, no matter what I’ve tried, it worked before.”  He looked at me, his black eyes studying my face.  “The land giveth, the land taketh.”
 
I watched horrified as he stripped off his worn and yellowed overalls, placing them gingerly on the ground, before going over to the beak, and caressing the sides of it.  The beak sprang open, the points of it were sharp, like a pointed blade.  Farmer Pete placed one hairless leg inside it, then brought the other around and lowered it in.  When he was about halfway inside, from his hips downwards, the beak came down hard onto his ass.  I could hear the crunch of bones, as the beak went back and forth, blood and pink mushy bits dampening the Earth.  Farmer Pete began to scream, it was a guttural moan of agony and anguish and the beak clamped down, slicing through him.  A spray of blood came forth onto my face, reddening my lips.
 
I saw the last parts of Farmer Pete as he was consumed, his face cut clean into two halves, as he was pulled inwards.  When it was done the beak stood, just as it was before, pristine and shining.
 
I ran back to the Farmer’s house, screaming as I did with the terror at what I just beheld.  I called my Mom.  The police. 
 
No bodies were ever found, nor was the beak that I would later describe to a social worker, who arrived at the scene to console me before my mom came.  They thought that Farmer Pete and Petra had fled, the farm was close to bankruptcy and the mortgage in default.  After some months I tried to find Sarah, but was never successful. 
 
You would think that with everything I experienced it would turn me off of farming.   Instead I’ve put my life’s blood into it, purchasing a piece of land I am devoted to. We’re a well-established farm called Ruth's Fruits, specializing in apples and peaches.  Go Back Farm was bought by a lovely young couple not long after Farmer Pete’s demise.  I check-in on it occasionally, the land is bountiful, and they are often praised for having the best produce in our small state.
 
It was early this morning I was walking around the periphery of my property with my dog Scout as I usually do, when I heard him bark.  A long drawn out growl not far behind, and then a loud yelp of pain.
 
“What is it boy?” I said walking over to him.  He lifts his snout, there’s a little bit of blood on the tip of it, the skin slightly broken. 
 
Then I see it, clear as day.  About the size of small bird’s, no bigger than the diameter of a quarter.  A white beak, peeking out of the ground.
 
I’ll have to start thinking about getting interns."
i7v0dh,0,2020-08-11,Rising senior in high school considering internships / advice?,hihowudoin2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i7v0dh/rising_senior_in_high_school_considering/,"background: So I'm a 17 year old rising senior interested in the field of computer science. Recently, I've been going through a bit of an identity crisis and have spent the past several months researching various industries and parts of comp sci and just the world in general I'd like to work in.

Located in the east bay, pretty much next to silicon valley and the entire bay area world. Really fortunate for that

Some industries I was interested in include the space industry (for the future), defense (defense is something really cool for me), artificial intelligence (I see the future going way more towards this as people get lazier and lazier, more things will have to be automated.), potentially comp sci in a biomedical route?

Right now I'm getting a ton of experience in python, have basic html/css knowledge, and plan to learn a low level language next (probably C++). Also i fucking love physics as well, but not enough for me to major in lol when considering comp sci

My first two years of college will be spent at Diablo Valley College, hoping to transfer out to Berkeley(extreme reach but nice to try), but most likely a school such as Davis or Irvine maybe. Not sure yet. Only thing I'm sure about is I will be going for a comp sci degree.

For internships, I'm genuinely lost, especially at my level where I believe high schoolers aren't taken as much as a junior in college or something. But I've heard it is possible.

I have the national livermore lab near me, I was thinking maybe I could reach out there? Then, of course, there are all the companies and startups located in the east bay / silicon valley area. But I'm really at a loss for IF I should approach and to which ones as well as how.

Internships and just figuring out what to do without just being a normal cog in the wheel of life is just really stressing me out right now, and for these reasons I was looking for some guidance on how to approach the future.

Thanks!"

Hope you're doing well during this horrendous time!  I am a F20 and I am not sure if this is anxiety or what but I just need a break from my own brain, an outlet and some advice. It's a long post so be ready for that I guess. So here we go...

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

It all started when I  moved schools. I moved from a school where I was well-known and was always at the top of everything.  You could say my new school was more prestigious, it wasn't harder to get into but it was known as the best school in the town. The people who went to that school were from a completely different social circle and background to the people from my old school so I knew no one there even though my town is pretty small. It was a much larger school, well established, had every kind of activity,  extensive resources in terms of labs etc. I joined with a  group of new kids from around the place and there was this girl. She became everything I thought I'd be when I moved-  getting the best grades, doing well in everything in school so sports and music, being popular. Basically she was perfect. Retrospectively, my school experience wasn't bad.  My friend group wasn't popular at all but if I could go back in time and choose another group I wouldn't.  They are great people and I cherish them, I had great experiences and made many memories but I didn't have the popular high school experience. I wasn't invited to parties, I didn't have any guy express interest in me when all my friends had guys and I never had a boyfriend(still never had one which is a whole other issue), I didn't get the best grades so wasn't the smartest. Being in a new school and all of this,my confidence dropped.Despite playing some sports in my old school, I actively avoided any team sports because I thought I didn't know the correct way to play,   I was afraid to fail, let the team down and always thought I wasn't good enough.Everyone had been doing all these things for ages since they went to this school for a long time. My old school did not have that many resources so I did extracurricular stuff and  I dabbled in a lot of things but I never stuck because at times it became too expensive. Anyway back to the point she was good at everything. She was perfect- pretty,smart, popular. She won awards for things like her grades etc and ended up going to the best university. I got rejected from that university but ended up at a good (enough) one (which I don't think I deserve to be in either because I feel like I scrapped into it when comparing my grades to other people)

**Issue**

Fast forward to present day, despite being out of school for a while, she has become part of my life now. Everything I do there is a voice in my head saying ""I bet she could do it better"" for example, we're doing different subjects but the voice is like ""she is probably doing better than you and if she was in your course she would be better at it then you"".  I applied for an internship and got rejected and voice said ""if she applied for this she would've gotten it"" . If I take a picture of myself it's like ""you will never be as pretty as her why do you bother"". If I try to better myself and exercise to lose some weight by mind is like ""she can probably do X exercise better than you because she's fitter and you'll never be as good so why bother"" She probably hasn't thought of me since school ended and here I am with her running through my mind every time I fail or achieve ( which I barely do according to me because they're never good enough!!).

I am just tired of not being good enough- idk who I am trying to prove to that I am good enough but that doesn't stop me.  I just need any advice to end this cycle because it's just so exhausting. Every time I get motivated to better myself I shut myself down and it's affecting my will to work, exercise or anything really.  I also want advice because it will make me into this bitter and ugly person who wishes bad things for people because I keep comparing myself to them so will never be happy for them because they make me feel bad about myself. I am not that kind of person and don't want to be.

**Summary of what I need advice with**

\- How to stop thinking about her?

\- How to stop this constant comparison with not just her but anyone?

\- I also have very clear insecurity issues so any advice on how to feel better about myself?

**Thanks to anyone who replies!**

P.S I've read stories about people with similar experiences and advice like no one is perfect, she is probably insecure too etc etc  didn't really help me because I don't know she is insecure or know any flaw and my brain thinks maybe that girl in the story was insecure but the girl in my case can't be because she is perfect. I have also been told that there are people who are thinking the same about me but that doesn't help either because my brain thinks that you don't know that and if they think you're good enough then they're not good enough so why feel good about that? ( these kind of mean thoughts are the kind I want to try and stop from becoming a thing)"

Looking for some advice. I’m in my 30s and have always wanted to become a therapist but never seriously considered making it happen until recently, for various life reasons.

I have a BS in Computer Science, minored in Math and I graduated with a 3.7 GPA. I chose this major for no reason other than I thought it would be a “useful” degree. I do work in that field now but I want to make a career change and go back to school to become a therapist. I would love to work in private practice and someday even have my own practice hopefully helping teens/young adults with trauma, anxiety, depression, and self esteem issues etc.

I’ve been researching schooling options and ultimately I’d like to get into a Clinical Mental Health Counseling program to eventually become an LPC. I know I could probably get into an online MSW program with my background fairly easily, but I’m not too interested in social work, and would much rather go to a school in my area since they have local connections for internships and placements.

So my question... is this even a possibility with my unrelated background and bachelors degree? Would it be ridiculous for me to try?

Tldr; I want to get a masters in clinical mental health counseling but my background isn’t related. Can I do it?"
i8161r,341,2020-08-11,This laboratory researches sin. One of the test subjects just escaped.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i8161r/this_laboratory_researches_sin_one_of_the_test/,"I'm just a low-level intern working in this labyrinth of inter-connected labs, filled with oblivious and demanding scientists. They want samples delivered *right now*, and their coffee *piping hot*. I despise most of them.

But Dr. Lee and I got along the best. Maybe it was because I was very interested in his work. We were studying patients who not only presented with some sort of mental health issue, but also had complained of other, often inexplicable physical symptoms.

One subject seemed the most promising, or more accurately, what came from her. Sarah Wilson. We extracted this, god, I don't even know what to call it! A being doesn't quite cut it. Monster would be closer, but still loses a bit of the accuracy.

Wilson had been suffering from depression, but our x-ray machine caught the cause. She had been muttering Biblical gibberish during the procedure, and honestly that combined with what I saw on the x-ray screen still haunts me.

It looked like a baby monkey with four arms on each side, narrow eyes which came across as black infinite holes on the x-ray.

""What's that?"" I asked Dr. Lee, fascinated but terrified at the same time.

""Call me crazy,"" he replied. ""But I think it's the cause of her depression.""

It might've been a fucked up conclusion, but he turned out to be right.

When he extracted the creature less than a day later, we were both astounded by what we saw. The eight-armed monkey was about a foot tall at most, strange gleam in its beady red eyes. It didn't seem to resist, but was very limp, almost dead seeming. Dr. Lee placed it in a large glass container for further study. The monkey rested against the glass like a fish left on dry land.

""Truly...bizarre."" Dr. Lee said. ""I can't wait to study this creature further.""

Dr. Lee's eyes were wide and excited, and I remember being surprised by that at the time because he never looked like that. He always said how boring the field was, that he had been waiting for a truly exciting medical anomaly.

""In all my decades of research, I've never seen anything quite like this,"" Dr. Lee muttered later on in the laboratory. The monkey didn't seem dangerous at all, despite my initial gut feeling of being absolutely horrified. It just lay there, red eyes dull and nearly lifeless. But it wasn't dead.

Dr. Lee went on to comment about how truly remarkable it was that Sarah Wilson had recovered. So quickly, too. We chose not to inform her of the thing which grew in her stomach, saying it was a generic tumor instead.

""Are you sure this thing is harmless?"" I asked, moving a way a little.

""This is actually a perfect opportunity for you, Miles, to get some good field experience. Why don't you come closer and take a look? It appears harmless.""

So I did, prodding and poking at it with the scalpel. Its eyes bulged, but nothing happened at first. Then the monkey's jaw worked furiously, speaking so quickly that I had a hard time making out what it said, especially since I was also mildly terrified in that moment.

Dr. Lee sprang to action, plucking the thing up like a rebellious cat and placing it back in the glass container, placing the lid firmly on top. The monkey went limp as soon as it was placed inside. As if on cue.

Replaying the monkey's utterings back in my head, I thought I heard it say, ""the negligent soul suffers hunger."" It was the only phrase I could make out.

Dr. Lee only came across as vaguely unsettled by the whole thing, but I was absolutely horrified. Even though the thing remained limp in the glass container. I could see it breathing...slowly...slowly...

Things only got worse over the next several days. Dr. Lee became obsessed with the creature, which he nicknamed Indolence, for the supposed Biblical reference it made before, and for its tendency to slump and appear lifeless while in the glass container.

But I knew this thing was fucking trouble. Dr. Lee just viewed it as another opportunity to satiate his scientific curiosity. Sloth merely played dead to lull his prey, I thought, my thoughts feeling a bit unhinged.

One morning, I came into the lab and Indolence was missing from its container. Dr. Lee was furious, said he searched all over the lab, and the adjoining ones to see where Sloth went to.

""It's not in any of the other labs, I'm worried it's gotten out somehow.""

I was worried about Dr. Lee. He had a light stubble, and dark circles cradled both eyes. He often slipped into obsessed researcher mode when confronted with an interesting seemingly unsolvable problem. And Indolence would definitely qualify as an unsolvable problem, as it posed a number of questions neither one of us had any clue how to solve.

A frantic shift followed, and Dr. Lee became increasingly tired as we searched for Indolence. No matter where we looked, we couldn't find any sign of the eight-armed monkey.

I eventually went home. Dr. Lee said he'd leave soon after, but I knew a lie just escaped his mouth.

I rode the subway home, deep in thought about our test subject and where he might've run off to. As soon as I opened the door, though, I had my answer.

Sarah Wilson sat on my couch, an arm around Indolence. Its red beady catching the waning rays of sunset coming through my window, three of its arms around Sarah's shoulders. Dr. Lee, my mentor, lay sprawled on the coffee table, dead, and with blood staining the white lab coat he wore to work that day.

She made me an offer then, and in the context of a dead body in my living room, I could hardly say no.

I'm still helping to perform experiments, still fetching coffee. I'm not quite sure who or what Sarah is, but she scares me. All along, I thought Indolence was the corrupting element, and granted he did just that to Dr. Lee, but Sarah is the driver behind the wheel.

I better do as she asks or the eight-armed monkey might somehow take over my body, and then I'd be little more than a sloth in my own right.

In my spare time, I've been looking into the personnel files. Sarah apparently worked here years ago, well before a broad staff change (probably really reduced the chance that someone would recognize her). Her file has been mostly sealed, but there's maybe one or two employees from then I can talk to so that maybe I can find out what's going on.

Dr. Lee had been one of them, but he's gone now. I'm thinking it's related to why she had him killed by Indolence.

Except it wouldn't make sense because he should've recognized her.

I'm applying this November and I'd really appreciate reading the experiences of others who have been in a similar situation at this point in their educational journey. I have paths in mind for what could happen, and your advice could determine where I go from here or help me to choose a different path.

***Course completion***

* I'll be applying for EECS
* I'll have completed  all the required coursed to transfer listed on the [assist.org](https://assist.org) and couple additional courses

***Grades***

* I have a 3.74 GPA now.
* I have 4 grades TBD for this semester and if I get all A's this semester I will have 3.83 at the max

***Background***

* I moved from Nepal with my parents 5 years ago
* Due to family financial constraints, I wasn't able to focus on school I was working to support my family throughout the highschool.
* I enrolled in college but  I was working 2 jobs and going to college full time at the same time. I tried my best but it just went downhill I failed two-semester and I was on the verge of getting kicked out of the college.
* The financial situation starting getting better so I started devoting all my time in college and here I'm now.

***Extracurricular***

1. work work work 😂
2. Volunteer computer science tutor for a year
3. Member of the Association for Computer Machinery;  I might be elected an officer position this semester.
4. Member of SAME (Society American military engineers)
5. Starting a  student chapter of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers this semester at my college

***Options***

1. I would really like to go to Berkeley. This would be my number one choice but I'm worried I won't get in seeing how competitive it is.
2. Another path would be to go to UCI...not really wanting to go there, but if I have no other options and if I got accepted to UCI
3. Another path would be to stay one more year at community college and finish all other required courses for other UC's like UCLA and UCSD and be more involved in school and do an internship and apply.

I:

* want to go to Berkeley but I'm worried I won't make the cut for EECS.
* have, at best, a 3.83 GPA
* have all the required course inform the assist and couple additional course

OR Should I:

* apply for CS BA because I'd definitely have a better chance?
* apply for EECS because I might have a chance and it'd be worth it?
* hope to get into Berkeley, but go to UCI if I don't and do get accepted.
* Thanks for taking the time to read/share.uired courses for other UC's like UCLA and UCSD and be more involved in school and do an internship and apply.
* forget about getting into Berkeley because I'll never make it?

i82746,9,2020-08-11,Is the net opportunity cost of an MBA from an IIM worth it after graduating from an IIT?,_you_shall_not_pass_,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/i82746/is_the_net_opportunity_cost_of_an_mba_from_an_iim/,"Hey guys, I am not sure if this is the right sub for this kind of discussion, if it isn't please point me in the right direction. I understand some of the stuff I say in this post might sound obnoxious but please trust me when I say this: I am genuinely confused and need some advice. So here goes:

I am a pre-final year student at an old IIT in one of the circuital branches. The placement and internship season is going to start soon, and looking at the figures that are being offered to some of my batchmates, I wanted to know if doing an MBA after graduating with such an offer makes any sense. I don't want to talk in vague terms here so I'll give some concrete numbers: around 10 people were offered PPOs by Microsoft (with an annualized CTC of around 20 lakhs, 15 people were given PPOs by Goldman Sachs, with an average CTC of 30 lakhs per year, many many more from not so famous companies like Publicis (18 lpa) / JP Morgan (18lpa) etc. ). These are indeed average numbers for the people who get placed from the circuital branches in software development roles, and quite frankly speaking, unless you're targeting some really top tier companies, it's not very hard to grab these. A ritualized solving of sites like Interviewbit and GeeksForGeeks for a month or two is more than sufficient. To reassure you that is indeed the case, the numbers I mentioned just now are simply the PPOs. A lot more people get these during the actual placement season. After talking to fellow friends in my department who worked in these product companies, and using sites like teamblind, it has become fairly clear to us that if we do indeed adopt this path, our trajectory, if we take an optimistic look at it, might land us with an annual compensation in the  somewhat wide range of 50lpa-90lpa by the time we are 30. Might sound a lot but really SWE salaries are inflated. 

This was the background context I had to setup. Now my real question is, do you think, as someone who has been offered these jobs at the age of 22-23, and given the scope and (artificial?) demand for SWE, it would make sense for to leave this to do an MBA from a top college (say, IIM ABC) in India? I personally do enjoy coding and building stuff, but I am fairly curious and wouldn't mind doing something else if it's interesting and pays more. But quite simply put, at the moment my primary objective is to maximize my compensation in the near future while also trying to keep options open as much as possible for the later part of my career. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find any website like teamblind for MBA grads to get a direct insight in the salaries that are offered to these individuals eventually, and having looked at the real offers vs the averages that are presented in the public for my own college, I know better than to judge them by their placement report. I understand the question might not be very clear, but that's really because I don't particularly know what to expect. Does an MBA degree, which would cost north of 20 lakhs, and make me miss out on 2 years of job experience and salary, prove itself to be worth it when compared to the career growth of a SWE? Since it's easier to judge any hypothesis with numbers than arguments, I don't mind reframing the question as: can I expect a significantly higher salary as an MBA compared to the 50-90 lpa range that engineers are paid by the time they're 30? If so, how much more? Are MBAs paid north of 1cr by their early 30s very frequently? North of 1.5cr? I don't mind sticking to purely tech, nor do I mind moving out to some other industry. The only aim is to maximize the CTC. I have heard that finance pays incredibly well too, so if anyone has numbers for that, it would be super helpful. 

I would really appreciate if people who have experience in the industry and know how the career trajectories grow for people with just BTech vs those with MBA, please let me know. To keep this discussion meaningful, I would really appreciate if people who do not have first hand experience to please state so clearly. Thank you all!"
i82is9,2,2020-08-11,Remote farewell,bold-italic,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/i82is9/remote_farewell/,"Hi everyone!

I will be leaving my internship place after 6 months of working remotely. As a result, I didn't have the closest relationship to my co-workers but I still want to organise a nice leaving video call.

At previous internships, I would usually provide breakfast or at least bring cake for the team I had worked with and usually we would go for leaving drinks afterwards (European country).

Anyone else having been in that situation, how did you plan your last day and do you have any suggestions on what left a good final impression on your employer?

Thanks so much!! :)"

I am on an H4 visa which means I can legally reside and study here, but I cannot work. This means I can't get a paid internship at all, and the only way to do so would be to switch to an international student (F1) visa. I have applied for an F1 but due to the pandemic the processing will obviously go a lot slower than usual. I'm not sure when my F1 will come in, it might not even be this year. I could apply for internships in Canada (my country of citizenship) but they would have to be remote or I would have to move there for the summer. Till then, what can I do to ensure that my resume, skills, and real world experience matches my peers who have actual internships? How can I still get a decent job right out of college? Thanks in advance for any advice :)"

It would be great for some experienced professionals to give some insight into working in BC or Alberta to students and young professionals. Thinking of starting a digital community with universities being out and networking events mostly cancelled, but thought I would get a discussion going here.

Here are some questions to get discussing! Let's start with talking about what people are seeing as the ""new normal"" regarding remote work. 

(1) What is your job (if you work) and how has it changed?

(2) Are junior positions, internships and co-ops looking to become remote more commonly mid and post-pandemic? 


Some more general topics-

(3) Let's talk tech hubs. Kelowna seems to be taking off, what smaller cities and towns do you see potential for a tech industry? (Or where are you based?)

(4) Share your experience/your story as a tech professional in BC or Alberta."

I don't know what I don't know, haven't done any major projects, and only infrequently code on the side. 

I first started learning by reading documentation/ Stack Overflow. So my learning of the basics has been patchy and driven by necessity, yet I have no patience for beginner courses since I'm not learning from scratch. It's an awkward position.

I really want a computational job in the future, because algorithms, ML and computer modelling have so much potential to solve FASCINATING problems. The scientific applications of programming are what really draw me, not the money. 

I study Bio right now and really regret not choosing a seriously quantitative discipline for undergrad. I feel like I'm already losing out to CompSci/Maths/Physics/Chem undergrads, in that order exactly. I've lost interest in biology and realised that what actually matters to me isn't the content of the subject, but being in a position to solve problems and design solutions (!!!)

I know peers (studying the ""god tier"" subjects I mentioned above) who have been coding since they were kids - front-end, back-end, you name it - scoring internships on data analysis and game dev and I just... These people are miles ahead of me with their degree AND their portfolio/side projects.

How do I compete? What could I possibly do? Right now all I've done is minor stuff like Conway's Game of Life (tried to make a gui where you toggle the conditions, lost steam and gave up) and Regex for extracting citations from papers (fuck it, still got issues with months like January 2020) 

The ""can anyone give me project ideas"" question has been asked a million times but I was wondering if someone could just give me advice. I've got two more years in uni - what can I do to build a portfolio, score a data analysis internship at a start-up or something like that? If I'm being too ambitious, please knock me down a peg.

I live in Oregon and honestly SO MANY of our colleges are underrated we have Reed college which is an amazing LAC that refuses to work with USNEWS so they are quite literally rated under what they normally be. Then there’s willamette which a few people know to be amazing but overall is forgotten and not well known. Then linfield which deserves more attention than it gets. And then Lewis and Clark college which has super strong programs but is also just not super well known. Then Oregon state which is a super strong school for STEM but again just not given enough attention. But out of all of those the most underrated school in Oregon in my opinion is university of Portland. It is a Christian university which is why I didn’t even apply but even though I still understand that it’s an amazing option and it often offers great financial aid. It’s programs are strong it offers many great internship opportunities and so much more but is overshadowed for out of state students and in state students George Fox university which is a good school but not near UofP overshadows it for Christian schools

Returning to school after 2 years and taking a full coarse load(5 classes) seems hectic but the extension also seems very intriguing.

His questions are:

- What do you think students misunderstand about the hiring process?
- Even junior roles require job experience. How do I get experience with no experience?
- I don't make meaningful connections at networking events, is this normal? What should I do?
- I've just bombed a question during my interview, what do I do?
- Do I need to know how to code to work in tech?
- Do you think these emerging areas like Cybersecurity, AI/ML, VR, Blockchain are good areas for students to get into/major in?

- What are the traits and examples of candidates you look for in the interview process?
- My interview is tomorrow, how do I prepare? People tell me to “research” in order to prepare - what does this mean?
- What's the work culture like and will I get the opportunity to travel?
- Is the job really stressful? Does that change over time?

Hi All

A few weeks ago I asked for feedback on what your biggest worries and questions are around the job hunting process. We nearly got over 400 responses.

There were some common pain points:

- Most advice at careers fairs etc is a bit generic.
- Generic information isn't actionable
- Actionable information is hard to find
- A lot of advice boils down to 'do everything (marks, extracurriculars and experience) and you'll get in'
- A lot of existing content is PR &amp; Marketing and it doesn't feel candid or completely honest.
- Hard to get much info til it's time to apply and by then it might be a bit too late


Some analysis from the data. The following were the top five answers for each question.

The hardest parts about the process were:

- Lack of experience
- Lack of information
- Length of process
- Competition
- Interviews

The people you wanted was

- Mix of people
- Related to my field
- Successful graduates
- Senior people
- People making hiring decisions

The questions you wanted were

- Expectations &amp; Day to day tasks
- Making your application stand out
- Stepping through the application process
- Interview preparation

A good answer was

- Honesty
- Detailed
- Clear and candid
- Personal experience

75% of people had a positive first impression of the service!

Thanks everyone and hope you find this useful."

To introduce myself briefly, I am a self-taught developer with 3 years of developing(not in a company setting) and 2, 3 years of learning experience from a 3rd world country(meaning they have to sponsor for my visa). I have been trying to land a job in the EU for 1 year now and applied around 100 companies. Have gotten \~12 interviews.

But none of them led anywhere; therefore, now I am looking for ways of going the extra mile. Just anything that can get me a bit closer to my goal. I am considering doing cold calls but aside from that, I am having trouble thinking of anything else. Obviously I do not have a network in the countries I want to work in and creating such networks would take a considerable amount of time.

Here is a list of the things I have done to help anyone who is looking to give advice.

* Have created a professional-looking CV with 2 pages of a portfolio that contains open-source applications as well
* Have written cover letter specific for every company I apply to
* Have stated that I am open for internships in case they have doubts regarding my eligibility

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any help/advice regarding ways of going the extra mile and improvements that can be done."

I was especially surprised, because I really didn't think I did a lot. The offer is valid until 30 October. During the internship, the work was not so much software development, but research on crypto and machine learning. I did not love it so much, but it was alright. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I really want to explore different options, but the time seems to limiting as I have til 30 October to either accept/reject the offer.

Would it be too sneaky to accept the offer for now, and when I get a letter for another internship that I like, I switch? Am I burning the bridge right now?"

I graduated from my undergrad in June and have been job hunting ever since. I'm located in Canada and am a Canadian citizen, but I'm applying to jobs all over Canada and the US.

I'm trying to avoid jobs that are exclusively software - I have a strong preference for hardware-related work. I have a fair bit of embedded and test software experience from my internships, but I'm interested in positions that involve work such as RF board-level design or embedded hardware design. I'm also open to working on digital hardware positions, but admittedly I don't have much experience with Verilog and RTL, so I'm working on a project to teach myself the basics.

Job hunting during covid is a major downer, so I'd appreciate any advice on improving my resume or projects that I can work on."

Our University first taught us Java and moved on to C++ for the intermediate courses. Because I only started coding Freshman year so I was hoping to gain some feedback about my next steps for getting an internship.

When I was looking through software engineer internships on LinkedIn and Google, it seemed like there were not that many internships available for C++. If there was, it was usually for big tech companies and required like 4-5 years of work experience and some crazy qualifications so I feel so underqualified for these positions. I would like to work at a smaller company first to gain some experience about what it's like as a software engineer. I was wondering how to apply for internships when you have no work experience in the field and what skills and languages you should master to apply for internships. 

P.S I was trying to learn SFML during the summer because I was interested in making a game but now I'm unsure if people still use SFML and if it's even worth learning at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of my next steps and have come up with some options. Feel free to share your opinions

1. Apply to as many internships as possible on LinkedIn. Get LeetCode Premium and spam interview questions so I can possibly ace the coding interviews?
2. Start a project that I can put on my resume and learn another language and apply in the spring.

i8b6wd,3,2020-08-12,24 y/o feeling unfulfilled in government job(s). Should I try a PhD?,goldsoundz123,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/i8b6wd/24_yo_feeling_unfulfilled_in_government_jobs/,"As the title states, I'm a 24 y/o feeling unfulfilled and a bit lost in my career. I've been thinking about going back to school for a PhD, but am not sure if that would solve my problems. Here is my backstory:

I got a Master's in Economics in 2019 (right after finishing my undergrad). In the 16 months since getting my Master's, I've worked three different jobs in the public sector.

The first was a summer internship that I really liked. The four major selling points were: 1) I got to work alongside a PhD economist doing academic-type research, which I found very interesting; 2) I came in with a group of 7 of other students who were fun to be around; 3) It was in the city where my family and friends are; 4) it was a very low stress, 9-5 environment.

After that, I worked for another public service agency in my first career type role (i.e. not an internship). In terms of stability, I felt like I had a golden ticket. I could just stay in that job for 35 years, making a middle class salary with great benefits, and then retire. However, almost immediately after being hired I started looking for other jobs, for a couple of reasons: 1) I didn't find the work interesting or intellectually stimulating. 2) I felt like a cog in a machine, with no opportunity for creativity or individuality. 3) It was in a new city, several hours away from my hometown. 4) The people were very nice, but I didn't make friends there like I had at my previous job.

Recently, I got an opportunity to transfer to a different public sector department and took it. I guess I need more time to evaluate how I feel about this job, but even before taking it, I felt like it was more of a stepping stone than an end career path. The big pro of this job is that I get to work with data everyday, which is a skill I've been wanting to develop. However, the field it's in is not really a field I have any background or previous interest in. Maybe that passion will develop, but maybe it won't.

For the last couple of months, I've had increasing thoughts of trying to do an Econ PhD with the aim of becoming a prof. I've been reading more about it and have talked to a couple current students + current profs. I find this career path attractive because: 1) I like learning and I feel it would be a very intellectually stimulating career; 2) I think doing research might scratch my creative itch and would be fun; 3) I miss learning everyday; 4) I think it would be fun to be around other academics with interesting ideas + work with young people as I age. It's also worth noting that, at the first two public sector departments I worked at, the people who I thought had the coolest jobs were Econ PhDs.

However, I also have some doubts about this career path that are holding me back. I think a big worry for me is just that I wouldn't be a good enough PhD student and/or researcher to be successful. I'm smart, but not a genius. I'm diligent and studied a lot of hours during school, but I worry that I've gotten used to the 9-5 public service life and won't be able to handle an increased workload. I like economics, but I don't think about it all the time, so I'm worried I don't love it enough. (In my free time, I do read some econ journal articles + magazine articles, but mostly just play a lot of 2K, browse reddit, and hangout with people.) The other worry is the stress of it. I've felt bored in my government jobs and occasionally there's a tighter deadline where you have to work some overtime, but I don't get the stress headaches like I used to in my Master's. I don't have to compete for grades, RAships, tenure-track positions, research funding, etc. I don't have to work into the evenings or on weekends like I would if I did the PhD--&gt;academia route.

So I guess my options are: 1) Just stick with this new job for a while, maybe look to make a career move 5-10 years down the road. Have a stable and not stressful job that I may never find super interesting. 2) Try to find a different public sector job that's more like my internship experience. 3) Try the PhD.

The concern with (1) is that I'll just feel unfulfilled and it will be harder to make a big change later on. The concern with (2) is that I'll just keep job-hopping and never find a place to settle + that internship experience may have been pretty unique. The concerns with (3) are that I either fail out/drop out quickly (or maybe don't even get admitted) and then am even more lost than I am now or I complete the PhD but can't get an academic job so just go back to public sector (losing out on 6 years of earnings to get to likely the same place) or I get an academic job, but it's super stressful and I find it more stressful than rewarding.

Anyways, as you can likely tell, I've got a lot going through my mind, but it was good to write it out. Any advice on what I should be thinking about would be greatly appreciated!"

When I do collect them, eventually I convert it to video or audio clips and add it to my files. Most of the videos or movies that were on the tapes were normal, older popular movies, families recording birthdays, you know, the normal stuff. The cassette tapes were my favorite. While they were a majority of the time just something mundane, like a talk show, or some old crappy version of a podcast, the treasures that’d I love to find where the really dark ones. The ones equivalent of you going deep into the dark web to find. I had a fixation on them.

I came across something that…leaves me horrified to say the least. I found a collection of unnamed cassette tapes that have a majority of interviews, eye witness statements, and assorted information about the disappearance of Torner Forest, MT. As best as I can gather from the tapes, it was a small town in northern Montana, fairly close the Canadian border, but there is one problem. It doesn’t exist. Google it, I swear it doesn’t exist. What I can gather from the tapes to what happened there is so fucked that I, well I can’t go anywhere else with this. My friends think I’m crazy or it’s just a fake, and I just need someone to agree with me. Something happened to Torner Forest and its residents.

*Interview 1, Tape 1 – Miss Catherine Sweetey*

**Agent Blodgroe:** Ma’am, My name is Agent Blodgroe. I will be conducting an interview today about what happened in Torner Forest. Can you please state your full name, age, and how long you lived in Torner Forest for?

**Miss Sweetey:** Oh we’re starting…? Uh. My name is Catherine Rose Sweetey. I’m uh…34, and I’ve lived in Torner Forest since I was about twenty. I moved her with my ex-

**Agent Blodgroe:** Very good ma’am, thank you. Start by telling us where you were on August 14th, 1975.

**Miss Sweetey:** Hmmpf. Well I worked at the local daycare. We had one of those big wildlife research facilities, and a majority of the people who lived here worked at the facility and needed someone to watch their kids. The daycare was so full that day, all the kids were laughing and playing. That morning was so sunny outside, we let them play on the swing set and the sandbox we had. I remember…

**Agent Blodgroe:** That’s good enough ma’am. Did you see anything happen unusual that day?

**Miss Sweetey:** If you hadn’t interrupted me, I would have. As I was saying, I remember looking up to the sky and seeing no clouds. It was a perfect day, a crisp 75 degrees outside. I watched the kids for the next hour or so, when it was time to bring the kids inside for a snack and the first lesson for the day. Now I don’t know if you know Idaho weather very well, but it changes fast. Very fast. I’ve seen it go from sunny to snowing within an hour, in late spring nonetheless. But when the weather changed this time, it was so fast it was unnatural. The temperature plummeted so quickly that one of the boys, Anthony, started to have an asthma attack right then. It went from that sunny day to what felt like a bad freezing day in winter. I was able to stop Anthony’s asthma attack, and we got all of the kids inside. Shortly thereafter, parents started to pick up their kids, worried about what the weather might mean for the day. Usually, we have anywhere between 10 to 15 kids there. About an hour after the freakish change in weather, only two were left.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Jacob Moore and Rebecca Palstry right? The two kids you brought with you to the police station here in Whitefish?

**Miss Sweetey:** Unfortunately, the only two. Their parents never arrived that day. My partner, Abigail Hickey, left early to go home so it was just me with the kids. We were there for another two to three hours and then…

**Agent Blodgroe:** And then what?

**Miss Sweetey:** Those…things. God’s punishment. He was the only one with the power to resculpt their flesh in that horrible vision. One of them was my neighbor, Mrs. Hawgreath. She was 67 years old! And she was crawling around like a spider! She even had two more limbs growing out of her chest, they were long and pointy, like a spiders leg. Her mouth unhinged, stretching impossibly wide, and released this horrible howl. Then…she saw me. I had only just stepped outside the door, and I was able to step inside and lock the door before she got there. But she was fast. Too fast. Faster than Olympic athletes doing the sprint.  She slammed the door like a bull, and then she just kept hitting the door. Over and over again. And she never stopped moaning, this low guttural moan.

**Agent Blodgroe:** *\*Chuckles\** what like a zombie?

**Miss Sweetey:** Worse. So much worse. There was no air being sucked in for her to breath. She just moaned endlessly.

**Agent Blodgroe:** I…apologize ma’am. Please continue. What did you do from there?

**Miss Sweetey**: Thank God that it worked, because I don’t know what I would have done if it hadn’t. We had this bell on the back of the building for when the kids were playing outside, that way we could let them know it was time to come inside. I rang that bell, and when she charged around the building, I snuck the kids out to my car. When I turned my car on, she charged me again from the other side of the building. I ended up hitting her to get out of the complex, and she stood up too! I didn't even realize how close I was to dying either. I hadn't noticed the two holes she had put in my side mirror and door trying to get me. God must have punished us for something. God would only do that to people if they deserved to be punished.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Did you leave the town straight after then?

**Miss Sweetey:** Yes. I drove to the closest town, Whitefish, and went straight to the police department. They told me I was crazy! Took the kids from me and locked me in a jail cell. I sat here for a couple days, and then you showed up.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Thank you for the information Ma’am. Your assistance is appreciated.

*Interview 2, Tape 1 – Mr. Jacob Klein*

**Agent Blodgroe:** Mr. Klein, My name is Agent Blodgroe. I will be conducting an interview today about what happened in Torner Forest. Can you please state your full name, age, and how long you lived in Torner Forest for?

**Mr. Klein:** Don’t call me Mr. Klein, alright? That was my father’s fucking title. I go by Jake. Jacob if I hate your ass, and I’m pretty close to hating yours. Fancy tie and shit. I’m 26. I lived in Torner forest for about a year, before recent events.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Good. Why did you move to Torner Forest Jake?

**Mr. Klein:** I got an offer to work at the wildlife research building as intern when I graduated college a year ago. Then I was fired about a month in. I didn’t have the money to move, so I got a job at the local dinner to save up my money to get the hell out of this shithole of a state.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Okay…Do you know why you were fired?

**Mr. Klein:** Of course I fucking do. I broke the rules. As an intern, the amount of locations that I could go to inside of the research facility were limited to say the least. It felt like they were hiding something. Something very big. Something either illegal, or very dangerous. And I was super curious to find out. I broke into one of the rooms, and that was that. I got caught and they fired me. It was a big waste of energy and time, because I didn’t see fucking anything. Empty counters. Who knows, maybe that saved my life if they were shady enough.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Did you notice anything unusual?

**Mr. Klein:** Of course I did, why do you think I broke in you dumbass. There were a lot of blood vials and packs being taken in. Never out. Only in.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Interesting. Where were you on August 14th, 1975?

**Mr. Klein**: That’s the day the shit went down right? I was working the diner most of the morning. I got off right before that weird drop in temperature that happened. I had been living out of my car for about a month, so that shit sucked. Felt like I was freezing to death inside my car. Then some weird shit started to happen. People started stumbling out the diner, puking their guts out, they started to fall down and they never got back up. After that I panicked, and high tailed my ass out of there.

**Agent Blodgroe:** How did you end up in Roosville then?

**Mr. Klein**: Got caught crossing the border with something I shouldn’t have.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Right Jake.

**Mr. Klein**: Jacob. I really don’t like your smug looks.

**Agent Blodgroe:** Mr. Klein. The mass amounts of cocaine you were trying to smuggle into Canada. Well. I thank you for your assistance.

**Mr. Klein:** That’s it? You don’t need anything else? Are you going to hold up your end of the deal then? Get me out of the shithole that I am in?

**Agent Blodgroe**: Nope. Your assistance has been appreciated. Unfortunately for you…

The problem with this is that the job I would do has nothing to do with what I am currently doing, but something much more related to engineering (as I work in a train manufactory company), which I don't like at all.

I am getting tired of Madrid, so I would like to try nee places. How hard is to get an internship in Data Science with my profile in these times? I speak fluently Spanish and English, and have an intermediate level of German. I don't care about the city, I just want to know if there are some options out there for someone like me.

Thanks in advance!"

So, after a long time of on and off college I will finally be graduating with my bachelors degree in computer information systems. I feel like am very late starting my career(29m). I have been applying for many positions whether it’s for an internship, entry level help desk positions position and software development positions but haven’t had any success. I live in Atlanta and I am worry that I won’t have find a job by the time I graduate. I just don’t know what I should do especially with the whole COVID pandemic. Lately, just feeling stressed and a lot of anxiety. 

My university offers Handshake as a way for us to apply for positions but there again no luck. 

What can I do or should be doing to hopefully land a job before I graduate? I am apply to 10-20 positions a day and have applied to over 400 positions nationwide with only 1 call which fell through because it was more customer service than IT related."

yesterday I got a job interview with a job I applied to a couple months ago and no longer want or need. I mentioned it to my mom, who told me to to in for it and just see where it led, which, smart, whatever. so I went in today and they offered me the job off the bat, so I took it, even though I'm not sure I actually want it. they're going to hire me as long as I pass the drug test. 

I did shrooms and smoked a few days back and I'm not 100% sure I'm going to pass the drug test, but like, I don't really want this job anyways. I have other jobs going for me. 

but I called my mom to let her know how it went, and she laughed when I mentioned that i wasn't sure i was going to pass the drug test tests get hired, so i figured that was fine. I drink and smoke a normal amout for a college student, and while she's a little conservative (immigrant mother), I thought she was coming around to it. she drinks with me and I thought she was fine with it. for context, recreational marijuana is 100% legal here and I'm of age for both drinking/smoking.

well, in a soap opera twist, after i hung up, she accidentally butt dialed me back. she clearly didn't realize and couldn't hear me, so I heard her whole conversation about it with her coworkers. she told them about the drug test, and about how she's appalled that I'm smoking, and that she's worried about my habits. she told them she never worried about my older sister, that my older sister never caused her any problems. she told them that my older sister was never irresponsible like I am. she told them about how i drink at home, about how she doesn't think that I've ever gotten drunk so she thinks that when I mention alcohol I'm just trying to brag and come off cool. I'm in college, I don't use drugs or alcohol as a cool factor, but I've blacked out once or twice because that happens sometimes. I don't know HOW we ended up on such different pages, but I thought my mom understood that I'm making smart choices, but I am making college student choices. I thought she was fine with that, and I thought maybe we could drink together, responsibly, like my friends and their parents do. 

but apparently I was completely wrong, and I just feel stupid. I feel like I always overshare with my mom because I want to share with her, and the it's too much and I should've known and I'm just DUMB. she's an immigrant mom, it's a different culture. I know it's not just a race thing, but all of my white friends' moms get drunk with them and are close and I KNOW it doesn't have to be that way, but I want it. like how I want to be really close to my grandparents like all the TV sitcom grandparents, but mine come from a culture where children are seen not heard. I'm never GOING to have that and it makes me sad sometimes. it's like how I want people to think I'm pretty and love me but I'm not white and I live in a predominantly white town and I can FEEL the way I get treated differently compared to my roommates. this is a rant about a lot of insecurities I've been having lately but whatever. 

my mom is disappointed that I drink and smoke. I have tattoos too, and I skateboard, and I do a lot of things she probably doesn't approve of. I pierced my own ear the other day. BUT I'm in the honors college. i got into an ivy league, we just couldn't afford it. I could've graduated a year early because I have the credits, but I'm double majoring and I have a minor too. I'm taking the GREs because I want to go to harvard or MIT for my PHD next year, or cornell because that's where she went and I want to follow in her footsteps. I have a 3.9 GPA and I'm a much better driver than my sister and everyone else in my family loves me a lot and I've had industry internships for the past 2 years and I just want her to be proud of me. I TRY SO HARD TO MAKE THEM PROUD OF ME and to DO MY BEST. I've overloaded my classes every semester since freshman year and I'm graduating with two bachelor degrees, a BS and a BA, not a double major degree, because I've functionally fit 5 years of school into 4. I just want my mom to be proud of me and tell me that I'm doing well but she'd never say that, because that's not in her culture. she's still way more proud of my sister, who's amazing! but she's the golden child and like my mom told her coworkers, I'll always be the problem child that she worries about and that gives her trouble. 

I should've seen this coming, I always fall short and it's always my fault anyways. I shouldn't have told her anything, I should've known better, that's on me. Honestly, my family is really great compared to a lot of others, I really shouldn't complain about it.  I'm going to go get super fucking drunk and prove her right. I'm worried about turning to alcohol for all of my problems but the thing is, I used to do a lot of self harm and I'm starting to think that this is just my way of hurting myself with it actually making scars that I'm going to get surgically removed later."

I'm a 23yo, living in Brazil, and I've been in college for 5 years now, with at least 2 more left, on an Electrical Engineering program. After much consideration (and I mean, MUCH) I've realized I don't want to work with EE, and want to get a job on game programming.

I love programming, it's basically the only part of my program that interested me. And I love gaming, it's basically the only other thing I've ever been truly obsessed with besides coding.

&amp;#x200B;

# My plan

Logically, I thought, the next step was to make a rough personal roadmap. I'm considering:

1. Dropping out of college temporarily;
2. Keep working on my internship (more of a entry level solar modules sales job) and on my personal game projects until the end of the year;
3. Next year, solicit a program transfer to Computer Science (I can't  do this before next year);
4. Graduate probably on 2023 or 2024;
5. Get a remote job in a game studio (any one, just to get my feet on the door).

The game programmer job isn't my ultimate goal. My ultimate goal is to make cool games that bring joy to people. However, I believe that this way is the best one to achieve that dream while working on things I enjoy.

Another way to achieve that would be to get a job on non-game related programming, since I enjoy coding in general, and just go full indie dev on the side. That would be a bit more viable since at least there are some big/medium companies I could work on here in Brazil, the same of which cannot be said about game studios.

&amp;#x200B;

# Problems

The thing is, from what I've read online, the part of getting an entry-level remote job seems kinda impossible. I don't  even know if it's been done before, someone from an entirely different country getting hired like that.

And it's \*\*\*\*\*\*\* killing me not knowing where to go, what to do. I haven't been able to sleep before 4am for like, a week now from sheer anxiety. And I have to work at 8:30am.

I would love to be able to relocate (love Brazil, hate our current situation), but it would add even another challenge: my girlfriend, whom I plan to marry somewhere along the route, is studying Architecture and due to the dynamics of her field, it's really hard to get a job somewhere no one knows you, or at least that's what she believes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

If you have any tips, any success story of someone who did something like what I want to do, anything really, please share. I just need some directions? Sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR: want to get a remote game programming job while living in Brazil, please halp."

I'm currently in a situation where I'm not quite getting enough financial aid to where I won't have enough money for my second semester of cs for loans to cover most of it. I'm 24 and classified as an independent getting the maximum amount of federal aid. I have rent to pay so I need a job (currently working part-time scraping by as a phone/computer repair tech) and am looking at potentially going into IT/help desk tier 1 then transitioning later into finishing my bachelors in cs once I'm making enough money to pay for what my loans don't cover.

Is this something that will hurt my career in software engineering or should I take out some private loans for the two-ish years I have left on my degree so that I can get into the industry faster? Do I have any other options that won't put me into insane debt? Maybe apply and pray for an internship this spring?

I really hate how in this country (US) makes it so hard to get a higher education but I'm determined to find a way to get this degree so that I can pursue my passion. If anyone could provide any kind of advice it would be greatly appreciated because all this is depressing me."
i8gqkq,307,2020-08-12,Guide to Recruiting for Quant/ Trading Roles,traders101023443,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/i8gqkq/guide_to_recruiting_for_quant_trading_roles/,"Hi all, 

I've had a few people reach out to me about advice on recruiting for Quant so I thought I could share my experience to help others who are interested. 

**Prep:** 

Understand these positions are extremely competitive and mainly go to math/stats/cs students at top targets. That being said, it is possible to get a position if you don't go to a target but you need a really strong quantitative skillset either way. 

The structure of the interviews for most shops are: online math/logic test, 1-3x phone interviews, and final round in person. At each level, they try to reduce the applicant pool by &gt;70%, with the initial math test weeding out the most. In my experience, the math tests are a mix of mental math, stats/probability, sequences, and sometimes trading/gambling simulators. It is extremely important that you practice even if you have taken advanced stats/math classes. 

For mental math, I used [rank your brain](https://rankyourbrain.com/mental-math) on expert and didn't apply until I was scoring around \~30. There are a lot of resources to practice probability questions but I used Quant Job Interview by Mark Joshi and just did the probability, brain teaser, and option pricing questions. The key to studying these is to really understand the logic of solving any question. There's no point memorizing answers if you can't talk through the logic of it. There were a few instances where I'd actually get the wrong answer but moved forward because my logic was correct. If you don't have much stats experience, I'd recommend taking a bayesian statistics and game theory course. Bayesian concepts are especially applicable to trading. For option pricing, I never got many question on the greeks  but there were a fair amount of calculating probabilities of outcomes given option prices. A simple example to think of is (if a painting could either be worth $100k if its real or $1k if its fake, and you receive an option to buy it for $30k, assuming the option is priced fairly, what are the probabilities of each outcome).

Some firms have a coding part to the interviews but in most cases, you don't need much coding skill. If you are applying to a more algo-focused shop, you should be prepared to answer algorithm questions. For those, you just have to have a lot of CS knowledge. I wouldn't focus on these types of firms if you don't have a strong CS background.

During phone interviews, I got a mix of behavioral (""Why trading?"") and math/stats questions. The math questions range from combinatorics to matrix algebra but you don't really need to know a lot of theory. For stats, they are a bit harder than initial assessment but not too bad. For a phone interview, practice with a friend talking through your logic for a given question. Practice breaking up the problem into components that can ultimately drive the solution. Also have some relevant projects/ ideas that you can speak to in depth. 

For the final round, you just have to really feel comfortable that you know your shit. There will be more rigorous probability/math questions and some problems may not have a known solution. Just remember, the way you explain your logic is far more important than getting to the answer. Also a few places had some type of trading simulation game. That's harder to prep for but you may be able to find some online. 

**Resume/ Application:**

I would recommend making a resume specific for trading where you highlight more quantitative skills/ experience. For example, I had an internship at a VC but focused more on how I modeled companies in different verticals and talked about a machine learning tool I made for the firm. Also it is fine to include school/ personal projects. For example, I made a sports betting algorithm that predicted game outcomes and sized positions using MPT. That led to a lot of interesting conversations with recruiters. Some firms do have referral programs so it would be worth reaching out to someone you know at a firm but it won't get you far. Usually, it'll just get you to the initial math test. 

If you manage your own portfolio, it could be worth mentioning. Be sure to word it in a way that shows it's something you're interested in and not that you're a trading god (you're not).

A lot of firms require a high GPA (&gt;3.6) but if you're not there just list your major gpa if applicable or don't include it. Networking/ cold emailing does very little to help you since relationships aren't as crucial in this business. 

If you're lacking relevant projects, I'd recommend learning python and playing around with some statistical modeling packages (sklearn, keras/tf, scipy). 

Most firms usually automatically send you a math test when you apply so be sure to practice a lot before applying. It might help to have a friend to help you if you feel unprepared but know they'll expect you to perform similar if you move forward. 

**Firm Reputations/ Comp:**

1. Market making: These firms are known to have extremely smart people but have better work life balance than others. Examples are Optiver, IMC, DRW, etc.. 
2. Prop Firms: Beware there are a ton of scummy places that claim to be prop but really it's just an arcade shop. If any firm claims you need to put in your own capital or they won't pay you a base salary is not worth the time. Prop kinda overlaps with market making but some examples are Jane Street capital, Akuna, Jump, etc ... 
3. Hedge Funds: IMO, the most exciting but also worst work life balance. Examples are Citadel, Bridgewater, twosigma.

Comp across the board ranges from $150k-$500k all in. Normal breakdown is $100-$200k base, $30-100k signing bonus, then another $50k-150k performance bonus. Pretty sure citadel pays the most but it sucks to work there. 

As far as reputations go, during my interviews I always had a pleasant experience. Most people are nice and polite and are happy to help you understand the firm more. I found Bridgewater's culture to be pretty weird. For example, they have an automated system that tracks everything you do or say so you can get an email saying you said the word ""um"" 3.6 times in the past week and need to communicate more effectively. At Citadel, all traders looked like they wanted to die but they're all rich. Other than that, if you can get into a top shop, you'll learn a lot and most are a very collaborative working environment. 

**Conclusion:**

Understand that making money in trading is extremely difficult and competitive. Dont think you can easily gain an edge or identify unique opportunities because there's usually someone more experienced and smarter on the other side. That being said, if you work hard and spend time to understand your focus/ niche, there may be opportunities. 

Yes, recruiting for this role is extremely competitive and stressful. More so than IB/PE imo. It can be disheartening at times, but stay motivated and try to improve. I got rejected by a ton of firms and it definitely can weigh in on you, but if you work hard and keep with it, something positive is bound to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps. Good luck!"

After spending a decade working towards being an amazing chef, I began reading up on logic gates to put me to bed at night. I quickly enrolled in school full time, and am graduating this summer from a top public university's CS program. 

Paying my own bills kept me regulated to paid positions (aka cooking) during school, which left me with 0 internships on my resume. I also had 0 credits when I began, so my fellow students were all light-years ahead - some have obtained *senior* roles immediately after graduation. Compared to the competition, my resume looks sparse and possibly lazy. 

The few recruiters I have talked to didn't follow up, and my first couple interviews for entry-level positions in fall 2019 went very poorly (DO YOUR LEETCODE!). I've greatly improved my ability to complete the coding questions and talk about my projects, but I am worried about the expiration date of my education. 

**Question(s)**

Where do I go from here? Am I really under-qualified, meaning I should bite the bullet and enroll in a masters, just to maintain status? If initiating conversations with companies is acceptable (aka works), who do I contact? HR? Senior devs? 

To add liberal amounts of salt to the wound, an acquaintance who caught the CS bug after I did completed a 6 month bootcamp and immediately received an internship which then got him a job. I know those programs specialize in finding their grads work, but still, what a slap.

I can't tell if this is just the current climate or if I would be in a similar boat regardless."

Revature offers 45k for 1 year and 60k for the 2year if the company doesn't buy me out according to the review.

I am really debating if I should go for the experience and take the low pay or keep hunting and not get a job for the next 4-6 months.

I need some input as you guys are amazing at rationalizing things and seeing stuff from another point.

Also my gpa is a 2.93 as I had to take Electrical and Computer Engineering which included hardware classes from which I hated a few. And last 3 sems I suffered a lot due to family deaths.

Looking for a job and advice on how to proceed.,new2itsendhelp,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/i8jqe2/recent_is_graduate_no_experience_looking_for_a/,"I wish I had discovered this sub while I was still a student because now I am a bit stuck. I am looking for some advice on how to proceed in finding a job.

I had the misfortune of getting my BS in Information Systems this May, during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic hitting, the job market in my area for entry level IT jobs was thriving so I didn't think too much about finding work once I graduated. In an effort to graduate without any debt, I worked as a restaurant server and never did an internship so I have zero professional experience in IT.

I graduated cum laude and really enjoyed all of my IS classes. I also have a solid homelab setup that has taught me a lot about Linux, virtualization, AD, SSL, VPNs, networking, data replication, etc. This is reflected briefly on my resume as recommended by others here. Unfortunately, I do not have any professional certifications.

After COVID hit, I was a bit nervous about entering the workforce and didn't start looking for work until the end of June. Since then, I have sent out around 75 applications and have only received one interview from a local MSP who I am still waiting to hear back from. As for the rest the breakdown is as follows:

90% - No communication.

8% - Email stating they have decided to move forward with more qualified candidate.

2% - Call saying I do not have the minimum 2 years required experience for helpdesk but that they do have a customer service position available for recent graduates.

I understand that times are tough for everyone right now but I thought helpdesk was supposed to be the entrance point for IT. I'm not applying for sysadmin jobs or any crazy reaches it has been all helpdesk or desktop support roles. How do I get the 2 years of helpdesk experience required for helpdesk jobs?

So I am looking for some advice on how to land my first job. Or at least how to get an interview. Now that I have graduated I don't think I qualify for internships anymore. Should I go for a certification? Money is pretty tight right now and I would hate to spend a big portion of my savings on the A+ when I don't know how much I will really learn from it. I'm really interested in the RHCSA as I much prefer Linux to Windows but I don't know how much it will help me when I'm looking at first time helpdesk jobs.

Thanks in advance for any advice."

I’ve been taking 20mg XRs for a while now daily during week days. I know I have somewhat of a temper usually so I’ve been good at dealing with that and communicating with my doctor about taking breaks. The problem lately has been is that I work in sales and have been WFH for the past 5 months and it’s driving me insane. 

A bit of background, I started right after college and found success quickly. I was riding a huge wave into February and was ahead on pace to promote by my 1 year mark if not even a month sooner if my momentum kept going. Prior to covid I did consider leaving and even interviewed around since I didn’t find fulfillment in my job but ended up turning down an offer. I came to the realization that my company offered a lot of potential to grow if I just kept popping off at the pace I had going plus my manager is the best manager I’ve ever had (comparing to my internships and friends’ opinions of their managers). Turning down that offer is now the biggest regret of my life to date. 

Covid hit and most of our clients went dark (i live in Bay Area for reference and sell people for a living - agency recruiter - focusing on full-time product designers and product managers) my plan to promote by my 1 year mark fell apart because my team and I weren’t able to bill for one reason or another. I was proud of myself for still consistently closing at least one account per month but recently even that fell off.

Around June was when I started noticing some weird symptoms. Obviously my role is pretty fast paced and high stress but I started to wake up angry every morning and get triggered easily by random things like WiFi losing service for a few minutes during meetings or out of pocket comments from colleagues/candidates/clients. These episodes became more frequent and ramped up with intensity from going to the beach to cool off for a bit to breaking down in tears out of frustration. The most recent one, I had to actually start working out with some weights because I was starting to hit the wall next to my desk out of pure rage about all of the aforementioned points. My mind just always goes back to how I put myself in this position and that I’m trapped because I’m unable to even land an interview at this point. 

I’ve never had this type of rage before and generally see myself as a calm person (although the temper thing, the most I usually do when I get set off is say something snarky and move on with my life) but the violent urges to hit stuff and slam my laptop are scaring me. Is this a symptom of the XRs? Is this covid related? How are you dealing with WFH and the anxiety side effects? 

Thanks in advance for any help and thank you for reading this long post!"
i8lnhs,4,2020-08-12,24 y/o feeling unfulfilled in government jobs. Should I try a PhD?,goldsoundz123,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/i8lnhs/24_yo_feeling_unfulfilled_in_government_jobs/,"(Tried posting this in r/careerguidance, but only got a couple responses, so thought I'd try posting here as well.)

As the title states, I'm a 24 y/o feeling unfulfilled and a bit lost in my career. I've been thinking about going back to school for a PhD, but am not sure if that would solve my problems. Here is my backstory:

I got a Master's in Economics in 2019 (right after finishing my undergrad). In the 16 months since getting my Master's, I've worked three different jobs in the public sector.

The first was a summer internship that I really liked. The four major selling points were: 1) I got to work alongside a PhD economist doing academic-type research, which I found very interesting; 2) I came in with a group of 7 of other students who were fun to be around; 3) It was in the city where my family and friends are; 4) it was a very low stress, 9-5 environment.

After that, I worked for another public service agency in my first career type role (i.e. not an internship). In terms of stability, I felt like I had a golden ticket. I could just stay in that job for 35 years, making a middle class salary with great benefits, and then retire. However, almost immediately after being hired I started looking for other jobs, for a couple of reasons: 1) I didn't find the work interesting or intellectually stimulating. 2) I felt like a cog in a machine, with no opportunity for creativity or individuality. 3) It was in a new city, several hours away from my hometown. 4) The people were very nice, but I didn't make friends there like I had at my previous job.

Recently, I got an opportunity to transfer to a different public sector department and took it. I guess I need more time to evaluate how I feel about this job, but even before taking it, I felt like it was more of a stepping stone than an end career path. The big pro of this job is that I get to work with data everyday, which is a skill I've been wanting to develop. However, the field it's in is not really a field I have any background or previous interest in. Maybe that passion will develop, but maybe it won't.

For the last couple of months, I've had increasing thoughts of trying to do an Econ PhD with the aim of becoming a prof. I've been reading more about it and have talked to a couple current students + current profs. I find this career path attractive because: 1) I like learning and I feel it would be a very intellectually stimulating career; 2) I think doing research might scratch my creative itch and would be fun; 3) I miss learning everyday; 4) I think it would be fun to be around other academics with interesting ideas + work with young people as I age. It's also worth noting that, at the first two public sector departments I worked at, the people who I thought had the coolest jobs were Econ PhDs.

However, I also have some doubts about this career path that are holding me back. I think a big worry for me is just that I wouldn't be a good enough PhD student and/or researcher to be successful. I'm smart, but not a genius. I'm diligent and studied a lot of hours during school, but I worry that I've gotten used to the 9-5 public service life and won't be able to handle an increased workload. I like economics, but I don't think about it all the time, so I'm worried I don't love it enough. (In my free time, I do read some econ journal articles + magazine articles, but mostly just play a lot of 2K, browse reddit, and hangout with people.) The other worry is the stress of it. I've felt bored in my government jobs and occasionally there's a tighter deadline where you have to work some overtime, but I don't get the stress headaches like I used to in my Master's. I don't have to compete for grades, RAships, tenure-track positions, research funding, etc. I don't have to routinely work into the evenings or on weekends like I would if I did the PhD--&gt;academia route.

So I guess my options are: 1) Just stick with this new job for a while, maybe look to make a career move 5-10 years down the road. Have a stable and not stressful job that I may never find super interesting. 2) Try to find a different public sector job that's more like my internship experience. 3) Try the PhD.

The concern with (1) is that I'll just feel unfulfilled and it will be harder to make a big change later on. The concern with (2) is that I'll just keep job-hopping and never find a place to settle + that internship experience may have been pretty unique. The concerns with (3) are that I either fail out/drop out quickly (or maybe don't even get admitted) and then am even more lost than I am now or I complete the PhD but can't get an academic job so just go back to public sector (losing out on 6 years of earnings to get to likely the same place) or I get an academic job, but it's super stressful and I find it more stressful than rewarding.

Anyways, as you can likely tell, I've got a lot going through my mind, so any advice on what I should be thinking about would be greatly appreciated!"

I graduated in 2018 with my bachelor's and have applied to hundreds of jobs on LinkedIn and indeed. While I was in school I really couldn't do any internships because I was working part-time to help pay for tuition and I was going to move to California after I graduated, so I know no one was going to hire me. So far I've had a couple interviews that I believe went really well but I was passed over each time. My roommate tried getting me a job where he works but the owner told me he wouldn't proceed with me because I didn't have enough apps in the app store. Another rejection I received, which is my favorite, is that they required 1 year of experience even though my resume ""looks good"". I've been working retail part time to cover living expenses and things have been copacetic so far. However, I just put in my two weeks. While being furloughed I was able to complete my app (GoWithFriends) and get it approved on the app store. I feel my time would be better spent trying to build up the ad revenue from that and starting my own company, which is my main goal. Also due to the virus we have been completely understaffed and overworked, so that was the tipping point. Is it really this hard to get a job in tech? What can I do to help my chances of getting hired?

I just got my masters in bioinformatics (diploma hasn’t even arrived yet.. so it doesn’t feel official yet!).

I’m scared to apply for a job as a new grad with almost no experience in the field. With that said, what can I do to strengthen my resume?

I thought about getting certifications (want to feel more confident with my coding skills). Any recommendations on what classes I should take?

Also, would it be even feasible for me to get an internship?

I did work hard on getting my masters, but I know I have so much more that I can/should do to improve.

Any recommendations?"

Any recommendations on outside resources? I really would like some interactive-type learning so I can practice it in code. But textbook recommendations are also helpful. There seems to be a lot of resources out there but it's difficult to know which ones are the *best*.

My goal is to learn the CS 261 equivalent so I can learn even more advanced classes beforehand too, as well as boost my data structures &amp; algorithms skills so I can do internship technical interviews sooner."
i8o1f1,5,2020-08-12,I hate my job but I dont know if I should risk going back to school,uncompromisingsiblin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/i8o1f1/i_hate_my_job_but_i_dont_know_if_i_should_risk/,"Obligatory Sorry,  I'm in Mobile, also sorry this is long.

For background: graduated in 2019 with a BS in Biology, in school I worked part time in a botany lab doing basic molecular bio work for 2 years and had 2 previous internships (one at school and the other at the USDA)  Since graduating, of all the jobs I applied to, I've only gotten 2 interviews at small labs. I was able to get a part time job as an after-school ""STEM teacher"" last August up until the pandemic shut us down mid March. 


My job just called me back and asked if I wanted to come back for the new school year, since schools are closed, they are looking at possibly opening back up as a ""distance learning center"" where low income elementary school kids who don't have access to computers or internet can do their schooling in a safe environment. So I would actually be Full-time instead of Part-time. They told me I have until Friday to give an answer and they also told me they'd want 100% commitment. Idk if that means they're gonna make me sign a contract or if they want me to understand that they don't want me to back out bc it would be hard to find another teacher. 

I know I should be grateful for this opportunity especially in this job climate but here are my reservations:

1. I have generalized anxiety disorder, when I was working there before pandemic my anxiety increased so much bc I had some issues with some of the kids there (it was mainly behavioral issues i was not prepared for) and lack of help from the head staff made me dread coming to work. BUT with this new program we'd be getting completely different kids so I'd have no idea what kind of behaviors or upbringing these kids have. 

2. I have to commute ~1-1.5 hrs both ways to work on public transport to get to work.  If I drove it would really be 2-2.5 hrs and at first I was fine with the commute bc I commuted most of my life but now with the virus I don't know if its worth risking getting sick

3. My work environment would be 2 teachers grouped with maybe 12 kids. Idk if that's too many kids and would put me at risk. I'm asthmatic, so I've been taking quarantine super seriously. Before we shut down, I asked my dr if I should keep working and she said I shouldn't worry if I am careful (which kinda bothered me)

4. I dont think I want a career as an educator, so I cant say this work benefits my resume. But its better than being unemployed, I think.

As for going back to school, I was thinking about going to a CC and completing coursework towards getting into school  for Clinical Lab Science. But rn I think its too late to get into classes for this Fall and I don't know how much harder it would be to get a better part time job.


Im sorry if this is stupid of me to be complaining about. Any advise would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"

My younger cousin recently received a software engineering internship offer at a notable, mid-size software company. He doesn't have prior industry experience - all his coding experience comes from classes (EDIT: he's halfway through 3rd year) and a couple very small projects. He is worried about how he can best prepare for the internship, so that he can successfully get a return offer if he really enjoys the job. We're not sure what stack he will be working on yet.

I was considering just having him run through some FreeCodeCamp modules, specifically the Responsive Web Design, Javascript, Frontend, and API modules. I was thinking this would give him a solid background in general. However, I'm a bit worried it may be a bit too spoonfed, and he won't learn how to effectively search for things on his own. Also, I'm not sure if it will really instill good coding.

Does anyone have any other recommended resources that would help him be ready to succeed at an internship?

Thank you so much!"

I'm starting college at 20 looking to major in computer science. I want to program, I don't exactly know what kind of work I'd enjoy the most but I trust that will come in time. As far as I can tell, I seem competent in comparison to my peers too. In high school I was best in class for my game dev classes, programming classes, and CAD classes. I've been trying to research what kind of job I would like so I can get an idea of what I want to work towards and what internships I want to search for as I start college, but I keep finding news relating to the ""over saturation"" in the coming job market.  


Things I know:   
The tech industry is only growing at this rate, everything between startups and the Big N.  
There are more students going in to get degrees in related majors.  
There are people coming out of code camps or similar programs, but don't seem to often produce good programmers.  
IT is improving for these reasons as well since more and more things switch to being more digital.  
There's a *current* saturation of mediocre programmers, and due to this there is significant struggle in being a newly graduated student and finding a first job.  
Having a developed portfolio and internships helps offset this significantly.  


All this in mind - and if I'm wrong on anything please shoot the messenger - how much do I have to worry about my next four years? I've found a plan to chase a degree that keeps me out of significant debt, and if all else fails I'm really not afraid of the trades...but I know this is my passion. And of course, if there is an oncoming recession or depression, how much would that effect the job market for this type of work, if at all?"

I recently graduated this year, and got a job after graduation with an a internship before taking this job. Make decent money for the area (at least I think, it's about 70k Utah UT, but seems super low but asking around seems standard?).

While I really enjoy the tech stack, people I'm working with, I am worried about our tech stack. We currently are using React with Javascript/Typescript, Mongo, Node.JS, and all the modern stuff (with cloud). However, I am worried I am trapping myself to be a pure web developer rather than a 'Software Engineer'.

&amp;#x200B;

In school I learned all the other common languages used Java, C#, Python, SQL, etc. But none of that is really used. I also scoped out some job postings encase I ever wanted to change down the road and looks like C++ is pretty common language also, but is not used at my place of work (at least on the team I'm on)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess at what point do you just accept your career path, and go with it. I just do not want to leave the job down the road and have future employers just see me as a web developer as I know they typically get paid quite a bit less then 'Software Engineers'.

Basically I have attained a CSIT diploma scholarship and if i were to accept it, I need to go for a compulsory internship. However, I've been leaning towards fyp all this while before the offer came down? Prefer certain conditions that are available for the fyp option.

In terms of prospects, grade attainment, development.......can anyone share some thoughts? Also for those who have interned with csit, i would appreciate some ideas of hows it going to be like?

So I have just finished my BSc. in Electrical Engineering at the TU Delft in the Netherlands. I am very interested though in Computer Science and I want to pursue a career in that direction, especially in the AI/ML domain. Coming year I will be doing a MSc. Embedded Systems at the TU Delft, composed with mainly CS courses, so that I can do the CS master afterwards (normally you would have to do a bridging program but they have made an exception if I do it this way). But I am also looking at universities abroad to do a Masters after my year of doing Embedded Systems. I have a very good GPA (8.8/10 (2nd highest of my year), equivalent to a 4.0 gpa I think), so I am looking to enroll in the CS/AI/ data science programs of high ranking universities like, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Cornell, university of Columbia etc..

My question is if I am aiming too much for the stars here? I have a good GPA, but I also see people around here with tons of side projects and internships and stuff which I simply don't have. Other than a chess engine I am writing right now and my BSc. graduation project about stress detection from ECG and respiratory effort using an ML approach, I have no other projects. Also I have less CS experience than most as I have done an EE bachelor (altough I did follow two extra CS courses (15EC) at RMIT in Melbourne for my minor).

So should I also apply for some other universities that are a bit less highly ranked, as to boost my admission chances? Also, I am definitely going to need a scholarship, so are there any resources I should look into for that, or is that more university specific?"

Then you guys suggested me to create a hands-on project and get out of tutorial hell, I would always be thankful for this advice. 



So, I brushed up some concepts and started to do small stuff and applied for a web dev internship. I got selected but then the internship people tell me to take 3-4 days and learn Django because we'll be building an E-commerce in it. 




I learnt as much as I could and along with other peers in 30-40 days we built the entire Backend in django. These 30 days made me so good in Django which 6 months of tutorials couldn't in NodeJs. 



Now I prefer the structured way of Django, and NodeJs feels very messy. Would you guys suggest me to continue Django, I am thinking of learning React along  or should I focus on MERN stack?"

I selected my thesis advisor in 2019 based on a list of approved supervisors and their specialties. I chose the only advisor in my field (sustainability), but he's not part of the sociology department, he's part of the business department. He approved taking me on as a student and my initial project proposal, which was based on my internship (also in 2019). I had one initial meeting with him in 2020, and then the pandemic hit. 

Due to the pandemic I stopped work on my thesis and I got an extension until September from my uni based on me having a young child at home. I notified my supervisor and he said to reach back to him when I resumed work on my thesis. When the daycares opened up again in June, I sent my child back and I wrote my internship place to ask if I could continue working on my thesis there since the uni and libraries were all closed. They said it was fine and helped support me through rewriting my thesis proposal and giving me space and access to wrap up my research and do my writing. I wrote back to my internship supervisor at the beginning of June to ask if he could look over my revised proposal and give me any feedback. He did not get back to me until the end of June when he said he would look over my proposal and get back to me. 

The uni shut down for the month of July and nobody responded. This was understandable, and I did as much as I could on writing my thesis. To make sure I was on the right track, I paid for a tutor to look over my proposal and revisions and give suggestions so I wouldn't fall too far behind over the break. 

I've been stumbling a lot with my thesis because I don't have a strong background in academic writing and I don't have anyone to talk to about it. I talked to one of the academic counsellors at my uni and she made me realise that I only have two and a half weeks left until my due date and I still don't have any feedback from my supervisor or approval for my revised project plan. I sent him the draft of what I've already written (about 1/3 of the total) to see if he could tell me that I'm on the right track or I need to do more or if I should scrap it entirely.

But thinking about it if he disapproves of my revised proposal then I have to start all over again. If there are any major errors in my draft I have to start all over again too. The academic counsellor said that if he's not being responsive at this point then I might want to consider getting a new supervisor - but that would delay my thesis and my completion date by another 3 months. 

 Is it worth it to wait for his response? I don't know what to expect from this level of education.  Should I just go ahead and ask for a new supervisor at this point? It's not that he's a bad guy it's just I don't think it's a good fit at this point. I'm so stressed out over this and it feels like I've wasted my summer. I'm sorry if this is all over the place but it all came to a head about an hour ago. 

Thanks for your time."

I'm starting think that maybe I have begun searching too late and so there's no real good opportunities for me right now. My problem is that, most of these opportunities require a ton of experience. Like there was an Epic Games internship I got excited for only to realize I need to have experience w/ physics engines, programming games, C++ and C# - all of which I do not have. I couldn't even teach myself all that in the span of a few weeks.  Not to mention, a lot of this internships require a good understanding of the C languages (I'm only good with Python and JS/HTML). 

My question I guess would, when should I apply to internships? Should I apply to them even if I don't have the required experience? Should I wait until I learn C++ and C# to apply to some of these internships?

Feeling quite lost on what exactly I want to do in life( I wanted to pursue marketing but haven’t had any experience in it yet since my initial internship changed due to Covid). Last year I applied to internships for bigger companies (Capital One, Deloitte, etc) but heard nothing back and didn’t even get a rejection email from them. My hopes are low, but I want to go ahead and apply to the full-time roles they have like business analyst. What’s the best way to go about applying? My school is hosting a panel discussion with employees from these companies that I signed up for later this month. Should I wait until after that to apply to any positions? I’ve read it’d be good to connect with current employers when trying to apply.

i932gb,2,2020-08-13,Should I negotiate my sign-on bonus on an already strong offer (...in covid times)?,l337sassninja,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i932gb/should_i_negotiate_my_signon_bonus_on_an_already/,"Hey reddit,

I'm a CS major, going into my final year of undergrad. I just finished my 3rd summer internship at Facebook, and they have extended what I believe to be a very strong offer. 118k base, 160 in stocks vesting over 4 years, and 70k sign-on.

In my final discussion with my recruiter, I asked if any parts of the offer are negotiable. He said that there is some leeway in the sign-on bonus, but the rest of the package is set (this does fall in-line with what I've heard other interns turned full-time say, with bonuses going up to 100k).

This is the job I want to take, with 100% confidence. I also think this is a strong offer, better even than what I hoped for. I have an interview with Microsoft in the next month (but no other offers currently). I let my recruiter know I was interviewing with Msoft (even though don't want to do the interview and have no intention of taking a job with Msoft).

So...I would really like to just sign my FB offer now. However, I would also love if I could negotiate for another 10-15k in the sign-on bonus (I mean that could be a new car, or half a year of rent for me). What I am worried about is trying to negotiate for another 10k right now and having the offer rescinded (I think this is unlikely, but I also don't know how covid is affecting their hiring). From talking to other interns converted to full-time, in normal times, it is usually not hard to get another 10-15k in negotiations for the sign-on.

Long-term, 10k isn't such a big deal, and it certainly wouldn't be the difference between my taking the job and not (especially when I have no other offers), but it is still 10k to a new college grad.

Lastly, the job security of just signing now is so attractive, especially when so many other talented people are struggling to find work.

What would you do reddit? Negotiate or sign now? Would I be risking anything if I asked for a bump in the sign-on? Do you think it is in the realm of possibility that they would rescind an offer if I asked for another 10-15k? How would you go about it?"

My GPA is average, I’m not good at taking tests because I miss a lot of small details during calculations, I hate taking 2 hr lectures because it drains me, I feel the pressure that I should be achieving more when I compare myself to my classmates, I always have an unconventional way of solving things and being told that it’s not right and overall doubting my abilities every little thing that I do. This is on top of the struggles of being an only child and taking care of one of my parents during a time of sickness. It’s been a constant battle of doing what I love vs feeling that I don’t belong.

But once I look back to all the things that I’ve achieved, I realize that I’m more than qualified and capable of doing what I do. I’ve participated in a handful of research projects, I did an REU during a summer at a different university, I was Vicepresident for an association at my university, I recently worked in a team to develop and optimize a manufacturing line at a plant and I’m currently in a 6-month long internship in a leading company in the world.

I want to take this time to do self learning and make projects, because currently I have nothing to show on my resume. The problem is, I have absolutely no idea what to do or where I should start.

My coding experience so far is that I have done 3 classes in college that have used Java (first one just being an intro course). Since the end of the spring semester I have tried learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have a decent grasp of HTML and CSS, and I understand Javascript to the extent that I could probably do most of the things I know how to do in Java with Javascript, but I am having a hard time actually applying it to anything.

I'm struggling to find things that I can do that are actually attainable for me right now. I have a web project that I have started but once I got most of the basic HTML and CSS done I got completely lost as to what to do next and I think I may have been a little bit in over my head, even though the project sounds fairly simple (the project is a webpage to add bookmarks to).

I have a lot of things I would like to do/get experience in this semester, such as web, app, and mobile game development (and I do realize that I may not get to everything I want to), but I am just overwhelmed with basically no guidance. Whenever I look the documentation for anything, even things that shouldn't be that difficult, I get lost immediately.

Any advice? I want to start applying for internships soon but I don't feel like it would be a fruitless effort with having nothing to show. I have this whole semester to accomplish some of these things, and I just don't want it to go to waste because I don't know what I am doing."

However, I'm getting demotivated since it seems these IT fields require a ton of certifications and experience in help-desk like positions before moving into the sought after roles. DevOps also seems to be something that requires a lot of industry experience before moving into a role.

Last year I landed an internship at a large multi-billion dollar company, which I was super stoked about because, even though they didn't pay me very well as an intern, it was very prestigious, and I thought it could lead to a further career with the company (ha!). Anyway, my supervisor there was the person who, completely unintentionally, 'woke me up' to the problems with work and corporate culture. 

\-she was in her early thirties, but all she talked about was how excited she was for retirement. She would always share her future plans for travel and such, and would cross her fingers and say ""only thirty-eight years to go!"" If the only thing you're excited for is almost forty years in the future, and you're essentially just trying to make time pass until then, what kind of a life are you living?

\-she seemingly did nothing except for work. She was always in early, stayed late, took on extra responsibilities. She had meaningful contact with almost no one outside of work but her parents. She told me she hadn't been out with friends in over a year!

\-she was always extremely stressed out. So much so that it was intimidating to approach her, with questions or even just to say hi in the morning. She also always looked sick and exhausted, huge bags under her eyes and sickly/yellowish skin. Even though she was a fairly attractive person, she looked awful to be blunt. She would spent her fifteen minute breaks dead asleep in the storage room with a pillow (upper management probably didn't know about this).

\-my internship was only for one semester, and I was returning to grad school afterward. On my last day she told me to enjoy school while I could, because its ""way more shitty"" in the work world.

Interacting with her, and just seeing how hopeless and empty she was, really affected me, especially since she seemed like she'd be a pretty cool person if it wasn't for work just beating her to a pulp. Now that I'm graduating myself, it makes me scared. I'm terrified of ending up like her, and 'losing my soul' so to speak. But I need income and don't know what my other options are. It makes me feel hopeless and empty myself knowing that that might be my fate.

Anyway, I know this is long and don't really know what my point is, but just wanted to share."

I've talked to some people who worked at both and want to clear things up, would you mind answering some questions?

1. What exactly is an analyst? The Goldman website is vague on their specific roles. I've heard that new interns regardless of whether they're in to do IT or finance are placed into a huge 'analyst' class (I've heard there's classes of 1000+ people each year WTF), made to do a boot camp and then they part you according to your field (tech division, finance, risk assessment). I don't know anything about banking so I'm really foggy on the details.
2. How bad is the work culture? I've already confirmed with everyone that investment banks suck ass for WLB and employees, especially new ones are worked to the bone. It can't be that bad if so many people look for a position right? Especially since I'm young and can get away with less sleep more work
3. Is there a dominant personality type? I've heard of Goldman described as full of 'type A personalities' and super-smart, super driven people. That motivates me since I want to be like that but I'm afraid that less aggressive personalities won't make it, is it Wolf of Wallstreet-esque or can normal people thrive?

I have some work experience related to algo trading and have done some machine learning stuff.

From what I've heard it's pretty hard to find quant internships as they require a lot of math background, so do you guys know which are the top companies that offer them? I've looked into TwoSigma among others.

Any other tips that can help me in my preparation are more than welcome."

I'm currently on a ~10 year old build that's starting to show its age (frequent driver crashes with no fix in sight, a few burnt out monitor pixels, left arrow key busted, and general sluggishness with games + productivity at times). So I figured it's time for an upgrade :)

Old/current specs for reference:
CPU: i5-2500K &lt;3
GPU: GTX 970 (upgraded to this about 5 years ago)
RAM: 8GB 1333 MHz
WiFi: USB dongle :(
Monitor: ViewSonic VA2431 (got this from an internship when they went bankrupt)


**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

General purpose for the most part. Decent amount of gaming (mostly single player FPS/RPG/Cities Skylines/Civ). Also daily multi-tasking of productivity stuff - software development / office suite / RDP / dozen browser tabs.

I don't intend on overclocking.

I'm going for a wifi-integrated motherboard since wired is not feasible for my apartment setup, I think the one I picked is pretty good, though open to feedback.


**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

I'm shooting for 1440p x 144hz for most games at high settings (ultra if lucky) around any bearable FPS (30+ ?).


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I'm not going to penny pinch, I have a good job and don't spend much on anything else, but I'd like to stay around $2000 (+- $500) including monitor.


**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

US

I wanted to go with the RTX 2070 Super but all retailers seem sold out or overpriced - I think the RX 5700 should be fine for my use case though (and I can hopefully upgrade it in a few years if need be).

Was going to do an AIO CPU water cooler but read some stuff about it being overkill (I'm not going to overclock).

Would love feedback on the monitor though, I'm not too knowledgeable with them and kinda just picked something top rated.

Also, if anyone has suggestions for a USB switcher, I intend on using one to switch my keyboard/mouse between my new desktop and a work laptop docking station (then I plan on using the second input on the monitor to connect to the docking station and just swap inputs when needed)


Thanks!

I have completed 2 internships so far. The first was a data analyst internship at a utilities company, and the second was a data analyst internship on the fintech team at a midsized asset management firm. Both of these were positions fairly programming heavy (for an econ student) and I primarily coded in R and SAS, and I've also taken a couple courses in Python.

However, I'm at a total loss about what to do next. I don't know what type of internships I should be applying to for next summer. Given my background, what type of finance positions would I be competitive for? Would FP&amp;A, risk management, or business intelligence be realistic options? Should I try to stay in finance or potentially look for data analyst roles in healthcare, insurance, or energy instead? Maybe work some more on my programming skills and try to break into data science? Any suggestion or guidance would be appreciated. Thanks."

I (24F) am a CS student in BC, Canada going into 4th year. I was hoping to do an internship this summer but I had a bad injury and could not do an internship. As such, I would have to extend my degree now to do an internship and it would be pretty late into my degree. How detrimental would it be to skip an internship all together and go straight to work? Could a strong portfolio make up for it? Would 5 years of work experience as a technologist and inspector in oil &amp; gas contribute much to the job hunt? 

I am eager to get into leadership positions as fast as possible and have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. I do not really want to be a cog in the wheel for very long at all.  I am switching careers and not excited to be a junior in a new field again, but I know I have to put some time in. I am hoping to go more into back-end or full stack development.

I would appreciate your opinion and thoughts on entering the field!"

Some **brief** information about me. I am from a developing country, *Iraq*, and currently I am *24 years-old*, and also I am *married* with no kids.

How I **got into** programming. When I was a teenager I used to play a game called *GTA: San Andreas*, the game had an online multiplayer mod called *SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer)*, people were able to script their own servers using a C like language called PAWN. And that was where my journey began. After finishing high school I decided that I want to study Computer Science, but I took this decision too quickly without even doing some local research on job availability.

My **college journey**. My *first year* was quite good, there were better students than me, but I literally kicked ass in programming class, but that was due to students not even knowing how to operate a computer. The *second year* was a bit more difficult, but I still was the best one in programming. These two years I learnt the basics of C++ and implemented some data structures using C++, such as Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Double Linked Lists. Now, my *third year* was better than my second, I learnt the C#.NET programming language and the Windows Forms API, I quite liked working with the Windows Forms API, and doing projects with it was enjoyable, after the year was over I did my internship locally in a govermental office, I built a windows application for them using the Windows Forms API that I grew to love, however, in production things were terrible, I had very bad code issues, hard coded some values that I shouldn't of, my database issues were endless, so the project I worked was axed, I was really **DEPRESSED**. My *fourth year* was TBH just a normal year, I did not learn anything new at all, only HTML &amp; CSS which I already knew the basics of.

For **more than 7 years** I have not decided whether I want to specialize in *Web Development*, *Mobile Application Development* or something else entirely! I always get stuck reading books, watching videos, doing the best MOOCs out there, and the cycle just repeats itself. I know the solution, yes, it is practice, and working on real projects! But I always and **always** get stuck somewhere. I think a lot about what project to work on, what idea would be successful, I research for days, and after I settle on an idea I try to create the UI for it, then research for weeks! Eventually I get tired and leave the project all together, my problem is *lack of discipline* and the solution is to be *more productive*, ironic right? I mean I know all of my problems and the solution to them, yet I keep repeating them!

Living in a country such as **Iraq** is very difficult, I am currently dependant on my parents even though I am a grown up man and married, this makes me feel very bad, getting a job here in programming ranges from hard to very difficult, due to some very complex reasons, it is achievable though, I can still do it. One of my best choices is to work remotely for western companies or do freelance work, which I still can't do because I have **no resume** and **no projects** to show to potential employers.

I have no idea what to do, what to persuit in order to build a successful career in programming. I thought of having a mentor would help, but none exist locally, and I can't hire one online, because, guess what, we don't even have **credit cards** which makes everything even much more difficult than they already are!

Me posting this might seem immature, or maybe even stupid, because you might say it is my life and I am responsible for everything that happens in it. And I do take responsibility, I am not running away from my problems. I just need help.

I intend to apply to grad schools for MS CS (with spec in ML/AI) in US, Canada and Germany for 2021. I know I still have some more time, but the whole pandemic situation has really shook me up and I am beginning to have second thoughts on applying seeing the current state of affairs. 

Anyhow, I give to you my application. Please feel free to be brutally honest and drop some advice :)

* BE in Computer Science from one of the top private colleges in India. CGPA: 8.8/10 (3.52/4)
* GRE 160 V 155 Q 4.0 AW
* Worked at a startup based out of my college, developing applications in my field of interest (Computer Vision)
* Have 3 REUs (a top college in India, a good enough college in France and a great university in Canada. Sorry I can't name them) in areas pertaining to my field of interest 
* I also have industrial research experience working as a research intern for the Microsoft R&amp;D Lab in India, I completed my capstone project for my undergrad there.
* I have two published papers, one in an IEEE Conference, and one in an Elsevier journal. One more is 'pending result' and hopefully would be published as conference proceedings. All are related (somewhat) to computer vision and applied pattern recognition methods.

I am a bit worried about my GRE score and CGPA (since I know some institutions value those a lot). I was diagnosed with anxiety in my final year, and thus, took a drop for a year before applying to grad school. Would never have done so if I knew this would be the end-result. 

Would love to hear this sub's take on my application and chances, and any further clarifications, I would be happy to answer in the comments :)"
i99x2s,0,2020-08-13,Not sure if Comp Sci is for me after 6 years of studies,Brocolli123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i99x2s/not_sure_if_comp_sci_is_for_me_after_6_years_of/,"So I have studied computer science since high school through to college and now in my final year of university, and I still don't know if it's not for me at all or I haven't found an area I enjoy. 4 of those years have been in game development, but I definitely don't want to get into such an exploitative industry. I've done a semester of web development (HTML/CSS - Hate, PHP - meh, JavaScript - okay, SQL - okay). But that already counts me out of the majority of software jobs. I feel way out of my league, both technically and socially, applying to all the internships I could, getting 0 offers.  I have few portfolio projects, just completing my coursework alone exhausts me, let alone going above and beyond. I dread working 40+ hours and then even after all that having no energy to do anything I want, plus having to work extra to keep up with the new tech stack.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what career is for me, and that I could do with a compsci degree (too late to change). I like working with computers, numbers, and written communication, but the constant problem solving and stress of a software developer sounds too much for me, even if it pays well. and I'm bad with people and manual labor so that counts me out of 90% of jobs. I'd ideally like to do something with a positive impact - environmentally or socially, not just making someone richer.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  I'm really in a twist between just sticking with this for money, sacrificing my time and energy, or looking for something I might enjoy, but I can't imagine any job I would enjoy"

I was just offered a Fall internship at an insurance company, but I will doing Xamarin and C# for managing their mobile app. In between the pay and the stack, I feel this is a step down. Based on my research, it seems Xamarin is falling out of favor and the mobile community hates it.

On top of that, my other internships paid $20 and $25, respectively. This place is only paying $16/hour, which I unsuccessfully tried to negotiate. My goal was to go from my last internship to name-brand another internship next summer (think Amazon, Asana, etc). I'm not sure $16/hour at a somewhat out-of-date insurance company will be worth it. I am thinking maybe it is better to decline and instead focus on my Data Structures and Leetcode. On the other hand, I can work a regular 20/hrs a week while in school, so that's always a good thing with COVID going on. Thoughts?"

* How should I approach IB recruiting with such strange timing?
   * Is it realistic to break into IB right away (even smaller boutiques)?
* Is worth my time to reach out to other PE firms to see if they hire people like me?
* What other roles should I be applying for if I eventually want to break into IB and then the buy-side?

i9ezgx,7,2020-08-13,NYU vs Duke vs Georgetown vs CMC?,a2cEDthrowaway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i9ezgx/nyu_vs_duke_vs_georgetown_vs_cmc/,"I want to decide which of these great schools to ED. My stats are 75th percentile for all of them and I'm pretty sure my ECs are competitive for them as well. I want something like econ, business, IR/poli-sci/public policy, or philosophy. Cost isn't really a factor. Here's my pros and cons for each:

**Duke:**

Pros:

* Beautiful campus. Of all the 4 of them, I like Duke's campus the most.
* Great econ &amp; public policy majors.
* Their social scene appeals to me for a bunch of reasons: 1) great basketball team and insane school spirit surrounding it 2) great parties 3) Frats &amp; Selective Living Groups (SLGs)-- I definitely want to rush and like the idea of living with a bunch of friends.

Cons:

* Durham isn't that big of a city compared to NYC, DC, or LA.

**Georgetown:**

Pros:

* The location. Lots of opportunities to network with and intern for the government, and a big enough city to have plenty of things to do.
* SFS &amp; MSB combined degree that melds business and international relations/politics. These are both subjects that I'm interested in, so studying a combination of the two sounds very interesting.
* I visited the campus, and I generally liked it-- the way people dressed, the way the campus and the surrounding neighborhood looked, just the general vibe.
* I'm not catholic myself, but I agree with a lot of Jesuit values like service, so I think I might do well there.

Cons:

* The dorms. I've seen Georgetown.hotmess, and I know it probably only represents the worst of it all, but I still can't get over the fact there's rats, roaches, etc.
* Apparently it's very pre-professional. I get caring about internships and jobs and all that, but I also genuinely am interested in learning for it's own sake, and I worry I won't find likeminded people. I don't think I'll fully learn as much as I can if I don't have other people to debate/discuss with, and that's a no-no for me.
* You apply to the SFS/MSB combined degree during your first semester there, so there's no guarantee I'll get in even if I get into Georgetown.
* I heard the party life isn't that great due to the lack of Greek Life.

**NYU**

Pros:

* The Stern BPE Program-- it covers business, economics, politics, etc, which appeals to me, and also includes a full year of studying abroad in London and Shanghai.
* Study abroad opportunities. Even if I don't get into BPE, NYU has lots of study abroad options-- London, Shanghai, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Buenos Aires, etc.
* Other great majors like economics, philosophy, poli-sci. If I get into Stern but not BPE, I could double major in one of those and still get the education I want.
* NYC. Great location for the same reasons DC is.

Cons:

* The social scene supposedly isn't great, and the lack of a campus apparently leads to isolation.
* No sports or school spirit.

**CMC:**

Pros:

* Great economics, government, and IR majors. Also a PPE major, which seems interesting.
* All the benefits of a LAC-- close knit social scene, interaction with professors.
* The consortium and the ability to take classes at any of the 5 C's is cool.
* California weather.
* Great social scene with lots of parties but the opportunity to hang out at the other C's if you want something more chill.
* Apparently a *lot* of guest speakers, which is cool.
* Decently close to LA

Cons:

* I heard it's very pre-professional, so I have the same worries I do with Georgetown.
* I worry the small size might make it feel 'cramped' or like everybody knows everything about you, which sucks. Does the consortium make it feel more like a medium-sized college, or does it still feel small?
* Less name recognition compared to the others.

Thanks for any input."

I recently started a new job as a SWE without a CS degree but with software development internships. However, it’s my first week and I feel like I am so behind my peers. I have not used many dev environment tools such as JAVA, JAVA Spring, IntelliJ, Azure and do not have extensive experience building APIs and the architecture of the app seems very complex to me that . I don’t have an assigned supervisor, and I haven’t spoken up yet cause I don’t want to feel like I’m useless and slowing the team down by asking them to give me breakdowns and tutorials. I feel like I need a week or two of training before I can officially get to the same page as them. What should I do? I feel stressed and nervous, and even a paranoia of being let go given the supply of workers in a pandemic. 

PS: I have never used a Mac before, and have to get used to that too. My previous dev environment in Windows was quite simple in comparison: Python backend, HTML/CSS front end, VS Code text editor, bash terminal to run and test commands and scripts, and Flask/Django for web framework. I did not handle deployment or database."

Since internship / graduate positions are opening soon, I was wondering how popular are they in Europe? I'm sure they are not as popular as SWE positions but should I expect to find a decent amount of companies looking for DE interns / graduates?

I'm currently a Junior in my undergraduate working towards a Computer Science degree. I'm starting to doubt whether or not I actually do enjoy programming, to the extent that I want to sit for a while writing code with Java, Python, etc. Granted, I think creating something with coding is cool, but actually typing all the syntax and large sums of code isn't my cup of tea.

Maybe it's because I don't have so much experience, I'm not sure. Regardless, I want to start exploring internship opportunities for next summer. 

I'm aware that a degree in Computer Science opens up a substantial amount of opportunities, not limited to just being a software developer or programmer. But I'm not quite sure what kind of internship opportunities aside from programming heavy ones exist out there. However, I would like to find such internships because I want to explore other potential careers now while I have the chance before graduating. And I ask to please not just tell me to find a programming internship to see if I'll like it. I know that's a possibility but I want to be open to other ideas.

I like to problem solve generally (albeit I'm not the best, but I am getting better), and I love math and numbers. Anything that can really get me to use my brain and face a challenge would be great. Furthermore, I have knowledge in writing some technical papers and memos. Peers and professors usually gave me high marks on them.

I'm not saying I only want internships with zero programming. Using the knowledge of some of the basics, or even MINIMAL programming would be fine. Maybe the implementation of SQL since I hear it's different from regular coding (I'd like to try SQL out, the general concepts of what it is seems interesting) would be another option. Of course, if there are potential internships in which just being a CS student is beneficial exists, that would be fine too. I'm even open to trying something related to business if the option exists for a current CS student.

What internship positions have you all heard of that I should try exploring online? I'm open to self learning some of the basics if needed for such positions."

Last December I took the normal  generalist test and got in the 20th-40th percentile. I figured it wasn't too bad cause I am a self-taught programmer (specializing in C#) I had worked on a few unfinished projects and was feeling more or less comfortable as a programmer. So much so that I decided to quit my job and go back to school to get a second bachelor's degree (first one is in business management) this time in software development. I am not over half way done with my degree and I feel more confident then ever in my programming skills. I have a couple small open source projects and I have even made contributions to other open source projects. So when I saw that on the Entry level genralist test I got below the 20th percentile I was mortified...

I do not feel like the questions had any practically behind them I spend a good amount of time every week look at projects on github and I have never see code like what was on that test. I also purposely try not to memorize certain terms and the like, cause why bother? I can find what I need on the internet in like 30 seconds to help me remember. 

I wouldn't say that I am super skilled as a programmer but I have a huge passion for it. It is something that I can do all day everyday and honestly never get bored. Are there any businesses out there that would hite someone like me? I don't know everything but I can sure figure it out darn quick. I even have a small side gig, programming for a guy on his website becuase I commicate well and I can get done what he needs done. He knows that I dont know it all, but he doesn't care because I show results.

I just do not know how to properly stand out on paper, cause my true skills come into play when I am on the job. I have an uncanny ability to learn very very fast. But I can only do it if I am actually working on a REAL practical problem. 

When I look at these typical job postings they all want these loads of already learned skills and tons of years of experience. All I can think is well, I don't know it sorry you wont hire me... I just want a job posting where they are like: ""must know theae skills or be able to learn them in  six months"" now that I can do! I have even seen internships that require 3+ years of experience!!! Like WTF?! What happened to good old fashioned apprenticeships?"

This was  around March and due to the pandemic, he told me to connect with him later.I recently had a meeting with him. He has agreed to supervise me remotely for a year if I commit to joining his lab for the Ph.D.  program. He says that it is no point to invest in someone if It does not benefit his group and lab although I will be able to learn from the experience.

I  am very interested in working with him but I am not sure about joining  the Ph.D. program. I just wanted to gain some experience doing research.  Although his area of work is exciting, I am not sure whether my  interest in that field is enough to commit to a Ph.D.  One reason is due  to the financial condition.

He has told me to think about it and reply.

I would like to know your opinion on this matter. Some of my questions are:

1. How good is the NTU CS Ph.D. program?
2. Is the stipend enough to live there comfortably?He  hinted that the stipend for Ph.D. students is around 2000 SGD. One  reason for my hesitance is the financial condition. I do not think I  will be able to bear expenses from my personal money.
3. The advisor is relatively new to NTU. He id his posdoc from standford 2-3 years ago and joined as assistant professor at NTU. Also, his background seems to be from electrical engineering. How will this affect a student's experience?
4. Should one pursue a Ph.D. if he is not sure about it?

I am not sure whether I want to do a Ph.D.

I am also  preparing for interviews for some product-based companies.My originals plan was to work as a software engineer for a few years and then maybe pursue higher studies."

I had plenty of moments where I was like ""oh crap why did I waste time like that they're going to find out, I'm screwed.""

However, I finished my main intern project early, and they said I caught on to the second project pretty quickly. I've had nothing but positive feedback when I've asked how I'm doing / how I'm progressing.

Is it that I had a false conception of how harsh work conditions/expectations are, or that interns aren't really held to a high standard? Is a real full time position more stringent on stuff like this? I figured that this would be a *serious* endeavor at a *big name* company where you're not allowed to *fool around* with unrelated work.

I know I'd get a straighter answer if I asked the people that are actually on my team, but I don't want to risk mentioning to them that I've spent a lot of time not working.

i9qfam,819,2020-08-14,Following this sub's advice is destroying my mental health,cscq_is_shit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/i9qfam/following_this_subs_advice_is_destroying_my/,"I graduated in June, and everything is a shitshow.
I had an offer pulled in March, and have been applying to 20 or so jobs a week ever since.
If you are in my position and post here for advice, you are *very* often told that ""it's a number's game"", and that you just ""need volume"".

Let me tell you: I've spent 5 months applying to as many jobs as I can find, contacting and being ghosted by recruiters on LinkedIn, grinding Leetcode, and building personal projects to pad my resume.
*This shit doesn't work right now*.
I have only had *a single* interview in this time, and it was because a friend of mine referred me for a position.
That fell through because they were looking for someone with an Master's, but the point still stands.

*Everything that this sub has told me to do has been useless.*

I reached a breaking point this week after being ghosted by the nth recruiter, who just no-showed for a scheduled phone call.
The world is a shit show right now, and there is nothing anyone can do.

My advice is to literally *give up on trying to find a job* if you are a new grad without a connection to a major company.
From what I can tell, there is nothing you can do.
I'm going to apply to my local coffee shop and work there.
It's easier to worry about that than worrying about why my 400 or applications have had zero responses, and questioning if I'm just worthless or not.

Go get a Master's, or something, don't do what people here tell you to do.
You'll have a nervous breakdown like me, after some amount of time.
It's nobody's fault, but it *isn't possible to be hired right now*.
Don't let people here tell you it is, and *don't* tell yourself that you're doing something wrong, or not putting in enough effort, because *you can do everything right and still fail miserably here*.

---

Edit: It's hilarious to me that every single reply is someone sitting with a comfy job telling me I just need to ""try harder"" or ""not give up"", as if the whole point of this post isn't that I *have been doing that for months with no fucking results*.

Believe me, I've tried everything.

- I've tuned my resume to the point where the advice thread said it was ""good"" (which is fucking hard because everyone there is amazingly critical of minor points).

- I blow by Leetcode hard questions easily. This skill is pointless because I haven't gotten any fucking interviews.

- I've made a blog, written posts about technical topics, shared them on LinkedIn and other places to boost my technical credibility.

- I've gone through three personal projects to pad out ""new skills"" into my resume to better fit what I perceive the job market to be.

- I've weaseled myself into contact with recruiters from ten or so different companies. *Every single one has ghosted me thus far*.
Oh, and btw: these 10 only count those who I've had some sort of back and forth messaging with.
I've sent out messages to likely 50-100 other recruiters who just simply ignored my messages.

I don't want to hear ""everyone gets ghosted"", or ""try harder, your chance will come"" because it fucking WON'T.
New grads are invisible in the current job market.
Nobody wants to train them, and all the eyes are on talent who are being laid off.
So fuck off with that ""I get contacted by recruiters all the time"" or ""I know people who were hired recently"" because they almost DEFINITELY weren't new grads.

---

Edit 2: I *did* do an internship, at the wrong place.
I worked unpaid, wasn't given any real development experience, or even a fucking code review.
Obviously I got unlucky there, but it does nothing for me.

And it's cute that people think that just because one person said my resume was ""good"" that I would think that it's good.
I've fucking *agonized* over my resume for the last *year*.
I've written, re-written, and edited it so many god damn times, through so many resume advice threads.
I have asked for opinions on it from practically everyone I know, down to the most minute details.

Nothing is perfect, but it's absolutely insulting that some of you would think that my *resume* could be what's holding me back.

And yes, I live in a major tech hub.
I'm from here, it's my home, but I also gave up on getting a job here months ago and have been applying all over the country.

---

Edit 3:
I really appreciate all the people who have DM'd me offering resume advice and even a few who offered to forward my resume to a recruiter.
To be honest, I don't think that linking an angry, miserable post like this with my real name is going to do me any favors, but I appreciate the thought, anyway."

Im 20 y/o male from Mississippi, and have been in college for 2 years majoring in computer networking technology. I honestly don't know if I wouldve even went to college if it wasn't for my mom making me. She's a nursing instructor and has a masters so she's very big on getting an education. However, I feel like I haven't learned the smallest thing from college. I was supposed to start an internship last year, but then I had a wreck. I was so scared about it too becuase I felt like they would hate me because I didn't know anything. It didn't matter though since I was in a wreck insight before I was supposed to start and couldn't work. I was enrolled for this semester, but I had to get a new job to get out of the walmart I transfered to after my wreck which was a nightmare compared to the one I worked at before. So I'm working full time now which made me decide to drop the classes anyways. I was tired of school and am ready to just work and live my life because I'm not learning anything there anyways. Everything was going good, the other day a customer I helped actually offered me an assistant manager position at his furniture store making double what I make now starting out, and even more after a few months. I was very excited about this and I've told them I would start soon. Then, as I was leaving work the other day, my mom pulled and told me she had gotten with my advisor and enrolled me in classes again. Literally her asking me about school just brings her to tears. Like I really dont want to go. I want to start a career at this furniture store.
I guess I'm just looking for thoughts or some reassurance. I feel so scared to talk to anyone about bevause I fell like they'll all think I'm an idiot. Sorry for the life story.

Edit: I here the phrase school is not for everyone from a lot of people, but most of the time they jump right back onto talking about college. That just further confuses me because at first I'm comforted, but then back where I started."

I'm currently working as an intern and am a rising senior in my uni's ECE program. I've had pretty heavy experience doing embedded work with C/C++ (moreso in the realm of EE and CE work than CS). I've yet to see that many people talk about their road from doing low-level embedded work to doing high-level, front-end work if those people exist. 
I'm looking to make that transition just because I feel I'm much more a visual learner and would love to see what I can create. I know python and have done some HTML and CSS as well.

I did not get a return offer at my BB mid-corporate banking internship. In retrospect, this was a colossal failure on my end, and I didn't realize the opportunity that I've had. My class received 3 return offers prior to last year's volume of 9 return offers; I believe that I could have played my cards better.

I, naively, was too confident within my return offer prospects, and failed to recruit during the tenure of my internship. This has resulted in me being phased out of many companies' FT recruiting time-line, and as of right now, I'm mainly applying to just the scraps for the possibility of an internal transfer down the line.

I'm mainly evaluating 3 options:

1. Applying to any available FT positions with relevant and transferable skills
2. Delaying graduation by taking on a data science minor (I believe that these skills will broaden my career options down the road)
3. Applying to a masters program from a school with stronger recruitment

Now, I wish I could elaborate more upon my interests, but it's hard for me to have a definitive idea of what I want to do. I do know that I enjoy working with institutional clients - enjoying the complexities of the transactions and pitching. I think it's a great learning opportunity. I also do enjoy participating in investment analysis and analyzing the effects of macro-trends on pricing of securities, hence why I believe pursuing a data science minor would be a great idea.

I am sensitive to expensive options (option 2 and largely option 3), however, I believe that it could well be worth it if it means I get a higher-paying job outside of school. I attended a non-target school due to the scholarships that it offered. Now, I realize that school pedigree does matter, and this is a price that I'm now willing to pay. It will be the first time in my life in which I take on debt, and I will be more focused than ever.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, would be vital to getting a headstart."

Approach. Ideally, you should approach those mentors who share with you common factors, such as university, profession, interests etc. However, if you need help and the number of common factors is low, be polite, specific, and clearly state what exactly you want from them. Don't send any documents or resume unless they ask  


Send as InMail (template):  
""Hi John, my name is Eugene Hayden and I’m a Master's student at the University of Toronto majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Human Factors. I found your profile on LinkedIn. I see that you are a {Mentor’s Job Title} for {Organization Name} and I’m really interested in learning more about a career in {field}. Would you have time to tell me about what you do and how your career progressed after graduating? I'd appreciate it. Best, Eugene""

My return offer that I’ve already accepted is in my preferred location and I will be comfortable making what I’ll be making. It’s just not an unbelievable offer.

I came across this subreddit and figured it might be a good place to get some advice on my situation or rather reassurance on what I'm thinking of doing, I'll try and keep it short but for context I feel like I have to list some things. 

Although it took forever, I got my degree last year, in Computer Programming &amp; Information systems with cum laude honors, even though my focus during the degree wasn't programming at all, as I don't have an interest in it, having taken programming classes, it's just how they named the program, which unfortunately also seems to be a fight on its own since I get asked what languages I program in 😒

The issue I have is that I've been working jobs not related to IT whatsoever &amp; I have no internships under my belt. The degree isn't helping much anyway as it didn't really set me up. I'm at the point where I need to get my foot in the door in the IT world since I can't just keep messing about. I do have an interest in the networking aspect, like hardware setup, etc.

-----------
Unfortunately, a lot of the jobs I see require ""x"" years of experience, to which I do not have any professional experience in, besides some minor home network stuff, such as; setting up POE cameras, built my own gaming rig, setup home network, and other minor things, but from what I've seen and read about, the general consensus is to apply anyway as those alone might be a good enough selling point. 
**Is it just about trying your luck or setting yourself up for embarrassment?**

I've also been trying to figure out what's a good ""starting"" position to be looking for, kind of **seems like help desk is the go to, with maybe some desktop support titles?**

With that said, I have some free time now, so I've been researching certifications, to help me get my foot in the door or at least a bit more ahead in line, and from my search, it seems like A+ and N+ are good entry ""starters"". Planning to use professor messers courses as they seem to be highly recommended. **Am I right or is there a different recommendation or order I should potentially follow? **


Later after securing a position (and having both A+ and N+)
- Security+

Then down the road 
- CCNA 


I also read about the google certification that while good, it still isn't as widely known as the above, and it's better to skip and go for say A+ &amp; N+ than spend time doing it. 

What do you guys think, am I on the right path here?"

I am going to graduate at the end of this year with a CS degree from a top-5 university for computer science with a GPA just a smidge under 4.0. For the past two years, I've had experience doing full stack dev as a student worker for my university (though I'm not really looking for a full stack position, but it is relevant experience, I think).

Given all that, what kind of a salary should I expect to have working as a SWE at a Chicago company for my first job out of college?

Professor Messer(Videos and practice tests) &amp; GCGA since the beginning and then ran through random practice test dumps I found online. Sometimes I would go over some random ass quizlets just to brush through vocab when i didn't feel like reading. 

Honestly, it was as hard as everyone says...but not impossible. During the exam you'll feel like you're not doing well and you're not gonna pass, but just trust in your knowledge. Thats the best thing you can do with this exam, trust in the hours you put in and the reading you have done. First post on this sub for me, but just reading posts like this kinda helped me out and motivated me so I wanted to pay it forward. 

The questions are not impossible, they just require a extra care in the verbage used. Which makes sense because the job you would use this cert is in. To anyone taking the exam soon, you got this and I believe in you. It is not that bad, just trust in your knowledge.

Much love

I'm a rising sophomore computer engineering major and currently looking for a digital design, computer architecture, or software internship next summer. I just finished most my general ed courses, an intro digital logic course, and intro signal processing course. 

A hardware internship is more beneficial for my career because my career goal is to work on microprocessors and integrated circuits. However, I'm not qualified in hardware roles right now. A lot of semi-conductor companies require or prefer inters that are pursuing a graduate degree. It's going to take a while to be even considered for openings as I will take Digital Design Lab this Fall and Computer Architecture in the Spring. 

It's the same with software roles. Most software roles require data structures and algorithms knowledge but I just took an object oriented programming course last Spring and wont take an intro algo course until next Spring. I could try to self teach myself data structures and algorithms myself but I will be busy with coursework, IEEE, and a research program. Plus, I think it's a waste of time since I'll be taking a class on it next semester.

So I'm stuck in a place where I'm currently unqualified but will be somewhat qualified for digital design/computer architecture (I know this is difficult to get into) roles and qualified for software roles by the time I finish Spring 21'. The problem is career fairs are early September this semester and early Feb next semester so it's likely I won't be ready for interviews.

The odds are against me, so I need some guidance on what direction I should take. Should I spend my energy applying to internships although I'll be missing some foundational knowledge? When should I start applying and interviewing? Should I focus my free time more on hardware or software roles? What specific roles should I be searching for, for someone with my background and career interests?

Hey everyone! I’m a senior at a public high school in Central New Jersey. I‘m an Indian female, 17 years of age, interested in pursuing medicine; At the high school that I currently attend, there is a separate, SELECTIVE program for students who are interested in pursuing STEM-related careers, and students who are in it receive more rigorous coursework than regular students as well as have their courses assigned to them based on their strand/field; I am a member of the biomed strand and have been since my sophomore year.

Note: Please refrain from judging because I am trying to do the best I can.

I am an Indian student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Canada. Due to some circumstances and health issues, I performed abysmally in the first three semesters. As a result, I was asked to take a less rigorous courseload and had to drop many CS courses. I am now on a path to pursue a Psychology major with CS minor. Being honest, I do not really like CS or programming. I am very interested in Psychology. 

But as mentioned I am an Indian student in Canada. I want to get a PR and that requires me to be employed in a 'level 0, 1, 2' job (basically white collar) for at least two years. I used to do a lot of front end work in my mom's company back in India before university. I got into an unpaid internship in the Django framework even after a flop show in my first year and was praised for my work.  I can confidently say I am good at it. I also am doing personal projects in Django so I can land in an internship easily given my previous experience. Still, I feel tired of doing CS work. I only see it as an opportunity to earn a bigger paycheck and a stable job. 

 But I like psychology a lot. Especially cognitive neuroscience and neurobiology. But in case I do pursue psychology, I need an advanced degree for a good career. It is cheaper to do an advanced degree as a PR. Also, I am done with my parents funding my education. It is not easy to get a job out of college and impossible to get a job in India with a bachelor's degree in psychology.

Coding seems a lot like a chore. But I can do it well and be in a boss's good books. I just want to learn to like it. If anyone were in a position where they didn't want to lose a stable paycheck and learned to like programming, how did you do it? I am willing to put all effort to get a job in a good company, but I still feel like someone is forcing me. I am doing it on my own will, and I want to learn to like CS.

One thing I want to state clearly is that I do everything required sincerely. It is not just I want some 9 to 5 job which pays me well only. I will care about the work. But if I am choosing it as a career I would rather learn to like it as well. And I take my responsibilities seriously. 

Thank you!"

Hello! I have known ever since middle school that I wanted to move to another country. Not because of any particular distaste for the US, but just because I really want to experience life in another country long term and grow to learn about and appreciate another culture. Originally I was very interested in East Asia (And learned Japanese and Korean decently well), but have over time started looking at Australia and New Zealand as more serious contenders since I can enjoy the comforts of having a shared language, Western style of democracy, and have developed interest in the cultures and lifestyles of the two countries themselves.  


I would be looking to migrate as soon as possible after graduating (at least as much as COVID allows) but would like to know the feasibility of migrating to Australia or New Zealand given my qualifications and if one may potentially be better or easier to migrate to than the other. I have around 8k USD in savings at the moment prepared for a move. I am not extremely picky on location (so long as I am not planted in the middle of the outback) nor am I extremely picky on pay (at least at first). I would expect to look to find jobs that pay better or in more ideal locations after establishing myself in the country itself.  


**My Qualifications**  


I am a senior in college studying IT Infrastructure and who will graduate next year with a basic knowledge of Computer Hardware, Networking, Databases, Cybersecurity, and Project Management. I don't feel extremely confident in any one of these specifically but am open to focusing more on one or two of them within the next year based upon what may open up more job opportunities. I am worst with programming. I will at least have A+ certification before I graduate but further certifications are uncertain (As I don't know what field I want to focus yet). I am looking to get internships and more work experience within the next year but that is also uncertain given the current COVID environment.  


Currently all my work experience mostly revolves around customer service, product management, and language learning. I run a website that offers free language learning courses on the side that I run as a hobby. If I could work with language in an IT setting that would be my dream, but it is a very niche field and by no means required or expected.  


**Questions**  


How easy will it be for a fresh out of college low work experience IT Infrastructure major from America to get a job in Australia or New Zealand in 2021? Will one of these countries be easier to get into than the other? Is there any specific fields I should be targeting strongly for either of these countries?  


Both of these countries have a working holiday program, and both of them have skilled worker visa's. Would I qualify for the skilled worker visa after I get my degree? Would it be better to come on a working holiday visa first? Or would I need to drastically raise my qualifications overall before migrating? (Unideal but if its necessary than it is what it is).  


I also know that Australia requires a hefty fee (somewhere along the lines of 3k USD) for a work visa and around 500 for a working holiday visa, does New Zealand have any similar fees I should be aware of? Is my savings enough to be able to survive a while alongside these fees while also finding a place to stay? (Savings are 8k). What is a good amount to have before going?  


I have heard New Zealand was easier to get into than Australia from numerous people and places online, but I have also seen people on the New Zealand subreddit say that it is easier for foreigners (Americans especially) to migrate to Australia. Which is actually easier overall?  


Lastly while I am more interested in the cooler weather and temperate landscape of New Zealand, there is many beautiful places in Australia I could see myself being happy to live in as well. Being somewhat undecided, what sales pitch can those familiar with both countries make for one or the other?  


**TL;DR**: 21M American IT Infrastructure Major with low work experience, Future A+ Certification, and 8k savings considering Australia or New Zealand. I need a feasibility analysis as to getting a job in 2021 in either country, which will be easier, and what I need to do to boost my chances from my current starting point."

ia0r3f,55,2020-08-14,I’m so tired of my mental illnesses. I just can’t get better.,radiyon,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ia0r3f/im_so_tired_of_my_mental_illnesses_i_just_cant/,"
I’m so tired of being mentally ill. I don’t even like saying that because honestly I don’t even feel like it’s mental illness it always just feels like me not... being right.

I’m SO anxious about this internship and I just absolutely hate the idea of having it honestly?? I’ve already applied and I feel like I’m just... terrified???? I’m so worried that I’m not going to be able to perform well and that I’m just going to make mistakes. I hate having so much pressure hanging over my head and having responsibilities like this because it’s literally just a CONSTANT stressor.

I can’t get my sleep schedule together and barely have enough energy to get through the day as it is. Honestly I feel like just being alive is all I can handle and even that feels like too much sometimes. Keeping up with eating and sleeping and dealing with not feeling well ON TOP of everything else is just.... too much for me.

I’m on such an awful sleep schedule right now and keep napping during the day and it causes me to get literally nothing done. Which adds stress because the things I NEED to get done get pushed to the last second. And honestly everything else is so unfulfilling... nothing feels like it gets me excited to get out of bed. I’m rarely even really “wanting” to do something and if I ever do it’s usually more videos games or something unproductive like that.

I really thought I was going to have time to figure things out but I just don’t. Corona took that away from me. I thought I’d get out of school and then do everything I could to figure out why I constantly feel so unhappy and unfulfilled and incapable of everything — even tho my life honestly isn’t that bad. Like I shouldn’t feel this distressed and unhappy, but I just keep feeling this way. It’s been so discouraging because I’ve seen psychiatrists, a therapist, I’ve got diagnosed, and done everything you’re supposed to do! I ended up in the hospital freshman year for mental illness and I just feel like I’ve never gotten a break... I just pushed through farther by finding a major I could “manage” through. Not one I’d actually enjoy :/

I finally even got some downtime in between school and this internship it still wasn’t enough. I still just keep feeling so bad and making the people around me upset and just no one seems to understand or be able to help me in how desperately bad I want to change how I feel.
I already feel so behind and like I failure. I just don’t feel like I can keep up and I just feel stupid and incapable. 

I don’t ever want to do anything. I just sit in bed and scroll on my phone and smoke. I’ve tried not doing that, I don’t personally feel addicted or anything it’s just nothing else really seems to be fulfilling and everything else is so overwhelming. Everything just all feels irritating and difficult and I just don’t seem to like - get it?? I don’t get how to do things right and I’m at the point where I just kinda feel hopeless and not good enough and like I’m just constantly fighting my own brain to get it to work. Even the meds don’t help enough and have kinda just been making me sick. I can’t go anywhere or do anything because of corona and it’s literally not any different from my life prior to corona besides having school to do. Like I don’t do shit and don’t wanna do shit and just never feel good despite the fact I feel like I have so much I should be happy for. Like yeah I’d like to travel more n shit and there’s def stuff I feel like I want??? But even picturing myself doing that stuff is kinda scary... because I know how I’m gonna feel... my brain just doesn’t work and I have some expectation of how things should be based on comparing myself to others and how they seem to feel and live such fulfilling lives.

Tbh I’m just feeling... made wrong. And... I’m gonna keep doing what I’m doing. Killing myself isn’t an option. I just keep moving forward and dealing with it despite how I feel and how much I fail and make others unhappy. I just keep tying people to myself for them to realize I’m not a very good person to be around. People seem to count on me and believe in me, even if I don’t believe in myself. I just wish I felt happy and normal and like life isn’t so stressful and impossible. I don’t even know what I’m searching for to feel or what. I just know I feel like I’m doing every single little tiny thing wrong and feel guilty for literally everything. I’m scared for what’s next honestly. I think I can at least get through this internship, but idk I don’t feel like I’m fit for society or to be able to function in the real world. Even if I was out of it and in my maladaptive daydream Montana meadows taking care of cows and chickens and vibing in a little ranch house with enough money to not be stressed and being away from society.... I don’t know... even if I was there.. would I be able to be happy? Or would I feel just as guilty and unfulfilled as I do now? 

I feel like I’m being a perfectionist in my own life and being in the process of it is so uncomfortable feeling so wrong and out of place. I don’t even know what I can do. I have to get a job and the only thing I have is design. I don’t really have any other experience or skills. I just feel kinda trapped in my own brain and in my own situation. Like I just moved to a new apartment with a nice view, I have a bf, and cool cats and shit. Like I should be happy?? I should feel lucky and more grateful?? And I am grateful! But I just can’t seem to make myself enjoy... life itself. 

I honestly feel kinda hopeless about getting better. Bad things are coming. The US is burning and my parents are out working in a pandemic and I’m just sitting here draining financially while my brain is just trying to kill me and ruin things. And the saddest part is that that’s still me :( I’m still the one feeling this way and making these decisions. This is me. This is how I’m living my life. I want to feel differently, but I just... can’t."

ia25mk,30,2020-08-15,A Biologist's Guide to the Silent Woods,silent_woods_ranger,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ia25mk/a_biologists_guide_to_the_silent_woods/," 

So, I want to preface this by saying I'm not a biologist. Not yet anyway. I'm in my third year of college, a biology major...And an aspiring park ranger. But as time goes on, my resolve has started to waver. I intern at one of the national parks, I won't say which one, I don't want to get into trouble. But I will tell you it's on the west coast, up north. I shouldn't be talking about this...But this should be safe as long as I remain anonymous. I'm here to share my stories of what I call ""The Silent Woods"" and the things that live there. I don't want to scare you, that's why I chose to post here. But I feel like it's my duty to make the people aware of what lives in the silence.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I ever noticed about the Silent Woods was the paths. You know, typical park paths, the farther they go the more...Worn they become. You go from the safe hard asphalt, rolled over by strollers, bicycles, and the occasional park sanctioned vehicle, to the smaller, softer dirt paths. Filled with rocks and pitfalls and tangles of roots crisscrossing under your boots. It's like an adventure almost, and yet there's always the quiet safety of knowing where you are. Of knowing that you can find your way back with ease. Not in the Silent Woods. You don't want to walk alone in that part of the park, because the paths don't abide by the same rules that they should. They stretch on and on, and as you walk everything starts to look the same. The first time this happened I'll admit I didn't notice. I was doing a routine sweep, just a typical task for interns like myself and this was back when I was new. I didn't know any better. I just kept walking, determined to get to my check point, loop back around, and make it back for lunch. But the path just stretched on and on. The woods all kind of look the same, and I tend to space out when I'm walking anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

But eventually something just...Felt off. I stopped finally, and managed to take a look around. It felt like breaking out of a very heavy sleep, the kind where your dreams just keep threatening to pull you back down. I rubbed my eyes and realized, I had absolutely no clue where I was. The path appeared to be the same, but there were no other signs of...Well...Civilization. It just appeared like I'd wandered into the deep woods, if it wasn't for the path under my feet I could have been anywhere. I felt a sort of bubble of panic in my throat and chest. You know when you want to cry but you can't because you have to save face? Like that. My head swivels around a little bit, and I got my bearings. This wasn't so bad. I would just hike back and bring a map next time. But a part of me knew this wasn't right. This wasn't the same park I had been hiking in before, even if I was blocking it out mentally, deep down I knew it. I started back up the path, my hand on my hip where I kept my hunting knife. Realistically speaking it wouldn't have done anything, but it made me feel a little bit more in control of the situation. As I walked I kept a close eye on the trees, and my surroundings, getting that crawly feeling that something was watching me intensely from just out of sight. Yet it still took me several minutes to realize, I had passed the same small outcropping of rock several times. I was going in circles. When it did finally hit me I felt panicked tears well up. I'm not an emotional man, or a small one for that matter, but the feeling of helplessness that overwhelmed me then was (at the time) the worst thing I'd ever felt.

&amp;#x200B;

I could feel that presence growing heavier all around me, like it wanted me to slow down, stay stopped as I was and even collapse to the ground. But I knew I couldn't, and not knowing what else to do I bolted in the same direction I had been going, the way that was supposed to lead me back to the visitors center. I didn't think it would do any good, but I didn't know what else to do. Eventually the scenery began to look familiar again and the presence behind me faded. I slowed, and caught my breath. I still hurried back, but strangely the terror from before slipped off of me easily. I made it back in time for lunch. Even though it felt like I should have been hours overdue. I didn't mention what had happened, in fact it was already a fading memory. Something I had written off as paranoia and dehydration. That is until one of the senior rangers took me aside. He didn't look angry, but there was a mild concern to his stance. He seemed edgy, like he wanted to say something but shouldn't. What he said still sticks with me today ""You be careful out there on those trails son. Keep your wits about you. You're a smart boy, but those trails are smarter."" And with that he walked off. I know now that this is unspoken knowledge, everyone knows but is too afraid to risk sounding crazy. The paths in the Silent Woods like to change.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a number of missing persons cases in the park. Some are solved, some aren't. It's a big piece of land, and the area I've deemed the Silent Woods is a large portion of it. Interns aren't really supposed to be involved with the legal stuff of course. But I can help with volunteer searches for those that go missing, and I've seen my fair share of strange and unexplained deaths and disappearances. I don't really like to talk about it too much, but they often seem to happen near the lake at the center of the Silent Woods. They're written off as drownings mostly, or exposure. Or they don't find a body at all, and the dogs find no scent...More than the majority tend to be children and that doesn't seem to help me debunk the drowning theory. But I know if there's anything in this damn place I can trust it's myself, and I know that the subtle sound of the waves on the bank don't sound right. A little like warped twisted voices, soft, melodic, but unintelligible. We all know there's something wrong about it. They've often told us not to mention to the media that the bodies they do find, typically were children lost miles and miles from the lake. We can't explain how they got there, and we don't need an investigation. Something tells me the woods wouldn't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

The campsites near the Silent Woods are the worst, and I tend not to recommend them to any of our visitors. There are a lot of strange sounds at night, most can be written off as animals. The scream of a bobcat, further off in the mountains. A lone grizzly making it's way past the campsite. These are normal things. And yet here and there you wonder if a scream is all too real, or if those crunching footsteps are just a bit too heavy an much too close. It's better to stay hidden in your sleep sack, and it's best not to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I want to discuss tonight, is the presence of Them. Everyone knows about Them, we just don't talk about Them. The rangers who have been here the longest tell us not to. Stating they aren't a ghost story for the fire, or a tale to amaze our friends. They, whomever and whatever They are, are dangerous. I've not had too many encounters with Them, not personal ones at least. But I do see them, every so often just lingering in the woods. On outcroppings of rock. In the distance across a wide open field, staring straight at me. Sometimes in the trees, catching me off guard with how horribly close they are as the leer down at me. Faces twisting in viscous mockery of delight and glee as they giggle, the laugh of a human child, before dancing away and as I blink they disappear. They're human like, as I've said, and they're beautiful. But in an unnatural way, an unsettling form of perfection. Uncanny valley at it's finest, when you see them you know they're wrong somehow but you can't place it. Especially not from far away, as they tend to appear.

&amp;#x200B;

What I do know is that their skin tones vary across the human color spectrum, normal pigmentation. Though some tend to be much paler or darker than a human could be. Their ears are slightly pointed, not rounded, and they are usually tall and lithe. But not in a healthy way, more in a way that resembles a willow tree, twisted, thin, breakable yet durable against the wind. Their hair varies, sometimes I almost believe it's real, like human hair...And then others I think not so much. But they all share two characteristics. The eyes are devoid of sclera and pupil, all they seem to have is an iris. Usually it's black, reflecting little light back out, but I have seen other variations. Secondly they have sharp pointed teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my knowledge is collected from other interns and rangers, as I've had very few personal encounters with them. They aren't common, I will see one, maybe every three hikes or so. Most of them are far off in the distance, they watch with large black eyes for merely a moment, and then they're gone again. It leaves me wondering if they were ever there at all. They give off a presence of power and danger, it both roots your feet to the ground and makes you want to run as fast as you can. When I finally got the courage to ask my trainer about Them she simply frowned and shook her head. ""Best not to talk about them. But if one of them tries to speak with you, don't do it. And don't take anything from them. Don't even pick up something they've dropped. Do that and you should be safe."" When I tried to ask her why she just smiled sadly ""That's a story for another time."" That was back in my first year, and by now I have the story, as well as many of my own. But I'm not supposed to say, I know I'm not without them even telling me. The higher ups always seem to know...And they want to keep everything quiet, they say it's for everyone's safety.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess I could say more, if anyone wanted. I'm not going to risk my internship, and my future job over something no one believes or cares about. But I have a lot more I'd like to get off my chest if you're willing to listen. If you have any theories or similar experiences I'd love to hear them, but if you recognize these stories, if you know of the park I'm speaking of, stay away. For my sake and yours."

ia32m2,156,2020-08-15,After 4 months of Leetcode and studying React I finally got a job in a very good company,meemboy,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/ia32m2/after_4_months_of_leetcode_and_studying_react_i/,"So I’ve been working at a startup for almost 3 years (2 years full time and 6 months internship ) and I’ve been very frustrated. Small company with a lot of pressure on my end. During the lockdown the pressure and work load on me increased a lot and I decided to switch. Applied at a lot of companies and either got rejected or got ghosted. Applied everywhere. From LinkedIn to angel.co

Finally landed a interview at a decent product based company. They had multiple rounds. Total was around 7 rounds. They had asked a medium leetcode question and I wasn’t able to solve it properly. I was able to run it for most of the test cases but I was still failing for some. Next day I got a call saying that I did pass that round. I checked the solution later and it was using Dynamic Programming which I wasn’t aware of at that time. This was in April. I cleared all the  other rounds and even successfully negotiated my compensation. I was told that I’d be sent my offer letter in weeks time. After a week I got an email saying that I was rejected.

I felt betrayed and felt very low for a week. When I contacted them asking for a reason they said that they do not have resources to manage resources like me.  After consulting my family and friends they said fuck that company and that I’ll find a better opportunity.

During that time my mom had forwarded a WhatsApp document which had a list of Indian companies hiring during Covid. I had applied at around the first 200 companies in that list. I did not care about the position/ role/ experience level. Just kept on applying.

Then I read that if I had wanted to be placed at good product based companies I had to solve leetcode style questions.

From April onwards I started solving leetcode, improved my data structures and also started working on a personal React project. I did so with the aim of applying react concepts that I hadn’t used during my current companies projects. Also my CSS sucked so I started working on it. Learned Redux and now I’ve mastered it.

My current company’s timings were 9:30 to 6:30. From 8 pm to 2 am I would be studying and practising leetcode and React.

Then last month 3 decent product based companies responded saying that I was eligible for an interview.

Started preparing for all 3 of them. One of the company’s role that I applied for required 5+ years of experience and was a Senior React position but they still gave me a chance. Let’s call this company B. Company A had a very easy interview process. Wasn’t very challenging. Company A’s interview process got over before B and C. Negotiated my salary with Company A and I also let them know that I was in advanced stages of the interview process at 2 other companies.

Company A just gave me 25% hike on my current salary which was very low and my current salary is quite low. I negotiated further I got it to 33 %. Which was still 10 % lower than I was was expecting. Company A said that they really liked me and they wanted me to join them. The HR wanted me to sign the offer in an hour and I told them I needed time to think about it. But he kept on forcing me. Somehow I bought some time.

I then called up company B’s HR and told them that I have already gotten an offer from Company A but I am more keen on joining B. Company B had a difficult interview process, with medium leetcode and some other tricky questions. They also had me solve Leetcode questions in Java. Since company B had difficult rounds, I knew that an offer from them would be quite rewarding not in terms of money but in terms of growth. The interviewers in B were quite knowledgeable. So I got the HR to prepone ally interviews so that they could conclude faster.

Finally cleared all the rounds at B. Company B only asked for my current compensation initially during applying. They never asked for my expected compensation which I found to be weird. Even during the compensation discussion they never asked for it. Then when they told me about my compensation I almost fainted. They gave me a fucking 200% hike, which is like 3x my current compensation.

I could not fucking believe it and I am so fucking happy about it!! My hard work really paid off.

The reason I am writing it was so that I can motivate other people and give them hope. Hard is a must if you want your dream job!!!

Happy to answer any questions you guys have!

Edit: one more thing they told me about the compensation was that, they do not believe in compensating an employee based on their previous salary. They feel that if an employee is capable and can get through their interviews they will always compensate based on the their talent and merit no matter their experience

Edit: So I have been given a role of SDE 2 and not Senior React Engineer based on performance during the interviews.

Resources that helped me a lot:

For React:

1. Modern React with Redux \[2020 update\] - Udemy
2. The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp course \[2020 Update\] - Udemy
3. Advanced React and Redux - Udemy
4. Traversy Media on Youtube
5. Tecsith on Youtube.

For DSA and logic building:

1. The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures - Udemy
2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass - Udemy
3. Nick White and Back to SWE, Akshay Saini on Youtube.

Additional Tips:

When I started with Leetcode I sucked a lot. So whenever, I got stuck I would watch Nick White's video but I would not watch the complete solution. If I got a hint on how to go about the solution I would pause the video and come up with a solution. If not, then I would finish the complete video.

For questions where I was able to solve it on my own, I would go to the discuss section and check what others have written. Believe me, I learned so much from other peoples code.

Once you are into solving these kind of questions, you will start seeing some common patterns. After a while I got pretty good and I would start posting on solution on the discuss section of leetcode. Sometimes people would praise my solution and sometimes they would correct me. Either way, it boosted my self-esteem.

Also during the interviews, do not just jump into the solving it. Ask the interviewer about the constraints, any parameters. Once you have that cleared, talk about the approaches that you would use to arrive with a solution. This way, the interviewer knows that you are a calculative person who thinks about the future rather than someone who jumps to a conclusion without thinking about the repercussions. Everyone makes mistakes and they know about it.

Also keep the conversations 2 way. Dont just keep on talking about yourself. Every interviewer knows that you are going to boast about yourself and showcase the best version about yourself during the interviews.

I asked them about their passions, hobbies etc. I love watching movies , so I asked them about what their favourite movie was. Then had a conversation regarding the current Covid situation etc.After every interview I would thank them and let them know that I learned something from them.

Personal project that I have been working on: [https://flicks-watch.herokuapp.com/](https://flicks-watch.herokuapp.com/). Its not completed yet. Had kept it on hold as I wanted to concentrate more on DSA

[https://www.amazon.in/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/dp/0984782869/ref=pd\_lpo\_14\_img\_0/259-4936181-5387020?\_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd\_rd\_i=0984782869&amp;pd\_rd\_r=14c738d6-73c3-4187-bbdf-bc97042b98e2&amp;pd\_rd\_w=DeZ00&amp;pd\_rd\_wg=UlBgj&amp;pf\_rd\_p=5a903e39-3cff-40f0-9a69-33552e242181&amp;pf\_rd\_r=5PFVG5GQQTAQCPVV2BDZ&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=5PFVG5GQQTAQCPVV2BDZ](https://www.amazon.in/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview/dp/0984782869/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_0/259-4936181-5387020?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0984782869&amp;pd_rd_r=14c738d6-73c3-4187-bbdf-bc97042b98e2&amp;pd_rd_w=DeZ00&amp;pd_rd_wg=UlBgj&amp;pf_rd_p=5a903e39-3cff-40f0-9a69-33552e242181&amp;pf_rd_r=5PFVG5GQQTAQCPVV2BDZ&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=5PFVG5GQQTAQCPVV2BDZ)

This is a very good book apparently. But this was delivered to me only after I got the offer.

If anyone wants to add me on LinkedIn , you can dm me about it.

**Edit:** The point of the post wasn't that I got a huge hike, but it was to let everyone know that If I could do it(BCA + MSc. Not an Engineer), so can you all.

Hard work does pay off. When that company rejected me after they said I got the job, I thought that was the end for me, that I suck. But after some motivation I was able to get good job. I never asked for such a huge hike from company B and my main motivation was to switch from my current company which I was able to.The hike was just one of the perks I got along with the offer.

Second point I wanted make was that people should be mostly be applying at product based companies rather than service based and especially avoid Mass recruiting companies. Mass recruiting companies really treat their employees as some commodity that can be used and then thrown. One thing I've realised after being on this sub and talking with my colleagues/friends is that many of them aren't happy and a majority of their unhappiness comes from their professional life. So, I think its important to be happy in your workplace. Not that I'm bitching about service based/ mass recruiting companies, I will always appreciate people who create jobs for others, but if you have a chance at a better opportunity, please do go ahead with it. Keep these mass recruiters as your last options. I always thought that since I am underpaid at my current company, that was my value and that I wasn't good enough for product based companies.

So I hope that people who have underestimated themselves like me take away something positive from this post and that there are good companies who will appreciate you.

Some damn good motivation:

**Please watch this video. Really inspired me and I know it will inspire everyone.**

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u\_ktRTWMX3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ktRTWMX3M)

Edit:

**A lot of people have been asking for my compensation which makes me think that people are only thinking about the money aspect. Please dont do that. Dont apply for jobs just for the money. Apply because you would want to work there. If there is a good company and if they like the candidate, the company would do anything to onboard that candidate.**

But during the interview test I felt like the company doesn’t know what they actually want?

The test comprised of 3 questions, question 1 was really easy so I won’t talk about it. But the second question was asking to write a python script to detect outliers in the dataset and remove them, outliers should not be worked on categorical values just continuous values. 
And then they gave a very specific example stating “suppose it’s an employee table and you need to find out the outliers, you encounter $1M as a salary for an employee but that employee is the CEO so we don’t remove it but if the employee is a middle level manager we must remove or rectify that error” so emailed them saying that hey this is a very specific example and you want a script to run with every kind of dataset which according to me is not possible there cannot be a one script fits for all. Maybe it’s my lack of experience but I believe that you cannot write a script that can detect categorical values accurately without any description of the dataset and remove really specific outlier 
I gave them my solution as this 
Remove all columns with dtype=Object And dtype=category 
And then find all rows that may have an outlier with IQR (since I couldn’t use Kmeans as they mentioned not to use distance based algorithms) 
I never got a call back and idk if they appointed anyone but what are your thoughts?"

ia8k99,9,2020-08-15,Stuck in casual retail forever?,inc_mplete1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ia8k99/stuck_in_casual_retail_forever/,"Hi everyone,

I'm in my mid-late twenties and have worked in retail as a part-timer/casual for nearly a decade. My retail jobs have been at large respectable companies, and a very large phone/tech company. I have worked at these companies for several years', not jumping around and have strong tenure. I have a Business/ Marketing degree and have also created and led creative projects of my own with transferrable skills for the jobs I am looking for. I did hop around a few degrees, but managed to finish one degree doing it part-time. In my education section of my resume, I have only listed my completed degree for simplicity sake, and have not included my age to avoid confusion and age-bias.

My issue is, as much as I am aware of the fierce competition in the job market at the moment, I am wondering if my rejections could be to do with my casual/ part-time experience in retail. I have been told to highlight my tenure, skills, and experience from volunteering at University where I was heavily involved in societies, my creative projects, roles in retail, social media, and a short Government internship, but unfortunately I don't seem to be getting anywhere. I unfortunately was unable to obtain long internships despite applying for several for 1-2 years.

Has anyone worked in retail casually/ part-time for a significant time transitioned to a full-time job in marketing, social media management, project management etc. or anything similar? If so, I'd be interested to hear if there were issues in transitioning when interviewing, and the best way to get out of retail. I fear that I will be stuck in retail forever, and my current retail company has continually rejected my applications for progression despite being told I fit the criteria, have no issues, and am regarded because of my work and tenure. I was rejected even from a volunteer role within the company and most reasonings are really, really vague.

Thank you!"

I just began my first SWE internship 2 weeks ago. My previous programming experience has been simple school projects, and some web application stuff on my own.

I am now in this internship in which we are using C#, SQL, and .NET framework. Our code base is hundreds of files, thousands of lines of code. My mentor has been working on getting me up to speed. So far he has had me create a few simple tables in SQL Server, and then applying some framework templates and changing the values to match the data and entities on the SQL tables I made. 

I am maybe understanding like 20% of what I am doing. I feel like I don't fully understand how our project flows, what we are doing, and why we are doing it.

I am maybe understanding like 20% of what I am doing. I feel like I don't fully understand how our project flows, what we are doing, and why we are doing it. I have been stressed out about completing these tasks, so I rush into them without fully understanding the code I am writing, which then leads to obvious mistakes. I am just trying to complete my tasks so that I am productive and they don't feel like I am a hindrance. My mentor has been very patient and understanding with me thus far.

Is this normal for a first internship / entry level experience? Am I beating myself up?"
iafaxp,2,2020-08-15,Competitive for Fed Agency jobs after Graduation?,iamzerothree,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iafaxp/competitive_for_fed_agency_jobs_after_graduation/,"Hey guys, I'm a CS sophomore and I've been going over what kinds of first jobs I want after college. Being a software engineer isn't really interesting to me, nor is being an app dev or other common titles I hear CS students like me talk about, but I am interested in working for a fed agency like NSA,FBI,CIA,DEA either as an analyst, or something software related under the name of those agencies.

It might be a long shot to try and get a job at one of those places right out of college but I'd appreciate if I can get pointers for how to be competitive coming out of college. I'm going to try to land an internship at one of those places after this year (if coronavirus isn't still ramping) which will probably be the biggest thing I can do.

Other than that though, thoughts? P.S I've heard this sub doesn't like people who want to go public sector, but don't kill me, I'm just trying to keep my options open here"

iafzj2,2,2020-08-15,"[Profile Review:] 2+2 for cyber security, looking for target schools!",ThrowawayL33tMBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/iafzj2/profile_review_22_for_cyber_security_looking_for/,"**MBA Info**

· Why I want an MBA: I want to become a CISO (chief information security officer), CIO, or CTO 10-20 years down the line, leveraging my technical strengths and interpersonal skills to maximize my career potential. These roles typically require an MBA or MIS. 

· Why I want one now: I am a rising senior and I want to have a solid roadmap established before I graduate. My goal is to use the MBA to pivot to cyber security consulting or management after 2-3 years on the ground. I am afraid of being pigeonholed into a purely technical role. 

· Target schools: **Taking recommendations!** Thinking T15, but the financial aspect is intimidating. 

I would be financing most of the degree with debt, with a possible $35K total in family support. Darden is my only good in-state option, which would reduce the annual cost a whopping $3K per year. I have no debt from undergrad thanks to merit scholarships &amp; said family support, but I have only \~$10K to my name in savings and investments, much of which will be used for moving expenses, security deposits, and vehicle down payments next spring. 

**Background**

· Work experience: Cyber security internship at midcap F500 (awaiting full-time return offer), 2 cyber security internships at microcap

· Extra curriculars and other experience: I am a member of the poker club, and I work with my religious group’s campus community service organization (both pre-COVID, lol). 

· Undergrad school/major: T20 for computer science in Big Ten (Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maryland, Purdue)

· Other education/coursework: Cyber security honors college, business analytics minor, upper level concentration in general business, graduating a year early (not sure if this is relevant, but a 6-semester transcript is weird)

· Race/nationality: W (oof)/US citizen

· Sex: M (double oof)

**Stats**

· GMAT (Official practice exam, first try): 750 (45V/48Q/8IR)

· ACT (since some schools accept this during the pandemic): 36 (36E/36S/35M/35R)

· Undergrad GPA (so far): 3.91

My comments: As I mentioned in the post, I am graduating early, and I am targeting 2+2 MBAs to pivot from a technical cyber security role into a managerial role as fast as possible. A common grievance in the cyber security community is the perceived disconnect between front line workers and the business-minded leadership, and I want to use my skill set to help bridge that gap. Time is my greatest asset here – I will graduate this spring within a month of my 20th birthday, and I would finish the MBA around my 24th. My biggest detriments, just like in my undergrad applications, are my weak ECs and my demographics. Also, there is likely room for improvement on the real GMAT, especially on the quantitative side, as I took the practice cold."

Hey everyone! I’m a senior at a public high school in Central New Jersey. I‘m an Indian female, 17 years of age, interested in pursuing medicine; At the high school that I currently attend, there is a separate, SELECTIVE program for students who are interested in pursuing STEM-related careers, and students who are in it receive more rigorous coursework than regular students as well as have their courses assigned to them based on their strand/field; I am a member of the biomed strand and have been since my sophomore year.

Here’s the schools I have on my list thus far: 
- Johns Hopkins University (definitely applying ED, my ULTIMATE DREAM school) 
- Cornell University  
- Northwestern University
- Rutgers University (going for BS/MD program)
- University of California Los Angeles
- University of Berkeley 
- University of Southern California 
- University of Pittsburgh (going for BS/MD program) 
- Boston University (going for BS/MD program) 
- Stony Brook University (going for BS/MD program) 
- University of Virginia
- University of Maryland 

Yes, I get that a lot of these are reach/far reach schools. I was wondering, if I want to get into one of the higher uni’s should I select something like social sciences as my major to increase chances of being selected and then switch over to pre-med once I’m in? Considering my relatively lower stats junior year, I mean. Is that a thing? Also writing is something that comes naturally to me, it’s the subject that I’ve always been most proficient in, so I’m hoping my essays will come in handy. I am open to ANY and ALL recommendations/suggestions! Thank you all!"

I did an internship last summer for a small company called NETGEAR Solutions, it's an IT company owned by an Indian guy.

So I worked for him for two pay periods, the first one I got paid to the tune of a few hundred bucks, but he never paid me for the second one, as it ended right when I was going to leave for college. It's been almost exactly a year, and he still owes me about $400.

The problem is, I never signed a legal contract stating that I would be his employee and such, but I do have a ton of communication between us as well as a timesheet that dates back to last year, so it's clear that I was working for him.

Even though I didn't sign a contract, can I still go to small claims court? Will I be able to get my $400 back in full, and will there be any penalties he can pay, since I've waited an entire year already?

I've called/texted/emailed him multiple times, he has said he will pay multiple times, nothing."

I decided to take a year out to do a year long internship which thankfully given the circumstances I managed to get. I don't want to sound ungrateful because I'm really happy that I have this job and the salary is decent and probably a little over average for an normal cs intern but I know that atleast some of the other interns are getting paid a few grand more than me. Not all of them are in the same department as me, granted. But atleast one is on the same team and same projects which I am on. From looking around it seems to be based on year of university. So far they have all completed 3 years and are going back to do a fourth year whereas as I mentioned earlier I've only completed 2 years. However some of the interns are American and there third year is equivalent to my second year. Basically I guess I just feel a little bit upset that other people who do the exact same job for the exact same amount of time with the exact same qualifications are getting paid more than me. 

Now I was wondering what advice you guys had for me? My current plan was to work really hard for the next 3-4 weeks to show my managers that I'm basically a hard worker and then I was going to bring it up to them and see what they said. Does that sound like a plan? 

I should probably mention that the job doesn't start until next week I've just been talking to and living with other interns and we got round to talking about salary last night at the pub. Hence the 3-4 week time line as my first pay cheque wouldn't be coming in until the 5 week mark."

Web Development

Database Management using SQL

Computer Architecture and Organization

In May, I got into a car accident that resulted in my car being totaled. The other person was at fault and I got a rental car paid for by my insurance. A few days after I got the car my best friend scratched it while backing out of her driveway. It wasn’t anything serious but it was noticeable on a brand new car. I told her and her family that I wouldn’t automatically say anything when I turned it in unless the rental place said anything about it.

A few months later I left the state for an internship so I didn’t drive the car. The rental company asked for me to turn in the car while I was away and I had my mom turn it in since I wasn’t there to. This was the second week of July. My mom said they also charged her a fee. It was around $200, my mom has a hard time understanding english so she didn’t understand what the charge was for and just paid it (she didn’t really have a choice because her card was on file). I believe there was a $50 deposit fee included and probably a loss of use fee. I’m not sure. I didn’t care at the time because I was super busy. Anyway, I told my best friend about it and she reimbursed my mom. 

Anyway, a couple of weeks ago my mom gets a letter sent to her house about the damages to the car and the letter asked for her insurance information and says that a claim has been started. My moms confused because she didn’t even drive the car and the car was in my name. I tell my mom I’ll handle it because she’s confused about why she paid the money in the first place if they’d still try and file a claim against her. Anyway, I call the rental company and ask them what to do since my mom has nothing to do with this and they tell me that it’s no big deal and to just get my friends insurance info. I tell my best friend about it and ask for her policy number and what insurance company she’s with and she asks her dad who gets upset and says he’s not gonna give it to me. 

Fast forward to last night, I was at their house and I ask her and her mom for it and her dad comes out and spends like five minutes persecuting me saying I’m scamming them and he’s not gonna give me the information and that she already paid for it (the $200). I try and explain to them that I’m not sure what that money was for either and that I’ll ask them once I get the information because I’m scared if I call them they’ll make me give someone’s information and since I’m not giving them mine or my moms it’ll seem like i’m being uncooperative and they’ll try and sue us or something. I also try explaining to them that if it was my car I wouldn’t care because it’s just a scratch but it’s not my car so there’re repercussions. He then goes on to say that I’m going to ruin my best friends credit blah blah blah and make their insurance go up. 

It really hurt my feelings because I’ve known them for years and they’re a second family to me. I’m not sure what to do, I feel like none of them are taking this as seriously as they should especially since my moms ass is on the line. 

Should I just pay for the damages and sue them? I’m considering distancing myself from them because I don’t like how this is how they’re being when they have to deal with consequences."

Finally figured out what I want to do with my degree, but have no clue where to start?",Morocco_Bama,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/iauvrn/career_reboot_graduated_with_bsee_over_a_year_ago/,"**TL;DR** I'm interested in designing music tech and equipment (microphones/speakers, MIDI instruments, maybe DAW software, etc). But I just figured that out, graduated over a year ago, and have barely any relevant experience besides ""EE degree"". Stumped about next steps, and would love any advice you can offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I never found my calling while I was attending university. I dabbled in a bunch of different concentrations, from analog, to FPGA, to embedded, to DSP, to ML - and did graduate with a good GPA - but I never committed to any specific field and it *really* shows. 

The most frequent critique I hear about my resume is that it's super broad, and doesn't convey a sense of my interests. Because *I* didn't even have an understanding of my own interests. Whereas if I tried to tailor my resume to a specific job or path, I completely failed to fill out a full page, because I didn't spend enough time or experience in one area. 

Job interviews were always disastrous because I didn't have an answer as to why I applied for the job or wanted to work for the company - I was just trying to get a job because that's what I thought I was supposed to do.

So I stopped applying for a while, hopped around a few personal engineering projects to try and figure out what I enjoy, and I think I'd like to use my degree toward music equipment design. Even then I haven't entirely narrowed that down, as I'd be interested in anything from DAW software development to analog effects pedals. But at least I know the industry I'd like to go into.

The question I don't know the answer to is: now what? I don't have any serious connections to the industry at this time. I currently work a minimum-wage, part-time, front desk job. And it's been so long since I graduated, I'm wondering if anybody would take my seriously.

Some questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Transition jobs?** I'm wondering what would be a sensible role to have if I can't immediately find an EE position - something a bit more relevant than front desk work. For what I want to do my current position feels like a complete dead end. I *really* don't want to go back to retail but have been considering even just getting a sales position at one of the companies of interest would at least be a better starting spot. Alternatively I've looked for technician roles but a lot of what comes up are audio/sound technician, which is not *quite* the same.

**Internships?** I know post-grad internships are... unconventional, to say the least. But I find it hard to believe that this isn't an option for me? (Given the pandemic/time of year, I don't know how many internship postings I'm going to find to begin with)

**Adjacent industries?** I'm aware that a lot of music equipment companies are fairly small, and jobs are probably, comparatively scarce. Are there more general industries that serve as a good starting point?

**Masters?** Because this is a specific field, and especially because I don't feel like I utilized my undergrad education properly, I've been thinking I should go for my Masters in EE. Thoughts? Programs? Would it make more sense to concentrate on DSP, or on analog? Is this something that I don't need a Masters for?

**Communities/Networks/Etc?** I've tried messaging alumni on LinkedIn who work at companies of interest, or managers at these companies, but haven't heard many replies so far. Any other suggestions for reaching out / finding people?

**Anyone with similar experiences?** Don't know if anyone else has gone through this same thing, where they graduated, got themselves stuck in the middle of nowhere, and were able to dig themselves out of it, but if you have, I'd love to hear what that was like for you and how you solved it for yourself?

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all advice is thoroughly appreciated! I really want to turn my life around and get out of the rut I've gotten myself into!"

My background is in journalism and I graduated in 2018. I absolutely loved (still do) what I studied, but out of fear that it was a dying industry, I considered law school. I worked for an attorney for one year and it was miserable. Law is not something I want to pursue, so I've been luckily staying afloat for the past year with side hustles. It's not enough to make a living out of, though, so I will have to move in with two family members soon.

I've been thinking about what career field I want to go into and am still so lost at 24 years old. All of my life I thought I had a plan and worked hard towards it, only to to get to this point where I feel like I have nothing to show for it. I graduated in the top percentile at school and performed well in prestigious and competitive internships, but now I feel so lost and scared for my future. I've considered going into education even before undergrad, so I began applying for schools. I am beyond grateful for every offer I've received so far, especially because of the times we're currently in, but as ridiculous as this may sound, none feel like the right fit.

I recently applied for a 2021-2022 position as a teacher's assistant for middle school. They got back to me and asked if I applied for 2020-2021. I told them I applied for 2021-2022, as the description on their employment page stated. They said they'd like to interview me for 2020-2021, so I said sure (big mistake, I don't want to go into teaching in the middle of a pandemic and my quarter life crisis so I don't know what I was thinking). The next day they offered me the position and asked for my references. This was Friday, so I have to get back to them soon. The position pays $20,000 and it's for one year. Since I'll be moving out of the city to live with my family members, it's going to be a one hour commute there and one hour back home.

The work day is from 7am-4:30pm. This means I'll have to get up at 5am to get ready and leave by 6am. The experience would be (I'm assuming) great as it's a very small private school and both the students and staff are really diverse which I care about. My interview was with the 7 teachers at the school and they were all polite and asked great questions, which I answered honestly and as best as I could. But taking this opportunity is also going to force me to start looking for graduate schools early next year so I can be admitted by fall. This is an incredible amount of pressure when I don't even know what it is I want to do. I have an interest in teaching, but I also learned my lesson with law - I was interested and instead of shadowing or meeting up with people who work in the field to get a better idea of what I was getting in to - I committed to working full time. That seems like a waste of time, which unfortunately in my case, time is a luxury I don't have. I have toxic family I'm trying to distance myself from and it's a necessity I become financially independent. At the same time I don't want to jump into something without being prepared or at least fully committed knowing this is exactly what I want to do. 

I would be willing to sacrifice the low pay and having to work those hours, as I love children and education, but even then I worry beyond that. I'd want to attend a top tier school for my Masters, and even with my Masters, would I be able to find work at another private school? What would my experience be like? Would I be compensated appropriately? Teachers being under appreciated and underpaid is a reality and I would be devastated to be in that position.

I recently applied for a position in journalism and am waiting to hear back. From the description it's exactly what I'd be super excited to do. It's a very competitive role and although I meet their qualifications, I'm worried it may not go through. I won't hear back for probably another week or so but the school needs my response by the 22nd as I would start on the 24th. I have no idea what to do.

I'm considering seeing a career counselor and have reached out to several, but unfortunately it's been so hard to get a hold of one. I'm afraid to take a risk and go into teaching without really considering what it is I want to do or what career would be the right fit. I don't have someone to talk to about this either and it's been a really difficult time in my life knowing I have no one to lean on as I go through this. It's building my resistance, but it's been hard.

Does anyone have any recommendations or words of advice? I'm extremely uncertain as to what next steps I should take."

The hours, stress, amount of extra work needed to keep up a portfolio of projects + keeping up with the current wave of technology + mental drain makes me feel like it's not for me. I wish I had gotten an internship to give it a try before I finish my course but sadly I couldn't find one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am looking at alternate options for work based on what I like and am good at. Which is mostly computer work with numbers/facts/data. I also enjoy project planning, which I often enjoyed creating plans and UML diagrams more than the actual coding. Ideally I would want to do work that has positive social/ecological impact which finance rarely does but not many jobs do

&amp;#x200B;

But after doing many career tests I am getting a lot of tests back giving me things like: accountant/technician, admin assistant, technical architect, insurance analyst, auditor, account manager bookkeeper.

I am a rising senior in the Gies College of Business and I recently took one online class this summer along with the internship I was doing in order to get ahead in my major. Long story short I ended up doing really poorly with managing my time in regards to interning and doing this class and I ended up with an awful grade in the class. I went to check my classes that I was originally signed up for for the Fall semester, only to be greeted with a notification saying my academic status was listed as ""drop.""

This has never happened to me before. Freshman, sophomore and junior year every semester I was listed as  good standing and my GPA was always above a 3.0 (including now after being listed as drop my GPA is still a above a 3.0) I had done really well in the spring semester when we went online midway too and even raised my GPA, so I have never once been close to academic probation or being dropped at all. Additionally, the University has not even told me anything about my academic status being changed to ""drop"" - the only way I even found out that I was dropped was because I logged in to check something for my fall classes and I was not able to view my schedule. Additionally, I am still getting emails from my professors for my fall classes and on Enterprise it still says on my transcript all the fall classes I have registered for.

This whole situation has taken a completely toll on me mentally and emotionally as it is a situation that I never thought I would end up in. I had recently accepted a full time offer with the company and now I am wondering if I will be fired  because of being dropped from the University. Does anyone have any experience with this situation or now what exactly the appeal proccess is? Again the University has not even formally told me that I was dropped so I am just really confused and scared for what is going to happen to me"

I don’t have a lot of people I can ask for help with this, as it’s just me and one other person working on this, but we are working on separate parts. I find the info online super simple and a lot of times I can’t find what I need to convert existing things we have to the other framework. I feel overwhelmed and burnt out from the constant hunt for information that doesn’t seem to exist. I think this is also hard because I’m still very early in my career and a lot of the concepts are new to me. My last co-op term I was coding on an agile team which I enjoyed a lot more and found it was hard but I had more resources.

At some point, I want to pursue a Master's because I feel like I fit within a certain niche in my field.

My ultimate plan right now is I can get a full time job somewhere (whereever that is) and after I work in the company for a few years, pursue a Master's there and have the company pay for it essentially because I heard you can do that. But, I'm sure I would need to take the GRE and I don't like standardized tests (like virtually everybody else). People have told me it's not that much of a big deal compared to like the ACT/SAT scores back in high school, but still...

Recently, my internship for a good company ended and I'm planning on going back (but they're currently not hiring due to COVID and I don't know how long that will last). I am applying to different companies just in case. 

As for grad school, my favorite professor offered me a research opportunity to work with the Department of Defense to work on some really cool projects ONLY if I stay with him through grad school. Now, my school requires a 146 verbal, 157 quantitative, and a 3.5 writing. Not sure on how hard or not hard that is. Like I said, I would rather avoid the GRE altogether but I'll take it if I ABSOLUTELY have to. I tried to register for the GRE to get it over with as soon as possible despite me clearly not being ready because I seriously don't want to study months for the test. 

Also, my brother (who's been through grad school before) recommended me to apply through this program for minorities that has a pretty aggressive deadline. The benefit of this program is that it supposedly gurantees an internship with some pretty big companies. One of these companies is the company I interned earlier that I want to go back to. So, in case if somehow they don't start hiring after that point, that's how I can get in. Wow, this is sounding like some over-elaborate Mission Impossible scheme right now.

Ultimately, I'm building as many options as possible. As soon as I graduate, I want to do something, whether it be work in industry or doing research. I have a plan, but I'm just not sure if it's the right plan. **I want to know what you guys would do in this situation.** **Take the GRE soon and apply for grad school? Or wait, try to get a job, and then do a Master's later?**"
ib17z8,5,2020-08-16,Cancel internship extension?,TroubledEngineer222,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ib17z8/cancel_internship_extension/,"Hi all,

I’m a senior Engineering student interning at a smaller Defense company. Recently I was offered to extend my internship into the Fall and said I could do “About 15 or 16 hours a week”. My manager said “I’m going to put in for your extension, but I’m going to say you are available for 22-25 hours each week”. 

I initially didn’t think much of it, but I actually thought 15 might be too much for me to maintain each week as I am in the National Guard and have an obligation to them to maintain financial support for school. With COVID winding down, I’m going to have more training to make up over the Fall too. I could drop down to part time status (10 credits/4 classes) without delaying my graduation this Fall, but I’ll lose additional financial aid for my fees and books for both the Fall and Spring (even though I plan to go back full time in the Spring). Plus the courses I do have to take this Fall are very demanding.

I wouldn’t mind working at this company after graduation and so far I’m obviously liked since I’ve been offered to extend, but I’m hopeful I can land a job in a better industry and/or at a larger company upon graduation (or pursue a masters).

Sorry that this is long, but I could really use some input from my peers. Thank you very much."

I've been at my current entry-level job for a year and nine months. It's my first full-time, ""professional"" job since I graduated with a BA from a very prestigious public college. It's a position at a very big, well-known company, and it pays decently (for someone with a liberal arts degree). I was very grateful when I first landed the position, because I had been looking for a full-time job in my field for months (I had been doing some part-time internship and temp work in the meantime).

When I first started, my team consisted of me, another coordinator, one supervisor (a few years my senior), and a manager. My supervisor and I were responsible for the same types of tasks, while the other coordinator had a totally different role.

There was a lot of turnover in my position before I started. There had been around 6 coordinators over the past 3 years who had only stayed for 2-11 months. The reason for this became clear when I started.

My manager is highly, highly critical. I'd receive emails in all caps (practically screaming at me) telling me that things I had done were incorrect - even though I thought I had done the task correctly based on how I had been trained. Her language was always highly dramatic: ""Why on EARTH would you think that was the right thing to do?"" ""in what WORLD would that be correct?"" ""I'm BAFFLED that you didn't do x, y, or z,"" or ""what the heck are you talking about??"" (some words would literally be in all caps and there would be multiple question or exclamation marks). Tiny typos, misunderstandings, or just not being able to read her mind was all met with harsh criticism. When I tried to clarify things or figure out what I was doing wrong, I was told ""what do you think?"" ""why are you asking me this?"" or ""the answer is OBVIOUS.""  But, when I tried to take initiative and act based on my knowledge, training, and research, I was often met with ""why didn't you clarify that?"" or ""why didn't you ask first?""

I tried to take this all in stride - I would apologize, take notes, ask questions, and try to improve. I absolutely know that I'm not perfect. I do make mistakes, and I really try not to be defensive. But a lot of the feedback I received was contradictory - it could be applied in one situation, but not another. Or, I would do something correctly, and she'd get mad because she misread something and refuse to apologize when corrected. Multiple times she told me ""you don't know what you're talking about"" (sometimes in front of other people), barely made eye contact with me when she did come into the office, and seemed visibly annoyed by anything I did or said. I received no positive feedback, other than a surprisingly decent 3-month review that lasted for five minutes.

I was constantly confused and kind of miserable, but my supervisor made it bearable enough to stay. He privately told me that I was doing very well, I was the best coordinator he's worked with, and I would soon get used to our manager's temperament. Also, whenever I was really unsure of how to handle something, he was there to provide some advice or direction. He was a big proponent of work-life balance, and when the work piled up, he would offer some guidance on how to prioritize so that we usually wouldn't work for more than 50 hours a week. He'd also established a decent relationship with our manager, so I had some hope that I would soon get to that place too.

So 6 months after I start, my supervisor leaves the company, and an entry-level coordinator (let's call her Sally) is hired in his place. Suddenly, I'm charged with training Sally and reporting directly to my manager instead of my supervisor. Sally and I start to struggle with the workload, and Sally also starts receiving nasty, nasty emails from my manager despite her efforts to understand expectations. I start working longer hours with no overtime just to keep up (I was eligible for overtime, but it was an unspoken rule that we just do the work without asking for it).

Fast forward to COVID, and we're all working from home. Sally (who, as I said, works on the same types of tasks as I do) is laid off, and my hours are cut by 1/4 (with a proportional pay cut). We establish new, shorter hours for me, yet I'm still expected to take on my full workload along with Sally's workload. Also, extra responsibilities are increasingly added to my role due to an effort by leadership to rearrange our department.

My manager starts to micro-manage. She'll ask me to do a task, and if it takes longer than she thinks it should, she screams at me over multiple mediums. When I calmly try to explain why it took as long as it did - I'm often juggling five to ten ""urgent"" tasks at a time, and there is an expectation that everything be perfect - she tells me I'm ""overthinking and belaboring things."" But, when I try to speed up and be less meticulous, I'm criticized for ""not putting thought into things."" All the while I am working over 60 hours a week (double what I'm being paid for), while my (notably male) coworker is working less than me and still being paid for 40 hours. My boss calls me multiple times to tell me that I needed to ""pick up the pace,"" calls me a ""deer in headlights,"" tells me I'm ""not absorbing anything or showing any enthusiasm for the job,"" etc. I try to calmly express that I could use some more help, but I'm just told that I'm ""not being fast enough.""

I'm back to officially working 40 hours, but I feel like I'm at a breaking point. I cry (like SOB) every single day. I can't think clearly, I'm loosing sleep, I feel nauseous all the time, I'm having difficulty concentrating, my confidence is completely shot, and all I think/talk about is work (to the dismay of my friends, family, partner, and therapist). I want to do well so badly, but my anxiety has become so intense that I make mistakes just because I'm paralyzed by fear and it seems impossible to do well.

I spend weekends just trying to catch up on sleep and do chores, and I often work on Sundays just to keep up, so applying for another job feels impossible. I'm considering asking for a few days off, but I'm feeling so beaten down I kind of just want to put in my two weeks with no job lined up. I'm thankful for even having a job, but it just feels so unbearable right now. Just thought I'd post here to get some perspective. Thanks all x"

ib43ip,4,2020-08-16,How to know if you're the right fit or if you should quit?,Sad_Responsibility50,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ib43ip/how_to_know_if_youre_the_right_fit_or_if_you/,"So I'm a recent college grad and I started working as an analyst in June after interning at the same company. I mainly took the job just to be employed because I had a lot of anxiety surrounding not having a job after graduation. I thought ""Well I didn't exactly like the work but if it's only a little more than what I did as an intern it should be fine"" because when I accepted the job my manager kinda gave the impression it would be similar as they gave the interns a lot of work last summer due to under staffing and my manager had mentioned they hired more people. Now that I'm actually working I'm kinda doing a lot more than I thought I would and sometimes feel like I'm drowning a little bit. It doesn't help that communication isn't the best right now since we're all work form home too. 

The company I work for has a review process for reports in place. I hate review, mostly because I feel like I'm faking being qualified enough for this job and they'll see that I'm doing a lot of things wrong (I guess what some could consider similar to impostor syndrome). I have a lot of anxiety each time I send things in for review and I even start to sweat and my heart races erratically when I go to check my email. Most of the time I feel too stupid for this work and I put a lot of pressure on myself because of it. I understand that the review is necessary but I always think in my head that someone better than me could be doing this work with less issues, as a lot of the time when I get stuff back from review there are a lot of changes. 

I know I haven't worked here that long but to me it just doesn't feel right. It's an office environment and I sometimes feel stifled by the formality that this office has. Most everyone is nice but some higher up people I feel look down on me because I am new and don't know as much. It's not like they're necessarily trying to be mean but because they're so smart they seem to forget not everyone knows everything. After getting off of calls or receiving review back I'll sometimes break down and cry because I just feel so stressed and that I'm not cut out for this job.

Another issue I don't necessarily like is that employees are expected to work long days. I get super fatigued following this and dislike working until 8 pm some nights. I kinda knew going in that the days would be longer and thought I could handle it but now it's just making me even more tired. I feel like I don't have time to go out and enjoy my life. My manager and other coworkers have also mentioned that, even when they take time off for vacation, they still are working and that just makes me fear the worst, that I'll become completely absorbed by this job with no free time for myself. 

My mom has said she can tell I'm depressed and worn out and I'm trying to connect with a therapist (right now through Betterhelp but we will see how that goes) to help root out the problem, whether it's just mental illness or I don't fit.

I know that I haven't worked here that long and ""all first jobs suck"" but how do you know when its a good fit or if the job just isn't for you and quit?"

I am pursuing Bachelors in computer applications and it's my last semester ( halted due to COVID-19 ). This programme focuses on programming. Recently I have lost interest in programming and am more passionate in Economics or social sciences ( since childhood ). I have all required knowledge about programming but I have not done any internship or projects except some semester projects. 

I know PHP Laravel HTML CSS stuff but I have not worked in any firm. Some of my friends are working in companies with handsome salary but here I'm stuck with knowledge but no ready to deliver skills. I think with 3 months of internship in any firm, I'll be ready for a junior developer role. 

I am 22 years old and I am feeling pressure to earn money. I have this interest to study Economics or social science as post-graduation. 

What should I do guys? I am occupied by this thought for 2 - 3 months but still not clear and able to decide my career path. 

I have this idea to spent one-year doing internship and getting a programming job ( for money ) and after having a source of income pursue my post-graduation. 

Any suggestions would be very appreciable..."

I hate to start off by giving my life story but it's kinda important: I grew up with a nacissistic/bipolar mother, and was very distant from my father both due to his job (airline pilot) requiring him to be gone for weeks as a time and my mother constantly blaming him while he was gone for any problems the family was having and making up stories about awful things he had done. I never really did anything for most of my childhood. My mother was intent on me being a musician, so I was taking violin and piano classes up through college, but beyond that I didn't really have any hobbies or interests, I just stayed in my room and buried my face in my computer or books, whatever would dissociate me from where I was. I had extreme anxiety during my teenage years, with a constant piercing headache and a brain fog that would occur anytime I was in a social situation (which wasn't often, as my mom homeschooled me up until college). Being trans and my mom being heavily catholic probably didn't help either. I ended up taking chemical engineering in college, both because my insulated ass sat there and went ""Chemical engineering? Like you design chemicals? That's so cool!"" and because I had heard people saying that ChemE was the hardest major you could take, and I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable. I began to become more ""normal"" toward the end of college, but my social anxiety and general upbringing resulted in pretty much everyone assuming I was heavily, debilitatingly autistic all the way until I graduated and to be fair, I definitely expressed the symptoms. I was constantly in a state of panic in college as I had no idea how to study or how to manage my time, and for some reason decided that graduating as quickly as possible was extremely important, avoiding doing co-ops or taking internships, instead taking full-time classes over the summer so I wouldn't have to work as hard during the normal school year. Since I had a full scholarship my dad was happy to cover this for me. Once college ended and I moved in with my dad (my mom had divorced him earlier that year) and I no longer had an arbitrary goal consuming my entire life, I became even more depressed than normal. After the third week or so of me staring at the ceiling without moving from my bed, my dad made me see a psychiatrist, and one massive prescription of antidepressants and a nice psychologist to talk to later, I started to become more normal again. 

After six months of job searching and being told by people that I didn't have the job experience (read: ANY job experience) to be desirable over other people, I got a part time job as a cashier, and within the last couple months started working full time as a cashier at a gun and hunting store, with my dad letting me stay with him so I could save money. Over the last year since graduating I've made incredible progress, I have hobbies, friends, will begin transitioning soon, and really feel like I'm coming into my own. When I write it out like this it really feels like I'm doing well, and maybe it's just the shock of working full time in retail and realizing how little my time is worth and really not having the time or energy for hobbies to a large extent, but I've been having a crisis trying to figure out what my future will look like. I have a degree that I'm not that interested in that I can't even find a job with due to covid, and while I have a lot of interests, I don't have anything I would classify as a passion to work towards. I took the LSAT my senior year and got a pretty good score (163 IIRC) with basically no studying beforehand, so my dad has been pushing me to become a lawyer, but the last year showed me that it was possible to be happy in life, and based on the law channels I follow on youtube, I really don't want to be spending 60+ hours a week of what youth I have left working. I know how this sounds. I'm very aware of how privileged I am to have gotten the help and resources to have gotten this far, and I know that plenty of the people I work alongside would kill to have a degree that pays as well as chemical engineering. But I've only really been ""me"" for the last year or so, and I'm sitting here at 23 going through stuff most people figure out in their teens. My dad is constantly reminding me that I only have three more years before I'm no longer allowed to be a dependent, and if I'm going to be getting a higher degree I have to start soon. My current plan is to save the money I'm making to take a smorgasbord of classes in spring, a neuroscience class, and art class, and maybe one or two more, and hope that one of them really interests me. I'm at a weird point where I simultaneously am looking for a chill job with a great work/life balance so I can just keep being happy with my life and wanting to get a EE/CS/ME degree as I see those as the ""gods"" of the modern world as far as innovating and pushing humanity forward is concerned, with neuroscience likely joining them if neural implants become a thing in the near future.

If you've read this massive wall of word vomit, thank you. This is the first time I've really gotten all of this out in one place, and any advice y'all could give would help me immensely. I feel really lost on where I should go, feel like a failure for taking this long to get going, and just have no idea what to do."

Would love some insight from people with current / senior positions within Cyber security. I have a couple of questions and a need for guidance that hopefully you all don't mind answering.

I will be graduating soon with a Bachelors in Information Technology with a Comp. Sci minor. One of my course electives that I plan to take soon involves me getting a certification. I am not sure which one exactly (I believe A+ is one of them I can pick), but I should be able to get a cert as well with my degree.

After some research, I am comfortable with both red and blue team (but red team sounds up my ally more). 

**Question 1:** What cyber security position/s incorporates cryptography and math? I would love to combine the two into my role.

**Question 2:** What software/skills should I start learning for a red team position and blue team position?

**Question 3:** Should I ""grab"" any internship I can find, or should I try to intern within a specific niche (I heard interns usually do help desk and nothing more)

Overall, I am coming in with programming experience in Java &amp; C, as well as MySQL which I think could help me get some positions. Thank you all for the help."

I had a bit of an odd question, but it has to do with life after school.

I personally would love to move to Washington State or to Colorado, just as I really like the scenery/weather and I feel like I have a lot of hobbies that would thrive in those areas. The problem is I am currently studying in Virginia, the other side of the country. How would I go about setting up myself to get a job in one of those states. Staying in Virginia would be easy as I can stick to the companies I intern at, however it seems harder to branch out to another state, even more so across the country. I’m also not too sure if Colorado even has a good abundance of tech jobs. I know Washington State has a decent amount, but I haven’t seen too much into Colorado. 

As I said before, I know this is a bit too early to really be thinking about this, but I would like to plan for this dream I’ve had and I don’t want to prevent it from happening. Thank you!"

ibetwu,9,2020-08-17,Advice for current CS PhD student seeking an AI/Data science job after graduating?,bijil90746,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ibetwu/advice_for_current_cs_phd_student_seeking_an/,"&amp;#x200B;

I’ve seen numerous sources stating that there exist instances of PhD grads getting AI research positions with very high salaries (i.e. 300k-600k). I am starting my PhD in computer science and would like to get any advice on how to best position myself to achieve the highest salary possible. Disclaimer: I understand that salary isn’t everything, but I think focusing on it is an effective way to limit the scope of my question.

**TLDR:** What advice do you have for me as an incoming PhD student to maximize my entry-level compensation for AI/ML/data science research positions after completing my PhD.

I want to leave it open ended since I don’t have a good idea of what the best strategy is. However, here are some questions I was trying to figure out:

**\[1\]** Do I have to be focused on a ‘hot’ area of AI like computer vision or NLP? Or is improving the core algorithms and components used by these areas (my current research) a valid strategy?

**\[2\]** Is it necessary to have a ground-breaking paper such as Goodfellow’s 2014 GAN paper? Or is it enough to have a strong publication record, but no ‘seminal’ paper?

**\[3\]** How important is networking? Who do I need to know to get these positions? Are conferences a good way to meet them?

**\[4\]** How much time should I spend on internships vs focusing on my research?

**\[5\]** Is interning at a lab like FAIR or Google brain the best choice?

**\[6\]** Any other important tips or things to consider?

&amp;#x200B;

I am beginning my CS PhD at a high-ish ranked US school. I have a relatively strong math background for a CS PhD student, and I have decent publications from my undergraduate. I would describe my current focus more as data science and algorithms than pure machine learning.  For example, questions I might focus on are creating distributed tensor decomposition algorithms, training hidden markov models through Riemannian optimization, and bounding the error of approximate kernel methods. I also have options to work in some more applied areas such as computational biology.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

**EDIT:** To clarify my question, I understand that these positions are competitive and that a PhD may not be the best choice to maximize salary.  However, I'm asking that *given* I've already decided to do a PhD, what specific advice is helpful to acquire one of these positions.

I chose hardware and software orientation and some  business and management classes cause I really like new technologies , I really like building and designing hardware and im decent at coding but not the usuall code geek you see in those classes . I ve been researching a lot about what career I could follow and don't feel expert enough to get any type of job despite being way above average student in grades . Also the big problem with greek universities is that they are too far from the industry and there is no real connection ..you have to find everything on your own .I ve done no internship only some big projects for some classes .

ibhdj8,3,2020-08-17,I’m torn between leaving and not.,TheN00bBuilder,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ibhdj8/im_torn_between_leaving_and_not/,"
Hi IT Career Questions! I’m in a bit of a pickle. 

I’m a college student in computer engineering whose working as a technician full time during summer and part time during school. I worked all summer at this position and know a lot of the tools we use. I’m a little burnt out from the hustle-and-bustle of tickets, as the helpdesk is undersized and not everyone pulls their own weight well. I’m also undermined/taken advantage of a lot and it’s not a great experience most of the time while drowning in tickets (I close 30% at a help desk of 10 active people). I don’t need to work either, I worked my ass off and got my college paid for by scholarships and I don’t have any real cost of living. 

I recently put in a 2 week notice due to school being online (and knowing I’ll have issues learning when online classes start) and these past few things I mentioned. I had a meeting with my boss and they want to keep me around, I voiced my concerns and was offered to start doing more project related work and less ticket work in my day-to-day along with a pay-bump and more flexible hours if the work I do constitutes it. 

I’m really torn on this offer as good as it sounds as I’m not sure if I can really trust that happening, I fear that it’ll just go back to normal and I’ll be back to square one before I know it, as I’m not too sure what projects I could do for them. I also have noticed a similar pattern of things like that happening for the helpdesk as far as ideas and projects go (e.g, we will say we will do X, but it’s never mentioned again and fades into obscurity) IT also isn’t where I hope to stay for my time and I was planning on getting an internship in engineering over the summer or a co-op during the year, but I am still torn on what I should do. 

My colleagues want me to stay and say that my bosses don’t do stuff like this normally for people. My ex-coworkers at an old internship that I still keep in touch with who work closely with this helpdesk say that I shouldn’t take it as I shouldn’t expect my work load to change, plus this particular helpdesk has a high turnaround rate on people, I’ve seen a few leave in my time here and an ex-colleague who started a bit back said not one person is the same from when they started. 

I’m just so torn... hopefully my boss or coworkers don’t see this but does anyone have an idea on what I should do?"
ibi69y,8,2020-08-17,Taking a gap year to apply to Waterloo &amp; other Canadian Universities?,aspiring_cosmonaut,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ibi69y/taking_a_gap_year_to_apply_to_waterloo_other/,"Ok I know your answer based on the title is likely an immediate ""no"", but if you could read my post in full that would be much appreciated!

For some context: I graduated from the IB Diploma Programme at a Canadian High School back in April, and had plans to go to UBC in about 3 weeks. Although I started really regretting this decision around the end of high school, I just sucked it up knowing that UBC was still a top 2-3 school for CS in Canada, and that I'd be saving a lot of money by going to a school which is a 10 minute drive from my house. C'est la vie, I guess...

Until August 16th. The IB conducted a full regrade of all students due to COVID, pushing my score up from a 36 to a 41 including bonus points. For reference to Canadian high school systems, this would be like a 96-97% average. A year ago, I was struggling with major anxiety and imposter syndrome so I didn't even bother applying to Waterloo. However, now that my grades are finalized and are quite a bit higher, I'm considering the possibility of taking a gap year to apply to Waterloo, by far the best school in Canada, as well as some other schools like UofT, McGill, and possibility American schools. UofT and Waterloo (top CS schools in Canada) don't really accept external CS transfers, so that wouldn't be an option. 

**Reasons to defer my UBC application and take a gap year:**

* The chance (keyword) to get into Waterloo CS or SE, greatly boosting my American employment opportunities
* A year to work on personal projects and leetcode, useful for internships no matter the school I go to
* UBC isn't guaranteed CS admission (top students averages from first year get in). All the other schools I'm considering are guaranteed assuming you maintain a pre-disclosed grade
* I have a year's worth of credits from IB, so even if I do end up back at UBC, I would still graduate with others my age
* A chance at a proper, not online, first year experience in a new place, not possible right now cause of COVID

**Reasons to stay:** 

* No guarantee that I'll get into Waterloo
* Can't do anything like travelling due to COVID
* UBC is a good school and really cheap for me. Also has a co-op option (good job postings, but I've heard they can be a pain in the ass to deal with)

I'm just trying to process this news and come up with an answer by the end of the week. Everyone I've talked to says only amazing things about Waterloo, and with a decent shot at the program I feel like I'd be doing myself a disservice by staying at a school that I don't even have a massive urge to go to, especially as a year off now doesn't even seem like too bad of an idea (even for just UBC, UofT, or McGill).

Thanks so much!"

Turns out the internship applications were released earlier this year so I went ahead and applied and have since let him know that I have, etc. He’s still responding actively so I’m hoping this is a good sign but don’t want to get ahead of myself.

I completed an internship at a company a couple years back and was even asked to come back later on.

During my work term, I realized how much I hated technical work. Software engineering is extremely similar to computer science where you just sit in a cubicle all day and code with little to no human interaction. I understand that not all engineering jobs are like this, but it’s the majority of what software engineers/developers do. I hated it. I dreaded going to work everyday and there were multiple instances where I physically had to pinch myself at my desk as hard as I could to prevent myself from falling asleep due to the boring work.

I panicked when I realized this fact - I put so much work into a difficult STEM degree only to realize that I hated the career. 

Although I didn’t enjoy the job, I LOVED my classes. Even though it seriously makes me want to hit my head off of a metal table sometimes, I love the problem solving, the mathematical thinking, and innovative ways of advancing technology. And honestly, I really love my coding classes. I just don’t think that I’m suited to do it for 8 hours a day, 5 times a week.

Anyway, I see my degree as an investment rather than a direct career path. I’ll never be an engineer, but I’ve learned so much organizational skills, time management skills, and leadership skills that I can use to further my success in the future upon graduation. I have absolutely no regrets. 

Plan right now is to work for a few years and complete a Masters in Business Administration.

If you feel the same way, what are some discoveries that you’ve made throughout your degree, and what are you planning to do after graduating?"

ibm687,24,2020-08-17,Anxiety help in UT during COVID19?,TheFreeJournalist,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/ibm687/anxiety_help_in_ut_during_covid19/,"After taking a final for my last class for the summer, and not getting the results that I wanted due to anxiety-related issues, I realized that the anxiety that I had during the exam and also have experienced for the past 3 years or so (maybe earlier like ever since high school or so) not only in exams, but also in general in my time at UT has not ""disappeared"", is too frequent to be passed on as ""normal anxiety"", and I wanted to get actual help for it. It seems a bit too late now, but the reason why I'm trying to get help right now is because I had family members who have dismissed my anxiety-related concerns as trivial and ""something that I should get over with"" and can ""disappear"". 

While I am in a way better state than I was in freshman and sophomore year (when I was harassed by a classmate/toxic friend and even had classes with that person throughout the whole of sophomore year) and first semester of junior year (when I was in a quite toxic relationship) in college when the anxiety was at peak (I'm an upcoming senior right now), the anxiety I have been facing has been pretty bad to the point that it had affected my overall academic performance in my time at UT, my experience as a CS major at UT (since a lot of the anxiety that I experienced in the past 3 years or so was due to my experiences as a CS major), my lack of tech internship experience (given that I haven't been able to do well in the interview stage of applications due to anxiety as well), and even made me isolate from and thus lose a good amount of my friends back in sophomore year in UT (to be fair though, a good amount of the friends I lost were somewhat toxic (and ironically my first) friends from UTCS). 

As I'm not going to be on-campus for this semester, I tried searching through the UT CMHC website for online services relating to my problem, but I haven't really seen anything suited for my needs yet (one of the options was talking to a hotline, but I don't like talking on the phone due to anxiety-related reasons as well). So is there any specific services in UT (like within CMHC for instance) that can help with anxiety-related issues? 

Also, I realized that this is quite a long post and I gave out a bit too much information than necessary. I also mentioned other people in my post too, but I don't mean to antagonize the people mentioned in this post or make them look bad (to be fair, I'm not proud of who I was back in freshman and sophomore year of college either), and I'm sorry if I irked anyone with this post. I'm just having a breakdown right now after unfortunate results from a recent final with the realization on how much anxiety has affected my experiences in UT. 

Thank you. \~"

I am a first year physics masters student and I am looking to apply to a CS PhD program in a year or two.

Personal background (keeping it general for anonymity): I was always interested in CS and programming, but I loved physics as well and went into undergrad as a physics major. All of my research experience was in computational physics and utilized physical simulations and modeling. I enjoyed it, but I realized I was more interested in the programming aspect than the physics. I also felt like I didn't quite find my ""niche"" or ""field"" yet, even though I was generally happy with the work I was doing.

After evaluating what I wanted to do with my life, I discovered the graphics/simulation research being done in CS. It was an instant click, and I knew this was the field I wanted to go into.

 As per my title, I am already enrolled in a 2-year masters program in physics but I would like to apply to a CS PhD program after.  What advice do you have to get into competitive CS programs? I realized that the field of CS that I am interested in has a lot of great groups in top programs (Stanford, CMU, etc.) so it will be a fight to get in. I want to use my next two years to make myself as competitive as possible. Should I also reach out to professors at these schools and start to network?

So far, my masters thesis is on track to involve computational theoretical research and machine learning. I am hoping to take one or two CS courses as electives as well. I may look to get a relevant CS internship, but my master's program requires that I work within the department during the summer, so I may do it the year after I graduate and apply the fall after. I also considered dropping out of my program, but I felt that because of COVID it would be too risky to find something to give me equivalent experience. 

Thanks!"

Just to give you an idea of who I really am, I started off at a biology major but switched to engineering then took a semester off, (switching schools) then resuming engineering. Then dropping out completely due to mental health reasons. And now I’m trying to start up cs major but can only take the beginner programming class since I had already completed most of the gen eds. So I’ll only be taking one class this semester with maybe a left over gen Ed’s. Assuming that all goes well and I finish my degree strong, any employer who sees my transcripts might dump my resume or interview in the trash and I might not even land an internship. Especially since there’s probably going to be way more competitive people easily qualifying. And I honestly do not know how I can explain these circumstances since their all related to my mental health... I don’t know what to do.... I honestly feel like a loser. I don’t really see myself doing anything else in life since I do enjoy math and science but at the same time it seems like my trajectory is going really downhill.

I will be having a lot of free time from now to January (besides my part-time job) and I was wondering things I should be doing to study for and to prepare for before jumping into college and my potential internship. I would like to know what things should I be studying so I don't jump in head first with no knowledge. I don't know a whole lot of the specifics of the technical side of I.T. but I would like to learn more as I did some research on what a career in I.T. would be like and, believe it would be a good career for me as I enjoy helping others, and learning new things.

Since then I haven’t had much luck finding anything as I’m always asked about my eligibility to work in the United States without a sponsor (currently as I’m international, even though I live in America) and I do not have that due to the visa I am on.  I am not looking for paid work, I just want a program like Google Step or Microsoft Explore ( which aren’t open yet and are very  selective) 

So if there is any summer opportunity that you as a student or alumni know of, I humbly ask that you please reach out to me.

I'm at the tail end of my internship and I can kind of tell that I won't be getting a return offer.\* Since this is the third internship in a row I haven't gotten a return offer from, do you think this will hurt my chances when I start applying to full time jobs this school year? Also, I feel like each time was because I kept getting a combination of boredom and burnout on the job, even though one of the companies was one that people on this sub would consider a ""dream company"". Is this a sign that software engineering is a bad choice for me? Given that jobs are now really competitive due to COVID, and I don't have much work experience beyond software engineering, would it be wise to pivot during the job search and start interviewing for other roles such as data science? \*\*

\*For reference, I feel like I did substantial work that I can definitely describe for future employers, but unfortunately the other interns in my group were all rock star programmers compared to me, so my manager has recently stopped giving me tasks to do, and I have to fight to get noticed.

I had a really good university in my city, so ofc, I went there and lived at home. At the time, I was really glad to be saving so much on rent, food,..etc other expenses. But now, I realized I really missed out on personal development, growth, independence, making friends and generally have ""fun student life"" because of parents managing curfew, and just not being closer to campus. I did move out short term to Toronto for 3 internships, and tbh, those were my most memorable times in unviersity, meeting new roommates, growing and being independent on my own (and not have parents around).

Now, maybe it's just the pandemic getting me down, but being at home for 8 months straight studying and not even being able to escape to go to campus has really got me hating living at home with toxic/narcassistic parents. I actually just finally finished university studies (hooray!) and will be doing a 16 week grad program in the Fall that's going to help me with my CPA studies since I'm going to start working in January. HOWEVER, work is also in town. So sure, I'll potentially be out for work, but still under my parents house. Which makes it hard to be independent, date, personal development etc.... 

Mentally, I know that moving out is the best option, but financially, I still don't feel it safe. I think it'd be silly to move out but within my city, because then i'd need to pay for my own car (or transportation cost) in addition to rent. Whereas I can at least live at home and take the car to work (and also gain driving experience bc i barely drive rip). I also have student loans of nearly $19k to pay off, so leaving to move after December this year doesn't seem smart to me. And I probably won't even be able to travel as a result of COVID because who knows what will happen in Fall/Winter. 

My incoming salary in January is $54k. I'm thinking of potentially working a year in town while living at home, then ask to transfer to the Toronto location for 2022 (at that time i really hope to have written/passed CFE). I will have money saved up from living at home to move out to Toronto too. But even that, I'll be 25 in 2022 and only then will I start living independently without the headache of my parents? I want to do so much but feel like I can't because I need to be smart with saving up first, be financially independent, pay off my loan. And right now, I obviously can't travel bc of rona but would like that in the forseeable future. You think moving out is feasible with my situation in a year? I know it'd effect my personal development waiting off, but i don't want to be struggling to live pay cheque to pay cheque.

TL;DR Anyone in their 20s still living at home with parents? When did you (or plan to) move out? Is it feasible to move to Toronto with 54k starting salary or is it better to save up? I feel like living at home is effecting my personal life (personal growth, development , dating..etc) and none of this will improve if I'm at home but i need to consider the COL. Thoughts?"
ibsxfh,0,2020-08-17,(24 F) University staff ignore my attempts to contact them over a very important issue regarding my ability to graduate,Purple-Membership-91,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ibsxfh/24_f_university_staff_ignore_my_attempts_to/,"
Hello guys, 

I’ve spent my summer working an awesome internship virtually for a company I really like. I got hired for this internship around February-ish and because it is unpaid, I decided  to pursue getting school credit for it. I didn’t think it would be an issue because the internship was directly related to my major and I would be working a substantial amount of hours a week (40 hours a week = roughly 12 credits to my school). Obviously by March, cOVID-19 hit and a lot of things changed, one being that my school went completely virtual. Luckily my internship was still willing to have me on board virtually and so I filled out my schools paperwork to apply for credits and got it to the right people by early April I would say. 

Now here’s where stuff starts to get crazy. I want to preface this by saying that I know things got really stressful switching to a virtual format and I completely understand that, but I don’t think being ignored for months by people in my department is acceptable in any situation. 

So because I had to do everything virtually, that meant I was only able to contact the people in my department through email. So I submitted the form filled out and signed through email. The head of my majors department seem to have a lot of trouble figuring out how to virtually sign the document and would literally ignore my emails for weeks on end until I followed up with a second or third email (wouldn’t answer calls and had his meetings completely closed off). Finally by mid June (yes, 2 months) I got an email from him saying he was able to figure out how to sign it virtually and that he approves of it. OK great.  he then sends it to the co-chairperson of the department for her to approve it. well, it is now August and I have yet to hear from her or anyone else. i’ve sent countless emails to him and her and have been ignored and I’m really not sure why when my internship was approved by at least one person. 

i’m really not sure who to reach out to at this point and I’m really stressed about it because I needed those 12 credits to graduate this winter. I have tried calling and setting up meetings but all have been ignored and obviously since everybody’s working from home as of right now I cannot meet with them in person. How should I go about this? I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to receive school credits that would help me graduate because of one person‘s incompetence or something as dumb as ignoring my inquiries. Should I reach out to the dean? What should I say? Am I wrong for being upset about this? 

TL;DR: The people in my majors department have been ignoring my emails about receiving credits for an internship that I’m currently working at. It’s been well over four months at this point and all of my attempts at contact have been largely ignored and I’ve had no word on whether I am able to receive credits for it or not. This is super important to me because I needed those credits to graduate and it would really suck to have to change that simply because no one wanted to respond to me.  What should I do? Who else can I reach out to?"

I am not asking you to do work for me for free. I feel like [this woman trying to give away free cruises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqBRyuljjF4).

I'm a software engineer and startup founder. I also wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i9vuhr/i_wrote_a_syllabus_for_learning_python_and_django/) the other day about learning Python that got pretty popular.

My strongest language is Python, but I'm learning Clojure and rewriting my app in Clojure. I thought one way to stay motivated / have fun / learn a lot would be to mentor someone who wants be a software engineer and learn Clojure. What I'm offering to one person is to meet over a video call twice a week for the next six months to talk about how your Clojure study is going for free. I'll answer your questions as best I can and help figure out what you should study next.

# Who I'm looking to help

1. Wants to be a professional software engineer.
2. Wants to learn Clojure.
3. Will spend 40 hours per week over the next six months learning to program.
4. Has completed at least a semester long introduction to computer science course (e.g., CS50).
5. US work authorization (in case you end up working at my startup after you're done).

# How to let me know you're interested

Fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrfE6RcCwb37zTVn) and I'll respond within 2 weeks. If I haven't responded by then, it means I went with someone else and dropped the ball in letting you know. I'm sorry.

# A huge word of warning

My experience with offering help is that I get way more response than I can handle. I'm probably going to have to say ""no"" to a lot of people. And if that's you, just remember it says nothing about your ability to become a software engineer!

# FAQ

**I don't meet the requirements in your list. Will you still mentor me?**

The only thing I'm flexible on is if you're almost done with a computer science intro course. Otherwise, no.

**Will you help me with this other thing?**

Probably not, but you could ask.

**Is Clojure the best language for a self-taught programmer to get a job?**

No. I don't know which it is (maybe Python or JS?), but I really doubt it's Clojure.

**Then why should I learn Clojure?**

I'm not saying you should learn Clojure. But if you do, I might help. People who like Clojure tend to *really* [like it](https://medium.com/@ertu.ctn/why-clojure-seriously-why-9f5e6f24dc29). Clojure is a lisp, which [is neat](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)."

Here is the twenty-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

Intro to Computer science: Intro to python 

Data Analysis and Applied Econometrics in Practice: work with STATA and R to conduct original analyses. Evaluate and replicate existing research. How multiple regression can be used to answer causal questions. 

I feel like these three courses add a lot to my skillset, but most applications and interviews for internships will be done before these courses finish or even start.

With everything there is a learning curve and a process. Just give yourself time to learn.  Jeez man it's like people are just putting so much pressure on themselves to be perfect all the time it's not worth it! Make mistakes and learn from them! Do projects that you find interesting and like don't put so much emphasis on leetcode. It's like every post I see is just lc and internships and I get it but just like chill and enjoy the path you have chosen! Companies don't want just another robot that can do lc and burnout in 6 months. Be your own person! Sorry for the rant I'm a lil drunk I just am tired of people being stressed about things beyond their control!

I'm a rising junior with a return offer that's set to expire early November. The benefits are quite good and I'm strongly considering going back (it's one of my top choices). I would like to interview with Google and get a decision before the deadline, however, I heard that Google's process takes a notoriously long time, especially host matching. If I tell a recruiter that I have a deadline, would that expedite the process? If not, could I ask to instead be evaluated for Winter 2021? 

Thanks!"

For reference, I'm currently preparing for internship applications and I know that in the past, companies have sometimes flown out applicants and conducted an in-person white-boarding technical interview.

Last Friday, I hosted a party at my place for my coworkers. 

I am an intern in a start up so we all super young and get along quite well. Party didn't turned out very well thought. 

Martin, my superior invited a friend of his, Amina and with another intern (who was actually my pal beforehand!) locked themselves in the bathroom the entire evening to plan how they were going to go to another party. I was kind of offended but hey i was not going to make drama over this. Later, i knocked on the bathroom door because i needed to go to pee. They refused to open the door and i had to come back knocking 10 minutes later... still refused and when i came back another 10 minutes after I banged on the door and seriously kicked them out of the bathroom. I was pretty angry at them so I explained how that was a super disrespectful behavior. 

If I had the next day a great discussion with Martin about what happened and received his apologies that i gladly accepted, the other intern thought.... Since then he does not talk to me, look at me or even say hello. He never apologized. Total coward!!! I feel even more offended by this behavior than what happened Friday evening. 

However, I am a professional person and personal drama do not belong it the workplace. But i am hesitating between squaring him up jussst a little with a confrontation (maybe not the best idea with a coward) or plainly ignoring him? What would you recommend me?"
ic182d,1,2020-08-18,Gradutate in the UK - What next?,uncut_onyx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ic182d/gradutate_in_the_uk_what_next/,"Hello everyone, 

I recently graduated (this year) from a pretty prestigious university in the UK with a high grade in computer science and I am looking for advice as to what to do next. 

Currently I do not feel that I am confident enough to apply for jobs and here are my reasons why: 

* I have no experience other than my degree (no internships or relevant jobs).
* I do not feel that my coding ability is at the level that it should be for a graduate job - My course was very theory orientate and I did not complete any side projects during my time at university. The only coding I did was the minimun required to complete the assignments, using as much help as I could get.
* My work ethic at university was not great (I guess it's best to admit this now rather than never) and so I have not really retained much of the content that I was taught - for a mixture of reasons but essentially boiling down to not caring enough.

My current idea is to find an applied masters in an applied subject which I actually find interesting (by spending a year figuring this out) and start the next chapter from there. I think this would give me the confidence to start applying for jobs. I have a few questions about this:

* How would I tell the difference between a masters course which would be more theoretical and a course which is much more likely to teach applied content? As in, what should I be looking for in a course' listings.
* What level of general coding (algorithms/data structures) should I be at to feel confident in being able to pass that section of an interview (perhaps in relationship to leetcode).
* Is there any other general advice for this stage in my career?"

Currently I know HTML, CSS, JS, Python and Django, and SQL. I recently finished a JS course on Udemy bc I didn't feel so strong in it and I'm now working my way through a React course. I'm also currently in a web development internship using Vue.js but the internship really doesn't give me enough work to keep me busy. 

I know this path isn't supposed to be easy at all, and hard work gets you through. The thing is, I've been dealing with anxiety for the last period of time. My wife is amazing and she works a full time job to support us, which frees up my time to learn and grow in this new skillset I've gained. She expects me to work every day on building my skills and send my resume out everywhere to try and get a job as fast as I can. 

I don't feel like I know anything. I've built a few small apps and sites, but I feel like when it comes to basic logic I'm an absolute idiot and I can't figure anything out. I'm afraid to try to get better bc I'm afraid to fail. I've been reading tons of articles about being stuck in a the beginner's rut, and how I just need to grind constantly and continuously be building apps but I just don't know if I can. I feel like I'm at my wits end, and the thought of building tons of apps and constantly grinding out code fills me with dread rather than passion. I don't want to quit, but I feel stuck and really overwhelmed.

Is there anyone who'd be willing to talk with me and maybe just help point me in the proper direction? or someone look at my current skills set and tell me I don't suck as much as I think I do?"

EC’s

Captain of my vex robotics team, 3x state champion during my tenure, 4x qualified for the world championship.

Marketing internship at a decently big finance company

Exec positions in a few student led non profits (legally registered and designated as a non profit)

STEM instructor at a local rec center (I got paid)

Cooking for friends and family (I have this listed down on the common app rn, but idk if I should put it. I feel like it shows who I am beyond my very boring ec’s but I don’t wanna come off as desperate to fill in every spot on the common app.)

Essays:
I’ve heard good things about my overall concept, just that I need to revise it to include a hook and make it flow better. Probably gonna be above average but not blow your socks off amazing. (7/10)

Recs;
Honors history teacher- she put “outstanding student, a joy to teach” for one of my progress reports so I figured she would write a good rec. only drawback is that I had her freshman year so idk if that docks how valid the letter is. (8/10)

College engineering teacher- stayed after class a bunch and would go to him whenever I had a new design for a robot and he would make suggestions. We definitely had a good relationship and I’ve heard he writes good rec letters. (9/10)

Honors precalc teacher- really respected me for how my success in her class increased throughout the year and complemented me on my work ethic. Not as close to her as the two other ones tho. (6/10)

Robotics coach- I’ve known him for four years so if anyone can talk about me it’s him. I’ve seen the letters he writes for the seniors and they’re very good. Our relationship was similar to the relationship I had with my engineering teacher.

Schools:
ED- Columbia
EA- uchicago, umich, mit (this one is for a bet with a friend but it’d be nice to get in), unc chapel hill
RD- northwestern (Applying for bsmd), brown (applying for bsmd), rice (applying for bsmd), ucla, uc berkeley, uc Irvine, suny stony brook, suny bing, UPenn, swarthmore, Boston college, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, wash u St. Louis, NYU 

Overall I know my ec’s are very meh especially since a lot of them fall under “stereotypical Asian” territory but it is what it is. I’m looking into bsmd programs but idk if it’s worth applying because I don’t have the research experience they look for in applicants. I also am applying for questbridge so if I get selected for the college match the whole college list I have gets thrown out.

ic2526,101,2020-08-18,"It's not always hellish, a positive story for those who have read too much gloom here.",Pocketfullofbugs,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ic2526/its_not_always_hellish_a_positive_story_for_those/,"There are a lot of posts on here detailing how hard and terrible it is to get a job. And I guess I am writing this post to say... not always.

I am a Midwest developer. I have been at it for three years now and am really enjoying it.

Before starting this career I had a Bachelors of Arts in History, which I used to wait tables, bar tend, and stock shelves for the first six years after college. I attended a nine month 'bootcamp' offered for free. Class two times a week and a couple hours a night with assignments.

I got my first job about three months after the classes. Bootcamp did all the legwork, never even sent out an application myself. It was a learning internship at a shipping company. The company had six of us interning, and they hired three full time, I did not make the cut. However one of the people who did had been looking at other opportunities and he shared one with me. I got a call from a recruiter and had an interview in a week, got the job for their associate program, I was hired along with 30, the vast majority of them were not college educated to code. Became a consultant there 12 weeks later (paid full salary the whole time). Working there to this day. I have more than tripled what I used to make before coding.

I am thankful I did not have to grind leetcode, or hackerrank, or get the hundred rejections I see people posting on here. I've interviewed at two development jobs and gotten both of them, never put out a single application. I know I am an edge case, but I feel like we see a lot of edge cases about the other side of things that never go right, so I wrote this to say to all the new learners and some of the worried ones, its not so bad all the time. There is probably a middle ground between how easy I had it and how hard others seem to have it. I have tried to pay it forward by getting as many other people out of the suck as I can. I stand at three, working on four. Hopefully more."
ic45sv,2,2020-08-18,I'm new here but just wanted to tell my story.,Mental_Conflict,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ic45sv/im_new_here_but_just_wanted_to_tell_my_story/,"Hi. I'm 22m and I think I'm done. I just wanted to come here to talk about myself and to see if it helps me figure out what to do right now.

Tl;Dr My girlfriend of over 4 years and I have broken up to be more independent and discover who we each are. It was mutual and we both still care about each other. I'm living alone and most days have 0 social interaction. My friends don't respond to my texts or don't feel like talking to me. I'm so lonely and I want it to end. I honestly think that if I were to stop living it would be better for me.

Growing up I was always super outgoing, athletic, funny, and I had tons of friends. I played on sports teams, went to sleep overs and all that fun stuff. I never had issues fitting in. In middle school and High school I had such a tight knit close of 5 or so friends that I'm still friends with today. Back in middle school and high school I was a popular kid and I felt like in my small school literally anybody was my friend. Senior year was the best year of my life. I didn't drink or smoke but I just had authentic fun with my friends. I didn't try too hard in school which I don't regret but I just had a good time. 

I met my first real girlfriend the end of my senior year and over the summer after I'd graduated we decided to stay together and do long distance. She was then a rising senior at my high school Keeping in touch is hard for me so i knew that I'd have to give her all my attention which was worth it for me. I went to a small liberal arts college and my freshmen year I would wake up, text my girlfriend, go to class, get food to go, go back to my room and text her while I did homework or played video games. I joined an a cappella group which kept me alive several times. Most nights I didn't go out or socialize I would face time my girlfriend until we fell asleep. I was really only friends with my roommate and 2 other guys and 2 girls on my hall. My first semester I had the worst grades I've ever gotten in my life. I couldn't focus but my family knew I had executive functioning disorder so I was prescribed adderall and it really helped. I saw my girlfriend about once a month when she would come visit me or I'd go home for a vacation.

At the end of my freshmen year with the help of one of my female friends I realized that I didn't really have any friends at school. I had people that I was friendly with but nobody that felt like a really friend to me. Somebody who would go out of their way to text me or come hangout with me. Partially I think because I hadn't put in the effort to do the same. I just kept talking with my girlfriend all the time because I loved her and both she and I weren't mature enough to have a healthy long distance relationship without the constant interaction. 

My sophomore year my girlfriend decided to come to school with me. She had visited and decided she liked the school so she came and it should have been great. I ended up having the worst year of my life. She was making so many new friends and experiencing all the things that I neglected for myself while I was suffering by myself. 

This was when I first realized I didn't want to be alive.

 My freshmen year roommate left to serve in the Korean military, my other friend changed schools after a weird falling out, my only other male friend was never really that close with me because he was on a sports team but we ended up living together what should have been a single because we both had nowhere else to live. Fall semester went by and I was miserable. Deep down I was so jealous of my girlfriend but I knew that I had made those decisions my freshmen year myself. 

Spring semester she went back early to rush a sorority. I felt more alone than ever. She was always off doing things with them and I was so fucking alone. I'm happy that she did it though. I decided to be a walk on for the men's crew team since I was tall and I also decided to rush a fraternity. I loved the crew team and it felt good to be a part of a group. The senior captains were funny and I fit in with them more than I did anywhere else on campus. I liked getting fit again and committing myself to a team helped me give my live direction. Hazing started with my fraternity. I would wake up at 4:45 am to get to practice on time, be back on campus at 8 am, go to classes until 3pm, rest until practice at 4:45pm, finish around 6:30pm, eat dinner with the team, then get hazed at night sometimes until 1 am. I fit in homework wherever I could. I would leave most pledging events crying myself to sleep to then wake up the next day and do it all again. Even after we were initiated I felt ostracized. The brothers who I had been hoping would be my new friends hated me the most because I was a rower and I had to miss events like morning workouts or weekend activities because of regattas. I was a sophomore pledging with 1 other sophomore and the rest freshmen so I stood out. I hated the hazing and I was gaslighted into thinking that the issue was with me.

Junior year came and I never felt like I fit in with my fraternity. The seniors who hazed me were gone but I never really fit in. I lived off campus with a girl from the rowing team. We were just friends but both of us didn't have anybody else to live with. She ended up being the most despicable person I know. My days involved me waking up for practice, going to class, exercising, seeing my girlfriend and going to bed. I barely had any social interaction. I didn't have a group of friends. Junior spring I quit the team because with the seniors who I came to befriend gone, and the team falling apart, it was hard for me to push my body to a breaking point everyday for people that I didn't agree with. My girlfriend and I had a great year but we both realized that we were both in a somewhat similar situation. Our own personas had become so intermixed with our relationship that we had little to nothing without the other. Our personalities became our relationship. We got along more than fine but we knew we had to have other friends.

Senior year came and my girlfriend went abroad. I was the vice president of my fraternity because I hoped having a leadership position would make other people have to care about me. I was living in our house to be more social but I really only had 2 friends in the fraternity. My brothers never came to my a cappella concerts but all showed up to the other male group because most of our brothers were in that group and not my co-ed one. I never felt like I belonged. With my girlfriend abroad and several hours ahead I spent most of my days alone crying. I thought it was too late to make friends which it was. 

I fantasized about how great it would be if I wasn't alive almost every single night.

Senior spring came and I was primed and ready to have the best year of my life. Covid happened. We went home on March 10 and never came back to school. We finished the semester online and I never got to see my teachers or the people closest to me. I never got to walk on stage and show my family that I did it. But that's okay.

Quarantine was rough. I barely saw my girlfriend because her parents are in the risk sensitive group. I worked for my uncle to make some money and my girlfriend and I talked about taking a break. I had an internship coming up and would be leaving our home state. I knew I needed to forge my own path and make friends and be independent. Long distance was always hard for me because it doesn't feel real. I need a real person in real life. We decided just to see how things went and decide later. First month of the internship ended and I brought up the break again. She said she would think about it. 2 days later we broke up. We kept talking because we were each other's best friends. She was the only person I had. 2nd month of the internship started 18 days ago. I had to relocate to just outside the city I'm working in. My now ex girlfriend and I texted about 3 times a day. It hurt. Last night I asked her about it and what she wanted to do. She needs some time to think things over on her own and to see where she is. She is currently moving into school which is an hour away from me here. 

So now we don't talk. It hasn't even been 24 hours. None of my friends talk to me over text. I lost my best friend. If i get any social interaction in a day it's 2 of my friends on discord at night playing a video game for about 2-3 hours. I'm so alone. I'm living alone. The loneliness is deafening. I've started taking notes. I think that when I finish writing something for each person that I'm closest too I will try and find a way to end my life."

HELP!,gedas434,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ic5tls/salesforce_admindev_job_vs_software_dev_job_help/,"My background : Currently going to the last year of college. *I am super passionate about programming , especially back-end, I love to code*. 4 months ago (before summer) I got thrown an offer to learn Salesforce and work for a company as a **admin/dev**, company delayed my recruitment for many reasons. 4 months later (now), job is still pending until start of september, so I have some time to make up my mind.

Im having big time conflicting toughts, is Salesforce even worth learning? Is it worth going to for software developer/engineer experience? Does person like me with no job experience and with huge passion for programming would like whole dev/admin position on Salesforce platform?  
**The problem is im going to be in dev/admin position**, not a whole dev position. This is primary thing why I dont like it. If I would go be some junior PHP or .NET developer I would be considered to be developer only and would learn things related only to programming, in this case I will have to learn ton of Salesforce not related to programming things and those things would only be useful in Salesforce radius, which in long term career perspective is a waste of time.

I am considering going to .NET or PHP internship otherwise, which would fit my long term career perspective much more than Salesforce.

TL;DR No job experience, big time passion towards programming, got thrown an offer to be Salesforce admin/dev, is it worth it career wise or should I seek developer-only job?"

I come from a very nontraditional background but I’ve been in school for about three years studying CS. I was incredibly lucky to keep my summer internship and started at a big tech company this summer and I’m a little more than halfway through. It's my very first tech job and it has really not been going well. I feel like this whole situation is just the result of a perfect storm of circumstances - timing with COVID causing 100% WFH, poor fit for my skills and my team/project and having an apathetic/inexperienced manager. I could write an essay (I did, but decided against posting it all) about what’s been going on and why I think it hasn’t been a successful internship for me.

But at this point, I know I’m not getting a return offer. I don’t really want one, as I don’t want to be on this team or under this manager anymore. I know many other people who work at this company, and I could probably get a referral later down the line if I really want to work here. I have learned a lot over the course of this internship, but I think the most important thing I’ve learned is that I don’t want a job doing anything even remotely like what I’m currently doing. What inspires me and excites me is frontend development and UX/UI design, and it's ultimately why I wanted to make the career shift to CS. I’ll be graduating next year with my MSCS, emphasis in Software Engineering, and I guess I’m wondering what I should be doing next. I’ll be starting to teach myself more frontend languages like javascript as well as starting to put a portfolio together, but what sorts of positions can I look for? Is it a bad idea to aim for UX positions as a software engineer? Will I be limited to small companies?   
 

What sort of advice do you have?"

I graduated this May from a computer science program with no personal projects and only non-technical internships. I got somewhat funnelled towards the business side of things so to help get me back onto the development path I'm applying to the [MLH Fellowship Program](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). This is essentially a 12-week program where you work on projects with a small of group of peers and a mentor. They offer two tracks, you can either contribute to [open source projects](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source), or learn about new tech and implement it in [real-world inspired projects](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/explorer) (they describe this option as ""a series of short hackathon sprints""). I've never worked on big projects, so I think the open source option would be a great introduction to working with large code bases written by other people. However, I'm slightly more inclined towards the other option where I would get to collaborate on projects from start to finish, and potentially do more full-stack development (my inclination is probably just because you do this kinda thing in school so I'm more comfortable with it).

My question is: Which program do you think will look best on my resume and help me land a development job?

ic6qbi,2,2020-08-18,Suicidal again after feeling good for a while,Toasterbuddha,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ic6qbi/suicidal_again_after_feeling_good_for_a_while/,"Hi, I just wanted to vent, I guess. Will definitely delete this after a while.

I had an 8-month period of horrible anxiety/depression/suicidal thoughts starting around January of last year, when I broke up with my girlfriend. I went to therapy and, after a while, started to heal. I tried to change up my routines and saw a lot of success. I started working out consistently, talking to people more, sleeping enough, and meditating. It did wonders for muting my suicidal thoughts and culling my anxiety.

I've been doing good since around September, and have even felt content while in quarantine. Yesterday, though, I really got knocked off the rails. I got into a semi-argument with a close friend over text, which I slowly realized was entirely my fault. I was confronting my friend about something I *interpreted* that he said, not what he actually said. I didn't bother asking him to clarify anything, I just launched into my baseless rant in a series of paragraph-long messages. He got understandably pissed, and I eventually realized what happened and apologized. He ultimately accepted my apology, but said that my behavior made him worried about future serious discussions we might have, because I was a selfish asshole in this one. 

We're in a better place now, but I still feel awful about this. It makes me feel like, in these months of ""recovery,"" I've made no progress at all. I'm still a selfish asshole who can't communicate or maintain close relationships, and the only reason I've felt good is that I haven't been *confronted* with that for a while. When I'm suicidally depressed, I tend to feel ""evil,"" and this has brought that up again. I'm having trouble thinking of anything today besides my own death.

Also, I'm feeling suicidal about being unemployed. I want to get a job ASAP, because my friends and I have talked about moving to the city in a couple months. I've been applying a lot and have a few prospects, but I can't get over the idea that I lack any specific ""skill."" I'm a recently graduated English major, and while I got good grades, I don't consider myself uniquely good at writing or research. I feel unexposed to and unprepared for the professional world. 

I do, however, have a unique opportunity right now to practice writing and research -- I'm a fact checking intern at a startup app. But I've been squandering that opportunity. All my work there is entirely optional, and because of that, I give up on fact checks easily, and frequently give myself the excuse that it would be ""unhealthy"" for me to work on a fact check anymore. As a result, I don't have much work to show for the few months I've worked there. This week, I was planning on changing that -- one fact check a day was my goal. But the whole thing with my friend put a stop to that. I'm having a lot of trouble working, and I'm having more trouble cutting myself any slack about it. The fact that I'm being lazy when it comes to this opportunity, again, makes me suicidal. It makes me feel unprepared for the professional world, and as if I'll never move out of my parents' house and just be a nothing stoner person forever. It's been overwhelming to relapse so heavily into this line of thinking.

I don't really have any questions or any particular requests for help. I just wanted to post this somewhere because I'm terrified to talk to anyone close to me about this. I do have a therapist, but I'm not seeing him for another week. This felt good to type; I just wanted to post it somewhere, I guess."

ic77ly,2,2020-08-18,How much does undergrad work experience matter?,WhodatBollocks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ic77ly/how_much_does_undergrad_work_experience_matter/,"I 'm a college student double majoring in data science and statistics who is going to be a sophomore this fall (class of 2023) and I consider myself VERY blessed to have earned positions as a student programmer for my school's IT department and as an undergraduate research assistant for a professor who specializes in computational medicine.

I've spent no less than 30 hours a week this summer testing software, building apps, training neural networks, etc. During the school year, it's more like 10-25 hours depending on my schedule. I know that's a wide range, but my supervisors allow to me to work as much as I want which I am very thankful for. I do this on top of my coursework so that's why my hours vary.

I realize this places me far ahead of my peers in terms of relevant experience. Most people I know, including a few seniors, are still working in food or retail. 

However, is this an advantage is AFTER graduation? I'm not planning on leaving either position until graduation. By that time, I'll have more than 3 years of continuous experience working in tech, both in an office and a lab. And that's not accounting for any internships I might get hired for. How much do employers value this kind of experience?

Any advice would be helpful, thanks!"

Have been deliberating on which program to join and cannot postpone decision-making anymore having earned admissions to both. Would love to hear some opinions in the comments below.

I am a dual-national (US/UK) most recently working in NYC in financial services. The post-MBA goal is to recruit into consulting/FLDP/corporate development roles so I will be fairly reliant on structured recruitment. Post-MBA location is ideally London for family reasons.

**IESE (October 2020 start)**\-   
*Pros*  
*-* Seems to be well-represented in OCR / structured recruiting (including MBB consulting, albeit strong Hispanic/Dubai office skew)  
\- Interactions with alumni/staff warm and all speak positively of their time in Barcelona  
\- Exchange opportunities (grades dependent) and international modules second year  
\- Strong, consistent rankings  
\- Barcelona is a low cost of living city vs. what I am used to  
\- Strong academic reputation   
\- Opportunity to become more fluent in Spanish

*Cons*  
\- If unsuccessful in structured recruiting, unsure of the marketability of the brand (generally less name recognition than even an HEC Paris, Oxford or Cambridge even though higher ranked)  
\- Covid cases in Spain are blowing up making everyone a bit nervous (and class is still set to be in-person from October)  


**INSEAD (January 2021 start)-**  
*Pros*  
\- Strong consulting placement (adjusting for sponsored students of course) into London offices  
\- Excellent reputation, name recognition and ranking  
\- Campus exchange (France and Singapore)  
\- Jan intake affords internship  
\- Lower opportunity cost in terms of time (1year)   
\- Impressive diversity of cohort  
\- Long-term value of brand  


*Cons*  
\- Rumors of poorer/overstated recruiting outcomes outside of consulting  
\- Slightly less warm vibe from admissions process   


Would love for folks to challenge me on the pro/con lists, as well as any other opinions. Looking forward to seeing you in the comments!

Covid has set back my internship opportunities so I probably will graduate without one, **am I pretty much screwed when it comes to entry level security positions?**

I want to know realistically, **what are my options for getting my foot in the door**?  My degree is basically worthless and has not prepared me to work in  security, I'm pretty much 100% self taught. My only skills thus far are:

* I'm very comfortable with Linux, use it as my main OS and have basic networking and programming knowledge
* Somewhere between beginner/ intermediate level with Python
* Studying for OSCP and plan to take it in November/December

I have a blog where I document CTF write-ups and other security related subjects like writing PoC exploit scripts and specific objectives for the OSCP exam (buffer overflows etc). I also have active github and  linkedin profiles and have listed several projects on my resume.

My only experience thus far is tutoring in math/science so, my only  credentials would be my degree and the OSCP by the time spring comes. I haven't networked with pretty much anyone and I haven't gotten my name  out there whatsoever.

I've applied to maybe 30-40 internships since last August and only received 2 phone interviews with 1 being technical. This interview was recent but I was  basically told I don't have enough skills for the position (even though its an internship and the guy said I gave answers he'd never heard  before) and that I'd be a liability to their company. I know the skills are specific to the position but its really made my imposter syndrome flare up and I feel extremely hopeless and discouraged. I've obtained many soft skills with tutoring/customer service and have read they can  sometimes be just as important as technical skills, they were even listed in the position requirements but I was never asked about it. My blog, projects, previous experience and soft skills were never once mentioned or referred to in the technical interview, are they even  relevant?

Do I just need to sell myself better? Get out there more? Be patient and actually get the OSCP first? I know it's not a guarantee but it holds more weight than my  degree. I frequently browse related subreddits and they all claim that getting into security right now is pretty much impossible. What are my options to get into security at this point?

icdmao,1,2020-08-18,Is it important to immediately begin graduate school after finishing my undergraduate degree? Mechanical/Aerospace.,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/icdmao/is_it_important_to_immediately_begin_graduate/,"Hi, I'm a 4th year MechE student, and I'm hoping to work in the aerospace industry. I'm not sure specifically what I want to specialize in, but I really like propulsion and/or systems engineering. I'm looking for some early career advice.

I'm very lucky to have several options after I graduate, through a scholarship program. The program has paid for my undergraduate degree (in return for employment after college) and can also pay for graduate education. At the moment, I have two options. 

1. Begin working after UGrad \~3 years  to work off my scholarship commitment, and then pursue a graduate degree.
2. Immediately begin graduate school after finishing UGrad at either my current or another university, which will incur more years of work to repay in return as soon as that's completed.

The work that the scholarship requires is in aerospace/defense, and is very fulfilling. I've worked two internships with them already and I've love it, and I'm excited to begin working there full-time. At the moment I have a commitment of 3 years, but considering the work and the people, I could see myself being there much longer. As I mentioned, I feel incredibly lucky that this program has accepted me.

I'm wondering if it is important to get my graduate degree immediately considering that it's an option? I absolutely want to go back to graduate school at some point, but at the moment my options seem to be flexible. I can get it now and then start working, or work a few years and then go back.

I've gotten mixed answers so far, and I think that my biggest worry is being able to go back to the student regimen after working a few years. I've also worked hard in UGrad, so I don't think being accepted to at least somewhere would be an issue. 

Do I lose traction if I try to resume school after working a few years, or does it even matter? Or, is there anything else I'm not considering? Thank you for reading, and I would love to hear any advice or perspective you can offer."

I recently graduated... during the pandemic. At first I thought it wouldn't be too bad, just getting a job and try to get into a routine. However, things turned otherwise. I just have a couple of questions:

1. **How did you deal with transitioning to full-time job?** I luckily got a 3-month internship which helps with the bills for the next couple of months, but this is also the first time I've ever worked truly full time 8-5 Mon-Fri. I think it's taking a toll on me: having only 6-8 hours left a day to do anything else that's not work, the rest is house chores, eating and cleaning. Socialization is nuked quite substantially, and when the weekend comes around, you're already too ""empty"" to know what to do with your time.
2. **How did you stay sane living with parents for the time being?** This is because of the job market and COVID. I really love the U-district and would rather work/live near there. I believe there's that transitory phase where you move back to your parents before you get a stable job and move out again. Without having my own car, nor wanting to ride the COVID-risky transit and that there's nothing nearby to do in the suburbs, I feel pretty confined. I have things around to keep me busy like books, or music learning, but those require motivation to do and I'd rather not force myself into it. Being around with my parents mean I can't talk comfortably with my friends online, nor can I consume edibles either. Alcohol is fine though, but that's a horrible drug.
3. **How did you maintain socialization with friends?** I think generally people have friends when they're at college, right? Right? And some likely are not in the same year as you, but different year, or they might not work in Seattle, or they move away for grad school. How did you deal with your social life essentially broken apart? I think this is more of a personal issue for me, as I don't deal with departures really well... And people say ""Oh you'll find friends at work"", but I don't see that happening. That, and the fact that I have 8 hours left a day to do anything else, is not helping maintaining/establishing socialization either. COVID exacerbates this.

All of this makes me really want to consider grad school or going back for another bachelor. But those generates different questions. At first, I thought that there's no way I'm doing grad school because I'd have to move away, but now the thought of starting it seems appealing..."

I'd just like to preface this post by thanking everyone who have shared their personal stories, guidance and advice on applying for grad schools. Reading these posts really helps me calm my anxiety and stress of applying for grad schools. 

I will be starting my final year this coming fall and honestly my future is looking super bleak. My undergraduate experience really crushed me. My first year started off fine. I wasn't scoring excellent grades but by the time I finished my first year my GPA was at 3.0, which I was pretty happy with. I knew that I can bring it up in the following years. However, in my second year, due to my own fault, I enrolled into 5 different courses in the first semester, 3 of which (orgo1, thermodynamics, analytical chem) and the courses I enrolled into in my second semester which were more or less the same (extension of the first semester courses) really tanked my GPA. I was unable to keep up with these courses, because of which my mental health really came down, and some really tragic stuff happened in my family that I am still not able to cope with. During this time, I had to make my family my first priority. I don't regret making that decision but the consequence was that my academics took a very strong punch to the gut. In short, I was just really going to through a lot of shit, in terms of my family, during that period and came out of that year with a 2.3 GPA. My third year, I was able to salvage very little of my GPA, but not really and only increased it to a 2.6. 

I finally caught a break after my third year by landing a year long internship. This was great because I was able to learn some real world skills. My time-management, organization, and all that good stuff really improved me as a person.  

Currently, I am volunteering in a DFT lab, contributing to their machine learning research by doing some coding and reading papers and elementary stuff like that. I also enrolled into an optional final year thesis course (starting in Sept), working for an environmental chemistry lab (my degree is in Env. Chem). Although due to COVID, my supervisor said the work will only be computational. 

It is my hope to at least bring my GPA back up to a 3.0 again, the same as it was when I finished my first year by the end of my senior year. However, I frankly don't know how my chances look like. The schools I will be applying for will be looking at the courses that are relevant to the programs I am applying for. I will be taking most of these advanced and specialized courses in my final year. However, the deadlines for most of these grad schools are by December 2020, by which point my grades for my senior year's first semester won't be out. And I frankly don't know to what extent my research experience would count since I only just started getting involved in it in my final year.

I know that my chances are very slim, or rather non-existent. However, given my predisposition to be a foolish optimist, I have started my prep to apply for grad schools this year. Given this, I was hoping if anyone who reads this could provide any advice on what I can do if I don't get into any grad school? I honestly don't know what I should do. I have no plan B. Or perhaps is there anything I can do now to improve my chances to maybe get into a grad school? Emailing the professors with whom I'd like to work with and size up my chances? I would appreciate any input! 

Thank you!

TL;DR: I fucked up my undergrad and I am now trying to seek validation and advice on how to approach the daunting task of applying and getting admitted into a grad school."

I've been working at a dead-end retail job during the duration of the crisis. Am I just totally shot in the foot in terms of finding a ME job? I have no internship experience otherwise. I have no significant engineering projects either. I'm applying to jobs and waiting to hear back, but I'm just so pessimistic about getting anything solid at all.

icg4o0,2,2020-08-18,Is there a guide out there for going through college correctly?,productiveDevices,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/icg4o0/is_there_a_guide_out_there_for_going_through/,"I’ve been at college for nearly two years now, and I still feel like I don’t understand the process. Like, I am going to classes and taking the ones recommended by my advisor for my major, but other than that, I don’t fully understand what I need to do to play the game if that makes sense.

I’ve got to figure out the process. Right now I am looking into transferring and it’s hella confusing. I’m not sure which university I should even go to. I’m not sure how to figure out the price of it all and if I’ll even be able to afford it, some of the websites say it’s affordable, but it still seems like a lot of money after scholarships and grants! 

I really want to land a good CS job after I’m done with college, so I really want to know how to do college correctly. I am assuming I need to do internships, networking, clubs, etc.

Can anyone help me understand what I can do to help myself understand college and feel comfortable and confident along the way?"
ichdwp,3,2020-08-19,How should I continue with this startup ?,darkpikl,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/ichdwp/how_should_i_continue_with_this_startup/,"Hello , 

I a new dev with only 6 month of experience , i join a startup for my school internship.

The startup is only 2 co-founder and me the only tech guy. ( I am cto of myself :D).

I have to do a mobile application on react-native with firebase (but will maybe go to my own server later) during my 4 month of intership. 

They startup love how I work and they already tell me that they want to keep me after the internship, they will need someone to maintain the application and add new feature.

The problem is that they don't have finance, I am actually pay 600€ a month ( min salary in French for a intership).

it not big deal as it a intership but if I finish a mobile app alone on 4 month I think I can ask a Good salary on my next job.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tl:dr

The main problem is ""should I stay in a startup after my internship and for what condition"" 

This startup have a good idea , but I would not like to sell myself cheap, they only have 2 people (without me) a designer co-founder and lawyer co-founder.

I was thinking maybe if they pay me 2500€ (no bad for a first job after 6 month of studies programming) or more ? 
Or give me share of the startup ? 
But how mush of share can is ask ? 
They are 2 co-founder so I think they have something like 51% 49% or 50% 50% between them.


Thanks all"

icihhl,3,2020-08-19,"28M, I'm ready to start being what I'm capable of, just need a direction to harness this energy (long, a little personal).",spongebobsbelt,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/icihhl/28m_im_ready_to_start_being_what_im_capable_of/,"**tldr**:i have bolded the focal point of what I'm looking for

I'm sort of at a crossroads right now and I don't know where I want to go. I'm mainly posting to see both what kind of jobs are out there I might not know about and also if the ones I'm leaning towards sound like theyd be a fit for me.

My jobs I've worked (in order) are, cashier/bagger, gym front desk, health and wellness intern at a senior center, afterschool for K-8, high school special ed paraprofessional, and afterschool for 2-5. My major is Health/Exercise Science.

What I’ve learned from these jobs is that I'm very much a people person. I find people really interesting and like to know what's going on with them, who they really are and how they got there, and sharing who I am. I would chat with a few regulars at the gym about stuff in depth, I connected a lot with the seniors I worked with, and I believe that being friends with coworkers (if they're cool) makes the workplace a more fun environment to be with. With the kid/teen related jobs, I was the one that bounced around the most to different students/grades because I'm able to work well with practically anyone and I'm given good job freedom because of this. I really do enjoy the variety. In my social circles, I like keeping in touch with people, I like being the host for people to come over and hang out, and I like connecting with people in groups individually to cement a group. I like to talk in depth about emotions, about life situations, and love the idea of a bunch of little ideas coming together to form a person/personality.

There's a caveat to this though. I also really need alone time (like every other 'extroverted introvert'). I get sick of people when I'm around them too long. I need to decompress to be 'myself' again and the little things about people start adding up and bothering me. That's kind of why I also enjoy variety. I have a side to me that really doesn't like people or think of everyone as my bestest friend ever or whatever; I'm real about the fact that for the most part, people are strangers and working with people is something I wouldn't do for free.

I enjoy working with kids because it puts me in a great mood, gave me a lot of insight on people and even myself, and it's so rewarding to be a safe and good role model for them, plus I get to be super silly and goofy lol. I liked special ed because I feel like they're misunderstood by a lot of people, they're more human than people think, and I think that people go at it the wrong way. It's all about seeing where they're capable and pushing them forward (not literally lul) and seeing where they aren't and assisting when appropriate. Same thing with kids, same thing with elders and their health/exercise. It's a balance of accepting who they are, accepting your dynamic in the relationship, and knowing when to step in.

One field I want to work in is mental health. I have been to therapy myself and been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, general anxiety, social anxiety, suicide ideation, and PTSD. I have been on anti depressants but took myself off them because they were making my nights uncomfortable and I feel they didn't do much for me, only a slight boost (and I didn't get to drink). I stopped going to therapy because I couldn't afford it and I didn't like to shop around for therapists; it's very hard to trust your own instincts on compatibility when you second guess your instincts). I figured that the only one who could truly know and fix myself was me.

I had a pretty traumatic childhood with major physical abuse from my father, talked my mom out of suicide and manic depressive episodes on multiple occasions (she once drove me and her with her eyes closed hoping she'd crash), and a slew of other things. A lot of my mental attention goes into my mental health. I'm constantly a work in progress but mentally I'm in a very good place compared to before and only getting better. I accept more and more of myself, I have built up a positive inner voice over time, actively try to confront things I avoid/afraid of (both externally and in my psyche), have turned my addictions around, I like to take little moments in life and create a useful meaning out of them, and so on. Like I said, ongoing work in progress and I'm still learning every day. I've been through literal pain and torture and have come out of it with a lot of perspective and I think I have value in helping other people out or learning more about mental health scientifically. I've been told I am very in-tune with myself and that I'm really easy to open up to. I'd like to take the interest I have in myself and somehow make a career out of it (...as narcissistic as that sounds lol). It's the thing on my mind the most and the lens through which I see the world and think about how all aspects of my reality tie into it, so me falling into a job where I do the same thing (working with kids was very close to this) would be great.

**main:** Ideally I'd like some kind of job that is some aspect of helping people through problems or being a good influence/role model/etc for them, working with a variety of people, working 1:1 or small groups, has some 'down time' where I can use my academic mind and do something scientific part of the time and not have to be 100% socially on, and the more money the better (ideally $60k or more). I'm hoping for something I can get with a Master's Degree. Some of my other passions are music and video games.

There's a couple of things I think I'd be interested in. I really like the brain, the mind, consciousness, and so forth. I think about my own thoughts recursively quite a bit and the fact that my thoughts exist within my brain is interesting. I would enjoy some type of neuroscience with a social aspect tied into it.

In a similar fashion, I think psychiatry is interesting too. It deals with the brain in both a health/scientific aspect but also how it relates to behavior and people's esteem. One caveat I have with this is that I didn't even like taking anti-depressants and I feel like I didn't want to take medication because I didn't want it to be a crutch. I think it's possible that other people would benefit though.It's both academic and social. However, I'm 28 and I'm not sure if I want to do 8 years of more schooling with tons of loans. I looked into psychiatric nurses and I'm curious about that field as well. It looks like a happy medium of time and still good income.

Guidance Counselor or a School Psychologist also seems like something I'd like. I'd be working with kids and I'd help them out on lots of things. However it seems very limited and rare because most schools don't open up the position too often.

Therapist/Clinical Psychologist seems like an obvious choice. I think it would be rewarding but possibly more draining. Also I'm worried about getting a client I don't like or dealing with projection or blame or whatnot. I also feel that I'm not quite yet ready to help other people this intensively through just communication and emotions. And the pay can be low.

Occupational Therapists seems good too, it's more lighthearted in emotional nature but still deals with people, and has other objectives than intense care.

That's all I have, thanks for reading my essay! I'm open to any suggestions or more questions or whatever."

But my major concern has to do with how much output they expect out of a simple intern.

My average work day extends well into 10h shifts with barely an hour of break in between. As a result, everything nice that recharges me has had to be chucked out.

I've had to shut out all usage of social media to preserve my eyes from recreational screen time. From the remainder of the time, I do my household chores and manage to get some form of movement in, though the tiredness is too much to manage this last week. I almost burned myself out trying to study a little and manage my social media pages.

It's taken a toll on my quality of work. While I understand that endurance is a muscle we all have to develop, people have to realise that creativity is not an bottomless well.

icqye0,25,2020-08-19,Eclipse Chapter 1: David,manufacture_reborn,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/icqye0/eclipse_chapter_1_david/,"Eclipse Chapter 1: David

The long corridor down to Mark Blake’s office was covered with front page news articles. Some of them were so old that they were actually paper placed inside of a frame. Gold plaques at the bottom described the date that they had been run and what had made them special enough for the Eclipse Herald to have so ensconced them. Others, the more recent ones, were displayed on screens. However, even these were now more than fifty years old – after all, it wasn’t very interesting to display the binary output feed that Eclipse uploaded directly to the Cortex Plates so many people used to take in the news of the day.

Most days, David would have found the old articles charming – a shrine to the publication’s long and rich history. The writer in him would wax poetic about the journalists of old who had uncovered corruption, scandals, and been on the front lines of no fewer than twenty-four wars over the last hundred and fifty years. There was a reason that Eclipse had been considered as one of the top System-Class news sources for so long – it was because of their reporters.

Today, David marched past the gold plaques and articles without so much as a side-long glance. For weeks now, he had felt more and more strongly that the Eclipse was abdicating its sacred duty to inform the people and now he could bear the feeling no longer. Already, he was rehearsing his admittedly self-serving speech over and over in his mind, trying to guess how the editor would consider his words.

David nodded to a pair of receptionists who were deep in conversation as the pair passed him, heading back towards the common room where most of the Eclipse’s writers and journalists resided. A door opened in front of him, and David stepped out of the way as a wiry-haired youth emerged from inside of another of the paper’s many offices. So focused on what he intended to say to Mark, David didn’t hear the first time that his name was called.

“David!” Came the friendly voice. He turned to see the young man in the hallway behind him and realized that it was Kyle Marzen, one of the interns. The youth approached, his unkempt hair running haphazardly down his forehead.

“Kinda occupied at the moment, Kyle. Do you need something?” David asked, his voice stiffer than he’d intended.

For a moment, the young man pulled back into himself, his stride halting. Then Kyle’s face brightened again.

“You’re going to talk to Mr. Blake.” It wasn’t a question, and yet the sparkle in the intern’s eyes betrayed a certain admiration – as if talking with the editor was an accomplishment onto itself.

“Planned to – I’m going there now.”

Kyle nodded, considering.

“You think he’ll let you go?” The intern asked.

“That’s what I want to find out. If he doesn’t, I’ll be packing up my desk and be out of here before lunch.”

“You all say that. Why would he say no? It’d be a good story.”

“There’s a lot more to it than that,” David shook his head. “SysDef doesn’t take on embedded reporters very readily these days – there are all sorts of hoops to jump through. Screenings, evals, they make you sign a loyalty oath too – before you ever step foot on one of their ships. Even if they do take you, it’s act of God whether you’ll catch even a single glimpse of what’s going on at the front.”

David cut himself off then, realizing that he had just said everything that he expected to hear from Mark. The boy was right though, the Eclipse’s writers were a tad dramatic – even if he were to be rejected, David could hardly imagine life outside of the paper’s walls. He wouldn’t quit, not today, maybe not ever. But, still, there had to be better material to be found than the tabloid exposes and slice-of-life pieces he’d been writing for the last three years.

“Well, I hope Mr. Blake says yes, anyway. One of you should be out there to see what’s really happening and tell us all about it.”

“We’ll see.” David responded, and with a curt nod, turned and resumed his march. He could feel the intern’s eyes on him has he went. He had no doubt that they were filled with an admiration he couldn’t feel about himself.

Mark Blake was a portly man, quick to laugh and make a crude joke or two. The staff liked to say that the man had been here since before the tower which contained the Eclipse offices had even been built – they had just built the place up around him. However, David thought he knew the man better. Blake was a realist and a hard-ass when he wanted to be, and although it pained him to admit it, David thought the man was a damn-fine editor.

The office which contained the fearless leader of the Eclipse Herald was at the very end of the hall and had a glorious view of Olympus Mons rising in the distance. Its entrance was flanked by two sleek desks, occupied by the editor’s receptionists. Night and day they were.

Nancy Wong was young, sweet, and beautiful. Her laugh was the chiming of bells and her smile could light up a room. Her counterpart, Karen Albrecht was ice and fire all bundled together in a volatile concoction which could – and had – explode at a moment’s notice. David tried to avoid the older widower at any cost. In fact, she was half the reason he had put off talking to Mark for so long. David couldn’t help but think that her presence was by design a bulwark against inane conversation or trivial concerns with which the paper’s staff might have otherwise interrupted Mark Blake’s incredibly valuable time.

“Good morning, Nancy!” David called as he approached with as much cheer as he could muster. After a moment’s hesitation, he added, “and to you Karen.”

Their reactions were as opposite as he might have expected. Karen fought back a scowl and said nothing – but eyed him warily as one might a warranty salesman. Nancy however, incredible Nancy, shined with a broad smile and eyes which were full of vitality and warmth.

“David!” She called back, happily. “I was just thinking that it had been a while since we’d seen you down here.”

“Not long enough.” Karen mumbled under her breath.

David chose to ignore that – what did it matter anyway, when the sun itself was shining into his eyes. He put a hand lightly onto Nancy’s desk and regarded her with an admiration that was not unlike the intern’s before. Not for the first time, he found himself wondering if the young woman was available and what she might look like sleeping in his bed.

“I apologize, I should make the trek more frequently. After all, we’re only halfway across the building from each other.”

Nancy nodded in genuine agreement.

“Last time you were here, you were planning to do a story about the current state of the conflict. Have you finished with it yet?” She asked him in a honeyed tone. “It sounded very interesting – I was hoping that I could read it.”

David stifled a frown.

“Unfortunately, I didn’t feel that there was enough primary material available to properly do the story justice. The admiralty and SysDef have been more or less non-responsive to my inquiries.”

He paused for a moment and thought he could see genuine disappointment in Nancy’s eyes. *Be still my heart.* He couldn’t help but be melted by this woman. As if to assuage her dismay, he found himself adding,

“That’s actually why I’m here – is Mark in? I need to talk to him about getting clearance to embed with the fleet so that I can go and find out what’s really happening out there.”

Nancy opened her mouth to answer, but it was Karen who spoke.

“He’s not going to sign off on you playing soldier and gallivanting halfway across the Orion Arm. You’re not the first to have come asking, anyway.”

David cast a sharp glance towards the older woman, but the look in her eyes, almost daring him to disagree made him draw back. The last thing he wanted was to have Karen dig her feet in on this. Once she got firm, she was all but immovable. David would have an easier time squeezing blood from an orange than changing her mind once it had been set.

“I’d like to try to convince him, anyway.”

Karen rolled her eyes.

Nancy, however, seemed thoughtful. After a moment, she gave a quick nod – as if she had decided something and began typing on her terminal.

“Mr. Blake has a fifteen-minute window in his schedule right now – you chose a good time to come down. I’ll see if he’ll see you.”

David nodded, not mentioning that he had checked the editor’s posted schedule before getting up from his own terminal halfway across Eclipse’s writing room.

For a moment, there was silence between the three of them. Karen had seemingly turned her attention back to whatever work she was doing – dismissing the writer and his disruptive inquiries. Nancy kept her eyes fixed on her terminal screen, awaiting a reply from within the office behind her. David found himself running his eyes over her small mouth and full lips, and watched with fascination as she softly bit her lower lip in concentration.

*She’s too good for you.* An unhelpfully pragmatic voice in the back of his mind informed him. *Plus, you’d be too old for her, anyway.*

David wasn’t sure that was fair. He was only fourteen after all. How old was Nancy, anyway? She’d been born on Earth – so she had to be, what? Twenty-one? Twenty-two? So that’d make her eleven in Martian years?

So, they were three years apart. That wasn’t unheard of by any stretch. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was too old for her. *Shit, I’ll be fifteen soon – what do I have to show for it?*

He resolved himself to be onboard a fleet vessel on the way to the front by the time that his next birthday came to pass. It was high time that he made something of himself – and this seemed like the best way to do it. He could convince Mark that he should go – he had to convince him.

“He’ll see you.” Nancy said with a relieved grin.

David smiled back, appreciative, and tried not to notice the mean smirk on Karen’s face as he passed between the desks to the editor’s office door. The door slid open before him, disappearing into the wall as he passed.

The office was cavernous and sparsely decorated. A sofa sat off to one side accompanied by two high-backed chairs that seemed to be wonderfully antique. A table cut the room in half, but the only thing upon it was a tall-mast sailing ship made of carved wood and beautifully lacquered to a shine. David had read the plaque beneath it once, the *HMS Victory*, though he had little idea as to what nation the ship’s real counterpart had belonged.

*I’m a bit rusty on my ancient Earth history.* He had to admit to himself.

At the far end of the office was a towering floor-to-ceiling window which looked out over innumerable green terraces which seemed to spill forth from the tower onto the rusty red landscape of his home. Further out, Olympus Mons rose gradually off to the horizon where the sky was a brilliant purple-blue.

Inside the office, a large mahogany desk sat like a throne in front of the window. A simple terminal was perched on its surface, but it was otherwise unoccupied. David glanced around looking for Blake, but the office seemed empty. He frowned and was about to turn around to ask Nancy when he heard a toilet flush.

A moment later, a seamless steel panel hissed open and the editor came rumbling out of the hidden bathroom.

“Daveyboy,” Mark called to him gruffly, tucking his collared floral shirt back into his straining pants as he did so, “what can I do for you on this fine morning?”

“Well,” David began, but found the words stuck in his throat. Mark would tell him no – it was as clear to him now as the outline of the great mountain in the distance. This was an exercise in futility.

Suddenly, the editor seemed to inspect him more closely. His sharp eyes searched David’s and found what they were seeking. The editor turned abruptly and faced out the window.

“You want my permission to embed.” The editor noted dryly.

“I do,” David agreed quickly, jumping into the opening, “I think that there’s a whole lot going on out there that SysDef isn’t sharing with the public and I want to find out what it is. Plus, I think that I’m cut out for more than the work you’ve got us doing and want the chance to cut my tee…”

Mark raised a hand and David fell silent. He begrudged himself in silence that he had rambled through so much of his argument so quickly.

“That’s enough, boy.” Mark’s voice brokered no appeal. “Going to the front with the fleet is the damned stupidest thing you could want to do. We’re getting our asses kicked out there – it’s a wanton bloodbath.”

The editor turned to face him, there was a dark look in his face.

“The reason that the System Defense Department is stonewalling you is because they’re all pissing their pants – we’re *losing* and badly – some of my contacts say that Sol itself may be under siege within five years. They’re terrified, but trying to cover it over so that there isn’t a system-wide panic.”

David didn’t understand. It didn’t make any sense. The war against the Evolved had been going on for more than two decades, ever since the uprising, and although David had been relatively sure that it had become harder fighting as they’d pushed further and further into the Evolved’s strongholds – he would never have even considered that they might be *losing*. It wasn’t possible.

“I can see you’re not taking this well – neither did I at first, truth be told. But the truth it is – and we all will just have to live with it.”

“If what you’re saying is true, then people need to know. It’s not our way to keep our own in the dark. All the more reason to embed and get the real story out there.”

“Even if we did get you embedded, they’d never let you tell the people the truth. Whatever came of it – whatever story – would be half true, half fiction, and entirely neutered of substance.”

“We have to try, anyway.” David maintained, surprised at his own conviction.

Mark Blake eyed him intensely for some time. Then, he let out a long sigh.

“I thought you’d feel that way.”

“So,” David began, searching for the words, “will you let me apply to embed with the fleet?”

Mark smiled, the smile of a man who has pulled off a great magic trick.

“It’s already done. I filed the paperwork a month ago.”

Shock coursed through David. This was nothing like the conversation that he had imagined. How could Mark have already submitted an application on his behalf without knowing that he’d even want to go?

*What the fuck is going on?*

Mark shook his head, smile widening into a grin.

“I filed the paperwork for me.” He said wryly, “but now I see that I won’t be going alone. If you’re really desperate to find out for yourself what’s really going on with this damned war, you better get home and pack your things.”

Mark turned again to stare out at the landscape. He let the silence hang between them for a few seconds. Then, he finished.

“Because our shuttle will be leaving tonight.”"
icqytu,1,2020-08-19,Cyber Security Resume Critique / Help,wistoo,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/icqytu/cyber_security_resume_critique_help/,"Hi everyone, 

Posting for the first time here. I have been following along with all the critiques and applying them to my resume, as I continue my search for an Internship during the pandemic. (my previous one got rescinded due to circumstances).

A little about me: I have a BSc. with Chemical Biology specialization, and decided to change career paths towards Cybersecurity. Right now, I'm pursuing an MSc in cybersecurity, and had to take a 1 year Qualifying program before I could be admitted into the MSc program. During this year, I took many computer science courses, that allowed me to get the background for my MSc. Since then, I have participated in two Hackathons (and won prizes at both), and earned an internship as a result of one of them (last year). I'm self-taught in web development (HTML, CSS, Python, JS, Node.js, and a little React.js)

Any criticism and comments are greatly appreciated. I also was curious, if my resume does an adequate job of reflecting what I've done over the past 2 years, or if there is a better way to state it. 

Thanks in advance!

I'm not worried about the perfect way. I don't know if that's smart or not. But to me, the payoff is worth it. That may be naive.

This has been beneficial because when COVID-19 hit my company kept me on and I’m currently working from home.

I hope this sub with many researchers and grad students may give me some advice. So some background info about me:

\- I've graduated a joint BS degree in Neuroscience and Computer Science. I'm doing a Master in the same field now. My school is considered a pretty good in ML (maybe top 10 but i'm not very sure).

\- My GPA is 3.84, not the best but I think it's ok. I've got several Bs in ML and algo classes tho.

\- I actually changed my major from BioEngineer to CS in my junior year (yeah, I know they're not very relevant. it took me lots of time and courage to make this decision). Therefore, sometimes I feel very behind compared to my CS friends.

\- I can read and understand most applied ML papers fine. I can re-implement the models and results. However, I have some troubles with understanding the math behind ML. I'm fine with usual calculus, probability and linear algebra, but don't really know vector calculus so I still can't derive by hand back-propagation through time. I feel not very confident with my math skills and worried that my math skills may not be enough to do ML research.

\- I've done 2 research experiences in my undergrads. The first one is not very related to ML, in which I implemented a software system to process electrode information recorded from monkey brains. The second one is related to NLP and we tried to use some new methods to interpret Transformer's internal representations. This research actually becomes an ICML paper with me as the second author. Honestly, we were all surprised that it got accepted, and I also don't really feel like I did that much work to deserved to become the second author .The students who started the paper, developed the pipeline and got like 60% result of the paper left for an industry job, then I came in and used the existing pipeline to do additional analysis to complete the paper. I only work in the project for 2 months. I feel that I just got lucky to be included in an almost finish project and become an author.

\- I'm working on adversarial machine learning now for my master thesis and I think I'm excited about the idea of the project. However, I don't really have lots of motivation to work hard and I procrastinate a lot. I'm supposed to work 8 hours per day for the project but I think I only have been working like 5 hours per day in this summer. I'm afraid that although I'm excited by new ML research and innovation in the field, I'm not motivated enough to survive and work hard in a challenging academic environment.

\- I'm also thinking about getting an industry job but I haven't done any internship and have only been doing research so far.

Thank you for reading all of this! Should I apply to ML PhD? And do you think that I stand a chance in ML grad school with my weak math background? Thank you very much redditors! Hope you have a great day!"

Okay student. Had 2 internships that went well. Graduated with a full time job, working on old Java web apps. After a year, I went to work at a startup that fizzled out after another year. Two years out of college, I got a job as a back end web dev on the .NET tech stack. Had good work experience, but didn’t grow very much. After 2 years, I went to another company doing the same thing as a contractor. Didn’t grow much.

At the beginning of quarantine (April 2020), I lost my contractor position. Since then, I’ve been taking a break/sabbatical while I try to figure out what I want to do next. I have a lot of regret that in the 6 years since graduating, I haven’t grown much. Hell - I feel the same way about the last 6 months. I feel like some of my most valuable years career wise have been wasted. The list of things I *don’t* know is a lot longer than the list of things I *do* know.

So where do I go from here?

I’m comfortable with C# - I really like C# as a whole, and working with Visual Studio, SQL, etc. I want to continue as a general software engineer - not necessarily as a full stack engineer, as I don’t like JS and CSS. However, most of the job postings I find in my area Los Angeles/Orange County) for something like .NET always want a full-stack developer.

I don’t have a strong personal Github. No personal projects. I don’t have any projects I’ve done for the full lifecycle I can show off, and don’t even know how to do a full lifecycle project, even on my most comfortable tech stack! I don’t know Docker, anything about cloud development, deploying apps, etc. My knowledge feels quite shallow.

For the past month, I’ve been working at upping my knowledge around the core data structures, sorting algorithms, and problem solving skills via Leetcode so that I can pass coding interviews - but I don’t just want to be an algorithm-solving monkey. *I want to learn how to build impressive apps.* All in all, I feel like I’m wasting time, and always have been. I need a game plan, but I don’t even know where to start, what to build, or what schedule to make. I'm so desperate, I'm considering returning to school for a masters program to help me figure it out. I'm tired of being complacent and average.

Side note: I don't see myself being a coder forever - I'd like to make the jump to some kind of management, but I'm having trouble doing so. How can I manage when team members know more than me? I've managed interns before, and it's gone really well. I've also done work as kind of a technical business analyst for a few months that also went well."
icto7p,10,2020-08-19,I feel like I have no passion for my graduate program anymore,barrym_54,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/icto7p/i_feel_like_i_have_no_passion_for_my_graduate/,"I began my first semester of graduate school last Fall, and due to difficulty finding housing (I didn't find a place until a few weeks after classes started and I was losing all my savings until then from motel costs) and running out of my ADHD medication (my old insurance wouldn't cover it in this state and I had to wait until the following March to get switched over to a plain that would), my grades suffered. I have to retake both classes from that semester starting next week, I lost my assistantship after that semester, and I was close to getting kicked out of the program.

Since then, I feel like I've lost a lot of passion for the program. Part of it is that I no longer feel like I'm focusing on learning during lectures, only trying to ensure I do well on every test, because my main concern is keeping my grades up, not on educating myself for the sake of it. I've done well with my grades for the Spring and Summer semester classes, but I'm still on academic probation since my GPA is .001 below the acceptable level, all because of how poorly I performed the first semester. I'm constantly in fear of getting kicked out and starting my life over again, this time with several thousands of dollars of new debt, so I no longer have any sort of excitement about this program.

The other part is dealing with the pandemic, which has left me inside all the time while taking classes online, and combined with academic probation I've had no luck finding an internship. Since my Summer semester ended a couple months ago, I haven't even been able to find work except a short low-paying administrative support position, and I feel like I've been wasting my life during this time. The lack of a social life probably hasn't helped either.

I've made definite improvements in my grades since that rocky start, but with the constant anxiety of potential failure and an inability to apply what I'm learning to anything tangible like an internship, I still don't feel as passionate about this program as when I started. I'm reluctant to talk to many people at my school about this, because with my initial grades and the indifference I've gotten from some people, like someone I spoke to at the disability office after the first semester who told me ""maybe graduate school isn't for you"", I'm worried some people would just as soon have me leave as encourage me to stay"
icu3e2,5,2020-08-19,Landed a internship with Georgia Tech Research Institute,marcosvaldez81,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/icu3e2/landed_a_internship_with_georgia_tech_research/,"Hello everyone, 

I recently landed a Student COOP/intern that will support research projects with GTRI. Whether it is getting my hands dirty and code, or just general IT. The job description seems pretty dense, consisting of that I will be developing and supporting DoD systems like linux, windows etc. Configure networks and servers, design and maintain application/machine virtualization and of course, general IT matters as well. This internship isn't a summer internship but rather a job, and that if I do well, they can extend a full time job after I graduate. This is a win win situation! 

For me, this is my first tech internship. I am pretty excited even if it may be surface level IT work. But I being a MIS major, and minoring in CS. Eventually, I would like to land a job that is a CS traditional job. Such as like CyberSecurity and or a programmer.  I want to break the barrier for MIS grad of staying IT level and be so much more. 

To get to the point, I am seeking advice from people who may work in IT or have started in IT then landed something greater. Since this will be my first internship, will it hold me strictly to IT work? Can I still land a job in a different tech sector like mentioned before with just this on my resume? Should I still work on side projects? Is networking the most important here? Should I pursue a 2nd internship in the future? Is my CS minor going to assist me greatly for jobs? I know this is a lot of questions, I don't have much guidance with school or career paths, it would be great if you can tell me whatever you like! Thanks in advance!!

&amp;#x200B;

Side note, I know you may be thinking ""Why didn't you major in CS then"", and to counter that, during my first two years of college,  I was switching majors quite often. I was inspired by my professor who was successful as a MIS grad. His stories of working in the tech field helped me find what I wanted to do. So I decided to major in MIS. Never got a chance to take a CS class :/ and also, It was too late to really switch to CS for which I would be in school for a really long time lol. But the minor isn't requiring too many classes so I decided to add it and finish school on time."

but I do want to go somewhere within IT for a career, so, I checked the courses in my city and they mostly all require GCSE or equivalent so hopefully I can get by on some equivalent qualifications. 

After looking  at some of the courses though they seem really.. oddly done, atleast to me. Some courses have 3D Modelling, Website Design and Spreadsheets all in one. I’m not sure if it’s right to assume this but personally I don’t feel as though many people can learn those 3 because typically you specialise in something in IT?

So, now, do I bother with doing the stuff I don’t know much about such as 3D modelling and Web Design if I just want to do basic IT work like tech support to work my way up? 

Is there any simple certification stuff I can get online that I could use for a job in the UK and that won’t interfere with my current education that someone can DM me?"

Been looking for jobs in as a Business Intelligence/Data analyst, plus some software engineering roles, for a few months with not even an interview to show for it.

I sent an application into Revature because they train you with what their partners want, pay you while they train you (minimum wage in my area because it will be remote so $16/hr), and guarantee you a job placement after training. This sounds very intriguing to me, as it will boost my resume with work experience and get me a paying job, but everything I have read about them is making me question it.  Everyone has told me to avoid it like the plague but gives no real reason for it, other than owing them money if you break the contract (like you signed a contract and they PAID YOU to train you, did you not expect repercussions, sorry I digress).  I have an interview tomorrow and I am just wondering if this is even remotely a good idea, but do not need to sign anything until training begins in mid-October.

Some Pros:

* paying job (45 or 55k starting salary depending on COL, with guaranteed 15k increase after first year)
* industry knowledge training
* getting a developer job with decent pay (my major only makes around 40-50k starting

Some Cons:

* locked into a two year contract (unless bought out)
* do not get to pick the location you are sent to
* owe them $20,000+ if you break contract

Can someone who has worked with Revature or know someone that has explain why this is such a horrible idea? I know that it is not good pay for someone with a CS degree, but having it as my minor really only opens me up to Junior Developer positions  (something that I have found virtually none of because of covid).  Are there any other pros/cons that I missed?"

They used [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to manage knowledge capture and task management, respectively. I did enjoy using this software, but I think its bit too teams focused for my needs but happy for my mind to changed.     


I am currently using an exercise book and doing daily entries but would like to change this before it becomes unmanageable. Therefore, I am looking for software that I could use to capture knowledge and manage tasks for each project. I was thinking about an offline personal wiki as that would allow for general knowledge capture along side the day to day project-based stuff.

**Does anyone have any software recommendations? Or workflow tips? Or anything that could help a new graduate at their first job?**
  
Software I have seen that seems interesting:  
    
* WikidPad     
* TiddlyWiki    
* DokuWiki    
* Confluence    
* Jira       
* Trello   
 

Let me know if you have any questions and I would be happy to answers!


Thank you.

Update - 20/09/20: 

In case anyone comes back to this thread or stumbles across it here is what I ended up doing. 

First here is a quick summary of the suggestions I got and why I didn't go with them:

OneNote - I tried it for a day and found it useful. However, I really don't like the UI and organization system it uses. Also don't want to be locked into a system. 

Notion - I like the look of Notion and very tempted to go with it. It was available on all platforms, had a nice UI, a good feature set, etc . However I decided I didn't want to locked into a platform that hard. I know it has export options but I didn't want to have to go though that one day if Notion flopped. I have similar reservation about Roam and Evernote. 

Trello - I have used Trello before and liked it. I may go back to it when I have more complex projects to manage but for the solution I chose does the basic task management I need.

So after trying the above suggestion I tried to one of my original ideas, DokuWiki. However the server management aspect was just too much for me to deal with. I imagine if you are strong with Linux and know Apache servers you will be fine but its just not something I wanted to deal with. Most other hosted wikis require this making them just note for me. 

So after more reading and hearing about it in different places I tried [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian is a note taking app that stores all your notes locally as markdown files which makes it very portable. I've been using for a fortnight now I really like it. The UI is nice and very customisable, it has wiki like functions like backlinking and wiki links and there is a strong community around it. There are downsides, its only for PC, Mac and Linux meaning I have to use a external editor to access my notes on my Phone (I store all my notes on OneDrive). It is also very new and has a small dev team so its future is very cloudy. However it's the best thing I have found and works for me. 

If you interested on how I use it or want to know any more, feel free comment or PM me."
icxmk0,1,2020-08-19,When in the year do big tech companies stop the bulk of their hiring for new grad SWE position?,Thenotoriousdev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/icxmk0/when_in_the_year_do_big_tech_companies_stop_the/,"Hi everyone hope y'all are doing well,

So context:

Right now I am in the recruiting process for APM roles that a lot of tech companies offer. These APM programs are usually so much more competitive than other entry-level positions (Extreme cases are programs that hire in the single digits per year, like LinkedIn for example), that despite prepping and interviewing that I might not land an APM position or earn a job offer that I'm not happy with opportunity-wise/compensation-wise.

SWE is my backup plan in case I end up with the short stick with APM. I don't know if I could do **full-time** recruiting/prepping for **both SWE and APM** on top of school and other things, especially with COVID and being stuck at home most of the time. Also, I'm looking at Leetcode problem forums, and I honestly don't know if I could pass some of those new grad onsites right now, especially for the well-known tech companies.  I'm trying to aim for the well-known/successful tech companies right now since they're the ones likely to survive and make profits in the next year or two of madness in the US (although that's not always guaranteed, case study being AirBnB lmao).

I'm not too particularly concerned with not passing the resume stage as I have some pretty good internships and experiences,  but more so concerned about the final round/ gauntlet type interviews that ask a lot of tough questions back to back.

**My question for you guys is: if I part-time prep for the next three/four months, would the big companies still have tons of SWE spots for new grads by the time I'm ready to interview?**

I have a feeling that, in the future, some other kid or someone right now might benefit from this so I'll post updates as well as my study plan:

Rest of August (\~2 weeks): Review my DS&amp;A notes and skim CTCI

September: 1 leetcode a day, gun for 2-3 leetcode Q's a day on the weekends

October: 1 leetcode a day, gun for 2-3 leetcode Q's a day on the weekends

November: 2 leetcode a day, gun for 3-4 Q's a day on the weekends, spend atleast 20-30 minutes on system design a day (APM recruiting is starting to wrap up). I'll start applying to companies for SWE roles around this time if I don't land something in APM.

December: Take two weeks off for Finals, then after do 3-4 leetcode a day and even more on the weekends. I'll continue to apply to companies around this time.

January: Treat interview prepping for SWE as my full time 9-5

Would love to hear your feedback/thoughts. Thanks guys :D"

I just finished my Amazon Internship and for a little something nice for myself I went shopping for my monitor (cause I had to return the one I got from the internship). My dumbass brother convinced me to get the Legion Y44w-10 43.4 Inch WLED Curved Panel cause it was on sale and I caved.

Also I was thinking maybe I could wait till next gen and just run 1080p on this monitor. It’s just gonna look horrible. What do y’all think?"

So I’m a recent college graduate with a degree in electrical engineering. I now have a big interest in cyber security, however, my degree was mostly focused on power electronics/distribution and nothing CS/IT related. I also have no CS/IT work experience and my internships towards my degree were engineering/construction based so I’m literally starting out completely new towards this new career path. 

I’m just wondering what certs I should start off with getting. I keep seeing Network+ and Security+ but I’m also wondering if its a good idea for me to get A+ as well. I haven’t seen many definite answers on this since some people recommend I get A+ first and some recommend not to get it at all. 

I’m also wondering if these certs and my STEM degree alone will be enough to get me through the door when it comes to getting entry level jobs despite not having any kind of work experience related to this field. 

EDIT: I’m interested in potentially becoming a cyber security analyst or even a CS engineer. 

Once again, I’m completely new to this field and I couldn’t find many direct answers so I apologize if this is a noob kind of post haha but I appreciate all the help and any advice you guys have for me!

So im aware of all the benefits of working in a union like annuity, 401k, pension, etc. I've already been accepted into their apprenticeship and in 4-5 years, Ill be a journeyman electrician, making a really solid hourly wage of like 60$. I've worked on their projects for two summers and enjoyed the camaraderie among the electricians, always meeting new people transferring in and out of jobs and ending my days early, 2-3pm. There's also tons of overtime. 

However, i personally don't like the idea of  having no control of being transferred to different jobs across the boroughs, most being in Manhattan but still. Also everyone on these jobs is super quick-witted and really knows how to make you look like an idiot. Which isn't a problem, i dont take things personally but theres a rapport that can be draining for me to constantly keep up with, the ball-busting especially. Cause even though I know how to be a social person, I am still an introvert. That being said, its a much more fun environment than most others.

Or i could finish my computer science degree, try to get as many valuable internships as possible and then look for work. I'll probably try to get my masters in something like stats or like an MBA since i dont go to a very impressive school. Maybe a reputable grad school would look better and i could further my education to increase my value. And if im lucky i could work at a great company in the tech or financial industry. I like this idea because i do believe in furthering my education and i have an interest in both of those fields, i like coding, i like math and i love reading about the markets. But I'm afraid I'll never be satisfied because I'll never feel like Im the kind of successful that i really want to be.  I'll probably always feel like that though. I want to pursue this path but its not as safe as the first option and I won't have all the benefits that come with joining a union. 

Sorry for the long post guys, thanks for the help in advance"

Take it or Leave it?,huntylterer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/id1lj2/first_real_job_offer_take_it_or_leave_it/,"TLDR: A good job offer from a good company, but at a bad location. The schedule should allow for me to continue my education while working. It’s not where I want to work forever, but would be a good place to get my foot in the door to this career.

I’m 22 and in school to become a power plant operator. I’m currently in my internship and they are going to offer me a full time position at the place I am interning. This will let me start work a semester earlier than the earliest the school allows. I will still be able to finish my degree.

The job market for power plants is a little right and it’s hard to get into a job without prior experience.

The location is 6 hours away from my closest relatives/girlfriend, but I should be able to go home once a month. I think this will be satisfactory for my standards. The company only offers jobs that are far away from my hometown. 

The pay will be better than anything I’ve seen and the company culture is good and the company has a future. The benefits are good.

My boss is very intelligent and I can learn a lot from him, but he lacks proper organization. He is a single man running this whole place and a lot of industry standard organizational things have been neglected here for administrative tasks. I’ll spend a lot of time reorganizing everything.

This is not the exact type of plant I want to work at. It’s the most simple design possible and I want to eventually learn all the complex systems involved at other styles of plants. This plant very rarely runs so I will not get real daily operational experience to know instinctively what to do when something goes wrong.

The schedule here is 7:00am-3:30pm and on call all the time which is great considering most power plants have rotating 12 hr shifts. This Provides time for me to do homework after work. I plant on completing a bachelors after I finish this degree so that would be super helpful as long as I’m not called in too much.

My thoughts now are to take it, get experience, finish school, and then find a new job. I hate to lie, so should I tell them when they give the job offer that I don’t plan on being here in 5 years?

The company only wants me to work here, so I don’t think I can get a job at another location within the company (which only come
Around rarely because people like the company and stay here a long time).

Let me know of any other questions you have.

Thanks in advance."
id24ep,1,2020-08-19,Should I drop my double major in engineering??,MisoShiroSoup,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/id24ep/should_i_drop_my_double_major_in_engineering/,"Hi! I'm a sophomore studying engineering, and last semester I declared a double major in aerospace and computer engineering because I really love both subjects. Most of my friends are in aero, and I met a lot of great profs there too. I feel like I fit the culture there really well especially compared with my school's computer engineering department. But this summer I realized that aero isn't a great fit coursework-wise (our school is more aviation oriented, I like space better), and due to COVID restricting some of the classes I can take this fall, I can no longer reasonably complete a double major in 4 years, so I'm starting to feel like I should drop aero.

I'm scared to drop either major though, because I feel like such a fraud. Most of my peers already know I'm double majoring and some of my profs have singled me out for it (positively) and I'm worried they'll think I was pretending to do it to look good and gain favor. I'm especially worried because I recorded the double major on some internship applications when I was still intending to do it, and I don't want to be seen as a liar by companies either.

Please help me?,onestepatatimeman,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/id2gd0/i_feel_like_the_reality_of_consequences_to_my/,"M23. Been a bang average student throughout my life. I'm Asian and so are my parents. Let me take you through the stages of my life. Please bear with me as your read this wall of text.

Why did I mention Asian? Well, Asian parents are notorious for expecting their children to perform well in school. Most Asian kids can tell you how they were screamed at, beaten or just scolded harshly for not getting good grades.

My family wasn't rich, but neither were we poor. We had everything we needed. Not everything we wanted but everything we needed. We lived comfortably.

Grade school and middle school. My grades always stuck around the B/C range. After each exam or test my parents would scold me, and explain the importance of studying well in school to me. I'd listen seriously, but go back to slacking a week later and having fun with friends.

I had a national standardized test in the 6th grade. Suddenly I had to buck up or I would end up going to a bad school for 7th grade. I somehow managed to get a better than average grade. Not excellent but better than average, and I got into a better than average school.

Till high school everything was the same. Had a lot of fun with friends, and grades were bang average. Again, I had a national standardized test in the sophomore year of high school. I honestly didn't study that well and wasted a lot of time watching TV and reading Harry Potter. I did excellent this time. I was the highest score in my entire state and my name went up on the school roll of honor. Consequences? I get to have my pick of subjects for the last 2 years of high school.

Junior and senior year. Bang average again. Actually, worse than average. I failed a lot of my exams in junior year. We had a final national standardized test as a senior. I somehow scraped through from failing every single subject to getting mostly As. I got a C in 2 subjects though. But hey, I was failing before this. Consequences? This score determines which college I went to. 

I went to a better than average college. I never had any backlogs but I always scraped through with the bare minimum. I didn't study for a single day in 4 years of college. I didn't learn as much as I should have, and did only the bare minimum. Didn't do a single internship or personal project. Consequences? Fucking hard to get a job with a piss poor college record.

I graduated and got into a shitty company that only expected the bare minimum. It was awful mindless corporate tech drone work. I hated it. But it still didn't hit me that I should improve.

I applied for grad school. I somehow got in. I got into a pretty good school with a pretty good program, with my average college grades and a piss poor record. I had my undergraduate thesis to show for it, which admittedly was pretty good, but I only typed the thing. My 2 buddies in my team did all the dirty work.

Grad school was supposed to be the new me. It would be hectic. I was going to study and become fantastic. Wrong.

I didn't study at all, and only tried to cram the night before. I did ok in my first semester. Got good grades. The same strategy didn't work for my second semester - I very nearly flunked. B and a C. GPA dropped from 3.8 to 3.3. I got an internship based on my first semester grades. And I still haven't put in any personal work to become better in my field!

See the pattern? I know the consequences of not working hard and performing poorly each time. I get kicks up the butt. But I still let the lazy bastard in me take over. I've been somehow barely avoiding miserable failure all my life.

I want to be hardworking. I can't sit for 10 fucking minutes to study something. I always get the big picture and manage to bullshit some answer from there since college till now.

I know I can't build a great work ethic right away in day one. That it takes consistent work. But I just fucking can't.

Please help me. I can't keep going like this. One way or the other this will come back to bite me in the ass and I'll pay for it dearly. Please help me."

I worked in industry for 2 years with not much experience in any language I was constantly shifted between languages and technologies. I took a brake for few months to think about where to go next. Now I got 2 job opportunities, one is junior andriod dev and one is intern react dev and I  am not sure what to take, let me give you some insights:

  
Personal:  
Even tho I have some experience I feel like I don't know much about coding and need to learn more, I haven't completed any business project and I see I am missing a lot of basic knowledge because I mostly worked alone without code reviews and mentors.  


Android job:  
\-It is very close to my place of living, with bus 10 minutes

\-Internal application for car company, so probably less stress?

React job:

\-Internship, so it will be more easier to catch up and not expected much of me?

\-It is remote and I like more to be close to person who can help me and not wait for meetings 

\-More clients

&amp;#x200B;

Which should I take? I am more keen towards frontend but andriod job is close to me as well, I got maybe 2/10 java skill and 3/10 js+html+css skill. How hard is to catch up on both of technologies? Which is better for beginner and maybe less stressful?"

Talked to my old colleagues about how I hate my new job and they tell my previous CTO and he called me up yesterday and give an offer letter for a contract employment(3 months) and will renew the contract if everything is fine. Besides that I did have an interview with another company last week and they offered me too.

I'll just put it as my internship company A and the other company that gave me an Offer as Company B

Company A
Pros: I love the environment and everything, I know the tech stack from top to bottom.
Cons : Contract, I may or may not be jobless 3 months from now.

Company B
Pros: The CTO is a wellknown person and his track record is great in training young talents, I prefer the product that they are building(e-commerce), full time instead of contract.
Cons: The expectation is quite high as I have to juggle both fullstack web development with a spice of AI here and there.

I used to have all the answers but this year have been rough and I am totally lost right now as I have to make a decision tomorrow."
idb8xe,0,2020-08-20,Have I picked the wrong field?,afemaledell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/idb8xe/have_i_picked_the_wrong_field/,"Three years ago I couldn’t even tell you what RAM is and now I just recently graduated with a degree in computer science. I never really thought I’d ever want to do anything with coding since in HS I hated looking at code, but then I had one professor in uni that was amazing and she made me fall in love with coding. I’m concerned though that I may have picked the wrong career now that I’m in a full-time job and that the spree of enjoyment I had with coding was just some fluke. Especially since most people I met in Uni and work have been working with computers all their lives and are huge computer nerds, (in a good way!), and I felt like I didn’t relate to that level of excitement.

I did two internships and research throughout uni and definitely didn’t hate them, though my last one at a big company I started to experience kind of what I’m having now. I don’t want to say where I work but it’s gov’t work and it’s as you can imagine really slow. But more than anything I just feel totally overwhelmed and don’t even feel like I’m at a computer science job. I haven’t gotten any tasks relating to coding and the more I learn the more it seems like most of the coding is outsourced and my job will be to test and integrate. My boss even said I’d be lucky to find a team where I do even 20% coding.

I’m stressed every day and feel like I’m going to be sick feeling that I locked myself in a career where I won't ever be happy. I thought careers in CS would be more like school where you are coding and building shit. I feel like I’m wasting the companies time since I’m totally just faking it. And not just imposter syndrome like I literally don’t know what the hell is going on and I’ve been here for a couple months and just waiting for the day that it all comes crashing down on me. I’m sure someone will say to ask questions and believe me I have, but at a certain point I don’t know how to say “I have literally no idea what the hell is going on” professionally. Covid is certainly not helping since I’m not actually with them in person and usually that’s how I learn – by observing other people.

Is this really what most CS careers are like? I wanted to actually be coding new things and learning new software engineering practices, not just setting up VMs and uploading binaries. I certainly don’t want to sound ungrateful for having a job during covid since I know friends that are struggling to find anything, but I also don’t want to lock myself down a path that isn’t for me. Like I enjoy coding and code apps in my free time and love learning about computer science and programming in general. But I’m just concerned that I’m never going to find a job that entails that anytime soon and wondering if I should think about pivoting if most CS jobs are not actually coding. I also don’t know how bad it would be for me to a quit a job this early if I do indeed try and find a separate CS job since I’ve never really quit a job before. 

I really don’t have much of a network IRL to get advice from, and most would probably just say I’m bitching and tell me how I graduated with a high GPA and that I should stop complaining. Me having a high GPA is not a humble brag, I do not believe GPA means shit, especially when I feel like I am struggling to recall stuff from my CS classes and I know extremely smart people and realize how I’m not even close to their level – my GPA is literally just that, a number."

I have an excellent resume with over 6 years of combined work experience in the industry and other larger side jobs. An example of the side jobs are IT consulting and Virtual Education Video Specialist. I'll be graduating this May and my current manager is going to have a meeting with me discussing salary. I'm in a unique position were I would be filling in for 2 people who are retiring when I would start full time. They also are very interested in me as I am geographically located where they need it. There's only one large issue, I absolutely cannot stand where I am located. My title is engineering system administrator and HPC AI benchmark engineer. I currently make $52,000/yr as an intern so I think a good range to ask for would be 80-90K depending on the benefits. Is this a fair range? In all honesty though I think I would need 120K or more to stay as the winters here are so damaging on my mental health.

Long story short, two years ago I had an interview with the head engineer at a local company, referred by a family friend. Unfortunately, even though the engineer had told me he wanted on board the owner at the time did not want an intern (my friends dads words not mine). Fast forward to two weeks ago. I reach out to the engineer again and set up an interview discussion, which was this Monday. He again told me he was impressed with my communication skills and wants me on board. Even going so far to ask when I can come in and figuring out how I can learn the software they use for design and telling me to study up on metal properties for manufacturing. I sent a thank you email later that day, and tried to call yesterday however was only able to leave a message. I once again thanked him for the discussion we had and asked if there was any update on the position. 

During my interview he had said that he would have to talk to HR and the *new* CEO of the company, but sounded optimistic on the phone.

It's been over a day now with no phone call back... am I just impatient or is this a sign that I didn't get the spot??"

No career growth, horrible management, all that and I knew I loved programming. I joined a boot camp and have been making personal projects nonstop.

I turned down an analyst role at a large tech firm like an idiot so don't turn down a job bc it's not in the industry you want. However if I had to give one tip, it's to KEEP learning and be ready when the opportunity arises.

I learned react at my school, and I used it primarily until I worked on an angular project with someone I was teaching remotely for. I spent 4 months learning angular, graphql, Apollo, aws amplify until covid basically killed the project. Following this I felt like I wasted 4 months on a private repo, and immediately started working on a react native project.

Last week I'm contacted about an angular position, intern, that they are hoping to become full time. I realized if I hadn't done that angular project I would not have heard about the opportunity. A project I thought was a ""waste of time"" in terms of building my portfolio helped me land my first dev job. I'm so happy and grateful to this community, I learned a lot listening to and arguing with you guys! Best of luck to everyone in the job search"
iddm1o,12,2020-08-20,Cybersecurity Exposure/Experience,TheBlackwater_,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/iddm1o/cybersecurity_exposureexperience/,"Hey folks,

I am a little more than half way through the program. I really enjoy software development and coding and would have not problem pursuing a career in this, but I think my passion really lies in security. 

I'm just wondering what the best steps are to get my foot in the door in this field. My current thinking as of right now is that I need to have a similar strategy to pursuing a SWE career which to me would entail:
-Work on side projects (cybersecurity related)
-Look for cybersecurity internships
-Obtain certifications such as Network+, Security+ etc
-Participating in competitions/events such as Capture The Flag


I am having a little trouble trying to figure out good security related side projects.
I am also lucky to live in a city which has several massive national security corporations such as Raytheon, FLIR, Northrop Grumman etc, but these all require a top secret government clearance to even apply, which I don't see myself getting anytime soon.
There certainly does appear to be much less opportunity for a security related position vs. SWE type positions just based on career listings for my particular area and I'm sure this is a common theme which I acknowledge. This seems like a big city type career. 

Sorry if my thoughts appear jumbled. I would appreciate any feedback, thoughts and opinions on this matter from other prospective security students/current professionals. 

Thank you."

We ran into a number of systems that have an extremely old version of Adobe Reader, like half a decade old! Naturally we're all looking around and thinking ""How the HELL did that get installed?!"". ::spidermandoubleidentitymeme.png::

We're digging through Windows event logs, (surprisingly helpful this time!) executable process trace logs, deployment logs, you name it!

And then we find it! The culprit? &gt;!AcroRdrDC1500720033\_en\_US.exe! !&lt;

But where the hell did it come from?! One doesn't download 5 year old software for a user, let alone multiple without remembering it! And this isn't Busch League, we don't have everyone as a local admin. At this point all signs point to our patch management system, so I'm elected (voluntold?) to open a support case with the vendor to get an answer to the age old question of **WTF?!.**

I just can't believe it though. This is a high quality, Gartner Magic Quadrant level, solution. It can't be the patching system, I thought.

And I was right! It isn't! I did what any good sysadmin does, I dug deeper! I went and downloaded the latest and greatest Adobe Reader DC enterprise offline installer myself and tore it apart. (Not exactly hard thankfully, it's just a self-extracting ZIP file that auto launches the actual installer. Thanks 7ZIP!).

Inside? Inside was the steaming pile of excrement that is the ACTUAL install files.

[Self Extracting Zip Contents](https://i.imgur.com/D9AA2p6.png)

Look at that AcroRead.msi modified date! Look at it!

Turns out the installer was bombing out part of the way through the process and as such the update MSP which is LARGER THAN THE BASE INSTALL wasn't applied.

COME ON, Adobe! You're a multi-billion, BILLION with a B, dollar international organization with over 22,000 employees! Get an intern to update the damn install package once a year!"

My university has been moved online this fall and I have plans to finish my third and final co-op rotation in the spring. My co-op is in devops, but I really want experience in software engineering or data science.

You all say you have to apply to a bunch of places to get an internship. I don’t really want to do that right now.

With a year of co-op and 0 expenses because I lived at home (thanks covid), I don’t absolutely need the money from an internship.

I could also get an internship summer 2022, since I will still be in school (thanks co-op). Should I just try for a smaller, local company instead of big tech companies? Orrrr I could take classes and maybe move graduation up, so I graduate a semester late instead of a year late.

What should I study to pursue exploring this question? Preferably with industry options if I end up having a family or something. I've considered a few things:

- bioinformatics (not so much anymore...)

- neuroscience, potentially doing research with psychedelics to aid in our understanding of the emergent nature of the mind

- brain-interface careers

[LONG],gdubbaya,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/idmvxx/all_my_spoons_are_full_long/,"I am so emotionally spent, and it's one of the worst times for me to be feeling this absolutely drained on life and overcome by information overload. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a transfer student who got into my number one choice school, and I know one of the major reasons I got in was my long list of volunteering and internships with nonprofits and charity organizations, and my personal essays wherein I poured out my sincere desire to dedicate my life to social equity and justice. I meant every word, and I have for years felt a deep need to help others, and I part of doing that is be always remaining informed about what's going on in my community, in my country, and in the international community as well; and that's the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

As COVID started to have its effects on America and millions of people lost their jobs, I went through wave after wave of emotions that lasted for days on end - rage, fear, worry, melancholy - at what was happening to the people around me. I was fortunate enough to be financially secure (essential worker), but my heart broke as each day I was met with more stories of hardship and avoidable death, and I felt a deep sense of what I can only describe as survivors remorse. I couldn't go on social media, it was too hard. Then George Floyd was murdered, and I watched the video (I broke down and couldn't watch all the way through) and the protests, riots, lock downs, and arguments dug into me even more. Then, suddenly every day it felt like news agencies specifically sought to share stories of innocent black people losing their lives (I'm black), and as I learned about more and more *and more* cases, I felt increasingly more depressed and less valued in my society. In my world. And having to endure arguments with people who dismissed the subject of systematic racism was just tiresome and unbelievable; and for the first time in my life, social justice, being politically informed, and being an active member of my communities seemed *exhausting*. I needed a break from being *so* informed, and so for the first time in years I stopped learning about what's going on in the world around me and would shut down conversations people wanted to have with me about current affairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now, school is going to go back into session soon, and my major involves being politically literate and informed, but I just *can't*. I read headlines about petty politicians and political theater and I cannot work myself up enough to just read the damn articles or do the research. I just don't want to know; but then I also don't like not knowing what's going on in the world around me. I just started learning more about the Breonna Taylor situation, and I trudge through it because I feel like it's important to know to remain informed, but *shit* it's depressing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the Eden the Doll situation happened, and I just watched those videos too and broke down for an hour. I will never, ever understand the psychology of people who can watch others being hurt and not feel absolutely overcome with the need to help, but rather, feel empowered. I'm just not made that way.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, headlines like these, stories like these, fire me up. They give me motivation to strive to help those weaker, less privileged, or less informed than me so I can use my knowledge to help them. It reminds me to keep going, to keep striving to make the world a better place so that these stories and headlines become fewer and far between - but right now, I just *can't.*

&amp;#x200B;

My spoons are full, and I feel so utterly ashamed. I feel like I've stumbled and can't get back up. Like I'm giving up on the communities I swore to dedicate my life to protecting and empowering, and leaving my journey before even really getting onto the path - and I just feel so guilty and lost. This is a huge part of my identity, but I just need to tap out of the ring right now, and I'm scared if maybe the thing I thought I should dedicate my life to is a bad idea if this is who I'm going to be now, or if I'll have months like this where I'm just totally useless and drained on information overload and emotional exhaustion."

Is it worth pursuing a Masters now if I can't find a job in my desired industry?,Zzqnm,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/idqci2/graduated_with_a_bs_in_biomedical_engineering_is/,"I graduated this past spring with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech and have since been searching for engineering positions with medical device companies. Despite sending out hundreds of applications and having a small number of interviews over the past 6 months, I haven't been able to land anything. My initial plan was to enter industry with the intention of eventually getting my Masters once I had a bit more practical experience to guide me, especially if a company was willing to pay for it, but now I'm less sure what to do. I'm growing frustrated, especially since all of my friends in other engineering majors have already started their careers with no trouble. Most of my BME classmates have been able to find jobs, but very few of them are doing actual engineering afaik.


So a few questions:

- Given the state of things, would getting my Masters now help my career prospects? I think it would, but I'm unsure if the price + opportunity cost is too high and if I should just keep applying as the economy straightens back out.

- How feasible is switching engineering disciplines with a Masters? I see a lot of potential with electrical engineering or computer science (within medical devices or outside of it), but I'm worried I don't know enough about either discipline to make a strong decision and don't have the work experience to back it up.

- Lastly, is Quality Engineering as bad as everybody says it is? I have an interview coming up for a QE job, and I would almost certainly take it. I'd like to at least try it and figure I could leverage the 1 or 2 years of experience for a different job if I don't.

Sorry this was so long, and thanks in advance! I appreciate any help!

Quick background:

B.S. Biomedical Engineering, 4.0 Total GPA
Summer internships doing design (not in a regulated industry, though) and in a wet lab.
My family can support me financially as long as I need, so thankfully there's no rush, but I already have some debt from undergrad and would have to take on more.

 I did a internship as one of my modules last year and I was introduced to Automated Testing. I really enjoyed it initially, I learned a new language and skills that have given me a good insight into software testing. I was asked back by the company for the summer and I have started to feel a degree of monotony now when I work. I enjoy the company and I have a great manager, its just the work doesn't interest me now after the 5ish months I've been doing it. 

We also have a issue of certain task being cancelled due to Covid and as a result I have had a few days where I had no work to do. 

I'm not sure should I bring this up to my boss? I feel that I may not get the response I want. They have said that they would love to have me back when I'm done college. But I really want to do development. Should I just wait till I get my degree and apply to a different company to do development. What do you guys suggest?

Now that my internship is over, I've been thinking more about the idea of tackling misinformation by enabling the community to upvote/downvote the content of a website.

Sure there's plenty wrong with the idea in terms of credibility, but in essence, the idea is simple: **can we leverage our voices to fight misinformation with a simple click of a button?**

iduqyc,0,2020-08-21,Looking for some advice,pmfka,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iduqyc/looking_for_some_advice/,"Hey guys,

A little bit about my journey: I began web development in September 2019, but I was always interested in it, even as a young boy. I had worked with HTML and CSS in the past, which is why I wanted to try something new: JavaScript. I began studying the basics and then started with my first framework, ReactJS. Quickly I realized, building a website is more than only the front-end. I learned NodeJS and ExpressJS, while taking first steps into MongoDB. Mobile development started looking quite attractive to me, which is why I tried my luck with React Native. I am eager to continue learning, but at the moment I want to focus on really using what I've learned until now, before I continue my learning journey.

I will be beginning my Bachelor degree in Computer Science at the University of Zürich in September 2020, which I am very excited for. Learning to ""code"" in a academic setting is hopefully as exciting as doing it as a self-taught developer.

As of now, I am working in the testing team at a software company, it pays quite decently. I started there in February 2020, in the beginning it was kind of interesting but now I'm not as motivated as I was in the beginning. I usually wait for the work days to go past so that I can come home and work on my side projects.

Now to my question: Should I take the jump into an internship / Junior Dev role or wait it out and develop my skills at my own pace until I feel more ready for working as a Dev? I've had some interviews in the past months, but I always fail at the coding challenges / technical interview. I feel so overwhelmed in this situation, which makes me forget even basic things which I've done hundreds of times already. Do you guys have any tips for me, how I can overcome this fear of coding challenges / interviews and be better prepared for a role as a software developer?"

Not a native speaker here, but I will try my best to explain exactly what happened.  


At the start of 2020, I went, as a student, to Manchester, UK, thanks to my internship managed by my university. Due to the Corona outbreak, I had to return back to my country (Czech republic). So I booked a fligh at the EasyJet, which was then cancelled. I got home by a state bus, but that's not the point here.  
I was for a few months now variously trying to get my money back, going trought their kind of confusing website, but without any resonable answer.  
Few days ago, I filled up some kind of a compensation claim, and today, I got this answer:   


 

**EU261 Compensation Claim Assessment**

**Claim decision: Declined**

**Decision summary**: We are sorry that your flight was cancelled. Our assessment and legal team has carefully reviewed your claim and the circumstances around your flight and have confirmed that your compensation claim is not eligible for compensation payment under EU Regulation EU261/2004. Please note that this may not match with the information you were given on the day of travel, as our staff in airports, and on-board, may not have had all the information concerning your cancelled flight.

Dear Customer,

We are sorry for the disruption to your flight. Our assessment and legal team have carefully reviewed your claim, including the circumstances around your flight and have confirmed that your compensation claim is not eligible for compensation payment under EU Regulation EC261/2004. Please note that this may not match with the information you were given on the day of travel, as our staff in airports, and on-board, may not have had all the information concerning your cancelled flight.

**Our assessment of your claim:**

To further explain what happened; health and travel restrictions imposed to mitigate the spread of the Covid-19 virus, severely affected easyJet’s flying programme. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to widespread and varied travel restrictions imposed by local governments throughout Europe. This significantly impacted our programme along with other airlines and we had no option but to cancel your flight. We do take reasonable measures to avoid delays and cancellations to our flights by having replacement crews and spare aircraft available in our network. However, in view of these widespread and varied travel restrictions imposed by local Governments, there were no measures we could have taken to operate your flight.

**EU261 Regulation**

When we have to disrupt a flight due to circumstances outside of our control, the flight is classified under EU regulation 261/2004 as being affected by “extraordinary circumstances”. An example of disruption outside of our control would be that primarily caused by air traffic control restrictions, industrial action, severe weather conditions or a runway closure.

EU261 compensation is only payable when a flight is delayed by 3 or more hours after the scheduled arrival time, or the flight is cancelled, and the reason for the delay or cancellation was within our control. This type of disruption is classified as “non-extraordinary circumstances” in the EU Regulation. Examples of this include most aircraft technical faults or when we haven’t taken reasonable measures to prevent or minimise disruption. A copy of the regulation can be found at [http://eur-lex.europa.eu](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/)

**Expenses**

Even if your compensation claim has been declined, you may be eligible for reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred as result of the disruption. If you have not already done so, you may submit an expenses claim on our website at [**https://www.easyjet.com/en/help/boarding-and-flying/delays-and-cancellations**](https://www.easyjet.com/en/help/boarding-and-flying/delays-and-cancellations)**.**

Please read this carefully before submitting a claim as this explains how we assess expenses. The only way to make a claim is via our expenses webform, we are unable to process claims submitted by email or over the phone.

We hope this letter clearly explains why your flight was disrupted. Our assessment team have thoroughly investigated all the available information and this is the decision we have arrived at.

Our Customer Services team will not be able to access any more information than we’ve provided here. Please read our “Who is entitled to compensation” section on the following link which will hopefully answer any further questions you may have.

[**https://www.easyjet.com/en/help/boarding-and-flying/delays-and-cancellations**](https://www.easyjet.com/en/help/boarding-and-flying/delays-and-cancellations)

Once again we are sorry for the disruption to your flight and hope to welcome you on board again soon.

Kind regards,

**easyJet Customer Services**  


  
I was, first, trying to find something myself about the whole eu261 thing, but as I am not that skilled when it comes to English language and law as a whole, I am now lost and would be really glad if someone more familiar with this could help me.

I have diverse profile with a background in dentistry back in my home country but I have a passion for coding and thus started learning web development and thought of changing my career and I am trying to do that.

I completed my web dev bootcamp over a year ago. Since then I am applying and working on my projects. I have got few interviews and have reached the 4th stage in some but always miss by a small margin to land my first entry level job.

My projects are built on JavaScript, Html, CSS, React, React360, Nodejs, MongoDB etc...

I have my portfolio website which also has my projects.

I apply to 100s of places every week, including entry and intermediate level positions, Internships but yet to get an offer and get very low response. I don't consider my self an expert or anything, but I think I am ok to land an internship and learn from there.

All my interviews I have got feedback that I just barely didn't make it ( maybe just a consolation thing ) but still I made it to 3rd or 4th stage in some. They all demanded me to be quite pro-efficient in algorithms which I am good at not great at, but is it a must have for entry level positions or internships ?

What I am missing out?  
is it the algorithms and problem solving ?  
Is it ok for me to get a IT Support desk certification and Job or a QA job meanwhile to get the foot in the door and then hope that my skills are recognized ?

What should I do ?

Thanks in advance."

I am a cs major student doing engineering in the 3rd year of a 4-year program. Let me tell you the core skills I know so far, A) Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) in which AWS is what I know best among 3, for example, from web hosting to server migration. B) Python: general programming, web scrapping, pulling data from API, talking to the database using py codes, etc. Currently learning Django C) a little knowledge of web development (i don’t know anything about javascript so don’t quote me to learn that, as I found that I take more time to learn this).

I am very confused about which way to lead forward. The thing that makes me more confused is that I have spoken to two different companies for an internship, and both looking for someone who knows javascript as first.

There's a great demand for javascript devs. in my area/state, and I can hardly find any internship regarding python or cloud, they are almost nil. The jobs which prefer python are all senior devs with experience and the same for AWS. I currently can not move to a different place as I still have 2 years of college remaining. I am thinking to appear for AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02)  Exam (but still I am confused to take the exam or not).

Should I consider freelancing or anything else?

So am I learning the wrong way ??

I hope my question makes sense.

-	Working on my CS degree (have about 6 classes left with 2 being ones I’m currently enrolled in, each being 8 weeks long) and nearing completion.
-	I’m my CS degree (BS) I have mostly worked with Java, Python, and MySQL with some C++ thrown in here and there.
-	I worked for Apple for a month but left since I had a better opportunity with the gym and got tired of retail.
-	In my own time I played around with markup like HTML CSS and iOS development.

I have since I’ve graduated been working as a gym membership salesman, manager (until my position was dissolved), and service (cleaning, etc) member in the gym (1 year 8 months). I planned on sticking with this until I had more projects lined up and maybe done some time in an internship. But recently I’ve had to leave my job (not fired, personal and professional reasons) with my last day being 8/21. I have some work lined up (part time) and should be good with my parents support on the mean time. 

That said, I also figure that this could be a good time for me to actually start doing something more relevant to my ambitions. 


My end goal: I’d like to eventually develop software on my own and/or manage a team/business. Specifically I’m interested in computer vision, fitness games/software (like WiiFit and iOS trackers) with eventually working on software that gyms could use for classes or developing smart equipment, and CRM. I could also see maybe operating a contract business one day. 

Right now I’m mostly applying for IT jobs and one particular opportunity I have (job through parents work) may give me some at least not retail related experience along side some references for CS and/or IT albeit in the education sector. 

What can I do now to work towards my end goal?

For the past 1-2 years, I've been thinking about returning to school for a degree in CS (I'm 28 right now and I have a Master's in Chemistry with some academic programming experience in a research setting). With COVID going on, I figured I would spend my summer off beginning to take classes online, since in-person classes aren't an option for anyone at the moment. I just finished taking Intro to CS in C++, Discrete Math, and Linear Algebra online at a community college in the US. The Fall semester is about to start up next week, and I am taking C++ Data Structures and Computer Architecture + Organization. In the Spring, I will take a course in Algorithms and possibly an intro course in Machine Learning. I am succeeding so far, and I'm enjoying the coursework. I've completed two hobby projects on the side, showcasing different types of skills I've picked up so far (one related to another hobby of mine, and one related to teaching chemistry to high school students).

&amp;#x200B;

My short-term goal is to get admitted to a MS program in CS for Fall 2021 (I've been looking at Georgia Tech's online MSCS program in particular, due to its rigor and price point). Another short-term goal of mine is to land an internship next summer, so I can get some hands-on experience. I live in the NYC area, so I am hoping that I will be able to find a something relatively quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions:

1) What technologies and skills should I be picking up on my spare time? I am most comfortable writing code in C++, but I also have some previous Python experience from my Master's in Chemistry.

2) When is the best time to apply for internships for Summer 2021? I've read that I should be comfortable with material in DS+A for tech interviews, but I won't have both of these courses completed until the end of Spring 2021. Again, I work full-time as a high school teacher, so the internship needs to be during the summer.

3) How should I structure my resume in the best way possible to stand out to hiring managers? I obviously don't have any industry experience, so when I apply for an internship, I'm just going to have some coursework and side projects to show.

4) If you are currently a SWE, what would you do differently in preparing for a career in industry?

I am a 35 year old career changer in the Chicago-land area. With absolutely no background in CS, I taught myself enough Java to return to the college and got accepted into the MS program for computer science.

I'm in my final few months of grad school, I've completed all my coursework.  All that I have left to do before I graduate is to complete my MS project.  I work full time and as a result, I haven't been able to do all the things I wish I could've have done to make myself more appealing to employers.

 I did really well in my classes (3.72 GPA) and I am very comfortable with Java, but I've only had brief introductions to other languages (Python, PHP). Unfortunately, internships are not an option to me, as I am the primary income-earner of our household and would not be able to leave my job for an unpaid or temporary position.  I have very little experience with GitHub and I don't really have to show for in the form of a portfolio.

I am at a point where I've invested so much time (3 years) in earning this degree, and I don't feel like I am anywhere close to having a shot at getting a job. I'm worried that even after I graduate, I'll have to put in several more months/years of time to get certifications/develop a portfolio, in order to make up for my lack of experience/internship history.

Am I being too pessimistic? Do I have any real shot of getting a job when a graduate, or do I still have lots of work ahead of me?

TL;DR

Career-changer graduating with MS degree and no previous experience.  Will it be impossible for me to get a job?"

iebb4w,8,2020-08-21,"If you are looking to learn React, Avoid Maximilian Schwarzmuller's course on Udemy!",fuckyallmat,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/iebb4w/if_you_are_looking_to_learn_react_avoid/,"I bought Maximilian Schwarzmuller's course on Udemy so you dont have to!

Background - I started learning web dev back in June last year and landed my first two jobs this summer at tech companies in the United States(One in San Diego and another one in Missouri) Back in the day I used to learn from horrible resources which just wasted my time. But that is why I dont want to waste yours. I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript from Colt Steele's bootcamp on Udemy and it was wonderful. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JS(ES6 too) and GSAP and this summer I decided I have to step up my game and learn react. So I bought Maximilian's course because I did not know Colt had a course out yet, but few weeks later I found colt's course and bought it too. Now since I landed my internship in May, I did not get my time to follow up with react and although I started both Colt's and Maximilian's course I had to give up. I was also teaching javascript to a few newbies which did not give me enough time. My internship ended earlier this month and I decided that I will start with Maximilian's course and once I am done I will begin with Colt's Course.

Now, I am not affiliated with Colt Steele in any shape or form and this post is obviously not sponsored by him. So, I started Maximilian's course. It has a 4.6 rating on udemy, but the course flow is downright horrible. For example in the styling section he teaches two obsolete methods/wrong ways of styling(using inline radium and styled components before showing the actual one - styled modules).Most of the times, he makes some changes to the code in a section, now in the next section he starts with the previous code from two sections back and the only way to start again is to download resources from two sections back and then start again! It is like playing russian roulette with this course, you never know what is next and the way to go about it is probably make multiple copies of your original folder probably. The friction in this course is too much and it will be just overwhelming for a newbie to start!

For example, at one point he asks us to run this command 'npm run eject' so that we can configure our webpack for style modules, but then quickly if you follow his way you end up with countless errors and the configuration doesn't work. You go to the question's section and see lots of other students facing the same problem and the only solution the teaching assistant offers is to ""DOWNLOAD"" Maximilian's course and start working from there. I am not sure what you are supposed to learn if you continue doing things this way.

The court starts in a very good way and I think Maximilian does a decent job of explaining things, but the course structure and flow and his method of teaching is downright horrible. This course lacks proper organization! I have taken a dozen of courses on web development on Udemy so far, but this is the first one to really disappoint me.

It is a pain in the ass to finish this course, but obviously I always finish things that I start and no matter how much time and patience it takes I will finish this before moving to Colt's react course. But if you are new and probably looking to learn react online please avoid this course for the sake of your own mental sanity.

One of the fair criticism that I got from a student's review was this -""For me, this is a really poor format for learning the source material. Too many five minute videos to communicate something that is two short code snippets and four bullet points.

\- Hours of just watching someone write undocumented code?

\- Poor structure, not setting context before communicating something, stream of consciousness that borders on meandering.

\- X number of seconds to watch code being entered, then immediately flip to another section of code, so you have to pause and back up the video to actually see the code that was written.

\- Too many sidelines into ""you can do it this way or you can do it this way"" before getting to the conclusion of why and when you should do things a particular way. The value of having an expert instructor lies in that advice, and there's just too much video to wade through to find those nuggets. ""

If you are someone who has tried this course, please let me know your experiences with this course. I may be wrong and open to criticism.Thanks!"

ieduoa,4,2020-08-22,Coding Challenge Concerns,justcejai,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ieduoa/coding_challenge_concerns/,"Hello all,

A quick background of me. I am second semester junior who transferred from community college after completing my sophomore year. My university splits our into Java classes into 2, so I took part 1 in the spring 2020, and part 2 in the summer. This fall I am registered to take Data Structure and Algo, Database Design and Implementation, Logic and Algo, and Stats.

As you all know, it’s time to start applying for internships. So far I’ve applied to 57. I’ve received the coding challenge for 4 so far (google, citadel, Goldman Sachs, and blackrock). Blackrock is the only one that I’ve started so far and I only completed the first question so far. Deep down I don’t feel like I’m prepared for this just yet. I didn’t do any LC (I know, stupid) or anything. What’s happens if I don’t do as well? I feel like I’m lacking behind because some applications say that classes like Data structures would be helpful. Is there a chance to still score an actual interview even if my code isn’t perfect? Should I tell them that I am taking the class this fall? 

Side note: just a super stressed college kid is all and looking to my peers for advice."

I've been working for the same company since I finished college 5 years ago. I joined the company as employee no 2, just after founders, CEO, and CTO. In the last 5 years company grew in revenue (15x) and user and I was promised shares, bonuses number of times but that never happened because of legal issues and recently COVID-19. Coronavirus struck hard on the travel tech industry and our already low wages were reduced even more. We are located in eastern Europe and software engineering wages are very low over here. Currently, I'm earning around 15000$ per year. I am the most senior person in our dev team and I have the most responsibility so I manage team, communicate with the support guys, resolve really serious bugs and develop most complex features, completely on my own in most cases. CEO is always trying to motivate us even more but the truth is that I'm listening to the same stories for the last 5 years. 

And I decided It's time to leave. 

The problem is that now there is a lot of talk about investment and the funding that we will have to take. That won't happen fast, at least not for another year but it should turn things around and we will employ even more developers and salespeople and we should be fine. I'm very tired of it all but on the other hand, It would be a shame to throw away the last 5 years just because I'm unhappy and underpaid at the moment. 

In the last 5 years, I was mostly working on the backend, also single-handedly developed our Android app, and eventually took over the entire frontend of the SPA and rewrote it to React. Also, I was a mentor to several interns, younger developers, and also I've been recruiting new developers and holding job interviews. I mainly do PHP, JS (react), and GO but I'm good at any OOP language (Java, C#) and Python. I really know my shit and I will solve any problem you throw at me.

I'm negotiating with other companies in my country, mostly for senior developer roles and nothing seems like a good option for me. Rather it's the boring jobs, or low paid or mostly frontend developer roles. And besides that companies that I really like are using different tech stack (node, .net..). I feel like I've hit a dead-end here and that's the reason I'm writing this. 

I don't know If I should join some other startup, software development agency, enterprise, or start something of my own like agency. The ideal case would be remote working for some foreign startup but I' don't know where to start. Also the question is, is it wise to leave my current job at this moment of a global pandemic?

What's your take on this situation?"
iejps1,8,2020-08-22,Extending internship part time for 20 hours a week during 18 credits semester. Bad idea?,throwawaymail21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iejps1/extending_internship_part_time_for_20_hours_a/,"I'm in software engineering and I have an 18 credit semester ahead, (6 classes in total).

I have been offered to extend my internship part time this semester (20 hrs / week). Can I accept the offer and still expect to do decent in this (online) semester? I would also be working from home. 

Pros:

- I had a really great experience working there so far with a supportive team &amp; manager
- I would be able to stash the money I made this summer and only use money from this semester to pay for my expenses (I live at home, so it's really more about buying stuff I like and not feel bad about it for e.g. clothes, gym membership, public transport pass) 
- This semester is online and so is my internship, so I think its a good opportunity to try it out
- I already don't go out that much since covid so I am not worried about my social life (except gym) 

Cons:

- This is the first time I am taking an 18 credits semester and I have no idea how the workload is 
- I never worked part time during a school semester so I'm afraid I might not manage my time properly
- I don't know if I will be able to stop my contract in case I burn out (finals, midterms, mental health etc.) without severely affecting my chances of maybe coming back next summer in case I don't get another internship 
- If I fail/drop a course, chances are I will have to delay my graduation by at least a year

If anyone has experience with this, let me know thanks."
ieka7w,4,2020-08-22,[Rant] The education system is starting to fall apart - and its not (entirely) the teachers fault,HagoromoChalk2000,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ieka7w/rant_the_education_system_is_starting_to_fall/,"*As usually with those things - whats about to follow is based on my own experiences. Im aware of the limitations which arise from that fact, and i would like you to read this piece without feeling offended or spoken about. you are free to share your own opinion though - would greatly appreciate that.*

&amp;#x200B;

Some background information: I've been wondering around the teaching profession as a tutor, as an intern, as a sub, as a student teacher and actual teacher for collectively 10 years now. I also spent alot of my time every week helping out in an after school program for kids to come to and receive additional help on school related stuff ( be it homework, stuff they didnt understand in lessons, or test preparation). I originally decided to become a teacher because i wanted to make a difference for those kids, that - through no fault of their own - had a rough time because some incompetent fool decided to mess with them.

What i want to share with you in the following lines are some experiences and observations i've made over the years, and give my opinion on the situation.

Lets start with the students. As teachers, its apparently our job to hammer knowledge into the skulls of those kids. I spent about 7 years of training myself up to handle that job. 7 years of gaining the knowledge necessary to provide the best education possible to students. And i also spent 7 years of receiving warnings about becoming a teacher. You know why? All of those people's warnings had something in common: the students. Now, after collecting my own experiences, i came to the following conclusion: The students are a major part of why education, as its currently going, will eventually lead to some catastrophic failures. The lack of appreciation for the teachers work, the immense determinism to make the teachers live absolutely miserable astounds me to no end. Instead of valuing the chance they have at getting a proper education, they decide to treat it like a chore their mother forced on them.

Speaking of mothers, lets talk about parents: I would really appreciate it so much, if people would stop treating teaching like its easy. Parents have the audacity to behave like everything is the fault of the teacher, when its clearly not. Just to give an example: i recently had a mother complain to me that her son could not follow the topic of the lesson, and that i somehow had neglected to give him special attention to help him understand it. What really bugged me about this wasnt the fact, that she wanted her kid to have special attention - thats fine. What bugged me was the fact, that i specifically explained to him what he had to do 3 times, and he blatantly refused to do any work.

Atleast in my experience, parents have delegated alot of their responsibilities to other people. School shall take care of their education, and best also teach the kids some manners and proper behaviours to comply with social norms. Hell, i had some neighbors pay a complete stranger to take their kid outside and play with him. The thing is, problems in school start as problems in kindergarten. And how do problems in kindergarten start? As problems at home. Because parents dont do their jobs. The failure of a parent in his/her job to educate their children is essentially just passed up the education system.

Which, by the way, doesnt do a great job either. We have rising numbers of special ed cases and just students with a general learning or behavior disorder, and whats the response of the education system? make stuff easier. I do alot of finals prep in mathematics, which is why i spent alot of time going through old published exams. Just comparing Exams of 2000 with 2019/2020, which is a span of 20 years, reveals a decline in difficulty i never found to be believable. Standards get shortened, and the  administered tests get a hell of a lot easier.

Why is stuff getting easier a problem? Because it no longer forces students to actually do any hard work to get a good grade in a test. Most people i work with tend to crumble, if the pressure on them gets to high. Thats because they never learned how to deal with situations of high pressure. And its my opinion that schools should be the place to teach that. But you cant, if A's just get handed out for free.

The last party necessary for this discussion: teachers. As i stated in the title, i do believe teachers do play an important role in this. I also believe they are at fault. But i dont believe they are the main contributor. Let me just begin by listing some hard truths i came to acknowledge over the years:

* There are good teachers and bad teachers.
* Some teachers are just not qualified enough for their job.

I have found 2 different types of people are going into the teaching profession:

* People that actually like teaching, and are in it to help the students and dont care about the rest.
* People, that go into teaching for the benefits, and somehow forgot, that they have to deal with children.

Now, how many of those people do you believe to be good teachers? It actually turns out, thats only the first group (in my experience). The large majority of teachers i know actually fall into category 2, or more specifically a subset of category 2. The major problem with that tends to be the fact that education of our children, which is a HUGE responsibility, gets left to people that actually dont really want to do the job. Or are not willing to do what it takes to get the job done right. Right now, teachers are in a state of complacency, while only producing mediocrity. Let me rephrase that:

If you are a teacher : 

* and recently went to school without wearing a mask
* and made statements to your students which are clearly disproven by science
* and tried to force your opinion onto a student
* used the same lesson plans and exams for more than 5 years
* and consistently have class averages of C or below and never do anything about it

you probably should resign. There is a person waiting to actually do your job properly. Teaching means constant improvement and development. Anybody, that is not willing to do that should not be a teacher in my opinion.

The last thing i want to add is something near and dear to my heart. Im an elementary teacher by training, which is how i came to know about the situation, but i still think this applies to other levels of school aswell. And thats the constant devaluation of the profession of teaching. In my mind, its basically a crime to entrust the education of children to a person not qualified for the job. Ive seen, read and heard about so many people changing disciplines into teaching, without ever receiving any proper training in the profession. Why is it, that a CS Major can teach at a high school? I have a mathematics degree for teaching purposes, but the idea to work in the industry never crossed my mind. Im well aware that the system needs to work this way, but it should not. We would never trust our finances to a guy who is not qualified for the job. Why do we trust the education of our children to people, that are absolutely not qualified for it?"
ielltx,2,2020-08-22,Apply for internships now or spend a few weeks putting together projects first?,CsTh1029384756,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ielltx/apply_for_internships_now_or_spend_a_few_weeks/,"I'm a 3rd year mathematics major and computer science minor at a state school, and I'm looking to get a computer science internship this coming summer. Up until recently I was mainly planning on going into graduate school, so pretty much all of my experience on my resume is research. I did a project in face recognition with MATLAB, a summer research project in an obscure area of pure math which led to a publication (and a short Python program with documentation up on my GitHub which allows you to apply the results), and a summer research project in applied math and data analysis where I wrote a bunch of messy research code with numpy and matplotlib. I also might be doing deep learning research with a professor this fall semester.

What I'm worried about with applying to internships is that I don't have any significant personal projects to list on my resume. I feel like if I apply right now, I'd have a smaller chance of securing an interview/offer than I would if I spent a few weeks putting together a couple projects to show proof that I know how to write actual software, use OOP principles in practice, etc. It's been quite a while since I've actually sat down and worked on a project like this (I made some games in Java a loooong time ago), but I know it won't be too much trouble to do. I actually forgot how fun it is, haha.

I could start applying now and work on improving my resume at the same time, but I'm worried that by the time my resume looks better, I'll have exhausted a lot of the places I'm more interested in. At the same time, it's hard to determine how late is too late for these applications. Am I overthinking this? What's the best course of action?"

This past summer, I was planning on interning at a boutique NY equity research firm: I did their unofficial interview process (they don’t have a formal recruiting process), and they liked me and said they’d give me a spot, they just had to work it out with HR and then they’d be good to go. I thought, great, I have an internship, although no contract or anything yet, I was just waiting for HR to make it and come through. Meanwhile, I was taking a summer class and said great, I’ll finish this class and then I’ll have a contract ready to sign to say I’ll be an intern, and I’ll do it for the rest of the summer. 

This was where I fucked up, or rather, Covid fucked me up. I put down the job on my resume, along with some bullet points of things I knew they would have me be doing (due diligence, DCF modeling, etc). And they kept delaying the start date. But then I get a call from the HR person near the end of summer. Due to not being in person, and due to the small size of the company, they couldn’t give me an offer. 

This was *after* I applied to a lot of firms, with my now-fake internship on my resume, some of which I’m just hearing from now. I also did a lot of hirevue interviews before the time I found out my offer was cancelled where I basically went along with the fact that I did have an internship.

So basically. I don’t have any offers for 2021 yet, but if I get one and they find out I lied, I’m fucked. I also was too pussy to change my resume until this week cuz I thought it would hurt my chances. But now i realized i can also get fired if I lie on my resume.

Percy strode across the cafeteria floor, packed lunch in hand. As he approached, Kay and Sam both raised their heads and smiled, Percy was all too happy to see that the pair had since grown accustomed to his chosen coping method. He hesitated sitting down, having not moved from his station for hours, but managed to seat himself without causing himself too much pain. Almost immediately after Percy had begun eating the Caesar salad wrap Jaali had made for him before leaving for work, the trio were joined by Richard, and the mood soured somewhat. It had been hard making due without Mark's usual presence as the final member of their quartet, let alone Richard's signature pessimism, but they managed to tolerate his presence so long as he kept his mouth shut, and Richard did. And there they ate, Percy, Kay, and Sam chatting idly amongst themselves of what they had recently gotten up to; Sam had recently attended his cousin's wedding on Hyperion as the sun rose over Saturn, Kay had sunk hours upon hours into a new survival video game her kids showed her, and Percy had done little but help draft prototype craft, eat, and sleep.

""What about you?"" Percy asked Richard, not realizing he had said it before the words left his mouth, much to the surprise of himself and his coworkers.

Richard was just as surprised, but wasn't about to pass up the opportunity. ""Nothing much, but I did notice something on the news: That new Congressional hopeful, the kid who wanted more funding for us? Apparently his rally was enough to get some of the guys in house to bring it up in hearings.""

Percy blinked. ""Wait, they're already considering it?""

""Probably just a reelection tactic to be honest, but we can only wait and see where it goes."" Richard returned to stabbing carrots onto his fork.

Percy pulled out his phone to look it up, and against all odds, Richard was right. Percy silently thanked Finn, and hope sparked in his heart. The lingering animosity between the four workers softened a bit in that moment, and the quartet ate happily.

&amp;#x200B;

The work day passed by in the blink of an eye, with Percy operating at peak efficiency with the news Richard had brought him that afternoon. He hung up his coat in his locker, sighed happily, and made to leave. Down an elevator that stretched all the way to the troposphere - stocked with reading material, a television, and a company gaming system to use during the long waits - Percy stepped out onto the ground floor and beelined toward the exit, when he saw Richard out of the corner of his eye. In that moment, a question came to him that he didn't realize until now he had been pondering since his lunch break. He picked up to the pace to meet him, grabbing his attention with a loud utterance of his name.

""Percy... Hi."" Richard's tone was one of surprise.

Percy paused, he never expected to be the one seeking a conversation with Richard. ""Hey, I was wondering something-""

""Walk and talk."" butted in Richard, gesturing to the exit. Percy followed.

""So, earlier, during lunch, why did you tell us that? Out of everything you could've said, why that?""

Richard sighed as the pair walked through the front door and out into the parking lot. ""Everyone in this building knows that you and Mark were tight, if it weren't for meeting your husband at that company party, we'd be thinking you two were together."" Percy blushed at the thought. He'd be lying if he said he wasn't tempted to choose Mark in the past, but after he met Jaali, there was no more debate. Richard raised an eyebrow at Percy's expression and continued. ""Everybody knew how bad the FTL incident hit you, including me. Look, we're not friends; you know that, I know that, but I still don't like working with someone who's miserable. I'm a realist, so I thought it'd be best to hit you with the blunt truth, kinda force you to get over it, but clearly, that didn't work. And nothing will."" He stopped, leaning on the trunk of a small car. ""So I gave up. If you're not gonna get over it, might as well give you a sense of hope, stop you from bringing down the room.""

He clicked his car key, unlocking the car he was leaning on.""Night, Perce."" And he climbed into his car, taking off past Percy and out of sight.

Watching as Richard's car rounded the corner and disappeared behind, Percy let the man's words sink in. He decided that, while the man's uncanny ability to suck the hope out of any situation with only a few syllables kept him from liking him, he appreciated the gesture. He turned to go find his car.

&amp;#x200B;

Homework review was the item on the evening's docket and Percy was happy to say that Angavu had slowly been improving in both literacy and numeracy, making his job all that much easier. He sipped at his glass of water as he looked over a short essay Angavu had written on her favourite animal, the dilophosaurus; her consistently correct spelling of its name was no small feat for a six year old. A brief sentence about why she liked the dinosaur's talons was the focus of Percy's gaze when he heard the soft patter of a child's feet on the kitchen tiles. He looked up and past the kitchen table to see Angavu sleepily plod across the floor, dressed in a dragon-patterned onesie, and pull a glass from a cabinet below the bench. She dragged a chair from the table, clambered atop it, and poured herself a glass of warm water from the faucet she could now reach.

""Hey kiddo."" said Percy in a calm, fatherly tone. ""What're you doing up this late?""

""Water."" replied Angavu between gulps. She quickly scrubbed the glass with a sponge and left it on the drying rack before replacing the chair and walking back up the passage to her room.

""Could you please come here, sweetheart?"" asked Percy, arms laid on his knees. Angavu yawned, and obliged. Her sleepy indifference quickly changed to loving joy as Percy lifted her off the ground and onto his lap, hugging her tightly. Percy sighed. ""I'm sorry we haven't talked or seen each other a lot recently, Daddy's been working.""

""Makin' space ships!"" Angavu said excitedly, holding her arms out like wings. ""But you're workin' more. Why's that?"" she asked curiously.

""Uh..."" Percy didn't want to lie to her, her adorably inquisitive expression wouldn't let him. But telling her that his best friend might be dead wasn't an option. ""You know Uncle Mark?""

""Yeah! I miss him."" Her expression faded into the blankness common for kids her age.

""Me too, kiddo."" Percy managed to hide just how much he did. ""See, Uncle Mark's lost right now, floating somewhere out in space, and I'm making a ship strong enough to go look for him!""

Angavu's eyes lit up with awe and excitement. ""Whoa! Really Daddy?""

""Yeah! And when we find him, we're gonna make sure he gets home safe. And then we can go play laser tag together again!""

""Yay! Find him quick, okay?""

Percy paused a moment before pulling himself together after a curious head tilt from Angavu. ""I'll do my best, and I'll make sure my team does as well."" He gently lowered Angavu to the floor. ""Alright, you'd better get some sleep, okay honey?""

""Okay Dad!"" She wrapped her arms around his neck in as much of a hug as her tiny form could muster. Percy returned it, holding her close for a long, silent moment, before releasing her and planting a fatherly kiss on her forehead. Angavu then turned and scampered off, waving as she did. ""Goodnight, Daddy!"" she yelled as she rounded the corner.

""Goodnight sweetheart!"" Percy replied, growing somber as his daughter left his sight. He turned back to the papers spread out on the table, feeling equal parts determination and regret for the promise he had just made. 'One just wasn't enough, was it?' he thought as he laid his head in his hands. With his own words on repeat in his head, the homework before him seemed unfairly daunting. He tuned out his own voice and found it replaced by the definitive squeak of a shower handle being turned, followed by the sound of rushing water suddenly coming to a halt. Percy took a breath, decided that the rest of the homework could wait until he had de-stressed a bit, and made for the bedroom. An hour later, he returned in a nightgown to complete his task.

\~\~\~

""Mark*Watch,* huh?"" asked Mark in between bites of his post-workout lunch, staring at the video before him. *""I dreamed of being on TV when I was a kid, I'm sure he would've been happy about it, at least.""* As much as he hated to admit it, Ta'X'rtana News was entirely within their rights to do this. He learned from Arnd that being in a public space voided one's right to privacy, just as it did back home, and unlike X'rtani House, the streets of Ta'X'rtana weren't private property.

*&lt;""They're parasites, I swear.""&gt;* lamented F'ejen as he held his device toward Mark, chewing on a lija pod. It was nice to catch up and finally sit down and talk again without the conversation being dictated by work, though his obligation to keep things professional in such an environment kept him from being as casual as he would have liked. *&lt;""Nothing for it but to grit your teeth, bear it, and try not to get swept up in anything that could tank your reputation.""&gt;*

Mark nodded. *""Yeah...""* He searched for another topic of conversation while he still had time. *""You still having those therapy sessions?""*

*&lt;""Yeah, actually, but it's all one-on-one.""&gt;* Mark's look of confusion sparked him to continue. *&lt;""So, Rilk'r and myself are the only ones out of all of us, to my knowledge, that wanted to continue having sessions. Mee'lo's just fine, so far as I can tell; Jan'u's the same; and Rilk'r wanted to continue his therapy in private, so there was no point in the group sessions any more. So yeah, it's just myself now.""&gt;*

""Huh. *How are they?""* Were it anyone else, Mark wouldn't risk asking a question of such a personal bent.

*&lt;""Honestly, I don't think I have as much to work through as I thought. Yeah, my mind wanders back to th- the noises sometimes, but Mapal and I agree that I'm better now than I was.""&gt;* His chewing faltered for a moment, but he pulled himself together just as quickly.

*""I'm glad.""* Any question of whether or not F'ejen was lying was dashed in the face of the sincerity his voice carried.

*&lt;""Um...""&gt;* The pair's attention was drawn away from them by the approach of an employee, a young X'etish woman dressed in a suit indicative of her position as intern. She appeared nervous, something that, due to her impressive size and bulk, Mark found quite entertaining. *&lt;""Could- could we get a photo together?""&gt;* she blurted out. Both men gave each other a look, F'ejen shrugged.

Mark smiled, how could it hurt? *""Of course. Let's do it.""*

The woman's face lit up and she almost skipped over to Mark's side, planting a hand on the human's shoulder that barely reached her chest. Holding out her phone at an angle that further emphasized Mark's diminutive stature, she snapped a picture of the pair smiling up into the camera, Mark winking as he did so. Upon reviewing the image, the woman let out a small squeak of joy. *&lt;""Thank you!""&gt;* she said enthusiastically, bowing low before tottering off to what Mark assumed to be her next assignment.

F'ejen sighed mockingly. *&lt;""You dreamed of being on TV? How about being a celebrity?""&gt;* he chuckled to himself.

Mark joined in. *""Last time I was in the spotlight, I remember* blushing *so hard I thought I was going to burst.""* It was during an awards ceremony at Snowy Peaks High School. Mark was stood up on stage beside a number of other exceptional students. One by one, they received a medal and certificate for their achievements: Dylan Maxwell for his strikingly fresh rendition of Romeo and Juliet, Jackson Kane for an exemplary year as the school's star quarterback, Gabriella Jay for becoming a finalist at a local art show, Mark for his highly efficient custom mag-engines, and Anne Vallière for bringing the school a crushing victory in a series of inter-school debates. In the back room following the awards ceremony, Anne struck up a conversation with Mark for no other reason than she liked to talk. He smiled warmly at the memory that birthed a million more.

He broke out of his nostalgic haze when he realized F'ejen was staring at him in puzzlement. Mark caught on quick. *""Okay, so* blushi-""

*&lt;""Gentlemen!""&gt;* A familiar voice rang out, and T'aro made his presence known at the table, accompanied as usual by K'ul. *&lt;""I'm glad to see you both in high spirits! Don't tell me you've forgotten our appointment, Mister* Stevens?""&gt;

*""I have not.""* Mark replied firmly, standing from his seat. *""See you around, F'ejen.""*

*&lt;""Seeya,* Mark.""&gt;

*&lt;""And don't you forget our appointment either, Mister Rour.""&gt;* asked T'aro pointedly, giving the doctor a knowing look before turning away. Mark looked questioningly at F'ejen, who waved him off with a smile. Unsure, but committed to the task ahead, Mark turned with T'aro, and made for the elevators.

&amp;#x200B;

The ride was short, with Mark spending little time sat across from T'aro in the back of his limousine, much to his relief. Upon touching down, the duo stepped out into the shadow cast by a wide building stood next to Kapari Square, that appeared to be little more than a series of repeated rooms, each looking nearly identical to each other. Figure-carved pillars inlaid with stained glass lined its face, and, emblazoned across the canopy above was the building's name: Central Bank of Ta'X'rtana.

T'aro strode ahead of Mark. *&lt;""Shall we?""&gt;* he asked calmly over his shoulder. Mark followed him inside.

Soft, grass-green rugs cushioned their feet as they walked over to a cushioned waiting bench. Tables for cheque writing stood in the middle of the floor, watched on two sides by a series of teller windows; three desks manned by support staff stood behind a small partition across the room, and a door to the back rooms was fitted into the far corner, under watch by a guard; all of it was surrounded by a thin security strip that Mark eyed with what he hoped was needless dread. From the ceiling dangled minimalist light fixtures that illuminated both the space below, and the intricate detail work that turned the ceiling above into a work of art; sure enough, Mark spotted a wobunil carving among others scattered about the piece.

Their entrance caused a stir amongst patrons and staff alike, but they all quickly went on with their tasks. That didn't stop tellers from gossiping between clients. At last, after several seated patrons that made several unsubtle glances Mark's way, he and T'aro were called to a counter. The teller shrank away a little when Mark approached, Mark hid his disappointment.

*""Hello,""* began Mark. *""I'd like to open a bank account and register a bank card in my name.""*

The teller took a moment to find the words he had been using for years. *&lt;""O-Of course. Do you have a card in your possession?""&gt;* Mark produced the card in question, the same with which he purchased the necklace that hung around his neck. The clerk seemed eased at this, taking the card once Mark had slid it below the window. The card was run through the database, and the teller grew wary once more. *&lt;""Sir, th-this card is registered under a man named T'aro Luk'yter.""&gt;*

*&lt;""That would be I.""&gt;* interjected T'aro. *&lt;""And I would like to pass registry onto my colleague here.""&gt;*

*&lt;""I-I see.""&gt;* the man swallowed. *&lt;""Do you have identification, sir?""&gt;* As though he anticipated this question, T'aro swiftly produced numerous documents and cards proving his identity, all of which the teller confirmed with the database. *&lt;""Okay... Do you-""&gt;* He looked down at Mark, and decided that, in this case, the fact that the human was human meant that proof of identity wasn't necessary, policy be damned.

He produced a form on a screen inlaid into the counter. *&lt;""Please fill out the form, sir. And please make any necessary conversions from... your calendar to ours.""&gt;*

As Mark did just that, he felt that he was being watched, he pushed down this feeling that he knew he would have to get used to, and continued without hesitation. After a few brief minutes and a quick re-read to ensure everything was correct, he was finished, and submitted it to the clerk.

&gt;**CENTRAL BANK OF TA'X'RTANA REGISTRY FORM          Date:** 7th Dawn of Se'te, 80363  
&gt;  
&gt;**Titles:** N/A     **Given Name/s:** Mark Hale     **Family Name:** Stevens

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;^(Note: By submitting this document, you pledge that all information presented on this document is legitimate. Failure to produce factual information will result in a suspension of your bank account and fines/prison time in accordance with Ta'X'rtana law under the Progeny Edict.)

T'aro had insisted that Mark state this occupation and list himself as his employer for reasons that the businessman assured him would be revealed soon, Mark had long since accepted that no matter how much he tried, T'aro wouldn't stray from his vague mode of speech.

Soon, the form was submitted into the database, and the teller returned the now re-registered bank card to Mark. *&lt;""Now, you have to set its lock.""&gt;*

Mark was warned of this. The card held a touch sensor that could detect the unique patterns present in every X'erren's talons, using this unique pattern, the card's holder could unlock the card and use it for whatever they may need. Mark, instead, pressed his thumb onto the sensor, marking the first thumbprint authentication in X'erren history, as a X'erren's thumbs were normally coated in a thin layer of fur, rendering them useless for authentication. Just to be safe, Mark set up a two-factor thumbprint and combination authentication, and the card was his to use as he saw fit. A small thing as it may have been, Mark felt he had made a great stride. Another key to personal freedom in hand, he followed T'aro from the building.

*""So now are you gonna tell me why you wanted to be listed as my employer?""* Mark asked, exasperation thick in his voice.

T'aro's ear perked up. *&lt;""Actually, yes. If I left you without personal funds, I can't rightly grant you the freedom you deserve, and if I were to simply provide an allowance without justification, that could be ammunition our political opponents could use against us. But if I officially hire you as an employee of my department, as is befitting of the head of the Department of Extraterrestrial Research and Relations to do, I am well within my rights to pay your wages without any loose threads waiting to be unraveled.""&gt;* He raised a cheeky eyebrow as he climbed into his vehicle. Mark couldn't help but crack a subtle smile.

However, despite the day being young, he was about to head back to X'rtani House, and in a limousine, no less. As convenient and luxurious as it was, it felt wrong to him. Why should he have to run errands by being driven about in a luxury vehicle? To protect him from xenophobes wielding raw meat? He thought, and came to the conclusion that, if he was to be accepted by the public, being ferried around like a king in a royal chariot was a poor way to go about it. He climbed into the vehicle. *""Do you mind if we make a stop on the way?""*

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, Mark stepped out from Flying Rukwa Central Station, a transport pass in hand. It took some convincing, but eventually, T'aro came around to the idea, seeing the sense in it. The man waited, leaning against the limousine parked outside the station, with a look of reluctance and dread.

*&lt;""Listen,""&gt;* he began. *&lt;""I get the idea, but do you really think this is the safest course of action?""&gt;*

*""Look, it was going to come to this eventually; you have a contract to stick to, and that contract has a place for me to live in at the end of it. Just think of this as getting a head start on the unwritten social aspect of that.""* he explained calmly, flipping his transport pass in his fingers.

T'aro sighed. With greater freedom, he conceded, there came greater risks. *&lt;""Alright. Just stay safe, okay?""&gt;*

*""Unless a bomb goes off, there's basically nothing out here that can hurt me, I'll be fine.""* Mark was well aware of the cockiness he displayed, but thought that after all the stiffness brought on by paranoia and living in a government facility, he deserved to loosen up a bit. T'aro suppressed nervous laughter, and simply nodded. And before long, the vehicle and the two men within it were little more than a black spot in the sky, one among the thousands littering the city's airspace. Mark took in a deep breath, feeling truly free for the first time since he stepped foot on Kerc-en, and knowing that he had already received his first paycheck, decided that the city could use a bit of human patronage.

&amp;#x200B;

Beneath Ta'X'rtana, as the sun began to near the horizon line and Mark returned from his tour of the city, T'aro looked through a viewing window. *&lt;""I hope this works, Mister Rour. Focusing a shield of that strength into such a small area is prohibitively expensive.""&gt;* As he spoke, his eyes flowed from an immense shield generator mounted on the ceiling, down an increasingly narrowing arm, and ending at an apparatus no larger than a standard issue scalpel.

*&lt;""Sir, given that you're the one who hired the engineers, I'm sure it'll work.""&gt;* replied F'ejen from beyond the window. He was dressed head to toe in surgical scrubs, and his dedication to the profession was shown with him tying his ears back, the sight of which made most x'erren wince. Before him, a sheet of pale flesh was stretched over a misshapen rod of metal in as close an approximation of a human arm as possible. Despite the technology existing for decades, all in attendance were still amazed at what tissue replication could do with the contents of a tiny plastic bag. *&lt;""Alright, commencing test... Now.""&gt;*

Power poured through every wire, breathed life into every circuit, and drove the generator's shaping engines to work. The machine's whirring was overpowering to the point that even the thoughts of those in proximity were drowned out. The blade's spine sparked briefly, before a shimmering shield thin enough to put most blades to shame appeared in the air beside it. Normally, this shield would be all but invisible to the naked eye and in turn be practically useless for surgery. To alleviate this issue, a basic hologram projector was too installed into the apparatus, projecting a brilliant white blade onto the shield's shape while also doubling as a weak, but useful flashlight.

Technicians on standby looked over the device's diagnostics, and found everything to be, if not entirely optimal, at least stable. Glad that the green light had been given, F'ejen took the scalpel in his hand and hoped. He reached forward, and with the finesse of a trained and experienced surgeon, made a shallow incision in the sheet of skin. As the knife continued its path, the technicians confirmed that the shield retained its integrity without issue. F'ejen smiled and pumped his fist at his success. Now that the first step had been taken and his idea proven, it was only a matter of time until he would have every tool he could ever need. Mark, his friend, saved his life, so should the time come, F'ejen would eagerly return the favour as best he possibly could. He slept well that night.

iex77j,4,2020-08-23,How can I improve my resume/impression to get a reliable office job?,stardropunlocked,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iex77j/how_can_i_improve_my_resumeimpression_to_get_a/,"I'm 24. I have a bachelor's degree in public relations and experience in news writing, copy editing, some restaurant/retail work, and child care. I am an excellent writer with experience in Canva, AP Style, Adobe InDesign, photography, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram), Google Drive/G Suite, and Wordpress, among other things. I've done two internships and have several very reliable references as well as an email marketing course certification.

During unemployment, I've been writing, running my blog, learning to weave, cooking, baking, working out, and most recently building up an Instagram for my dog (as a sort of portfolio piece mostly).

I have no interest in starting my own business/company, being my own boss, or (outside pandemic circumstances) working from home. All I want is reliable full-time hours at a desk in an office with a computer and a phone, working with people I like enough to invite them to eat cake on my birthday. I don't care what I'm doing as long as I'm actively doing something and getting paid for it.

**Some employment backstory if you want it (feel free to skip down):**

In 2018-2019, I was living in a small town and working at a newspaper. I was a journalist, but I spent more time at the desk than the others because my primary responsibility was receiving, editing, and collecting payment for obituaries. I loved that job, until my (amazing) supervisor was fired and our entire team fell apart. When the editor bombed my reputation\*, the timing with my lease and my relationship made it the right time for me to leave.

*(\*More info: the editor changed my headline, and over 200 people called me a racist on Facebook. I posted on Facebook about the situation to clear things up, which I was sure would get me fired, but I was only called in to talk. I apologized to the editor and publisher for making the paper look bad to save my own butt. So I managed to clear up my public reputation and keep on good terms with the company before leaving. I was the first to quit, but everyone else from our team left within two months and the editor ""retired"" shortly after I left. It was a mess.)*

I moved in with my partner in Tippecanoe County, Indiana. I took a job at the Kroger deli until I could find something else, but despite several promising interviews I never got any other offers. Due to unexpected health problems, I had to leave Kroger. I got my health problems treated and under control. I was just about to re-apply for my old job when the pandemic started; we weren't comfortable with me being back at the supermarket, all things considered.

I did get a summer job providing in-home childcare for one family, but now that school has started, that job is over.

My partner's full-time job has easily provided for all our expenses since I moved in. He is studying engineering at a community college (Ivy Tech). He needs to transfer to a bachelor's program for the 2021-2022 school year, and his associate's classes are getting more demanding as he reaches higher level coursework. He can't keep working full-time and give his studies the time they need.

**The current problem (help!):**

I need a full-time job in Fort Wayne, Indiana, ASAP. That's where the colleges my partner will apply to are both located, and he already has everything set up to transfer to that branch of Ivy Tech. His parents live there and are willing to let me/us move in between getting a job and finding an apartment there.

What I need from a job:

* Regular, reliable schedule
* Long term potential (we'll be there two years minimum, probably longer)
* Minimum $38,000/year or $18.50/hour
* Health care, dental, and vision (for myself, doesn't have to be a family plan)

If it were just me, I'd definitely be open to lower paying jobs — my newspaper job was $14/hour and I made it work — but to support my family's living expenses this is as low as I can go.

I've applied for administrative assistant (and similarly titled) positions, receptionist and secretarial work, event planning, hospitality and hotel positions, and media and communications positions. I've looked into public relations firms and newspapers in the area. I've applied to anything on Indeed and LinkedIn that looks like I might be remotely qualified. So far, I've got nothing.

I know everyone is struggling right now. I know the job field has been thrown in disarray and competition is fierce. But I don't want to keep throwing out applications and feeling hopeless and helpless. I feel like there must be something I can do to improve my chances.

Is there some certification or course or skill I should be working to add? Some part of my experience or personality or skills I need to play up? Some office job that might fit which I haven't considered? I'll take any advice you've got for me, Reddit."

if0ss0,4,2020-08-23,$2700+ to “Life Coach” instead of “LMFT” - No disclosure of no license! (CA),sleepiebeauty,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/if0ss0/2700_to_life_coach_instead_of_lmft_no_disclosure/,"My husband &amp; I wanted to start marriage counseling during quarantine as a precaution &amp; for overall mental health during this time. I emailed a Psychotherapy Group in our area &amp; the owner replied:

&gt;Hello. Thank you for reaching out to me. My fee is $185.00 per 1 hour session and I don’t take insurance. I have 4 therapist that I have trained ranging in price from $110-140 an hour. One of those therapists can bill out of network on a PPO plan. We don’t take HMO, EAP or Kaiser plans. A cheaper option is my intern that I am supervising who has completed all education requirements and is completing hours for her license. She is $80. Please let me know if you would like to schedule or if you would like additional information and I’d be happy to schedule you or have someone call you back.

I asked for a call back &amp; was called by our, now, counselor (or so I thought). He spoke really fast when he mentioned schools &amp; his qualifications. He mentioned different couples therapy methods that he favors so I had no reason to be suspicious. I set up our session with him &amp; have since, had 23 sessions that total $2760 all together. 

A few weeks ago, I mentioned to a LMFT friend of mine that it feels like our counselor is trying to split us up. She told me that he is legally not able to, he can ask questions to lead us to make that decision for ourselves but it cannot be his suggestion. (Ethics) At our last session, he told me privately that I should start the separation/divorce process &amp; I immediately knew something was off.

I looked at the Psychotherapy Group’s website &amp; realized that all of the other “Therapists” had their license numbers posted under their bios if you pulled up a little, but our “Life Coach” has no license to post.

To my knowledge, I was **never** told that he is NOT a licensed therapist/psychologist before our 1st session but I wasn’t given an option to CHOOSE to see a licensed therapist or an (unlicensed) life coach. Nowhere in the owner’s email did she explain/imply that *any* of her employees(other than the intern, explicitly) are unlicensed or simply not licensed therapists. In our sessions, we’ve talked about serious mental health issues &amp; childhood abuse (all of which he’s actually unqualified to discuss) &amp; even *at that point*, he didn’t disclose that he’s not a LMFT nor did he offer to refer us to someone who is.

In my initial inquiry email, I asked for **marriage counseling** specifically &amp; have paid for/received “life coaching” - which I didn’t ask for &amp; was unaware that I was receiving. We were never told &amp; were, in fact, made to believe we were receiving guidance &amp; services from a LICENSED PROFESSIONAL. I feel so grossly violated &amp; taken advantage of. He could’ve ended my marriage if I didn’t know any better.

I intend to simply have a conversation with the owner regarding this first &amp; see if she can correct this. But do I have any legal recourse? Isn’t there some kind of legal requirement to disclose if someone is unlicensed &amp; providing services?"

Just looking for some advice on studying smarter. I work really hard on studying DS/Algo stuff and am doing an internship for the stack I learned. But I feel like it's not clicking. Like I don't think like a Software Engineer - I don't truly problem solve-- and if I do, it takes me a long time to get to an answer for algorithms. I don't think that's going to fly in the professional world and so it's concerning. 

I do leetcode and study data structures and common problem-solving patterns, and I've gotten a little better, but to be honest, it's been slow. Very slow. And I think that's a byproduct of not studying in a smart way. And then I always end up getting brain fog, and while solutions make sense, it's not being absorbed. 

I know this is difficult advice to give to people, and it's practice, practice, practice. But any little way -- unusual or not -- that you've incorporated in studying would be helpful.

I am going into my final year of university studying mathematics in the UK, however right now in my summer holiday im feeling very insecure.

This is due to me achieving below optimal grades and having no research experience or any internships. As such it's obvious that I have no job prospects to look forward to when I finish my degree.

My university is classed as one of the top univerisities in the country. However due to the above stated reasons I'm finding it hard to stay motivated to finish off my degree. I was going to make a study group for maths because, while I do find maths to be enjoyable to study, it hurts as I'm geniuenley not sure what I should be doing to get a job.

If anyone can shine a light for me I'll be very happy. I'm sorry if I sound like a downer but I really would love some help.

Skills I have:

* Beginners understanding of C++ - I recently read through the deep learning book by ian goodfellowes and I've managed to implement an very basic deep neural net simulating XOR.
* Latex - I was tasked with writing an essay on Brownian motion last year and got a good grade for that. Also I typesetted all of my assignment in latex throughout the year."

As a bonus, I love programming and tech. The biggest issue is that I don't really have any job or volunteering experience, this is mostly due to my being very introverted and being reluctant to applying for internships since I rarely hear any positive things about them (and I earn more from working online). I did a lot of freelancing (mosty graphic design) and own a decently successful YouTube channel which I have been managing for roughly 5 years.

Hey guys, I will be starting my Bsc course in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham in late September 2020. I am an international student which means my tuition fee is significantly more expensive than a UK/EU citizen. 

I intend on landing high a summer internship to help ease some of the debt that I'm taking on to be able to go to university. What are my chances of getting an interview at a FAANG, Hedge fund, or financial company as a first year? 

I would also appreciate if someone could clarify the application process for this internships for me. In the US, I've heard that it's next to impossible to get an interview unless you have a referral. Is this also the case in the UK? If it is that competitive, how do I better my chances of getting someone to refer me?

As far as preparation goes, I intend on putting my head down, focussing and solving questions from leetcode and cracking the coding interview in the coming few months. I also plan on working on a few personal projects. Is this approach a good one? Would you suggest a different course of action as far as preparation goes? 

For context, I have been solving easy/medium level leetcode style questions in java for the past few years as I took computer science in high school. Because of this, I don't think jumping straight into leetcode would be too much of an issue for me as I know most of my basic data structures and algorithms.

Sorry for the extremely lengthy post. My parents are helping me pay for my education as they want me to live a better life than they have so far and I want to ease their financial burden as much as I can. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

It's been a month. But I still feel very overwhelmed. We are currently doing work from home.

I have been put into a complex project. It uses frameworks that I do not know. Languages that I don't know. 90% of the things they ask me to do I don't know how to do. Even google doesn't help because the problems errors etc are usually business logic related.

I did start getting the hang of some things then they changed the project I was assigned to. And now I feel like I'm Back at square one. 

It's been like 1.5 months since I started btw

I don't know how to do anything. It is extremely embarrassing and frustrating. I'm supposed to work from 9 to 6 but people usually show up (online) around 10, 11. Then stay late till 8, 9. 

I usually don't get assigned work most of the day but I am still occupied because I just sit there waiting for them to call and give me a task. They obviously can't give me long tasks because I don't know anything.

I used to be the smart kid in University. But I feel absolutely lost here. I am on the verge of tears. 

I don't get time for anything personal during weekdays. And weekends feel so short. I feel like I'm in the wrong place.

if9iq8,3,2020-08-23,Stuck in an endless wait. What would you do?,curiousbee2021,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/if9iq8/stuck_in_an_endless_wait_what_would_you_do/,"Imagine the following, as an immigrant:

You came to the US many years ago to pursue a master's degree in a top university. You then went on to work at one of the 5 top tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, FB) as a software engineer and have worked there for 11 years now. You got promoted several times, hired/fired several engineers and have made your company a lot of money in the process. You're earning a high salary (top 1% in state and country). You're still on an H1B visa since the EB2 wait time for your country of birth is roughly 150 years.

What you find frustrating/unfair:

\- Everyone you hired (starting 2012) obtained a green card within 1-3 years and most are citizens now. Although you're the person who hired them, mentored them, managed their work, you're still a temporary worker while they've comfortably settled into the American life.

\- The EB1, EB2, EB3 categories for all countries besides India and China are and have been current. Meaning that if Joe has even a bachelor's degree, he automatically gets a green card within a year. Although you have a master's degree, you're somehow not worthy, after 12 years, of being a resident in the US because of your country of birth.

\- There's a diversity visa quota of 50,000 visas a year given to people of countries that do not have high immigration numbers (all but 20 countries). That means no need for a degree, no need to speak English, no need to prove financial independence - people from these countries are given green cards just for asking (although it is a lottery).

\- As you see all the interns you hired go on to start their own companies, get VC funding and ask you for advice, you're stuck on a work visa where, let alone starting a company, you cannot start a youtube channel, an etsy store or even work for a non-profit. You cannot be on the board of these companies that are happy to seek your advice. You also cannot take a sabbatical or change professions.

\- You don't expect there to be fair treatment for everyone, but America seems to be the only country that gives permanent residency (based on country of birth) within a year. Most developed countries require you to wait for at least 2-5 years (Canada: 2y, UK: 5y, Australia: 5y, Switzerland: 10y!)

So coming to the question - what would you do? Note that I'm not asking what I should do (since I'm sure most of the answers will be to get rid of myself). That's all - simple question.

Note: I've not caused anyone any harm and don't wish to either, so I'd request keeping the discussion civil. In person, I'm always told that I'm very important and that the country needs people like me. Online, I'm generally told that I'm taking someone's job away and that I should get the hell out. My gripe with that argument is that many of those ""citizens"" came to this country after I did, so I don't really think I should leave so that they can get my job. Although, in all fairness, I'm hiring, so if they are qualified, would love to interview them."

I am a Mechanical Engineering Student going into my 2nd year at a Community College here in the US. I have started hunting for Summer 2021 internships already but have run into some dilemmas.

1. Most, if not all, internships I looked at wanted their candidates to be pursuing a B.S. in Engineering. I am going to be transferring to a 4 year college in Fall of 2021.....so my question is, should I still apply to internships that require their candidates to be working on a B.S. with resumes that say I am a CC student?? Do recruiters actually care if the candidate is doing their first two years of a B.S. at a CC or a 4-year University?

Internships I looked at ranged from Defense, Construction, Energy; they all had the ""pursuing B.S. in Mechanical Engineering"" listed in the job description.

2) Other than company websites, Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster &amp; Career Fairs, where else can I start finding internships? Listing your own personal experiences in hunting for internships would be great also!

I am having a bit of a dilemma deciding what I should do as a student graduating this semester (December).

I have been offered to interview for a contractor position (I have a pretty good feeling I’ll get the job as I’ve interned for them before, bu anything could happen).
This is currently my only interview I’ve received, but I’m not super happy about it being a contractor position, plus I’d have to move across the country away from my SO whom I love very much.
Again, I haven’t actually received an offer yet but I have high hopes that I will.
I’d prefer a full time job rather than a contract position for the benefits and job security.

My other option would be to go to grad school for Human Computer Interaction. This field sounds amazing as I primarily do front-end work. Grad school would allow me to try to intern for a big time company in the summers as well (I’m going to Grace Hopper so I hope that would help my chances of getting an internship).

So, should I just take this contractor position if offered? Should I go to grad school in this economy? I think HCI would be good for front-end work, and I’d get to stay with my SO, and try for internships at Grace Hopper. I could also try for full time offers at Grace Hopper.

Grad school would cost money but I could get 50% assistantship for tuition. The contractor position I assume wouldn’t have benefits like 401k and health insurance and I would have to move away. I really like where the contractor position is located but right now I don’t feel ready to move away from my SO so that’s why I’m leaning towards grad school.

I realize I’m kind of getting ahead of myself, but I wanted to weigh the benefits of this hypothetical before actually having to make any decisions."

Despite researching remedies for my diseases &gt;= 6 hrs/day, I worry OBSESSIVELY about my future (presuming I ever get better). Here’s a short summary of my life so you can better understand me.

In primary school, though I chatted with peers and disrupted class unrelentingly, I could always produce the correct answer when called upon. I earned straight As from pre to middle school.

I was addicted to drugs and alcohol by 12, went to rehab multiple times, and experienced many near-fatal car accidents (FIVE), overdoses, and suicide attempts. In high school, my grades dropped and I failed chemistry &amp; trig. This all culminated in a DUI, where I crashed into 2 cop cars (totaling their cars and mine) and nearly killed a cop. To this day, I am EXTREMELY remorseful of my actions and grateful that he recovered. I served a year in jail, 6 months house arrest, and 5 years probation. 

In jail, I read as many books as possible and swore to stay away from alcohol (13 years sober and counting)!! When I got out, I worked in retail a bit longer. Then, when my manager encouraged me to go back to school, I enrolled in a few community college courses. I took an aptitude test at this college, and the results suggested I go into research, engineering, or medicine. I really didn’t want to deal with people anymore, so I chose engineering - chemical engineering, to be exact, since I knew it was the most difficult (in retrospect, that’s a TERRIBLE way to choose a career path). My Myers-Briggs is XNTJ (I like alone time, but also love conversation with a close friend).

I worked my ass off at community college. I became vice president of student government, won the Martin Luther King Leadership Award, tutored chemistry, calculus, &amp; physics, and earned that damn Associates with a 4.0 GPA. I also scored a 33 on the ACT, so I was accepted to the University of Florida. My best friend (a very talented hacker) swiped most records of my criminal history that Google returned. Plus, most companies only look back 7 years, so it wasn’t an issue when it came time to apply for internships or jobs.

During my first semester of college, I took organic chemistry, a few chemical engineering courses, and intro to computer science. And even though I had the highest grades in my chemical engineering classes, I just wasn’t enjoying it. So I decided to switch my major to computer science.

I won an entrepreneurial contest in which I had to create a company during my 1st semester as a computer science major. I was chosen to accompany the dean to Silicon Valley to pitch my idea to raise money for a new engineering campus at the University of Florida. In the audience was the vice president of IBM and NVIDIA co-founder, Chris Malachowsky (who was my mentor for a while). I went on to internship at Lockheed Martin and IBM.

Unfortunately and unknowingly (until 2-5 years after the fact), I was bitten by a tick and contracted Lyme disease and Bartonella. My health started to quickly slip. They found 12 white matter lesions on my brain, and I developed small vessel disease, which prevented circulation to my brain and the rest of my body. I had to do the last year of university from my bed.

Regardless of my circumstances (and the fact that my cognitive performance was steadily decreasing), I persevered and graduated with Summa Cum Laude honors and a 3.9 GPA.

After graduation, I moved in with my fiancée and took work as a remote freelancing mobile app developer (too bad, because with my credentials I could have went to med school or worked at a FAANG company).

It’s now four years later, and my health and cognition has deteriorated so much that I can barely code (I can still write, though)! I take about 10 medications and 25 supplements to manage my pain, but I can barely think anymore. Regardless, I am extremely driven and cannot settle for collecting disability for the rest of my life.

I wanted to be a musician or actor when I was small, and this urge has continued to follow me. I play guitar and sing, but if there is no problem to fix (as in computer programming) I get bored and move to something more stimulating.

Acting is a pipe dream, as I am 35 and may not live to see 40. Also, even moving hurts, so I can't act until I recover. I can cry on demand tho, and was the lead in school play and told I was good. This is my true wish, but I should probably be realistic.

The problem is this - I’m interested in EVERYTHING - technology, medicine, video games, writing, acting, music, engineering, math, and a whole lot more. I learn quickly and am good at what I put effort into, so that makes finding my strengths difficult. I would say my best strength is my resourcefulness. 

Strengths:

Math: 

I can do math like a calculator in my head, but not anymore on these meds. I failed trig, calc, and chemistry in high school due to drug use. In college, I had to restart back at high school math, and ended up getting A's in calc 1, 2, 3, chem 1&amp;2, physics 1&amp;2, and ended up tutoring them all. BUT, I don’t really like math, as it’s so dry. It does intrigue me, however, as I believe mathematics is THE language of the universe, and the language that God speaks.

Sales/people skills: 

Won multiple prizes and awards for my salesmanship, and was even the top salesperson of the region for a while. 

I’m also a strong public speaker. In my Public Speaking course in college, my speeches were shown to every class as an archetype for a good speech. I was honored.

But people skills/psychology (especially body language), didn’t come naturally, and I had to read countless books on the matter. But even after DECADES of intentionally putting myself in socially distressing situations (exposure therapy), I still have severe social anxiety (even with my fiancée, family, and friends)!!!

Science/Medicine: 

Was always a strength. Was the highest scoring section on my ACT (34). Always liked physics, astronomy, etc. Unlike math, I love science. But, I’m not specially trained in any one field. Very good with medications, supplements, disorders- I usually know more than my doctors (on MY illness Only). THEY are the experts, not me, but I AM medically inclined. However, due to illness, the field is impractical unless I am healed tomorrow.

Computer Science:

The field is so rapidly changing, that it’s been hard to keep up studying (try studying data structures on ketamine, oxycodone, marijuana, lyrica, and amitryptaline- it’s almost impossible). 

BUT, I do have an interest in AI/Machine Learning, and my math background (although I'd have to brush up) would help me. AI is the next frontier, and I believe will be one of the highest-paying jobs in a few years. BUT, I'd rather do something I am passionate about and not sure if I want to be behind a computer screen forever.

Music:

Have been playing guitar since 12 (still not great at it) and have written some good music, but never finished recording any. I have a habit of not completing what I start. But, I am HIGHLY emotional, and consider myself a good lyricist and composer. I am also a decent singer. I have been pursuing music in my free time and recording with my brother (a professional musician). But unless we make it big, there's no money in it (which I NEED due to $40,000/yr medical bills).

Acting:

Pipe dream

Writing/Law:

Probably my strongest skill. Don’t knock me for my grammar or vocab - I’m on an iPhone and typing fast. 

For my University or Florida honors project, I wrote a research paper that was subsequently chosen for publishing at the university and a prolific engineering journal. I later published my research on [medium.com](http://medium.com/). To date, it has been read a quarter million times, translated into multiple languages, and won me an invitation as a regular contributor for a programming journal.

I also once had 4 Fs replaced with Ws (at a college AND a different University, which I attended before jail and failed) due to my appeal packet; the packet was huge, had photos, a timeline, compelling story, etc. They told me rarely, if ever, do they grant grade change requests, but I made small talk with the lady doing the processing and strategically attended a board meeting (where I approached the meeting chair and told him my story {addict’s redemption} ). So these skills may make me a good LAWYER? I’m also a good debater. I was a toastmaster, and won a few debates. Won my English 2 honors debate by a landslide. I know it’s not a big deal, but it’s my experience.

I also penned dozens of friends’ resumes. I typed my roommate’s resume during his 1st year of university (he had no professional experience), and it got him an internship at GE as a mechanical engineer; he now works there full-time. I also had a job as a technical writer for an online programming magazine. I was scouted by Apple and Amazon as a tech writer (I declined because of my health). 

Not sure if I want the social anxiety from law, and IM DISABLED! So maybe wishful thinking. Writing, on the other hand, is definitely doable. But write what? Technica writing, since related to programming, doesn't interest me anymore.

Investing:

My autistic trait is that I can tell you the net worth of almost anyone famous without looking up any information. I guess I use my resourcefulness to pull any info from my brain and give an estimate within 10% of the true value. I’ve done some investing, and I am usually right in my predictions. Unfortunately, my anxiety makes me second-guess myself and has made me miss gigantic pay-days (in the hundreds of thousands). But I can probably use my math-mind and resourcefulness to do well.

&amp;#x200B;

ANY and all advice would be appreciated. I want to find my true purpose and work on it while I am stuck in bed."

iffyod,14,2020-08-23,Signs you're not meant for software engineering?,shykakapo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iffyod/signs_youre_not_meant_for_software_engineering/,"What are some signs that you aren't cut out for doing software engineering? I had my first software engineering internship and I'm considering switching paths to something else (I'm an INFP).  Here's some of reasons why I don't like software engineering, and I'm curious to know if they're legitimate reasons to switch paths: 

1) I'm not passionate about tech, I'm more of a human-centered person. I like seeing my efforts impact the quality of someone's life and/or help them grow. I hated staring at a screen, alone in my house, for 8 hours a day.  

2) If software engineering didn't pay well, I don't think I'd do it.

3) I consider myself a dumb coder. I read the documentation and StackOverflow and often still can't solve my problems. I end up banging my head on the table all the time, and every time I struggle, I question whether this path is right for me. My master's degree in CS is useless in terms of providing basic CS fundamentals. I'm not smart enough to write good code or understand how to debug my problems, so I tend to just give up easily. That being said, I can probably leetcode well enough to get a good job (I did for an internship), but I don't think it reflects my actual abilities in a project environment.

I wanna know if I'm headed on the road to more misery by pursuing software engineering, or do I not have enough experience yet? (I've hated every day of the internship I had though :( )"

I recently graduated with a degree in psychology and linguistics, and have had reasonable experience with programming (R/ Python etc, through bootcamps and MOOCs + schoolwork).

One field I’ve become quite interested in is Natural Language Processing, particularly in data analysis and applied AI such as chatbots. 

While I’ve tried looking for trainee positions / internships that could give me more exposure, many employers are asking for Master’s or CS / Engineering degrees. I don’t have any of that, and i don’t know if it’s worth doing postgraduate studies in those degrees, given my current skills and the narrow subfield NLP lies in. 

I would appreciate advice regarding the following points:
1. is NLP a field worth pursuing (in terms of job opportunities/ career progression and earning potential) 
2. Besides enrolling in a CS or Engineering masters, is there any way I could make myself more employable? (Eg bootcamps/ professional certifications from Google) 
3. Are Kaggle competitions recognised by employers?"

So I (24M) have my bachelors degree in business marketing and have a masters degree in business administration. In my previous work experience, I believe I had excelled and brought significant value to the companies I had worked for. For example, I was hired on as an intern, hired on full-time, then finally  offered a marketing manager position all within a year of working for the company. I left the manager position about 8 months later to pursue a career in the sports industry (being in the sports industry is where I wanted to be all along). I was 22 at that point and still had 6 months left in my master's program. I was accepted into a 8-month training program where I did sales and then went into digital media. I generated the highest revenue amongst my peers in both season ticket sales and group ticket sales. At the end of the program, the team had no open positions, so I unfortunately had to part ways. That was in September of 2019. 

Unfortunately, from September to now, I haven't even been able to land a job or even an interview. Obviously since the Pandemic, sports teams are really not hiring, so I have been applying for jobs in all industries. I've probably sent out 150-200 applications for positions across the US and I've hardly got a response from any. The ones I did get a response from send the generic ""sorry, we decided to pursue other candidates"" email, so it doesn't help me get an idea on why they said no. I've called and emailed asking for feedback, but I never get a response. 

I was able to get a minimum wage job just because I couldn't afford my insurance and prescription costs (I'm a type 1 diabetic, so my monthly costs are high to say the least and I am still losing money every month), but I have no future here, so I am still looking and applying.

I guess what my question is, for those of you that may have gotten a job during this pandemic, what have you done to make yourself stand out? Any tricks you can share with me so I can at least land an interview? I'm confident in my abilities and know that I can be successful wherever I end up, but it doesn't seem that that message gets across to hiring managers. I've sent out my resume to get critiqued several times and it hasn't helped. I edit my resume prior to applying for a position so I can add key words from the job description, still hasn't helped. 

Legitimately, any feedback or nuggets of wisdom will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

In my country, Singapore, more efforts and investment are initiated from the government to push data analytics and AI to be implemented in business and is one of the driver of the national economic plans. I'm new to the community and will like to ask the people here about career advice here in data science/AI.

I was thinking doing another masters degree in georgia tech Online Masters of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program as part-time to further deepen my skills and be exposed to new ideas on how people apply analytics.(will it help in my career or progress my career faster?). I thought a degree with the brand name from georgia tech, can expose me to new career opportunities overseas. If relevant, I am 27-29 years old.

Academics:

* Masters in Information System
   * I will finished my Masters in Information System from National University of Singapore this December, which is a #10 University Ranking Globally - QS World University Rankings by Subject 2019.
   * I took four data science related courses mainly related to machine learning and predictive analytics.
      * big data technologies(hadoop &amp; spark)
      * predictive analytics (machine learning)
      * intelligent system (more qualitative)
      * data mining
* Economics Undergraduate degree
   * Prior, I had an economics major background and graduated with the highest honour from a regionally recognised school in Singapore.

Job:

* Transaction Banking Product management experience - 1 year. My first job as a trainee for a year in a international bank.
* Data analyst, currently I have also secured a role in another leading international bank as a data analyst that uses predictive analytics and ML (not yet started).

My ultimate aim is to be a data scientist that uses AI or maybe an AI role but less on being a developer part. I'm not so much interested about business intelligence too. In the long term, I will like to grow into a even more rewarding career in the future. I dont have a preference in industry, but given my work experience and internships, I thought its more efficient to pursue something in the financial industry.

May the community here please give some perspectives and advise? Anything is welcome, will like to hear all views. :D"

Honest opinions, advice, help?",yohleroux,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ifk4ou/just_miserably_failed_my_3rd_coding_assessment/,"Hey guys! I just submitted my RobinHood coding assessment answering only 1 out of 4 tasks. read the last 3 but didn't try because I was not motivated ( mainly because of the difficulty ), tired, and clearly not prepared enough. This happened after taking Cisco's and Citi's assessments and feeling like I did awful on both last week. Here's my situation:

I started coding at 13, played around a few languages and interesting projects ( Ruby/RoR chatting website, C# Unity games, C/C++ maths games ( card/casino games ). Because of how early that was I always did fine and learned/got through these projects with tutorials and at my own pace. Never got pressured for solving a problem or answering someone's demand for a deadline. I started CS classes in College where deadlines and requests started to appear but I passed every one of my classes with an A ( no bragging intended, it doesn't mean anything ). But here's my problem:

I am starting the semester right now taking Software Development but I am at the same time looking for an internship for next Summer and I'm AWFUL at taking coding assessments. First, how bad is it? I know these assessments are doable, I'm just not prepared, an intensive preparation would do the job but I don't have one right now and with the semester starting I don't think I can get myself to become a coding assessment killer in the next few weeks. I guess I need some reassuring rn because I feel like giving up and waiting for the winter break to get ready for assessments. Will good and fun and rewarding internships still be available in December/January? Any opinions, advice? I'm just looking for a little help in this process in which I feel totally alone.

PS: As a lot of people mentioned ( wrongly? ), this subreddit makes a lot of students powerless seeing how well everyone is doing. I would love to hear from people who don't usually post or people who feel like me, so if you're doing good or even okay but don't feel like you can kill every assessment in the world ( OR at least one, we need ONE ) just let me know."
ifkdq1,2,2020-08-24,Can't forget my ex after 5 years with no contact,mikecicada,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ifkdq1/cant_forget_my_ex_after_5_years_with_no_contact/,"In school, I fell deeply in love with a new girl who joined our class. I had a big crush on her for all primary and high school, we were really close and always talked in class etc. Until, one day her best friend asked me ""What would you do if you knew she (my ex) likes you"", so I talked with my ex and she told me her feelings for me, we started dating and I honestly felt so happy, I don't think I have felt any happier ever since that time. She would always tell me she loved me, that we were gonna get married and make a lofe together. 

Each time we had a discussion she would say how much she loved me to end it. Sometimes I would get annoyied by her in school and ignore her. For her birthday I burned a cd with her favorite songs, when she openned it in class everyone laughed at her and she didn't even say thank you for it or even talked about it. Her best friend gave her a fancy baloon that she took around school for the day and everyone thought I gave it to her. 

However, I was a childish inmature 15 year old who would always find a way to fuck things up with her until eventually she couldn't take it any more and broke up with me. I was sad, cried and had never felt like that before, my apetite decaied, I lost weight and overall feelt awful. 

To make things even worse, my grandfather was feeling very bad and my family had to be away most of the day to take care of him. 

I was still talking with her at the time, like before we dated, but I still loved her but I knew there was no way we could be a thing again and it hurt like shit. 

One day I was just done for, I couldn't take going back to being friends like it never happened. So the only way I thought I could get my life back was getting her out of my head ASAP. The next day, I started ignoring her 24/7, I would literally pretend she didn't exist, ignore her talking to me in person, block her on socials and even pretend I didn't know who she was with my friends. That apparently broke her, she would cry in class and get very upset. 

She also made me a letter saying that she was sad and sorry we didn't work out as everyone said we would. That it wasn't my fault or something I did that ended it, and that she knows I will eventually find someone who loves me. I don't fully remember it as I lost the letter, it was in a folder I sent to my teacher the last day of class, it was too late when I remembered were I left it. 

Years went by, I got into uni and never saw her again. 4 years later I'm one semester away from graduating, I will be the youngest of my class to get my degree and the first to graduate from my friends back in school. I got into the best internship out there for my major, and most of my friends always remember me how great and smart I am. 

Regardless of all this success, I just cant't get her off my head, I see her IG every now and then, stare at her pics and start remembering  my time with her and how a stupid arrogant asshole I was, I didn't know how to appreciate what I had. 

Thanks for reaching this point and finishing reading the post. Guys, what should I do? What do I do to forget about her an move on with life, I always told my self that time will eventually make me forget her and keep on with my life. I'm still into her. Sometimes I think this will all go away the day I male a clousure with her, end things the way it have ended. But she has a BF and has clearly moved on, she probaly thinks I'm an asshole and the worst thing that happened to her. 

I felt good writing this, I've never told this to anyone else. I will love and appreciate to have advice on this, how do you finally move on? I will be reading all the comments. Thanks for reading!!"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of dropping out, I am entering my 4th year of IT engineering school and it's gonna be a year now that I feel really underwhelmed by it. I believe I was depressed during high school and my first two years, but experiences last September cracked me open and I am in a way better place now. I went for IT bc all my teens were spent on a computer and I enjoyed basic coding classes but the deeper I go and the more I am annoyed.

I've been thinking since the beginning of the year in doing Data Science as a back up and a way to continue my degree, which I am trying to pursue. But I am required to find an internship and I can't seem to.

I don't know what else I could do so am thinking of taking a year off to find out and explore parts of myself that I haven't before due to my mental health/not being aware.

When I think of staying I feel stuck and not moving forward with my life, obstined in something that I don't know makes me happy.

Dropping out makes me relieved of a certain weight but in the meantime I am really scared of abandoning the hopes that I had at a good life, and 'waste' my year in doing activities that won't help me in moving forward.

How do I approach this ? I have around 2 months before I can last start my internship."

First off, I want to thank you for reading my story/question. I feel like that's something I should say off the top, whether or not it's standard practice (this isn't a sub I frequent often), but I don't want to burden anyone if they don't feel like reading a bunch.

I'm a 25-year-old, gay, white male. I have a very hard time communicating with people and maintaining friendships. Conversations with people rarely get beyond the task at hand (like a school or work assignment) or small talk; I really don't know much about anyone's personal life, except for the people I live with.

A major problem I have been struggling with recently is coping with people cutting you out from their lives/telling you not to talk to them because you said/did something that made them feel uncomfortable.

Right now, I'm in graduate school, and was running for a student government position earlier this summer. In my nomination letter, I wrote the following statement (edited to remove identifying info):

&gt;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. talked about how equality doesn’t happen until Black, Latinx and other communities have the ability to “cash a check” through which they can achieve equal societal status. Just making the law equal for all isn’t enough; we need to give underserved communities the platform and tools required to have the opportunity to become equal.  
Since joining the program, I have made it a priority to help “cash a check”. I have held internships through which I have supported people in majority-Black cities, and I am the only white person in our cohort who made the effort to work with minority students in both major school projects this Spring.

This statement angered one of the Black female students I had worked with in the spring, who felt like I was tokenizing her. That was the opposite of my intent, which was to prop up the needs of minority communities, not prop up myself. What's awkward, of course, is that I'm running for a political position, so I kind-of have to talk about the work I've done/efforts I've made to garner people's support.

So anyway, she texted me, saying in part ""If you wanted a pat on the back for working with someone black I wish you would've picked someone else."" I tried apologizing to her, talking about how much I respected her as a person and validating her feelings on the issue, but she didn't understand/accept the apology, saying ""You don't need to use minorities for points. You think black people get a cookie for every white person we work with?? No, not at all... You're an adult. Tighten up."" (That ""tighten up"" really pissed me off - it's not like I can just instantly learn what the right thing to say is, like a neurotypical person could - but I didn't bring that up to her, because I didn't want to create more conflict.)

2 months pass. I'm giving her space, to allow her time to process her feelings before reconnecting. This past week, I sent her a check-in text, asking how her summer went and sending her a video of my dogs. She responded by saying ""Can you not contact me unless it's work related. Thanks.""

This is an example of the most recent situation where I've been cut off/given the silent treatment. However, it's happened to me at least 5-6 times since I started undergraduate school 7 years ago, and I lost my post-undergrad job because my boss cited communication-based work conflicts I had with colleagues. I've never told anyone outside of my nuclear family about the intense social difficulties I face, because I work in communication-centric fields (like journalism and politics), and I've been worried that I wouldn't be offered work/school opportunities if people knew I was bad at interpersonal communicating. My two most recent internships ended on good terms, mainly because I was working on mostly independent projects where I didn't have to work with other people; however, I want to be a college professor in the future, so I'm going to have to be able to effectively communicate with administrators and students.

I want to know if there's effective ways adults like myself can both communicate better themselves and have the intent of their words be more primarily acknowledged by others, which would help me to not get cut off or the ""silent treatment"" again in the future. I also want to know if there's anything that can help me ""get over it"" when the cutting off happens, i.e. not dwell on it/become depressed over it (which has happened to me every time this situation has come up).

All support is welcomed, even if you're not sure of the answer yourself. :) Thanks in advance!"

ifmy3p,1,2020-08-24,AM4 Motherboard needed,chriSamot,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ifmy3p/am4_motherboard_needed/,"Hey guys, so 2 months ago my PC stopped booting and since then I've tried to repair it/had to wait for my internship wage to replace parts.  I've tried booting without my GPU, switched ram slots, disconnected drives etc. Now 2 days ago a work colleague borrowed me his ryzen 3 1200 to see if the problem was with my ryzen 5 1600. I changed the cpu but still nothing happened. So in conclusion I am pretty sure the Motherboard was fried somehow. It's the only part I wasn't able to change yet so I hope it's just the MOBO and nothing else in addition to that. Next week I am getting my first Paycheck so it's finally time to get the machine running again.

Long story short I need a new Mobo. I want something somewhat future proof so if I decide to upgrade to a 3rd Gen ryzen, which I am thinking about, that would be a possibility. Also my current Mobo (B350 Tomahawk Arctic) doesn't have any Bluetooth, I'd love to have that so I can connect my Xbox controller wireless.

I am a bit overwhelmed with the different models (B350/450/550(?), and the X470s(I think that's what they are called?)). 
So if anyone could recommend me something that's maybe in a budget under 200€, preferably 150 max, that would be really great, I miss playing csgo :(

Also I don't know if this comes with every Motherboard now but a M.2 slot for a new drive would be great, but it's not really a necessity. 

Thanks in advance! :) 

My specs are:
Ryzen 5 1600
Radeon 580 Nitro 8gb
15 GB DDR4 RAM 
128GB SSD
2 TB HDD
Corsair 650 Watt PSU

TLTR: Please recommend me a Motherboard for the specs above, which should be comfortable running a Ryzen 3rd Gen in the near future."

I'm a Belgian graduate CS student, looking to do a data science/engineering internship abroad starting in October/November. I've tried applying for some companies, but it's difficult to find companies willing to accept foreign students, so I was wondering if any of you guys know anything about companies who are offering special programmes for internationals? Or maybe someone has done something like this and can share their experience with the company?  


I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this question, if not please suggest another one 📷

ifq3hd,1,2020-08-24,Having a hard time with programming,kamyhp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ifq3hd/having_a_hard_time_with_programming/,"I have started an internship where were learning Full Stack(working from home). By the end of the internship the company will decide who theyll choose to keep.
It seems like programming is not that hard to learn, if you have the right mindset towards it. My problem seems to be my mental health. Because things are very unclear and I can not see the solution of the problem right away, I start panicking and I lose all concentration. If I try googling things, the stress of me not understanding things gives me more pressure and makes me feel like I don't understand what I'm reading. So, because of all this pressure I keep creating for myself, I am left behind with tasks and I am constantly fighting to survive rather to learn. My review so far was alright, but they stated I lack knowledge in things which I should have already covered.

At the moment, I already feel like I have wasted a good opportunity to start a career in programming. I cannot push myself to do things, yet when I'm pressured to do them I get stuck. All it takes is to sit down and never stop searching but even that is difficult for me.

Can't say I havent questioned my career choice. At least how my mind works right now, I am only making it worse for myself.

So my question would be, does someone have any advice for me?"

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class at MIT, and I've been involved in numerous secret engineering projects, and I have over 300 ECTS points. I am trained in advanced fluid mechanics and I'm the top intern in the entire company. You are nothing to me but just another problem to solve. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision tolerance the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. 

As we speak, I am contacting my secret network of computer science engineers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your career. You're fucking fired, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can out-CAD you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed calculation, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the stack overflow and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. 

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."
ifqr10,75,2020-08-24,Survival! (Day 20),PhilattheGame,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ifqr10/survival_day_20/,"The next morning we were greeted with a slight drizzle. I stood in our doorway and watch the rain. I could see people slowly going about their jobs. Since the smithy was undercover we could work without getting too wet. I felt sorry for the cooks and fishermen, no telling how long this drizzle would last. I decided to ask RJ to start making a cover over where the cooks were working. Ready for the wet I marched out into the rain. I of course slipped and fell. Great start to the day.

I found RJ just finishing the last house. He and a few others rushed to get the tiles on the last house. Some people were working on repairing the inside of the house. I just tried to say out of the way.

“Hey RJ!” I called.

“What’s up!”

“I was thinking, that when you get finished here you should start on making a pavilion for the cooking area,” I told him.

“No need to start!” RJ called back, “Matthew’s already started on that. Dines asked us about that the day after the big storm. We’ve been getting stuff ready since then. Sense Matthew finished his house yesterday he started building the pavilion today.”

“That's great! What are you starting on after this?” I asked.

“Most likely the meeting hall. We’ve got enough wood cut to start building a fully wooden house. So We’ll make the meeting hall out of wood. I heard that we got iron. I was hoping we could get saws and axes and make proper wooden homes at some point,” RJ told me as he put the last tile on the house. We all stood back and looked over the house.

“Looks good RJ. But don’t get carried away. Making iron isn’t easy. We got to make sure we get the impurities out of the iron. There’s no reason to just start with Iron though. I have what I need to make Steel. So once we’re set I’ll start making steel.” I told the excitable man.

“That’s good! I’m interested in making better houses for everyone.”

I left shortly after to look at what Matthew was doing, and to see how Leanna and Denis were doing. Matthew and the people helping him dug holes around the cooks. I watched as a woman, named Sofia, would finish digging a hole and someone would immediately place a ten-foot pole into the hole. Then Sofia would fill in around the pole. They did this while dancing around the cooks. The cooks were already soaking wet from the rain. I didn’t hear any complaints though. Leanna saw me and motioned me over. I dogged workers and made it over to her.

“How's it going?” I asked.

“Good! I remember that you haven’t had a potato yet. So try this.” She told me as she delicately picked a yam like a tuber out of the pot.

I took a bit of the tuber. I did taste similar to a potato, but it did have a gritty taste to it.

“If you mix it with the basil plant, it tastes even better. I hope we can find other stuff to mix with it. I want a baked potato at some point,” Leanna told me.

“That would be good. I haven’t had a baked potato in a long time. I wonder if the hairy pig thing makes good bacon?” I wondered.

“We’ll have to see. David hasn’t crossed any pigs recently. He thinks that if he goes south he’ll find more of the pigs. There seems to be nothing to the north, and to the east, the bigger animals seem to keep the pigs away. We’ll test out making bacon next time David and Tim bring one back.”

I thanked Leanna for the food and went to the smithy. Hannah, Edward, Oliver, and the other smith were waiting for me. The first thing we did was go over what Oliver and Henry IV. They had made some progress. Henry IV had figured out how to make good glue. Fiber hadn’t made good armor, so they had started getting the long fur from the hair pig and weaving it. The nine days we were gone had given them enough time to make a basic linothorax. I wouldn’t want to wear it to battle, but it was a good first try. Oliver had been working on different styles. He had one started specifically for Staff Sergeant Samuel. Rolled my eyes when I saw it. He had done the weird thing of adding actual breasts to the design. I don’t know why people did this. Couldn’t see a good reason to add such a design to armor. But go look up codpieces in medieval armor for some ridiculous unnecessary designs.

I gave Oliver a look. “Did you really need to have the breasts?” I asked.

Oliver threw up his hands in defense, “believe it or not but it was Samuels’ idea. I wasn’t going to add them, but she wanted her armor to stand out and suggested the addition.”

I rolled my eyes. “I’m sure you didn’t suggest an alternative,” I deadpanned.

“I just do what the client wants,” He said unabashedly.

“Right, and you just have to suffer and make it.”

“That’s what the lady wants.”

“You're awful,” I stated.

Hannah was in a fit of giggling, And everyone else thought it was all good fun.  We left Oliver and Henry IV to their work and started working on the copper and iron. With Stephanie still gone we only had half of the trained smiths left. But we got down to it.

Without Coke, not the drink, we couldn’t make steel yet. But while I had been sleeping Henry IV hand-gathered limestone and had several people start making coal coke. It would take several days to make enough coke to start the process of making steel.

So we started melting down what we had of copper. I hoped it would remove any impurities in the copper. Not that there seemed to be any.  If Stephnie brought back tin we would have to get the impurities out of the tin as well, but this would have to do until then.

Many hot hours later I was pleased with the finished product. From what I could tell the copper was near to pure as it could be. Darwin and Edward had already started making molds for utensils and tools. All we needed was hammers and something to grind on and we would be set. There was other stuff to it as well, but we had what we initially needed.

As nice as this distraction was I still had a bigger issue to deal with. Handing the project over to Darwin, I went to find Tim.

He had just got back from a hunt, the first time he had come back empty-handed.

“There’s nothing to the North and East. David found more stuff in the South. So we’ll have enough food. As much as I like fish, any additional food is appreciated.” He told me.

“That’s good. I am getting worried about Stephenie’s group. If she doesn't show up today. I would like for you to take some people and go looking for her. Hopefully, they’re just overburdened and going slow,” I told Tim.

He nodded and went to talk to David.

I spied Rebecca, but she turned tail as soon as she saw me. It looked like her influence was faltering because the only person I saw her with was Jerrod. I remembered that something had happened during the time I was away. I went and looked for Mama F.

Sure enough, four days after we had left Rebecca had tried to have Jerrod take over.

“So what happened?” I inquired of Mama F.

“Well, Jerrod started to say that it wasn’t right for Samuels to be ordering us, civilians, around. He tried to get a bunch of people to agree with him. He pushed a little too hard, started name-calling, and the like.

He caught Oliver down by the river and got into a fight. I was in a bad mood that day. I clobbered the boy. He hit me back, and well… Let’s just say I was in a really bad mood.

Everyone saw what he did, and all the people who had started agreeing with him jumped ship. From what I heard Rebecca lost a lot of face and lost more when she insisted that we were making it up about the Lizards.”

I felt bad about the fight, but there was nothing to be done now. I would have to check with Peggie and find out what she had learned. I excused myself and headed back.

I avoided thinking about our new neighbors. Not wanting to make a firm decision until Stephanie was back with her group. I hadn’t asked David if he had sent anyone to watch for the Lizards. I needed to do that.

Sometime later I was helping erect part of the walls with Peggie and Samuels. David had sent four hunters North and they promised not to be seen. It would be some time before they could come back. Dines had given them ample supplies.

That taken care of, I offered to help with the wall and to learn what Peggie had dug up about Rebecca.

“From what Janice learned, we have us a little celebrity here. Rebecca is the daughter of a former congresswoman. From what I remember Olivia Roma Stephens was acting as an advocate for some third party in Washington.

Rebecca’s father is Joshua Reynolds. He is a scientist out of Harvard. What exactly he works in is unknown, but Olivia usually brings him in when she needs an “Expert”.

It was a big deal when Rebecca started down the path to be a botanist. Olivia had already secured Rebecca’s place in Washington. Jerrod told Janice that after Rebecca’s little trip to Mexico, she was going to start her internship in Washington. But this happened.”

Peggie told me all this while we carried logs to the wall. The three of us dropped the end of the log in the hole and packed the soil around it.

“That explains how she is so good at getting what she wants, but not why she’s doing it,” I said as we started back.

Samuels shook her head. “I thank it does. She’s smart. And she probably thinks she should be either in charge or at least the one everyone should be asking what to do. I suspect that this is the first time in her life no one’s been hanging on her every word. Other than when someone needs to know about plants, no one asks her opinion. Not to mention making her work like everyone else,” Samuels guessed.

I wasn’t so sure. “Maybe, but no one, so far, is unwilling to do the work. As far as I can tell everyone here is capable of the work. I don’t think anyone not able or capable was sent here. Rebecca could really believe that I shouldn't be in charge,” I said.

Peggie bit her lower lip before replying, ”I don’t know either, but Janice will be able to get more out of Jerrod sooner or later. Rebecca is only hanging out with Jerrod now, the group that supported her has drifted away.”

Samuels gave a half-grin, “I know you wouldn’t do it, but while you were gone I implemented ‘if you don’t work you don’t eat’. There’s no one who is not able to work, so there were no excuses.”

I frowned at her, but she continued, “I didn’t keep it in play long. Most of Rebecca’s group ditched her as soon as they missed a meal. And when I told everyone that Mama F would be the de facto leader while I got the troops ready, that basically ended Rebecca’s group.”

Surprise I looked at Samuels, “Did you actually give Mama F command?”

“Hell ya. I hate being in command. I wish I had never been given the rank of Staff Sergeant. I went from Sergeant to Staff Sergeant overnight. Some higher up decided he wanted to look good by having me as his Staff Sergeant. I never intended to go beyond Sergeant, but…” She said and stared off into space.

“Ok, I understand. Does that mean that when Jerrod got into a fight with Mama F she was in charge?” I inquired.

Peggie got really mad at that. “No, but I wish she had been. Maybe I could have used it as an excuse to deal with him and Rebecca!”

“And done what? Exile them, put them in jail? We don’t have enough people as is. As much as I want to make it stop, we can’t force everyone to obey. We need everyone to cooperate. Maybe we can work something out with them,” I offered.

“I’m not sure it will work out the way you want, Peter. I don’t think Rebecca will stop till she gets what she wants. Right now everyone is sourer on her. But give her one chance and she’ll use it against you,” Samuels warned.

“We’ll just have to see,” I replied.

Around 6 or 7 we stopped for the day. I left and checked in on Darwin and Edward. They figured they'd have proper utensils by tomorrow. Poor Ed had burnt his hand while trying to cast a simple spoon. Not too bad, but he wouldn’t be doing anything delicate for a couple of days.

I went to check on the Coal Coke. One of the other smiths, Mark was working on it. Everyone was taking turns making the Coal Coke. It was great that we had what we needed to make it. Mark used to make it at home, just to see if he could. Thanks to the Fish we had the oil we needed. It was more complicated than all that, but with someone knowledgeable we could get by.

I left Mark to it and checked on everyone else. The Cooking area was almost finished, and Dine was pleased with what they had.

Justin and the other people who had worked on flint were next. They now only had to repair damaged tools and spears. They didn’t need anything, so I left them to it.

Next was Austin and Victoria. They were hard at work creating more cups and plates. Victoria gave me a wave and went back to work as I talked to Austin. Not much had changed since yesterday. The rain had ruined some clay tiles, but other than that it was all good.

I went around and finished checking on everyone. The most interesting thing was Susan’s bow. She happily showed me her work. Doc had set up a target for us. And Susan and  Pippen stood by as I loosed an arrow at the target. I missed of course, but the second one managed to hit the target.

It was amazing and we could hardly wait till she made some more.

Doc was almost finished with making his first set of clothing. All he needed now was his other skins to finish drying and we could start on another.

Nothing else of note was happening. Food was good, Leanna had started a garden to grow more of the potatoes and other food. Fish was a’plenty. Despite the animals moving south, hunting was still good. Who knew how long before the animals caught on that we were a predator. David had already set up an area to hold the Pigs in. There was no way we could hold the Deers in, not with how far they could jump. Other things were in the works too. The little birds that we got eggs from could be rounded up and kept as well. They didn’t seem to fly very often. So food was set.

Stephenie’s group hadn’t shown up yet. So Tim had gotten five others and planned to head out in the morning. I was worried about them. But I probably didn’t need to. The group was very experienced.

We had our little meeting shortly after that. Nothing new was brought up. Everyone wanted to know what we would do about our neighbors. I still hadn’t made a decision about it. It would be a huge decision to make.

“I want to wait till Stephenie and her group are back. I’ll make the decision then.” I told everyone.

That night I had a hard time getting to sleep. Despite all the work I had done I was still restless. Too much had happened and I had too much on my mind. While everyone was sleeping I snuck out of my home and got on top of the wall. O’Malley was the only other person I saw awake. But he let me be. I guess he saw that I had a lot on my mind.

Walking up and down the wall I was deep in thought. I didn’t know what to do. There was so much going on. The lizards, the wall, making better homes, and so much more. We need to send more people out to gather resources. Maybe build boats to make it easier to transport the Copper and Iron. It could be easier if we made contact with the Lizards or it might make things worse. I needed more information. But with every bit of new information, it only seemed to make things more complicated. I huffed out a breath in frustration.

“You kinda sound like a train when you do that!”

I almost jumped out of my skin, when Victoria spoke.

“How long have you been there?” I said, hand over my pounding heart.

“Not too long. Are you all right?” She asked.

“Ya, you just scared me,” I replied dryly.

“No not that!” Victoria probed.

“I don’t know,” I said looking at the moons, “I don’t know what to do. There’s too much going on and I can’t make a firm decision. I’m worried that I might make the wrong one. There’s a lot of lives at stake here. If I make a mistake it could end badly for everyone.”

Victoria looked over our homes. “So far you’ve done a good job,” She pointed out.

“Thanks, but I’ve been gone half the time as well,” I pointed out.

“So? You delegated responsibility, got everyone ready, and it worked out in the end.” Victoria said smiling at me.

“Uh…”

“Come on dude. Don’t let yourself get bogged down by your own thoughts. Almost everyone believes you're doing a great job. Stop letting a handful of people make you lose your confidence,” She reminded me. Then she slugged me on the shoulder.

“Get it in gear!” She ordered.

“All right, all right.” I laughed. “Thanks Vic. You always seemed to be able to cheer me up.”

“No worries. I’ll keep it up as long as I can. You just keep on moving forward and I’ll keep on kicking your butt.” She joked.

We looked over or home for several minutes. I was about to head down when Victoria suddenly hugged herself and shuddered.

“Do you ever get the feeling that someone’s watching you?” She asked.

I looked at her and my stomach dropped out. I whipped my head towards the woods. A large gray shape was disappearing down the trail to the river.

“Shit!”

I’ve been actively searching for over a year. I’ve easily had over 10 in person interviews, yet never have the skills they’re looking for.

I’ve taught myself java in highschool, and have been programming as a hobby for the past 8 years. I graduated two years ago in mathematics(which I suspect has been hurting me), and I’ve had two internships throughout college.

In my free time, I’ve mostly been doing fullstack python development. However, most of my hobby projects are not public, but they are used by people. I've worked on backend java systems for 3 years in one of my internships. My experience in languages are: 6 years of java, 5 years of javascript, 4 years of python.

6 months after college, I found a job at cognizant, a major consulting company, as a java springboot/react dev. The job was a joke, I went through 2 months of training. Then I was on the bench for the next 7 months before being laid off, last november. I picked both springboot and react up pretty well, but didn’t do anything with them so I can’t say I know them. This has made my job search pretty difficult, because I have nothing to say about what I did there other than learning soft skills, which it doesn’t seem like recruiters care about. Should I take cognizant off my resume and stop talking about them completely?

Another problem is that springboot/react is very popular among companies, which I am very experienced in java, yet I don’t really know the frameworks. I have very little motivation to learn them because I much prefer my stack of python/vue. Even if I learn them, I still wouldn’t have the deep experience in them that everyone is looking for to get a job soon.

I don’t really know what to do now. Should I go back to school and get a CS degree? I’d rather not, but I could. Should I switch over to projects that look good on my resume? I feel like it’s a bit late and I have little motivation."

ifttzn,1,2020-08-24,How should I let hiring managers know about my arm injuries?,nukethehomeless,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ifttzn/how_should_i_let_hiring_managers_know_about_my/,"Location: currently I live in Utah, but there are many other states in the US I might move to for work such as California, Oregon, or Idaho.


I believe this post will relate mostly to title 1 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but I’m sure there are other laws as well. I’m still a little confused as to how this applies to me, so I’m seeking more advice here.


In December I will finish my masters degree in computer engineering, so I am starting to look for a job to start afterwards. About 2 years ago I started to get pain in my forearms/elbows. About 1.5 years ago the pain was bad enough that I couldn’t really type on a computer anymore. A little over a year ago I got surgeries on both of my arms. My doctor informed me that it usually takes around a year to recover from this surgery. I can still only type for small amounts of time, and I’m starting to get worried about if I really will ever fully heal.  I’m now trying to figure out how to work a job where I’m on a computer 90% of the time without using my arms very much.


Over the last couple years I’ve gotten pretty good at using speech to text, so I have still been able to complete all of my schoolwork as a full-time student. Admittedly, it does take me longer to get stuff done, but I am still completing my courses with good grades.


I just barely finished a 12 week coding internship and I feel like I could’ve handled the legal side of my arm injuries better. During the interview process, I told my manager (who was performing the interview) about my arm injuries, and he basically just shrugged it off saying that the company was very accommodating. When I filled out the paperwork, however, I did not identify as having a disability, and I was nervous excepting the position they offered me. An office with a bunch of cubicles is loud enough that it interferes with my speech to text. When it came time to work, the entire company was working from home, and it was during this internship that I realized working from home is great for me. I am currently slower at coding and using a computer in general, but I did exceed the expectations by a decent amount as far as how much they wanted me to accomplish.


Questions: when filling out job applications, should I mark that I have a disability and explain my arm situation there, or simply bring it up during the interview process?

I see the ADA says companies must provide “a reasonable accommodation.”  Is allowing me to work from home or providing a space in the office that is quiet “reasonable?”

The ADA makes it illegal to discriminate against individuals with disabilities. Would I qualify as an individual with disabilities? Is there anything I need to do to register my disability?


Thanks in advance for any help. I’m glad to clarify in the comments if anything is unclear."

I read a bit here about remote working, but most of the threads were before the coronavirus crisis. I read that most of the offers were for experienced developers, hard to find junior job offers. Has anything changed at all as far as you know thanks to this crisis?  


I live in the Alps near Milan and corona in a sense was a blessing for me. I've been working for almost a year first as intern then as junior developer and it cut my daily commute which was 150-200 minutes every day. Also my quality of life has massively improved since my hometown has better living conditions than Milan - and although I never relocated when you spend 10 hours a day there you feel the difference.  


Aside from that I know very well mostly thank to this sub that working in Milan is a terrible choice in this field but considering how I want to live my life it's the only place other than maybe Switzerland where I can work on site. That's why I was wondering if I should look for a fully remote job and especially when to do it.

ifv2pr,2,2020-08-24,Have a burnt the bridge with a pat employer?,VikingKing42,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ifv2pr/have_a_burnt_the_bridge_with_a_pat_employer/,"Not sure if This is right spot or not. And it’s kinda long. 

So I am just trying to figure out if I have fully burnt the bridge with a company I did a 6-7 months “internship” with.

Out of college I was looking for jobs in my field of study. Most of those jobs looked boring and didn’t really appeal to me. So I started looking for other jobs that I think would interest me. I have always had a love for construction and the equipment just always intrigued me. So I applied to Construction Company and ended up in talks with a company a state over. They said they were interested but wanted me to work in the field beforehand so I could get some experience and see if this is actually something wanted to do because my degree was not in this field. That’s why I say “internship” because it wasn’t really one but kind of was.

Any ways times goes by and they decide they want to extend an offer to me and now it’s up to me to decide if I want to work for them or not. I came to the conclusion that for reasons I did not want to work for them. Reasons being I wanted to stay in the certain city I lived in at the time, and all my friends were planning on moving back to same city and we could all continue to hangout, the GF (now fiancé) was fine with living in the city I wanted to even though her home town was 9 hours away.

2 months go by while I’m searching for another job and they reach back out to me to see if I have found anything yet as they have not filled the position they first offered me. I had not yet but had some interviews lined up. So he’s has a project coming up in my town and is thinking I would help run that project from my town and maybe afterwards move back over and continue my growth or if other project arose in my town could stay and manage them from here. Well I guess once you get one offer all other people decide to offer too. I end up with 1 other offer for permanent in my home town making better than this second offer from the company has offered me. But I told the first company who I turned down that I would like to take this second opportunity they offered me because of the fast growth and high potential. The next day a 3rd company offers me a big pot almost 20-25k more than the job I just verbally agree to take.

I called the first company back to ask him some questions like if I would get a bonus at end of project and to tell him about this other offer. (if it were 5k or so not a big deal but 20k is a big deal that needs to be brought up). At this point he had had enough of my and pretty much told me to grow up and stop being a damn kid and told me were done before I could tell him why exactly I was calling I only got first half of my sentence out before it was over. I sent a follow up email explaining what my purpose was and how I’m sorry the way it ended and hope he understand and I copied the owner to the email so he would see my side of what happen in case he hear something different. Of course no response wasn’t expecting one but just wanted to hopefully end on better terms.

It’s now been 7-8 months sense and things are not going well with the company I went with. Not that there are complaints or struggles but just that I am not progressing like I wanted and the boss here doesn’t not seem to care if I work or not. When started I was always asking for work to do and would be given some. But then it got to the point where I would ask and get something that would take 5 minutes or short work followed by “give me a second and I’ll bring you something to work on” followed by no work and me sitting at my desk for hours. I haven’t done any work in month or now and pretty much play on my phone or googles how to do certain tasks for my future. I’m planning on leaving soon and trying to work somewhere where they will have work and help me progress in this field better.

I have thought about maybe reaching back out to the first company I did my internship with but well unsure how they feel about me now. And for most of the reason I wanted to not move there have changed like with Covid and friends being back during college we did not hangout as much as I thought we would so now I’m fine living 2-3 hours away and making a drive up on weekend if we plan events. And the GF (fiancé) has voiced she wanted to live closer to her fam which this place would allow us to be 5-4 hours from her fam and 3-4 from mine so all the big reason I didn’t want to move have now all be debunked. I would put in that the owner seemed to like me and think I would be a good worker because he had called me personally one night to try and tell me how successful people are who work for him and when I first met with them after interning awhile he was very impressed by how much knowledge I had picked up in a short amount of time.

So hopefully it’s not too long and you were able to follow along.

Let me know if you need me to clarify anything.

Here is the twenty-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

So to preface, I moved to a new state from California after graduating undergrad to do an internship. The internship offers housing. On paper, this was the perfect internship for me, but the actual job is so menial and stressful. It will end in about 4 months, by the way.

Yesterday I was in a situation with my supervisor which ended up making me cry for upwards of 30 minutes. I came into this thing so excited yet it is not giving me any fulfillment whatsoever. I hate the new state I moved to (the climate is nice, but the aura and the people are just.... ugh), and a few days into work already has me fucking shit up and crying. Last night I ended up getting lightheaded and unable to feel my limbs.

I know it is only a temporary position, but I started less than a week ago and I feel absolutely miserable. I am ridiculously homesick and I have not felt truly happy the entire time I've been here. I feel lost and scared. And I feel like my parents will be incredibly disappointed in me if I tell them the truth of how I feel (sidenote, they are not the overbearing types; I am an only child and my mom never even graduated college. But I still will feel like a huge failure if I pull out, especially since we came all the way out here)

I am fully willing to pay my parents back for helping me get to the new state once I get a position back home. Many people will tell me that it doesn't seem worth it, but I am telling you, I am absolutely fucking miserable. And that's completely odd because I completed and internship before this of the same exact job description and I loved it (granted this was also close to home)

I legit feel like I have nowhere to go. 4 months is temporary, yes, but I do not want to feel miserable for 4 straight months. I am absolutely baffled at how much I am disliking this internship. I miss my college and my old life, and I want to go home, really bad.

I am beyond flabbergasted how much I am disliking this...."
ifxdob,8,2020-08-24,[IWantOut] 22M US -&gt; EU or East Asia,undergr4dquestions,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/ifxdob/iwantout_22m_us_eu_or_east_asia/,"Hello r/IWantOut, to preface this I am **not** looking to move because of the election, although it certainly doesn't make me fond of staying. I graduated with a BA in political science this past May and since have been working a number of part time office jobs within my mother's company doing everything from web development to billing/reconciliation to apparently now (potentially) some work handling payments. Frankly, not at all what I thought I'd be doing and for the pay ($10/hr) although its higher than the regional average its less than what I would've made had I just stayed in the major city I used to live around. I'm happy to have work right now don't get me wrong, but my home environment is toxic and the amount of stress related to work that I'm having put on me due to how the business is being mismanaged is inordinate to the amount of work I'm supposed to be putting in as a part-timer. 

Neither of my parents can believe me when I tell them what the salary expectations are where I used to live in DC, that I have ""too high expectations""(40k/yr is basically standard) and should just ""take what you can get and be happy with it"". From parents who refuse to get tested or actually listen to their son and help him plan out a path forward. My extended family in the States is no better, and often puts money over family. I have the ability to get an EU citizenship and was in the process of getting passports secured before COVID, but the relevant Embassy has now decided to cancel most if not all appointments for the rest of the year due to how the US has handled the outbreak. I am aware salaries in the rest of the world are lower, I am more than willing to take a comparative pay cut at this rate if it means I can get out of my current living situation and not have to deal with my family.

My undergrad was in large part focussed on studying East Asia, I speak decent Mandarin but never was able to take classes but am studying for the new HSK-5 as well as an AWS certification. My internship primarily focussed on data analysis and web/app development, so I've got experience there. I have about 30k in student loan debt at (averaged out) 4% interest, half of it subsidized half unsubsidized (the principal was around 25k). In terms of savings provided I manage to save up I may be looking at 5k by January, plus around $3000 in savings bonds I'm likely going to just throw at my loan interest. 

With regard to the EU, I have made contacts in Estonia and Latvia to where I can potentially live in Riga or Tallinn for 6-12 months over the next year working in web or app development. Average salary from what I keep hearing is around 1800 euros per month, I'd be able to crash with a friend of mine so rent would be next to nothing and I could throw all the money I wanted at my loans and save the rest. I also have family in my country of potential citizenship, but due to my parents not willing to lift a finger or even give me the paperwork, I'm hoping I can somehow convince tech recruiters/companies to hire me on. 

With regard to East/ SE Asia, I can in theory either go to China, Japan with JET, Korea, or Vietnam. I can't go to Taiwan, in large part thanks to their blanket ban on the visually impaired. Whereas its just a serious life impediment and I need to hide it in all the other places I've looked into, Taiwan explicitly bans the visually impaired from having work permits either through Fulbright or more generally based on afaik monetary concerns related to their national health service. Additionally, I am aware that salaries broadly speaking allow for some people to save in excess of $1000 a month depending on location (Korea and China this is easier, Vietnam is more likely to be $600 in savings). 

If it means I have to teach English for a year or two before moving into consulting, or into some other line of work, I'd be more than fine with that. I think it's a great stepping stone into a new place, and I'd take the time to not just gain proficiency in a tech stack/pay down loans, but also learn the local language and try to develop connections to where I could go into more office/creative work outside of teaching English. I know full well that I'm not the first person to want to make moves like this, certainly not during the pandemic. Ultimately what I would *like* to do is go get a Masters before I'm 25, but I left that out primarily because I'm not confident with a 2.9 GPA I can get in anywhere decent abroad with scholarships/funding to lessen debt burden. 

Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this, I hope you all have a wonderful Monday!"
ifxepi,374,2020-08-24,Reminder that FAANG is not the be-all-end-all of CS,TigerLilly00,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ifxepi/reminder_that_faang_is_not_the_beallendall_of_cs/,"I love that there are communities such as these to help CS students in their school and their careers. Lots of invaluable advice and insight can be taken from places such as these.

It's an unfortunate reality that there will be toxicity in basically any community you go to. In CS, that toxicity often tends to take the form of extreme pride and arrogance. The idea that you're a failure if you don't get that internship/job at one of the most prestigious companies, that you're doing something wrong if you're not leetcoding 23/7, and conceited and egotistical people making you feel inferior to them bc they've had an internship at a Big N.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but absolutely none of this speaks for your worth. I know the race can get to people's heads and it's very very easy to feel like you're not good enough if you're not achieving ridiculous goals. This impacts people's sense of self worth, confidence, and gives them impostor syndrome.

I know several people who work both at big tech companies and not. After you break it into industry, it stops becoming such a huge deal. I know people who make less money at smaller companies, who get messages from recruiters at Google, Facebook, Netflix, w/e, but wouldn't leave for the world, because they're happier there. At the end of the day, being a software engineer will still mean you're one one of the most well-valued professionals in the world. You'll be well off, whether you get a FAANG-type job or not.

Working in this industry isn't just about prestige. It's finding a place where you can have a good work-life balance, a place where you can enjoy financial stability, and most importantly, a place you actually look forward to going to every morning.

If you don't get the job you want right out of college, it's not the end of the world. You work in industry for a few years, better yourself, keep learning, and never stop trying. It'll happen for you sooner or later.

And please, lift each other up, help each other in this quest, don't tear each other down. You don't know the person on the other side of the screen, you don't know what damage you might be causing them when you tear them down to make yourself feel better.

Please don't be rude in the comments. I'm bringing this up because it needs to be said once in a while, and especially now with recruiting season upon us.

Best of luck to everyone this recruiting season! Keep your ideals high, your hopes higher, and never let small failures stop you from continuing to strive to be the best YOU you can be."

I am currently a Masters student in Computer Science in the US, but will be finishing my program (hopefully) by next summer. Until then, I would like to think about preparing job searching and opportunity seeking for working in Quebec.

I have been to Quebec 4 times (Montreal, Quebec City, Trois Rivières) and have loved it every time, it really fits my lifestyle and isn't too far from family despite being a refreshing change from the Southern USA (particularly in regards to politics and progressiveness). 

I am fluent in French and last summer I lived in France and carried out a Software Engineering internship there. 

My question is:

Should I try to get a job with a company based out of Quebec on some sort of work visa, or should I try to get a job with an American company and then transfer to Quebec? My ultimate goal would be to attain Canadian citizenship or permanent residence; are there stipulations or gotchas for American citizens, or (like in France) can I gain an expedited citizenship as I work in a STEM field?

Thank you"

(car accident, personal injury, pain and suffering)",simsgoddess,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ifyq01/is_it_worth_it_to_sue_car_accident_personal/,"Hello and thanks for your time guys. I'm going to break everything down into sections so its simple and easy to read as possible.  So I was in a car accident with my BF in the state of CA.  


edit: I edited this to hell since what I put seemed too confusing. I tried to simplify best I could guys! Thanks for your help!

**My question is should I lawyer up or just come right out and ask the insurance company for the money**? I don't think my bf cares if I sue his insurance so what makes more sense? My bf insurance covers I think up til 100,000 not sure if thats relevant though.  
Keep in mind my bf and I  are both completely ignorant of what's supposed to happen when you get into an accident and when I can seek treatment and the process for that.

Me and my BF were driving in his car - he the driver, and me the passenger. My BF made a left-hand turn after being cut off by another car and t-boned an oncoming vehicle. The officer at the scene incorrectly reported that I was in the t-boned vehicle and recorded my testimony;  this delayed my BF's claim with his insurance (i think) and my bf for a few months tried to fight the responsibility for the accident and they made it seem as though as long as he fought responsibility they could not pay for treatment and when he stoped fighting responsibility I had to turn in paper work in order for his insurance to pay my bills. 

I was told to wait to seek treatment on the advice of my BF, who claimed his insurance adjuster said there was a process to getting my bills paid which later when I spoke with the adjustor they confirmed. I asked my bf if he specifically talked to the insurance person and if they said specifically that I had to wait and he said yes. I over heard conversations with his adjuster and what he said seemed to hold true. I even spoke with the adjuster and we emailed each other out the paperwork and process back and forth so I had no reason to think there was something wrong. But when I finally did seek treatment, four months later, too much time had passed and his insurance company would no longer accept responsibility for the bills.  
I expressed this is what I was instructed to do by my bf and by the adjustor. We were given a new adjustor and the new adjuster told me to finish my treatment with the chiropractor and whatever else i need and when Im ready call and we can come to a settlement agreement. . .**My question is should I lawyer up or just come right out and ask the insurance company for the money**?  


This accident and dealing with his insurance company has been a nightmare. It had devastating effects on me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I stopped sleeping and my eating stopped as well (I have gastritis and endometriosis both of which are very sensitive and reacted violently after the accident), I lost clients during my internship and missed days which counted against my graduation from the program (I almost got kicked out for missing a birth esp during COVID it was not a good thing, a mom had to labor without the necessary personnel care) I was supposed to graduate last month but ultimately I couldn't perform well and was reprimanded. Which caused me a lot of stress and depression it took me 2 years to be accepted into this program and now I didn't graduate and my reputation had taken a major hit within the company.

1. I want to become a lecturer at my current school (SFSU) or any other school. I also want to use this degree as a stepping stone to possibly getting a PhD and becoming a full-fledged professor.
2. I graduated a year and a half early and I went to a commuter school so I really missed out on a lot of the typical college stuff.
3. My parents are paying for it so I don't need to take out loans (thanks so much guys)

That being said, NYU and Cal Poly are my main two choices. FYI I have a future internship at a Big4 so hopefully I get a FT offer as well! :)

**NYU Pros**

* Location, location, location
* Access to job opportunities in NYC
* Prestige
* My dream school since I was 12, didn't do nearly as well as I should have in hs to get in

**NYU Cons**

* Crazy expensive! (we're looking at 57k for tuition and about 13k for NYC living expenses)
* Extremely far from my long-term boyfriend

**Cal Poly Pros**

* Super cute beach town
* Much closer to my bf
* Probably easier academically than NYU
* Much cheaper but still expensive (26,350 for tuition) and 13k for living expenses
* Classic college experience, not sure how much of that a grad student would get though

**Cal Poly Cons**

* It's not NYU and isn't as ""glamorous""
* Still pretty expensive for a CSU

I've also considered attending SFSU for my master's, as it doesn't really matter where you get it and I love San Francisco and the big city life. I'm also very familiar with the school and the professors. The downside of this is that it's basically a repeat of undergrad. However, I've always wanted to attend a ""prestigious"" school (lol, I know). The cost of tuition is about 19k and for living costs I would love to live in the city, but living at home in the 'burbs is probably cheaper."

So,  as the title says I graduated May 2019 and have no job in a CS field. A  part of that has been a lack of trying on my part due to a number of  personal problems that cropped up in my senior year that also led me to  miss out on getting an internship. The combination of personal problems  and Covid-19 has put me in a bit of a depression and I've been  struggling to move forward.

I got a  wake-up call recently that I need to commit more time and effort if I  want to get started in this field and get out of my funk. The question  now is what do I do. I'm looking for tips on my resume, what kind of  jobs I should apply for, whether or not I should try to get an  internship now and how important that would be.

In  addition to that I would like some advice on personal projects I could  do or how to spruce up my LinkedIn profile to make it more appealing. I  currently have a GitHub but need to put some projects on it.

I did some time in the military where I got my TS clearance and knocked out a lot of general education credits. This allowed me to come into full-time school as a brand new CSmajor but as a sophomore/almost Junior. As in I’m starting my Intro to CS this semester but am still considered a sophomore/junior). 

My LinkedIn is set up and shows that I’ll graduate in two years and that I still have my active TS clearance (both are accurate). A recruiter from a major tech company reached out to me about a Cleared Internship position and the post for the internship assumes that I have things like DS&amp;A, a years worth of coding experience, etc. 

I understand that I’m probably not qualified for the internship so my question is do I still apply, if I do how do I minimize my lack of experience, if I don’t apply how do I manage this connection with the recruiter, and what other tips do you all have for me?"

Read that it is easier to find an internship despite me not being a student now. Should I apply for new grad positions or internships? Which one do I have a higher chance of nailing as my first developer job?

Any other recommendations for more success of getting responses?

I have a good GPA (3.81), and I’m currently in an Internship(Angular front end, Java backend). Today, both my internship teacher and my internship boss told me I’m not good enough for entry level developer positions in my area. Apparently I don’t produce enough code, and when I do “I struggle to translate theory into practical output”. 

For some background, I started in college with 0 experience in programming. I didn’t know what an if statement was. I didn’t know what github was, or what an “agile environment” meant. I couldn’t navigate CLI or ssh into a server. I didn’t know how to query an SQL server or create a virtual machine. In two years, I’ve made websites from scratch (HTML5 &amp; CSS), developed Android applications, created databases and managed them in VMs, passed Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (with an A-!), made Wordpress plugins in PHP, passed CISCO networking essentials, made a freakn 2D game in Unity, plus MORE, and I’m STILL not good enough. 

What the hell does it take to get into this industry? I dropped everything and moved in with my wife’s parents to attend college. I lived in a utility closest, worked a part time job, had my first child (oh god the lack of sleep), and still got up at 7am everyday to go to school and maintain good grades. I need to start making money once I graduate, as I have to help provide for my family. 

I don’t want to give up. I’m going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and eventually, hopefully, I’ll get a job. But today, I’m really not feeling that. Today, my instructors just told me I don’t have the skills needed to get an entry level development job."

Nobody wants to gloat about their internships when over half of the class lost theirs, and nobody who lost theirs wants to get up in front of the class and talk about how they lost it.

I solve one thing and another one pops up. At this point I am think I am spending 70% of my time solving bugs or getting familiar with new tech. Although it has just been a week and I know that this is really normal I am wondering how you guys navigated this stage. Did you guys work overtime to complete tasks or just worked normal hours and tried to be the productive then irrespective of if you ended up working on bugs for 70% of time or 10% of time. Any tips would be very helpful. This is very weird for me because I have done well in school and internships and other part time job.

ig3jei,50,2020-08-24,I Landed My First Job in IT Before Finishing College! This Sub Helped Me A Ton!,caglebagel,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ig3jei/i_landed_my_first_job_in_it_before_finishing/,"I just happily accepted my first full time role in IT! I’m finishing up my last couple classes of college going into the fall, but I was offered an amazing opportunity to work with a company that I interned at! A few recommendations I can give to people:

1) If you go to college, intern intern intern. I can’t say this enough, I did multiple internships that really built up my knowledge of IT and also gave me experiences in multiple facets (cyber security, data science, helpdesk, business analysis). It really helps with solving the catch 22 in regards to entry level jobs

2) Don’t give you hope. Finding a job in this space can be tricky at first, but if you get certs, build something at home, get internships and network with people, you’ll be sure to find something! I did 95 applications throughout the summer with 8 interviews; it only takes one yes to give you the path ahead!

3) Networking is key. Build strong relationships and really care about your work. I got my first role from working on a project with the manager of this position while interning. 

4) Use this sub! I’ve been reading information on here for ages about different tech questions and career paths. I’ve reached out to several people on here about their roles and really got a good sense of what things are like.

Thank you all so much for giving a space for entry level folk like me the ability to find a great career path!"
ig3jf8,1,2020-08-24,Best path into a career into patent/IP law?,owemeacent,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ig3jf8/best_path_into_a_career_into_patentip_law/,"I'm a senior Computer Engineering B.S. student and I've started looking into patent law as a career path. I have research experience at my university but I don't know if the traditional software/computer engineering career is right for me. I have a lot of friends in law school and I find the stuff they're studying fascinating and I have a natural knack for it. I have a little higher than average engineering GPA but nothing like what people going into law school have, so I don't think I'd immediately be a competitive candidate, and I don't think I'd want to take on the debt of law school straight away. 

I think becoming a patent agent might be right for me, as it's a fairly high paying position as far as I'm finding(I live and go to school on the West Coast, so those are the salaries I'm finding) positions for online, but I haven't taken the USPTO patent exam yet, as I can only take it after graduation. I've also found online that most firms that employ patent agents will pay for law school after proving your worth to the firm, which is definitely a plus one for me.

After a decent amount of searching online I've found that most lawyers outside of the elite law schools don't have the best job prospects, but being a patent attorney is something highly sought after, especially in the software/computer engineering field. I don't know how true this is, but I've seen online openings that won't hire someone without prosecution experience and a current USPTO certification, which I will have the latter of a couple of months after graduation. 

So as of right now, my current questions are:

* A) Do firms only employ engineers with a current USPTO patent agent certification or is there a way to ""intern"" at a firm during the year? 

* B) Do firms require experience working as an engineer AND having the USPTO patent agent certification to have any chance of getting hired? Or can you find employment right out of undergrad?

* C) Is it customary for firms to pay for law school for becoming a patent attorney or is this just an occurrence of survivorship bias?

* D) From what I understand, after graduating from law school with a J.D. and a USPTO patent agent certification, you become a patent attorney, but must you still take the state bar exam to become a fully-fledged lawyer?

*Are the job prospects and salary on the West Coast(Bay Area, SoCal, Portland, Seattle) as good as is mentioned elsewhere?


If any of you have any experience with this or want to chime in with any suggestions or recommendations that would be great! Thanks"
ig46ry,18,2020-08-24,Tips for applying with minimal experience?,Anabelieve,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/ig46ry/tips_for_applying_with_minimal_experience/,"I decided to apply for CS-related internships since I switched my major to CS and I have a couple of questions regarding the internship process. I have minimal programming experience (Java &lt;less than a year) and see a lot of internships targeted towards engineering/IT/CS/business majors.   


(I apologize in advance for my scattered questions!)  


I see one internship for business/IT majors but it ""requires"" proficiency in Java, HTML, C#, and SQL. Now I know most business majors don't require programming so would it be a good idea to apply even though I have minimal experience? I have a friend who managed to snag an internship as an IT major for an industrial engineering-related internship and he said that all he did was manage projects, learn to train some employees on the manufacturing line, and help in the IT department. He said that the requirements stated on most internship postings aren't always required but I don't know if it's true.   


Do the interviewers absolutely require the requirements or is it simple to weed out individuals such as myself? I've already applied to a couple of positions, would it be a good idea to reach out to thank them if I can?   


I'm all new to the internship process and researching what I can but I would definitely appreciate any tips regarding applying and such.   


How would I begin to pick up skills such as PLC projects, software engineering, etc.?   
Thanks!"

[Job Search Visualization](https://imgur.com/gallery/zCXe1Xj)

[Resume Template](https://gofile.io/d/ekmdVv)

[Cover Letter Template](https://gofile.io/d/msicKU)

(Keep in mind that I made this cover letter from scratch, so it might not fit your needs directly. There also may be something to gain from creating your own from scratch).

**Here is a little of my background:**

* 4 year CS degree from a no-name liberal arts university (graduated this May)
* 0 internships (applied to 100+ over 3 summers, oops!)
* 2 projects and a portfolio that I made in the final semester of my senior year
   * bootstrap portfolio, one subpar recipe search webapp and a UI for senior project
* 3.4 GPA and not confident in coding skills

**The search:**

After 60 applications spanning 5 months, most including cover letters (hint), I finally received something more than a phone screen or an assessment. That opportunity led to a coding challenge, a HireVue interview, 2 skype interviews, and then finally an offer (all well-after Covid-19) from a company that I never would have thought to hire me.

I applied to positions in Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas (mostly the latter), all for either entry-level or entry-level-ish software developer positions.

My resume was constantly changing throughout my search, and I made a cover letter template that I altered only slightly from job to job.

I am not passionate about coding or programming or computers or anything like that. I picked CS because I figured it was good opportunity to not be living paycheck to paycheck like my family was growing up.

**To those struggling in the job search:**

I want this post to specifically inspire those who feel they will never get a job. The past months have sucked--not from Covid, not from the turbulence in my personal life, but from feeling like a failure in not getting internships, not being good enough, and especially not getting job offers.

If you're like me, you'll see this post and tell yourself things like ""well I don't have a degree or I don't have that GPA, that's why this poster got the job and that's why I won't etc."" Do not do that to yourself. The fact is that the jobs are there for those who REALLY want and work for them, not just for people who ""deserve"" them or were ""meant"" for them. Just believe in yourself, take care of yourself, and grind. That's all it takes!! (if you want specifics, just copy projects from youtube in a language until you actually understand what you're doing. i.e. practice and projects).

I made this visualization like this because I don't understand those Sanky graphs or whatever they are called. I obviously didn't get a job for design work, but I felt that this visualization is a little easier to read.

As a final note, take everything on the internet with a grain of salt. It's filled with negativity, and usually the people who post stuff on the internet are at the extreme ends of the spectrum of whatever the topic is. I guess I'm guilty of that with this post, but if it's any consolation, this is my first and probably only reddit post.

Good luck job searchers, you got this!"

I was tasked with the job of creating a small website for a small local business. The owner would like to update the website a bit more and make it more digitalized.

&gt;Background info on myself: I am fairly new to web development, senior standing in college. This is an internship, however, it really isn't as there aren't any other ""tech"" people to learn from.

What used to be done;

The website would host all the products and customers would look at the products, and then email an invoice themselves to the owner, and they would conduct business that way.

&amp;#x200B;

What he wants;

The owner would like the customers to be able to view the products, add them to a cart, and then create an invoice online. The invoice would then be sent to him, and he would take payment that way. So he doesn't want the payment processing done on the website.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if I could use something like WooCommerce, install that, use the HTML theme I have already made, and have WooCommerce be able to control the cart/invoicing but have it so it doesn't charge the customers, just sends the invoice to the ""admin"" account?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this makes sense."

I'm now taking Algebra 1 on my Junior Year, and it's very discouraging seeing my classmates in that class that I'm the only Junior there.

It makes me feel like I'm in there level of smartness and intelligence. I thought I was good at Math because I was doing well in my school back in The Philippines, but when I first got here, they placed me to Geometry, then that's where everything fell apart. (They put me in Pre-algebra Sophomore Year)

Seeing my fellow Junior Peers challenging themselves in harder classes like AP/Honors makes me feel like I'm not going to be as good as them.

I'm not challenging myself. And im taking easy classes this year.

I know comparing yourself is not good, but I can't help it, and most of my friends are seniors, and I'm scared that if they graduate, I'll have no friends now.

I can barely remember the concepts of Math and Algebra that make me feel even dumber and worse.

Also, English? Even one of my weakest suit (alongside with Maths) I can barely write an academic paper, and writing College-Level Essays scares me because I don't know-how.

I heard people taking Remedial courses in Community College but never graduate. And I'm scared that I might end up one of them.

Then my Mental Health started to decline due to my insecurity. I hate myself; I started hating everything about myself.

My scars, acne, skin tone, nose, body, and everything. And seeing myself makes me feel even worse, and I tell myself who would love a person like you.

This, of course, also impacted my confidence and motivation to do stuff it as I'm ""What's the point. I can just kill myself.""

Confession: I'm planning on not taking the SAT/ACT. Just hearing these two tests makes me wanna cry as I'm not college-ready for these exams. I can barely afford the resources from it.

So I'm pretty sure Community College yet I hear so many bad things about this. (No connections, No Internships = No Work, No Friends, The stuff are less rigorous than a University)

My biggest concern if I went to a CC route is the difficulty of the classes. If I transfer from a Community College, then the difficulty of coursen in a Uni than CC so that's my biggest concern.

I'm very anxious about my future. And I f'ed up every opportunity i have right now. Me going to a University is Nothing but a wasted dream. I don't even know if College is for me because I don't know what to major.

I don't know where to go in life. I don't know if I can still handle myself. I don't know if I can go anywhere."

I was in and out of school for years for various reasons (usually work related) and most recently had enrolled at University to finish my bachelors (I think i'd have 4 classes left in History) however the tuition amount (I make just enough to only be offered loans im guessing) is insane for a degree that i'm not even sure what I would've done with, so I backed out.  I've been wanting to look into trades/careers that interest me, and i've always been good with computers and troubleshooting, just never really took the time to develop it/fine tune my skills if that makes sense.

The Local Community College (same 1 I went to like 10 years ago for my AA) has an IT program that is pretty good and even gives the chance to intern with IBM and some other places as options, as well as setting you up for certifications along the way and i'm thinking of pursuing it, it is much cheaper (of course) and while i looked on some other subreddits and seen a bunch of ""associates degrees are useless"" ""a second associates degree wont matter"" ect posts, i'm interested in checking it out (I actually emailed the department head as soon as I changed my mind and cancelled my 2 classes at the university (I wouldve had to do this anyway, because they require a virtual meeting at a set time every week and right now with my work schedule I cant) and he can still get me into a couple of classes this semester if I want.

I thought about a bachelors in IT or MIS or something, but my math skills are horrible and the programs ive looked at all require algebra (most actually want calculus) and at this point im ready to just get done and get into working/work my way up.

I genuinely enjoy doing web design type stuff and theres a couple of courses related to that, and the job descriptions I read for system analysts sound like something i'd enjoy as well.

I figure the associates program would give me a chance to get up to date (or at least refresh my memory) on some tech stuff as I kind of got out of it once I hit my mid/late 20s and itd be a nice way to dive back in.

Now since I'll end my internship and my master's in few days, I had asked if it's possible to extend my internship, they agreed to extend it for 3 more months, but again it's unpaid.

So, should I agree for the extension or do part time jobs and look for a full time job elsewhere (but finding jobs now is very difficult as I don't have industry experience other than the 3 months of internship). I do like working here but sustaining myself in Dublin is difficult."

I got a 4 year scholarship worth 96k at UBC, which I gave up because I wanted to attend U of T -cause of prestige and ""rankings"". (I got into the same program at  both the places).  Now that I have spent two years here, there are certain things that make me feel this way-

1. The quality of teaching is pretty average to be honest, and it all boils down to me reading up the course textbook, solving tests and problems and doing better ,rather than the lectures helping out so much, I dont know if all universities are supposed to be this way or is it just U of T?
2. I did pretty decent in both my years here-but I am not a part of the elite ""4.0s"". I had to sweat it out a lot to achieve whatever grades I have (3.5+) and even then  I must admit that  I feel overwhelmed during the school years with all the competition around. Really dont know how it would be at UBC? 
3. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING-WORK-LIFE BALANCE-SERIOUS LACK OF IT! During the semester I feel  so short of time always to do anything except studying-the constant time pressure with assignments and course work is terrible- Maybe because I aim too high? Not really I have friends who just wanna pass- and feel the same pressure as me..
4. I have applied to a couple of jobs (internships) and after all the rejections-I am afraid all these 4 years of labour  is not worth it 
5. LAST-INTERNATIONAL TUITION AT U OF T IS HARSH, and the fact that they are charging soo much even for online education!

I'm convinced I don't want a Masters (unless a company pays for it) because of the cost, the time, as well as already having most of the knowledge I need.

I know getting a Data Analyst position would be more feasible since I just have an undergrad degree, but I really want a more involved role where I'm actually making models, predicting things, and utilizing my Math/CS skills.

igkhen,24,2020-08-25,How to Choose the Right Major/Concentration/Program,theadmissionsangle,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/igkhen/how_to_choose_the_right_majorconcentrationprogram/,"When it comes to the college admissions process, the story is everything. As such, admissions officers are concerned with three primary questions. First, who are you? Second, where do you come from? And third, where are you going? For the applicant, creating synergy in a college application is important. Think of your application as a puzzle. Each piece, whether an essay, an activity, or a major, needs to fit together to fill in gaps while assembling a complete portrait of who you are. 

To this end, choosing a major is very important. In fact, we would argue that choosing your course of study is the first step in the application process. If you are certain of your major, then you should be choosing schools that will best facilitate your goals. However, if you are uncertain of your major but have a dream school in mind, the process is different (and this article is for you). You will instead need to look at your accomplishments and consider the story that you tell. Then, you can choose the major that you are most competitive for. 

In this article, I will first discuss general application strategy. Here at The Admissions Angle, we lovingly refer to this strategy as… an [Admissions Angle](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2019/01/15/whats-an-admissions-angle/) (we’re very creative). Then, I will take you through the different strategies for choosing a major depending on the type of school. And finally, I will discuss appropriate times for applying undeclared. 

# Strategies for choosing a major

If you haven’t already, I recommend checking out our article [What is an Admissions Angle?](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2019/01/15/whats-an-admissions-angle/) In the broad strokes, an Admissions Angle is a strategy for college admissions comprising three parts: talent, passion, and admissions value. Your application materials should incorporate all three of these items in order to be competitive. 

#### Talent: 

This part is simple: Are you good at your thing? What sorts of skills do you have? In other words, for whatever you’re planning to study, you should have some experience in that field. This could be related to your personal experience, but ideally, this is related to your extracurricular activities. If you want to study business, have you been involved in a business club? Do you have leadership experience? If you want to study biology, have you completed an internship? Have you taken the right classes? Additionally, your course load and grades should reflect this talent.  

If your application materials lack talent, the admissions officer will think that your application is *unsupported*. Therefore, if you have your heart set on a course of study for which you have no experience, you have two options. First, you can get some experience. [Consider undertaking an activity from our suggested list](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/03/16/extracurricular-activities-that-any-high-schooler-can-do-from-home/). Second, you can choose a different major for admissions purposes and plan to change majors later. However, this is a process with major caveats, so we will discuss it more later in this article. 

#### Passion: 

It goes without saying that you should care about your field of study. Passion is largely understood through the essay process. Do you sound excited when you talk about a given subject? Moreover, do you possess the character qualities that one would expect for such a major? For example, if you are trying to get into medicine or psychology, you should be passionate about helping people. If you are trying to get into technology, you should be solution-oriented and inquisitive. Choosing the right qualities to highlight about yourself in the essay can help demonstrate your passion. Moreover, it will help you stick to your tasks. After all, putting work into something you care about is much easier than putting work into something you don’t care about.

If you do not demonstrate passion in your application materials, the admissions officer will think you’re *uninspired*. This is bad for admissions. An enthusiastic student is more likely to try hard at school and get good grades. This same student will ideally go on to have a fruitful and fulfilling career. You definitely don’t want the admissions officer to read your application and think, “is his/her heart in this?”

#### Admissions value:

This is the crux of today’s issue. Admissions value boils down to the question, “is there a major for that?” But it’s also, “are my talents and passions aligned with the major I want to pursue?” This is tricky, so I will use three scenarios to outline my point: 

##### Scenario 1: 

There are plenty of things that students are talented at and passionate about. But this doesn’t mean that a major exists for that thing. Consider video games. Sure, you might be good at video games, and you may love them. But can you major in video games? Sadly, no. It's important to choose the [right activities](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/07/09/what-makes-an-extracurricular-activity-good/) to invest your time in. 

##### Scenario 2: 

Sometimes, students put loads of time into an activity that is very different from their desired major. Consider music. Let’s say every single one of your activities revolves around music, like marching band, pit band, pep band, honor band, etc. But then, let’s say you are planning to major in biology. You might have the skill and passion for music, but how does this have admissions value when it comes to studying biology?

##### Scenario 3: 

Students often make the mistake of considering admissions value to be a yes or no question. But it’s not. Everything has *some* quantity of admissions value, and the goal is to amass as much of this admissions value as you can. To that end, there are some activities that have value, but not much of it. Consider community service. Sure, there is intrinsic value in projects that help society, but do these activities relate to your major? Moreover, will these things help you stand out? If you have an overabundance of community service on your resume, consider how you can translate these activities into leadership potential. Or, make sure your activities are focused on something with a connection to your major, like political activism into a political science major, or volunteering at a hospital into a public health major. 

An application without admissions value is *unappealing*. Therefore, when choosing a major, have a look at your resume. Ask yourself this: Based on the materials I am looking at, what sort of major makes sense? What can I support on an application to boost my odds of admission? 

# Choosing a major for your personality 

If you, like many students, are in a position where your talent + passion + admissions value do not point in a clear direction, try getting creative. Think about the essence of who you are and consider how you can build a story around it. Remember, the admissions officer wants to know where you came from and where you’re going. Beyond that, they want to see how your past will support your future. Can you make the case that your past activities in one discipline have prepared you for a future in another? 

In my article [What Should I Write About on the Common App Essay?](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/06/16/common-app-essay/), I discuss the importance of highlighting your best characteristics. This is a practice that is also useful for supporting a major. When considering what to major in, think about the archetype of a person in that field. For example, if you want to major in engineering, what should an engineer be like? A lot of words might come to mind: analytical, methodical, inquisitive, thorough, patient, to name a few. Now, have a look at your activities. Can you demonstrate these qualities in your activities? Then, for your essays, can you take care to highlight these items in an anecdote? How about a people-centered profession, like sociology, public policy, or psychology. What should these ideal candidates look like? Compassionate, understanding, courageous, and versatile, perhaps. How can you demonstrate these characteristics in your application materials?

# Different strategies for different schools  

College advice is not one-size-fits-all. A major defining factor for admissions depends on how difficult the school is to get into, and you may have to adjust your strategy accordingly. Here, I will go through a few “types” of schools and discuss particular strategies. 

#### Top-30 colleges: 

Top-30 colleges want the whole package. Excellent GPA and test scores, compelling extracurricular activities, and beautiful essays. Top-30 schools are highly selective ([and getting more selective every year](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/03/17/competition-for-top-college-admissions-increasing-every-year/)), so for them, [fantastic academics is a baseline.](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/) They are very interested in your extracurricular activities and essays, and to that end, your major choice matters. A lot. 

If you know that you want to attend a certain top-30 school, then it’s important to choose a major that you are already competitive for. In other words, if all of your activities are related to math, then don’t choose an art major. This is unfortunate for some people who don’t have the foundation to support their major of choice. However, it is often [possible to change majors](https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/how-easy-it-change-my-concentration) once you arrive at a college.

However, if you are planning to apply as one major and switch into another, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, is this something that the school allows? Some colleges, like [Johns Hopkins](https://ehe.jhu.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-advising/changing-declaring-majors-and-minors.html), are really easy-going when it comes to changing majors, unless you want to study biomedical engineering, in which case you should plan to apply as a freshman. [At Carnegie Mellon](https://csd.cmu.edu/guidelines-transfer-dual-degree-minor-and-additional-major-cs), if you want to study computer science, it’s a very rigorous and selective process. But for other schools, there are limitations. For example, at many schools, if you are part of the Liberal Arts College, then it is easy to change majors within that college. However, if you want to transfer from the Liberal Arts College to the Business School, you will encounter a much more difficult process. Ultimately, this course boils down to research, research, research.

#### Large state schools: 

It goes without saying that some state schools are more competitive than others, and may require unique approaches. For example, [at the UC schools](http://www.admission.ucla.edu/NewBruins/MajorChange.htm) it is notoriously challenging to change majors, so you should apply for the thing you want to study. At Michigan, though, [students don’t even declare a major until they’re sophomores](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/lsa-requirements/majors.html#:~:text=To%20declare%20a%20major%2C%20a,entered%20on%20the%20student's%20record.), so it’s easier to switch. But in general, for any school that is handling a large volume of applications, academic index and general enthusiasm is more important than choice of major. If you are applying for a large state school as a target (meaning your academic index is around the 50th percentile), then go for the major that you’re really interested in pursuing. Ideally, you will have an activity to support this interest. If you don’t, I would consider picking one up, or discussing your motivation for choosing the major in your essays. 

#### Liberal arts schools:

Liberal arts schools are all about the spirit of inquisition and educational exploration. As such, these schools (e.g. [Williams](https://dean.williams.edu/academic-advising-info/)) are generally quite flexible about allowing students freedom in their curriculums. Liberal arts schools generally don't ask you to declare a major until the middle of sophomore year, and some schools will allow you to change programs up until your senior year, as long as you can fulfill the requirements for graduation for the new curriculum. Still, when you're writing essays and trying to stand out in the admissions process, it helps to express those specific interest in the things that you currently really want to study. These schools also encourage students to pursue multiple courses of study and explore the intersections among disciplines. For example, are you a theater-kid with an interest in psychology? Talk about a double major and discuss performance as therapy! In other words, pick the major(s) that you want and spend the essay or interview making a compelling case for yourself. Unlike the big state schools, liberal arts colleges spend a lot of time trying to understand the “real” you. Take advantage of this opportunity to show them!

# When to apply undeclared

Students sometimes feel a lot of pressure to choose a major. They believe that this decision is among the most important in their lifetime, and that if they mess it up, their whole career will suffer. This is (usually) not true! However, in order to cope with this stress, many students decide to apply undeclared. We usually do not advocate applying undeclared, when it’s avoidable. However, if you are already in the 75th percentile for academic index, it’s probably okay to apply undeclared. 

This said, it is still important to have an admissions strategy! Ideally, you have some service activities or athletics that can attest to your involvement in school activities to bolster your case. Make the case that you are a strong leader in your community. Discuss the two majors that you can’t decide between, or talk about your career goals. Tell them how you would use your first year of college to figure it out. In an undeclared major, there is a danger of coming across as wishy-washy. To combat this, show them that you have a plan for establishing your path.

# Choosing a major doesn’t need to be scary

At the end of the day, choosing a major should be fun and exciting! If you start to feel stressed, remember that it’s almost always possible to change your mind once you get into a college. The important thing is that you wind up in the place you want to be. After that, you’ll be free to explore your interests, meet new people, and sample new disciplines.

My work got laptops for everyone and I told them I could easily transfer their files from old computer to the new ones. Basically just a copy and paste job. So I copy and paste files from old computers to the new laptops and then head home. The staff isn't fully using these laptops yet as we had to purchase microsoft word and there isn't wifi set up in the building yet. So the laptops aren't fully ready to go yet. The next day is my day off when I get awoken by my phone ringing. I answer and one of my coworkers tells me that Janes computer isn't printing.

Me: Her new laptop isn't printing?

Coworker: yea its not printing.  
Me: Just tell her to print from her Old computer, everything is still hooked up.

COworker: she says her old computer isn't printing either.

Me: Well that's weird, I didn't do anything that should have effected her printer.  
Coworker: We need you to come in right now and fix this.  
ME: Sure, I'll be right there, can I talk to Jane?

Jane: Hello my computer isn't printing

Me:Did you try printing from your old computer

Jane:Yes I did and nothing came out of the printer

Me:OKay, because nothing should have changed on your old computer so it hypothetically should be able to print. the new laptop isn't set up yet though. You're not trying to print from the laptop, right?

Jane: No I'm not on the laptop, both computers aren't printing.

Me:Did any thing pop up or any windows open saying low ink or error

Jane: No nothing popped up

Me:Okay is the printer on?

Jane yes its on

Me: OKay is the printer name listed when you open the document to print

Jane: I don't know

Me: okay Maybe it got disconnected. I can come take a look but I didn't do anything that should have effected your printer. So If its a major issue then we will have to call the printer maintenance guys.  


After that point I get to the office and go into her office I see her laptop open and her desktop has a black screen. I go to the desktop and wiggle the house but it stays black.   
Jane: It was like that when I came in! I don't know whats wrong with it.  
Me: It looks like its turned off

Jane: I didn't do that. I never turn my computer off. 

Me: (realizing that jane 100% did not actually try printing from her desktop computer and wondering if she just lied during our entire conversation where I had her walk me through step by step as she tried to print) Well I turned it off after I finished working on it yesterday.  


I then turn the computer on by pressing the power button and the log in screen opens

Me: Can you type your password in for me

Jane: I don't know the password.   
ME: Its probably the same password you normally use for everything  
Jane: (rummages through her desk until she finds a sticky note) I've never had to log in before. I don't ever turn the computer off.

I log in, open word and immediately print.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane: Oh My GOD! You fixed the printer!!!!

Me: Uh yea, Jane, do you know how to turn the computer on?

Jane: No, I don't need to though since I just never turn it off. 

Everything starts to click into place for me and all the comments from jane about how slow her computer was running come to mind. I then show her the power button and then go to our boss who I inform that the issue was resolved and that the issue was that Jane didn't know how to turn her computer on. This alarms my boss who then at the next meeting informs everyone that they should be turning their computers off at least once a week.  


I go to my coworker's office and let her know that Janes real problem isn't the printer but the fact she doesn't know how to turn computers on. I at this point am in almost complete disbelief that people in my office who use computers every single day have no idea how to do something so basic as turning on the computer. Mind-blowing. But then again there is a woman who is a couple of years away from retiring who doesn't know the alphabet (American born and raised, only knows the English language and went to public school) and I know there are a lot of people who don't understand computers but I figure that if you use a computer every single day, all day long, you should probably know the basics. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; Got called into work on my day off because my coworker didn't know how to turn on her computer and apparently has never turned a computer on or off before.

I’ve also explored this through working on my thesis and i seem to have a decent grasp of the concepts.

I’m currently working in a small company that’s giving me a lot of flexibility and support to learn on the job. It’s given me the opportunity to work with “real” data and I’m keen to pursue it further. I’m hoping to use this as a stepping stone to bigger things (and wages).

There are several problems in my plan,
1. I have minimal programming experience (I do most of my work within the Microsoft ecosystem), and am working on using Python and SQL. I’m considering pursuing a postgraduate degree (or maybe a “conversion” grad diploma), but there’s just so many domains. In such a situation, would experience (eg open source contributions, github repo etc) work in my favour of not having an IT degree? 
2. Career prospects - IT jobs have become increasingly popular, while also being increasingly easy to outsource. If I planned on pursuing postgraduate education, would I be able to earn a living wage and pay off any debts? 
3. Job opportunities - what are some key things I should look for in a company when seeking employment for these jobs?"

I'm a support engineer at a large iot company. In the last month, I've completely given up the will to work. I have a BSEE and I'm four classes deep into a MSCS. 

I started about 18 months ago as a support engineer. Before, I had a data science internship in Python. I taught myself the basics of full stack development using the mern stack. I'm basically in tech support. I answer tickets and calls for 95% of my time. I'm consistently overworked (50-55 hours normally with up to 80+ when on call). My salary sucks; I get paid $60k a year. I'm a subject matter expert and now a trainer for new employees on a software package

In the last month, my will to work has just stopped. My company cut tuition assistance ""due to covid"" but their financial report says theyre ""extremely cash positive"". I was stuck between two job offers and I took the lower paying one because of the tuition assistance. 

They also lied about the job description. I was told I'd be in tech support for 6-9 months before being moved to a technical team. I was an idiot and that was a fucking lie. It was true when the original team started but not with me. Me and the people hired around me are in the help desk team for the last 1-2.5 YEARS. Furthermore, it turns out I'm paid way less than other engineers. When I started, the base pay is $60k. Older engineers started at 70k. 

I've started applying for new positions but I feel I've been typecast as support. I was waiting to finish my masters but I literally can't stomach working at this fucking company. I swear it's giving me depression. I will work at Starbucks if they would give me tuition assistance. I can't focus on anything because all I fucking feel is scammed. I've been wasting time. I'm a published grad student with ieee at night but by day it's: Hi welcome to XXX support, how may I help you?

Anyone been in a similar situation? How did you escape?"

I am 28 years old currently living in Washington D.C. I have been around computers all my life(who hasn't today) in high school, I took a web design/development curriculum as well as Computer Science and Ap computer science. To be completely honest I didn't enjoy computer science that much. Web Design and development was fun, I was even offered a web development internship in my high school so the senior year I had 2 hours a day internship in which I maintained a few web pages for the high school including the main web page.

Outside of school I was crazy about finding old computers on the streets and giving them a new life, by installing light linux Os's on them. I would then make them servers, I would have web servers, radio servers, different games servers running from my parent's basement, on the old boxed. I was crazy about it when I took a tutorial on how to set up a radio server I would spend hours and days trying to complete them and It made me very happy.

I went to college University of Maryland College Park got in as a Computer Science major(this was THE DREAM) but quickly figured out that neither my math knowledge nor programming knowledge were on the level of the school I was in. I felt like I didn't have the time to catch up(while I figured out the first two calc 2 chapters the class was already on chapter 5), I chickened out and switched to economics major, which I completed, I have a B.A in Economics

But, I keep thinking IT, IT I want to do IT. Right now I have a good analytics job which I love, but when the head of IT comes to our office, I can't stop looking at him and what he does. I want to be like him I want to set up the servers in the office, I don't want to run the excel spreadsheets they have me run currently.

I told this to my friend the other day and he told me ""Dude you don't really need Computer science or math go get a cloud certification, look into Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS certifications, I have seen you work with computers, I have seen you setup stuff, those certifications would be easy for a guy like you, then you will get a much better paying job, and you will be happier as you will do something you truly enjoy.

Is he right? Can I get a job with those certifications without the CS diploma? Which route should I take Amazon AWS or Azure? If both, where do I begin?

If you have any other recommendations please share! I have also heard about Cisco CCNA certifications(I feel like this is a bit different then cloud maybe I am wrong) are they valuable on the job market currently?

Also, like I said I love setting up stuff, I love making stuff work, I just don't like sitting in front of Visual Basic all day trying to code some ultra-complicated C# code with a ton of heavy math involved. Having said that I have B in Ap Computer Science so I can do most of the programming in a introductory books both in Java and C#.

How should I proceed?"

1. Do you think I can find a part time job even though I have no prior work experience in the field of computer science? I've never even done an internship. I did however do a research position instead for school credits where I programmed in C++, Python, Java, and worked with a microcontroller
2. What is the shortest amount of time I can work there without fucking people over? It causes me a lot of anxiety to apply to jobs because I'm worried that if I hate it, I will be stuck due to committing to the people there and I don't want to piss off my coworkers nor do I want to destroy my reputation/resume.

I like the company and I'm doing really cool projects and learning a lot, but the salary is bad ($15k a year). And since my boss also left, the other intern, which also got the same offer, and I are doing his tasks and managing our own projects.

Should I ask for a raise? I was kind of ok earning that because it was my first job and this salary is what someone earns as a graduate in my home country. I'm not sure if they are going to try and treat me as an intern until I graduate, but I don't find it viable earning that until I graduate, mostly because now that I have some work experience, other internships should be easier to get into.

igtoiy,2,2020-08-26,Quitting Law School?,winlow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/igtoiy/quitting_law_school/,"Hello there. Throwaway account for reasons.

I just started Law School &amp; I could use some advice.

**Background:** For a few years, I haven't had a clue what I wanted to do with my life. Studying humanities in undergrad, Law seemed like a natural path to riches and success. ""Maybe I'll go to Law school"" is the answer I gave to respond to the typical family member question at Christmas, ""What are you going to do with your life?"" After I poached the idea out loud, the ball started rolling. I know they weren't trying to push me, but I often heard this line from my loved ones: ""How I'm going to become a successful attorney some day and make us so proud."" That its an amazing profession and that I could do such wonderful things. When in reality, I didn't have the slightest clue if that's what I wanted to do, but that was my public go-to. Its my own fault for keeping up a facade, not anyone else's around me. I know that.

After I finished undergrad, I told people around me that I wanted to take sometime to work before diving into Law, because like I said, I really didn't think that's what I wanted to do. Anyway, after Undergrad I didn't find many prospects in my area with my BA, which was a small economically depressed region. After a few months without finding a job or having direction, the pressure was mounting, I was not in a good state mentally without having direction or purpose. So by fall I signed up for the GRE &amp; LSAT to see how I did. LSAT scores were decent and better than my GRE scores, so I started my law applications and actually got caught up in the process. Just having something to do, felt good. It felt even better since it was something fairly prestigious in the minds of many. I spoke with several attorney's from my hometown. I asked lots of questions regarding what schools to apply to, in terms of ranking, based upon my GPA &amp; Scores, etc. They gave me good advice with regards to that, told me that 1L was the hardest year, and told me about the vital importance of summer internships, etc.

Knowing that the job market wasn't great for attorney's but seemed better than that of someone with a BA in humanities, I probed the topic with one attorney, and he basically told me that in my home area, the pond was dry and filled with tons of fish all trying to bathe in what little water was left. I looked online and saw mixed opinions about the job market in the US as a whole, but I was less concerned about all this at the time, because I didn't think I wanted to actually practice law. At the time I thought: ""If I decided I did later, then that was fine because I would have the option to and I would find a way"". I figured the degree would open up other doors, to positions/jobs of higher pay, prestige, success, stability, etc. that a Bachelors of Humanities from a state school couldn't. This seems to be the conventional wisdom from my parent's generation that a JD is an indispensable degree no matter the field. (Perhaps it still is true, but recent reading online has made me think the times have changed).

Basically my rationale was, ""I might not be interested in this but it will lead to money regardless, even if I choose to get the degree and do something other than law."" I followed the old conventional wisdom I mentioned above, that Law was a solid stable professor, and a JD was a solid degree, on par with an MD, etc. That I wouldn't be able to ascend without one of those.

Sometime passes. COVID begins, and I receive my first acceptance letters. I narrowed my choices down a between a \~T50 far away where I didn't want to live &amp; work with an okay scholarship, and several lower ranked regional schools closer to home where I had envisioned myself living and working with over half of my tuition paid with scholarships. I chose one of the lesser ranked schools.

**Fast forward, seven months later.** I'm a week into my first semester of law school. I've had some tough times in the past, but this has to be the most anxious &amp; miserable I've ever felt in my life. I've woken up in the middle of the night, sheets drenched in sweat for the past week. I usually don't break down either, but its been happening daily. I'm not hungry, just nauseated &amp; diarrhea. I'm not able to distract myself when I need a break, but at the same time I'm equally distracted when I'm trying to work. Classes are all online due to COVID. I can't keep my attention during the lectures. My only interactions with other people thus far have been over Zoom or behind a mask at the store, subsequently I have yet to make any friends. I have many case briefs and chapters to read for every class each night, which is the driest, most abstract, esoteric, crap I've ever had to try to understand in my life. Then the Professors' and their ""Socratic Method"" to test or humiliate me in class the next day, on material that doesn't click with me. It feels like every moment there is a looming dread hanging over me.

How could I have been so irresponsible and stupid to get myself in this situation?

**Why do I waste another second doing this when, the result of all my labors and stress over the next three years is for a degree in something that I don't even want to do with my life?**

I've been honest with my father over the phone &amp; told him the truth. That this whole thing sounded great on paper, that it was a great conversation piece, that it made me look and feel good to say I would be going to law school. I also told him that I didn't look before leaping. That I'm probably here for the wrong reasons. That I don't think I can hang on for the next year, yet alone the next month. That its hard to rationalize putting up with this agonizing stress, anxiety, and work when I don't think I want to practice law, just something to make my resume stand out.

I think he believes that I have had good reasons to get to this point, and that the stress and shock of this has sent me spiraling out of control, confusing me, and clouding my judgement. Maybe he's right. Maybe all of this will be worth it in the end. He's told me that I just need to take it day by day and get through the first semester or year at least, then decide if this is for me or not. Then if its not for me, its not for me, and withdrawal. I haven't even broached the conversation with my mother, due to her high level of enthusiasm &amp; pride that I have started law school.

(To share this thought for the first time) If I'm being entirely honest with myself, the only light at the end of my tunnel isn't the prospect of getting the degree. The only thing that has allowed me to fall asleep over the past eight nights and keep doing my work is the prospect that I could withdrawal from law school and find something that I **want** to put 170% of my strength, willpower, and passion into in order to succeed.

I'm in a larger city now with more opportunity. (Although COVID hasn't helped) I've still found plenty of job listings that I at least meet the basic requirements for. It's cost a lot of time, energy, and money over the past year, just surviving, getting this far, and relocating for school but I think this is not for me. I could get a partial tuition refund &amp; I would be happy taking any job I could get with my BA in this big city, re-cooperating mentally, financially, and taking time to reassess my career prospects, by just getting some real work experience, and find that thing I could give my all.

Not only do I feel like a colossal idiot for making this mistake of leaping before looking, but I also feel like a coward, a quitter, and that I've failed. Part of me is nagging, and saying, ""Count your lucky stars that you're in law school and not getting shot, in Afghanistan. You're a snowflake, suck it up"". ""Your grandfather worked himself out of dirt poverty, you ought to be able to do this."" On top of this, so many of my friends &amp; cousins have worked their asses off for years to become physicians, bankers, brokers, finance professionals, etc. Here I would be quitting law school after a week. I don't know how to deal with the failure, shame, and cowardice involved with that. (Which is what will likely keep me in law school for sometime).

I've read plenty of other posts, about people with feelings different from my own on practicing/reasons for being there, stuck it out and still ended up quitting after their first semester or year. I have only found one post on google thus far that mentions someone they knew who dropped out of law school in their first week, without much other info given.

**So finally we arrive. Do you have any advice?:**

If anyone else out there has been in a similar situation, do you think a week or month is too early to throw in the towel. (Doesn't have to be dropping out of law school, could be quitting a job, undergrad, or other professional school, etc. More or less quitting something immediately after starting.

Am I a snowflake that needs to toughen up and at least finish out a semester before throwing in the towel? I can imagine some people saying ""Quit being a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*, suck it up, and do it, you aren't getting chemical weapons dropped on you in Syria, you're in law school."" Well that's what is amazing about anonymous online messaging boards &amp; maybe that's something I need to hear before I do anything rash.

If I decide to pull the plug, how do I get over this immense mistake I've made, the shame of it, and the shame of quitting after a week. How do I explain how I feel &amp; my rationale to those around me, who either don't understand how I'm feeling or have been in a similar situation, facing tougher odds, but overcame them, went on to succeed professionally, regardless if it was something they were passionate about or not?"

All from job sites. Seems like my UX Design internship I had was 5 years ago instead of last summer.

Since I decided I wanted to become a self taught UI/UX Designer in June of 2018, I knew I was in it for the long haul and opportunities weren’t going to be given to me right away.

Between graduating college last year of Spring and getting my art degree while starting a awesome, paid internship a couple weeks after; I was absolutely euphoric about everything aligning my way.

However, I did not expect in a million years that I am going to be out of work for this long. I get there’s a pandemic and maybe that’s affecting my status but I am at a genuine loss. 

A couple of months ago, I had a design friend recommend me to redesign my whole portfolio from my case studies to my website layout on webflow. Took me about roughly 13 weeks to get everything how I wanted to envision for me. Never felt more connected to my site and how happy I felt accomplishing this.

But at the start of August, as soon as I published my portfolio live, I decided to apply for jobs. Never thought I’d get immediate interest from 3 companies in the same week. I was hyped and did my best to prepare.

A couple weeks went by and it couldn’t have gotten any worse. Had one company completely ghost me because I wanted to reschedule the interview and that interview never occurred. Felt like I did a good job presenting myself, researching the other two companies, and having a good, flowing conversion, but to my demise...

All I’m going to say is after going through this process for a full year, I’m just at a loss of words.  I’m starting to feel like I should never apply to job sites ever again and find alternatives (networking). Should I take the rest of the year off, focus on my mental health, and figure whether or not UI/UX Design is something I should reconsider?

igxdye,4,2020-08-26,Advice on having a CS degree vs some experience,picks-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/igxdye/advice_on_having_a_cs_degree_vs_some_experience/,"I posted this in r/csmajors but only got one response so I'm hoping more people will see it here*

I'm in a bit of a pickle right now and I'm not 100% sure as to what I should do. I'll give a quick background about me and what I'm having a hard time deciding. 

I went to school for my BA in comm studies and graduated in 2018. Now I'm finishing my master's degree in a program that combines graphic design and introductory web/mobile development (graduating in Summer 2021). While in my program, I found out that I can take undergrad CS courses and have been doing so. I'm falling in love with CS and wish (now more than ever) that I pursued a BS in CS during my undergrad. A lot of stuff happened in my life while I was 18-22 and I just felt too tired to challenge myself, as I know CS would've be hard for me. 

I did some digging and saw that I can still use my credits from my previous undergrad degree and apply it to a BS in CS. In total, I would only need 11 classes to get this degree. The question is, should I stay in school until I'm 26, or graduate from my master's and then go from there? Do y'all think taking those 11 classes would be worth it? Side note: if I decide to do this, then I will most likely graduate with the CS degree in Spring 2022 – adds roughly an extra 3 semesters.

I really want to go down this path, but I'm nervous that I'll be too old or should be getting professional work experience before I think about getting another degree. I'm also doing an internship right now for web dev and have also been a TA for a web dev class at my college.

I appreciate any and all insight. Sorry for the novel of text."

Recently for my internship, I  was working on the deployment of several micro service applications and wrote a docker-compose script to be deployed as a stack into a docker swarm node where all my docker secrets are located in. As such, all you really have to do is just to run the command docker stack deploy, and all the services will be up and running.  However, I wonder if this really constitutes as building a pipeline which i think should be fully automated to the point whereby you should not even have to run this command, even if its just one command. If I am right that this does not count as a CI/CD pipeline, I would like to know how I could improve upon this process? Thanks!"

ih07h2,3,2020-08-26,How can I fight my landlord insisting us to pay 60-day rent after the lease period has ended and making us find new tenants?,notnanxy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ih07h2/how_can_i_fight_my_landlord_insisting_us_to_pay/,"Apartment-mate and I have been leasing the condo for 3 years now for college, and have been providing at least 30-day notice of renewal in previous years. Edit- the apartment is in California.

1. Fixed Term Lease notice - Although uncommon, I searched that it seems that the only legal requirements for a 60-day notice are for landlords to tenants in **periodic leases** that have lasted over a year. I could only find information for the eviction of a tenant rather requiring notice for leaving once a lease has expired.

The landlord claims that we should be giving him a 60-day notice even though the lease ends on 8/31 therefore he needs 2 extra months of rent. It is not a month-to-month tenancy, nor does the agreement say it is an automatically extending lease. The only thing stopping us from simply leaving is this addendum that reads

&gt;""**Contrary to #2. TERM: B. Tenant and Landlord to give a 60 day written notice to vacate versus 30 day. Upon vacating tenant shall have the property professionally deep cleaned including windows and carpeting.** ""

We never noticed the change in lease upon renewal last year and it was never discussed, so it went under our nose. Otherwise, the lease should expire on 8/31 with the following terms

&gt;2B. ""This Agreement shalt terminate on (date)Tenant shall vacate the Premises upon termination of the Agreement, unless: (i) landlord and Tenant have extended this Agreement in writing or signed a new agreement: (ii) mandated by local rent control law; or (iii) Landlord accepts Rent from Tenant (other than past due Rent), in which case a month-to-month tenancy sham be created which either party may terminate as specified In paragraph 2A. Rent shall be at a rate agreed to by Landlord and Tenant or as allowed by law. All other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Is 2B is regarding terminating the lease early or does it not exempt notice for when the term expires? It doesn't even mention a 30-day notice in 2B, is the ""contrary to"" statement cancel out ""Tenant shall vacate the Premises upon termination of the Agreement""? Does a notice to vacate equate to a notice of non-renewal?

He accepted a notice from an email I sent saying we graduated and are leaving on 8/17, but I had also sent a similar email on 7/14 consenting to my apartment-mate to turn over her lease to someone else. He takes everything in calls and they talked over the phone about her moving to texas and they had talked at the beginning of the year how we were graduating but unfortunately, she doesn't have written proof.

2. Termination.

&gt;""Tenants obligation upon vacting the premises.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Upon termination of this Agreement.** Tenant shall (i) give Landlord all copies of all keys and any opening devices to Premises, including any common areas; (ii) vacate and surrender Premises to Landlord, empty of all persons; (iii) vacate any/all parking and/or storage space; (iv) clean and deliver Premises, as specified in paragraph C below, to Landlord in the same condition as referenced in paragraph 10; (v) remove all debris; **(vi) give written notice to Landlord of Tenant's forwarding address; and (vii)EITHER PARTY SHALL GIVE A 60 DAY WRITTEN NOTICE TO VACATE refer to ADDENDUM 1 attached hereto and made hereof ""**

I am unsure of the wording: does termination of this agreement mean regardless if the lease expires? If so, what determines who ""either party"" is responsible of giving notice? Shouldn't he have given notice as well?

&amp;#x200B;

3. Mitigating Losses

The landlord was insisting that it is our responsibility to find him new tenants. So both my roommate and I posted online ads for our rooms respectively. I have gotten less than a 24-hour notice that someone was coming to see the apartment and he insisted he's ""just trying to help"" and the interested people that I had contacted online are likely not going to sign. But this potential candidate he recommended was not interested and my apartment-mate and I found different people on Facebook to proceed.

He has kept my apartment-mate out of the loop and I have constantly told him that I only know what my potential tenant's status, and not hers so it would be better to contact her because I am afraid of misrepresenting her situation. She requested that he include her in texts or emails and now he is threatening to simply hold on to our security deposit until the 2 months of rent is provided and the new tenants have paid their security deposit because he found us ungrateful for his help. We were terrified at first but it seems like mitigating his losses is not our responsibility, even though we aren't ending the lease early. However, the tenant that was supposed to take up the other room is in quarantine and no longer is planning on moving so the tenant that I found is not allowed to sign the lease alone. The landlord also said that he would not be returning our security deposit until the new tenants pay theirs. At this point, I feel defrauded into frantically finding new tenants for him even though I have no real estate knowledge and being blamed for hiccups in the process of interested tenants not turning in credit checks or applications.

In addition, if we had found new tenants and paid rent following the termination, wouldn't we then be bound in a month to month lease as stated in 2biii? He never said anything about this and we could have been paying for rent on end? If not, doesn't that mean he should have given us a 60-day notice that the 2Bi states we need to vacate the apartment/condo?

&amp;#x200B;

COVID 19, Emotional distress, and ""good faith and fair dealing"".

Despite graduating early this year as the pandemic hit, we both have paid our rent. We have never missed a month of rent in 3 years nor has the landlord received complaints about us. Not only did the landlord claim I was like a ""daughter to him"" in the same phone call where he told me that I owed him 2 months rent after the lease ends, but he has been calling my apartment-mate the wrong name for 3 years even with the efforts of me trying to correct him in a face-saving way. Both her parents and mine are immigrants so we are trying our best to translate and navigate this new information. In the midst of the COVID crisis, my parents have lost their major source of income and I am currently searching for work, and my apartment-mate is in a similar situation. I have had to ask for a leave on my unpaid internship and have spent the last 2 weeks toiling away to appease him. I haven't been able to find a new place to live because my family and I can't afford to pay double rent and managing the apartment has taken up all my time. This is fine because I can stay with my parents temporarily, but I also have diagnosed mental comorbidities and with my university health insurance ending this month, I have barely any time to find new insurance. I just don't understand why he blew up on my apartment-mate's written request to be included in the rerenting process and saying that he has done us a great favor by taking so many calls. The landlord owns, sells, and rents so many properties but he can't include another name in his emails? How can he require us to find two parties to rerent the apartment but not inform both parties of the current one(us) of the status of the credit-checks? The credit checking service he requires needs to be accessed through a landlord's account to email to applicants, and we obviously don't have access to his account. We kept having calls between him urgently warning me of what I owe him and gaslighting that there's just one more thing left and it's over. It also confounds me how differently he treats my apartment-mate compared to myself and I had to defend her. It's hard not to assume that he bears some prejudice against her since she has never done anything wrong prior to correcting him of her name and requesting better communication.

I have not slept since he called at 10 pm yesterday and have been researching tenant/landlord rights and I have an inspection at 8:30 am(in an hour) that was sprung up on me yesterday. Sorry if anything is incoherent.

ih23s7,1,2020-08-26,Is a minor in Computer Science worth putting off graduation for two years?,bluedream122,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ih23s7/is_a_minor_in_computer_science_worth_putting_off/,"I'm a 23 year old college senior majoring in English (concentration in Linguistics). English majors are required to complete a minor, and I really want to pursue Computer Science. I took one Intro to Programming course last year where we learned the fundamentals of Python, and I *loved* it. I even finished with an A. It might not seem like a huge accomplishment, but I never thought I could do well in a programming course, let alone program at all. I've always just stuck to what I'm comfortable with, which is the humanities. But that course proved to me that I am capable, and while I'm happy with the discovery, I'm also conflicted.

To declare a CS minor at my uni, in addition to fundamental courses, you need to complete three upper-level courses, most of which have *several* prerequisites. I planned it all out today and if I were to go through all the math courses and other pre-reqs, I would have to put off graduation by two whole years. And I'm just not sure if it's worth it. I want the knowledge and can't see myself building a proper portfolio outside of the classroom. This area is still so new to me. But if I go through with it, by the time I graduate I'll already be 25. I know everyone goes through college at their own pace, but just the thought of that really pains me. I dealt with pretty severe depression on and off the past few years, so if I didn't want to kill my GPA, I could only take one or two classes for a handful of semesters. I didn't think it'd be an issue back then, because I was planning on minoring in psychology, which can be knocked out in like one semester. But I have absolutely no interest in psychology. And it's literally useless as a minor.

To add a bit more context, I don't have to pay for tuition. My dad is a veteran, so his benefits have passed down to me. I'm also still living at home, so I don't have to worry about rent and other expenses. I have a part-time job, but I'm willing to go on academic leave to really dedicate myself to this portion of my degree and seek out internships that can give me a bit more experience. As to what I see myself doing after graduating, the ideal would be to find a job that allows me to apply both areas of my degree, like computational linguistics. Or technical writing, which I also really enjoy. I'd be more than willing to work as a programmer, too, if the opportunity arises. 

It's just... the humanities were so easy for me. I've always had an aptitude for writing and composition, so I can't say I struggled even once for my major. And that doesn't sit right with me at all. I don't want to graduate college not having been challenged. CS has finally offered that to me. I'd finally feel like I'm not just wasting away my dad's benefits on a degree that will offer little to no opportunities after graduation. 

I'm sorry if this was all over the place. I'm just stuck. Two years is a long time...

Any advice?"

These interviews don't get easier just because someone has interned at top tech companies. It's still a b\*\*\*\*. I often still mess up on simple problems and question whether I'm a good programmer/engineer. Point is, it's ok to fail and to be discouraged - it happens to everyone but don't for a second think that you are somehow lesser of a CS student than your friends who have shiny internships. A career in tech really is a long journey and this is just the beginning for all of us. ""making it"" does not mean finally getting a FAANG offer, trust me."

If you're looking for an internship or new grad job in tech you should check out my project [techinternship.io](https://www.techinternship.io). It lets you easily filter through jobs and apply to them, and then automatically track your applications in an embedded spreadsheet. You can also subscribe to companies if they haven't opened their applications up yet, and you'll get a notification when they do. 

I shared this here last year, but I figured I'd share it again since the recruiting cycle is just starting up again and I've made a lot of improvements to the site over the past year.

Hope it's helpful!"

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in CS and was an intern at good Dutch company for the last 6 months. Long story short they did not offer me a job after internship.

Now I'm looking at job postings and there aren't any good opportunities. Junior positions are sparse, technologies these companies use doesn't fit my knowledge and most of these positions require at least 1 year of experience, which I do not possess. So I'm getting desperate. I'm even considering doing one more internship(third lol) in hope of getting the job afterwards. 

On the other hand I consider posting my CV public on LinkedIn or some other website for potential recruiters to see. Has anyone here done something similar? Will I look desperate or proactive?"

This is my last year, and I'm graduating this Spring. I have a current job offer as a Software Development Engineer with Amazon in Seattle, but I've always wanted to move to Europe after I graduate. I studied abroad in France for 4 months (didn't really have the money necessary to do so, but took out student loans as it was a lifelong dream), and really enjoyed it. Of all the countries I visited, I enjoyed Ireland the most. That combined with the fact that Dublin is currently a major tech center made me think it'd be a good place to try to find a job after graduation. Honestly though, I'd be okay with most countries in Western Europe. I only speak English despite my four months in France. (My French is pretty much limited to 'can I have some fries?')

With COVID however, I'm worried that it will be significantly harder even a year from now. I already knew it'd be difficult to find an employer to sponsor me, but it seems like I'm facing mounting odds. Would it be better to take the job in Seattle and try again after a couple of years or is there still the possibility that I could find a job by the end of this school year? I don't have to give my final decision on the Amazon position until February so I have a while to try but wanted to know if there's any chance at all.

Additional Details: I go to a pretty good college (the CS program is ranked in the top 10 globally), and have a decent CV (Amazon internship and Teaching Assistant at said school). Interview skills are admittedly so-so."

For a little bit of background, I've graduated with a CS degree about two years ago. In school I was lazy and a bad student so I didn't get an internship during my time there. I feel like this really hurt my skill and my confidence level because I always felt like I was always lacking in my cs skills and unprepared to go into a real world engineering job. After I graduated I was unable to find a suitable job in any tech field and was unemployed for about a year. Then I started a job in manufacturing for a pretty reputable company where they told me that there are opportunities for me to move into a CS career from my current position as a bottom level operator. I trusted them I stuck with a minimum wage, low skill level labor job for about a year. I learned all I could from that job and there were no opportunities to move up and I'm starting to get really burnt out of that job and just dreading every single day I have to work.

So here I am now, just constantly tired and depressed that I went to school and got my degree, but was a bad student and am working some bottom level job where they treat us like we're in middle school. I've been doing leetcode here and there, but I always get stuck on mediums and even when I solve things they are usually just the brute force most inefficient methods. It's just hard sometimes because work is very draining so on the weekends it's hard to find the drive to do even more ""work"" even though I know that I have to do this and there is no easy way out. I also don't have any projects on my resume other than some school projects done for classes and senior project. 

I honestly just want a job that I can get my foot in the door into the tech field. Something that isn't a labor job, something where I can actually sit at a desk and do work. I'm not even looking to work at a FAANG either because I feel like I am far from qualified to even attempt to apply for their jobs. Should I be just applying for software engineer jobs? Honestly one of my biggest confusions is what keywords should I use to look for jobs other than Software Engineer, like what else would I qualify for with a CS degree? I live in the Portland, Oregon area so I have wonderful resources like [this](http://portlandtech.org/) so it makes job hunting a little easier, but if I wanted to use something like Indeed, what should I put for the search terms other than software engineer and what should I be studying to prepare in the mean time?"

As a junior growing closer to his senior year at college, an opportunity popped up for me to learn Swift in a iOS bootcamp in the Chicago area, where live and go to college in, it’ll teach me the basics of the Swift language from Apple’s everyone can code curriculum for 600 dollars flat. At the bootcamp their plan is to teach me the basics so I can go on to finish Apple’s Swift curriculum on my own. This bootcamp is part of CCC ( Chicago’s City Colleges)  and it’s a four month bootcamp, so it’s not a camp that’ll take my money and run. One of the reasons why I want to take this bootcamp is because I want to show employers the app I would be developing and to add some more personal projects on my resume so they could give me a chance and hire me after I graduate college or an internship opportunity. I’m even willing to take unpaid Swift development internships if need be. Although I have friends who have software engineering positions who can help me get a job, I don’t have any internships on my resume to show employers that I have experience. Which can hinder my chances at landing a job, but maybe with this bootcamp I could point out that this was an experience that I did and could make up the some slack of not having an internship during my college years. A good friend of mine told me that employers are willing to overlook the fact I have no internships done with quality projects like an app or websites I could develop for my boss during the semester. Mobile development is a career path I would interested in after I graduate college but becoming a software engineer is my main goal. My question is, would this be a good idea for me to do? I just think with my degree and this iOS bootcamp on top of some projects I did, could really help me stand out when I’m applying to jobs. Regardless if it’s a mobile app development job. Any advice would help. 

Thanks!"

I have managed to do that while going full time to a top 30 (USA Today) university even though I got a full merit scholarship there out of high school. I will graduate next December with a B.S. in applied math and a B.A. in computer science. I will have also completed a 6 month full time web development bootcamp online through UNC Chapel Hill. I also have experience in high performance computing because I started the HPC club at my college and I have a 200 core monster in my basement running CentOS for machine learning workflows. I also used HPC for biochem research that lasted about a year. I have compTIA A+, Network+, and Microsoft MS-100.

How do I approach jobs post graduation? Not to sound arrogant, but I think I will have a lot of choices because I already have paid internship offers and one full time offer.

I like Windows administration, but I am pretty sure I want a change in pace. My heart is really in programming, so I was thinking DevOps? I also really like HPC so I was thinking something with data science at scale (docker/kubernetes/Apache Spark/ Hadoop)? My current job is cool because I got to design and implement the whole environment as I learned (and then learned more and went back and fixed things haha), but as a result I never got to do some of the cool things that people get to do at larger companies.

Should I go for an entry level position in a new field or try to get an intermediate position that I am currently prepared for?

Before I used to share office A with new intern and, and it had worked. We both decorated it and put our pictures up, and had a theme going. I didn't mind sharing with them as we had opposite schedules, and when we collided they would use another staff's office who was off that day since I had seniority and they were respectful

Now my organization is moving my office at A site to the storage side of a meeting room, saying they can get a desk in there and make a makeshift office, I'd just have to leave if the meeting room is being used

I don't like that at all, I feel like I've been thrown away to a side. The new office doesn't even offer privacy and I feel resentment building. Ive been in the organization the longest out of everyone.

I wouldn't mind if I was spending all day and everyday in my B office , but now they want me to spend more time in A office. 

How can I express to my supervisors that I feel uncomfortable about working in such a setup? I don't want to sound entitled, but I've been this company for years. Why am I being kicked out? It's not like they are building me an office from scratch or giving me a door, its basically a makeshift in a meeting room that's still being used.

I'm a 24 year old who graduated twelve months ago and have been constantly on the hunt for a full time. For the past three months I've worked two remote jobs - software internship (paid $25, 40hrs/week) and IT internship (paid $20, 25hrs/week). 

The software internship ended a week ago, and when I asked for a full time, my manager extended my internship with the same rate instead. I wanted to quit. Why? Low pay for the large work load of building a project from scratch with no guidance from other devs as an intern, and other work culture red flags.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, when I emailed my termination to my boss, he immediately asked HR to extend me an offer - 90k base, 5k stock, and 5k bonus if the project rolls out successfully. I tried to negotiate but he said that's more than he'd usually offer.

SO - given my situation I have two realistic options:

1. Take the full time offer with better pay (about $43/hour) and keep applying with the possibility of a more miserable work culture and being stuck for a long time
2. Turn down the offer, stick with low paying IT job, and use the extra time and space to apply for better options given the current bad market

&amp;#x200B;

I might add that  I'm also moving into the city with about $1000 - $1200 in rent so the extra financial security would be nice.

I am providing context to my dilemma and asking for advice on potential roles that I might be well-suited for because I am having trouble deciding on my career.**

Hello!

I am currently a college senior double majoring in comp sci and applied math.

I have done several internships in multiple industries and have (for the most part) enjoyed each one. The exception was working as a software engineer intern at Microsoft this past summer. I felt very undervalued, not part of the team, and not part of the company culture. I'm sure the remote environment had something to do with this but I noticed that I was never excited to work on my project. The work felt very detailed and unimportant as if my entire summer project was just a bunch of tedious bug fixes and minor feature adding that my boss didn't really feel like doing. I spent a lot of time preparing for the interview and was extremely excited for the summer, only to have my enthusiasm gradually erode away every day as I realized that the captivating, exploratory projects I had done in previous internships and at school were a rare find in the real world. The internship made me reevaluate my career decisions and my interests entirely.  

I did some self-reflection and realized that I haven't really enjoyed any of my internships enough to see myself doing it as a career, which is a problem considering I only have a couple of semesters left to figure that out. The clock is ticking and I'm growing more and more concerned that I'll end up having to settle on a job and get stuck in it, then wake up 20 years later and realize that I've wasted my life.

I've reached out to many of my friends who work in tech/engineering industries and they haven't been super helpful, to be honest. So, I'm reaching out to this community, which has served me well many times, in hopes of finding some thoughtful insights.

For context, I will provide examples of the work I enjoyed and didn't enjoy.

**Work I Enjoyed:**

* I researched emerging technologies and summarized how they work/their business applications and viability to semi-technical audiences.
* I researched methods for ensuring data integrity and worked with my boss to develop a blockchain-based double signature verification scheme and made a small-scale working prototype.

**Work I Did Not Enjoy:**

*  I worked on a certain Microsoft application used to ease database migration. I was responsible for refactoring the code to move CLR stored procedures to the client side and figuring out a way to store user information in local XML files as opposed to SQL Server tables.

This is all experience I have had professionally, but I am also deeply fascinated by mathematics, so much so to the point that I added it on as a second major. I am especially interested in how mathematics can be used to model the natural world, which led me to apply for several quantitative finance roles. Unfortunately, I have either been rejected from them or not heard back, yet.

I am feeling quite confused and lost. I am having doubts about my major and am very scared that I made the wrong choice with my life. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking things or not thinking about them enough. My friends and family just keep telling me similar things and the remote schooling environment has made reaching out to advisors difficult. In summary, I have several options but don't feel particularly enthusiastic about any of them, I don't know what other options are out there, and I'm having a quarter-life crisis because of these circumstances.

Any advice and/or experience will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank You"
ihhcqi,2,2020-08-27,Should I become a frontend dev?,GameAndElse,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ihhcqi/should_i_become_a_frontend_dev/,"I am making a school in which I can do a certifcate in either Software Engineering or Systems Engineering.

It's maybe about 70% of a normal CS degree but much more focused on actual practice at an internship.  
Usually it is 4 years, but I can do it in 2 years because I have already done an apprenticeship with certificate in another field.

Now, in the first year I felt that especially with the fast passe this 2 year school has it was very hard to keep up in programming, I had good grades, but I kept getting anxiety of thinking I would not meet the requirements in the internship or not being able to keep up. Also I felt that many companies had high expectations. On top of all of this came corona and home schooling.

With all this pressure, I decided to go the route of System Engineering first, which is much easier to keep up because it's much more based on ""knowledge"" than almost mathematical understanding of programming.

I still feel like I want to go into Software Engineering in some form.

At the same time I have the problem, that I live alone, I have to pay for everything my own, and I can't afford to just hang around in interns all year to slowly learn it and eventually get better.

I need a job with a full income. 

So I had the idea, that I could do it that way that I would make my way into SE by making a bootcamp after finishing this school and go into HTML/CSS/Javascript and a bit of python and SQL front end dev.  
My Idea would be that front end devs usually don't have just as complex problems as backend devs. I think it's easier justify a full wage in a shorter ammount of time than as backend dev.

My idea is that I try to make a bootcamp, get a job or an intern as frontend dev for a few months, and after that I will see how well it goes and can decide further and if it works well I can make my way into software development slowly.

How do you guys think about that, is it hard to become a frontend dev? And is it worth it?

I was never the deep learning sitting 5 days in my basement and coding kinda guy. But I still like coding, and I like UI, so it could fit me really well I think.

ihjp1a,4,2020-08-27,Grad Degrees Abroad,Aneducationabroad,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ihjp1a/grad_degrees_abroad/,"Hey /u/gradadmissions, since it’s admissions season, and due to the pandemic there are a lot of people who are interested in going to grad school, I thought I’d offer a few thoughts on why it could be worth doing a degree abroad.

While it sounds crazy, you can actually save a substantial amount of time and money by going overseas, but while those are important, that’s not even the best reason that exists.

As there seems to be a good mix of those looking for jobs in academia versus those looking for a masters degree to set themselves apart, I’ll try to appeal to both groups below.

**Exposure to New Ideas**

While we’d like to think of scholarship as a global pursuit, the fact is that a lot of academics tend to only have their work read on their respective continent. This is especially true outside of the bigger journals and the more well-known academics. By going abroad, you’ll have the opportunity to see what kind of work that others are up to, and how that interacts with your own interests.

But let’s say that you don’t care about scholarship as much as practicality. In that case, there’s even more reason to go overseas. Look at some of the greatest business shifts of the last fifty years, and a number of them originated in Japan or Europe. Or if you’re looking to do a degree in international affairs, nothing gives you gravitas quite like having a resume with international experience on it.

**Building New Relationships**

Chances are that, if you’re interested in getting a graduate degree, you’ve already started building relationships with faculty members. Whether you’re looking to be a professor yourself one day or simply gain access to their professional network, it’s a great idea.

Going abroad gives you a whole new set of people to interact with, and chances are that much of their network will not overlap with those here in North America. This gives you more people you can reach out to with any number of questions, including…

**More About Networking**

Want a way to really make your research stick out? Present it overseas. Any North Americans present will likely be open to talking to you afterwards because you’ve got something in common, which helps open doors too.

Even if you’re not interested in a career in the academy, the chance to network with groups overseas will definitely help your job search. For those who want to come back to the United States, there’s something about having internships with overseas companies that stands out to employers.

Finally, when you do come back to the US, you’ll still have a network of graduates. Places like Oxford, Edinburgh, and Trinity College Dublin have thriving alumni groups in the United States and around the world, and since the uniqueness of the experience is higher, the chances of getting a call back when you reach out goes through the roof.

**Working Abroad**

Of course, it doesn’t just have to be an internship. In the last few weeks, the UK has announced that it has overhauled its visa system to allow those who finished a degree in the UK to have right to remain for an additional two years. Imagine using those two years to work with firms that are on the cutting edge of your industry. Other countries also have similar programs.

With so many people dreaming of a way to work overseas, this actually offers a great way to do it.

**Saving Money**

First, the bad news. Most MA programs are not funded overseas, so you’ll have to pay your own way. In the UK, that can amount to over $22,000 (MBAs will be more expensive - see below). However, most masters degrees in the UK are only one year long, so if you were looking at a two year degree in the US, that could make your decision a bit more complicated.

Bear in mind too that the UK is almost always the most expensive. Other countries have masters degrees available for a fraction of the price. Some countries even have loans available to foreigners, and many accept American Federal Direct Loans (though oddly enough Germany does not in most cases).

Finally, there is funding available for some students, if you know where to look. A number of American alumni groups offer scholarships for graduate study at their alma maters (I get hit up by mine at least three times a year), and these are growing in interest. Additionally, the British Council and other groups offer third party funding, the most famous of which are probably the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships. Finally, some universities do offer funding if you can prove that there is no other way you can attend, but it’s not worth betting on.

**Business Students and International Affairs Students**

There are two groups that I especially wanted to address. First, the group that I was once a part of, the international affairs students. Increasingly, top IR and Global Studies masters are beginning to look a lot like MBAs with regards to cost. SAIS, Fletcher, and the like are great, but they are incredibly expensive. Additionally, they take two years. I don’t know about you, but I’m not convinced that a MSc in International Economics or Global History from LSE isn’t a better value all around. It covers the same material, gives you access to a superb alumni network, and gives you the chance to live abroad. Throw in that it costs about half as much, and it’s an easy decision all day long.

As for aspiring business students, going abroad gives you a second chance to break into a competitive field like consulting or investment banking because there are a ton of one year masters degrees designed for exactly that purpose. LSE, UCL, and a bunch of other universities offer them, and they have great links to multinational companies. These are often no more expensive than any other masters degree.

MBA students will have to pay higher fees, but they’ll still be lower than what you’ll find in the US. Yes, LBS, Said at Oxford, and Judge at Cambridge will still be high, because they know they can get away with it. However, an MBA from Edinburgh costs about $30k plus living expenses. Let that one sink in.

**The Downsides**

There are a few downsides worth considering. First, if you’re interested in nursing or other health professions, forget about it. Licensure is simply a bit too complicated to get through. Additionally, those looking for a professional licensure for teaching should probably stay stateside, though if you already have your certification and just need a masters, going abroad can save you a bundle. Finally, while a number of British, Swiss, and German universities are world leaders in technology, it is hard to hear them over the sounds of MIT, Caltech, Stanford, and the like. If that bothers you, it’s understandable, as there's a lot of cutting edge research right here in the US.

Just remember that Einstein went to Zurich."

-Almost finished a short cycle (cs related) I learnt the basics in java (some hibernate too), sql, html and css.

-I don’t live in Germany but I love it and can afford the costs.

-I sent +100 applications and just got accepted by a company in Berlin but they offer non-paid internships.

-I don’t know which field I like most in CS as I’m still learning, they offered me an internship related with React Native for Android.

-Working hours would be 36-38h/week, company with Indian environment.

-My local city has not a very good job offers for CS related jobs, Berlin seems as a big market.

And this is what I wanna ask your honest opinions about:

-Do you think is possible to find paid internships for me?

-In my country I’m pretty sure I can find internships paying ~500€ a month at local companies. Will this be smarter for my first internship?

-What would you do if you were me at this moment? 

More advice is welcome. Thank you for reading!

It's a shitty situation, but I'm trying to make due with the situation I'm in. I want to spend these next few months to develop my skills in order to build up my portfolio &amp; apply for an Internship/Junior Software Developer. I've considered a few options:

* Take part in a Web Development Bootcamp in my city (Le Wagon &amp; Elevation are the most recommended where I live)
* Take a free Full-Stack Program online (The Odin Project/App Academy/The Syllabus for Python &amp; Django that was posted here almost two weeks ago)
* Try to apply for internships while doing either bootcamp, or wait until I have some projects under my belt? (I have no projects besides classwork, so that may hinder my chances)

ihrl0e,1,2020-08-27,New Cybersecurity major completely lost,OriChabz,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ihrl0e/new_cybersecurity_major_completely_lost/,"Hey everybody, I am currently a junior in college and *just* switched dramatically from Criminal Justice to Cybersecurity on partly a whim and partly an interest in the growing field of Cybersecurity / IT. The only problem is that I have absolutely no clue what I am doing. I have no experience at all coding, writing script, networking, the list really goes on. The extent of my computer skills comes from many years of online gaming and spending loads of time on the computer doing that and building a custom tower in high school. I consider myself relatively knowledgeable of computers, but I am completely lost when it comes to anything IT/Cybersecurity related.

I took a course last semester that was an introduction to Computer Science that involved using Java and a compiler to carry out tasks. Currently, I am taking classes on Script Programming (using Bash, Python, and PowerShell), Web Development (using Adobe Dreamweaver/PhP Storm as the IDE and connecting it to a hosting site), and a course on Computer Security. These are the first classes I have ever taken teaching any code/script or anything like that and I've noticed that it's a lot of self-learning and requires a pretty basic understanding of Cybersecurity/IT concepts (and I may be using this terminology completely wrong; I am actually **lost**).

I am worried that I only have this year and next before I am graduating with a degree in Cybersecurity and I don't want to feel like I have no clue what I am doing when I do graduate, so what steps can/should I take now while I am in my latter-half of college that will help supplement the things I am learning now and better prepare me for the field? Additionally, should I be looking for internships or jobs that relate to Cybersecurity? I work in retail now just to make ends meet and I feel like nowhere would hire me when I have absolutely no idea what the job requires me to do. Thanks!

**tl;dr:** Just switched my major to Cybersecurity from Criminal Justice and have no idea what I am doing, what should I do while im a junior in college to help me learn the material and prepare me for the job field. Also, is it possible for me to get a job in Cybersecurity/IT while still in college?"
ihrsf4,3,2020-08-27,Would you finish a postbacc BSCS earlier or a MSCS a year later in my situation?,csnoobcakes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ihrsf4/would_you_finish_a_postbacc_bscs_earlier_or_a/,"Background:

I have a job that involves some software dev. Not full-time and no guarantee I'll ever be able to do FT software dev here. To that end, where I'm at is a waypoint, and not a final destination. It is giving me experience in C# and SQL though. Also not a sure thing, as they have mentioned there will be layoffs, so staying where I'm at for a couple years to see how things turn out isn't a safe bet.

Dilemma:

I am currently in OSU's postbacc BSCS program. I can finish around April 2022. For this reason, I am applying to summer 2021 internships at big companies, because the pay is as good if not better than what I make now and my hope is that the internship would turn into a FT offer. If not, I have related experience from my current work plus a SWE internship, so that hopefully gives me enough experience to be competitive for new grad positions if no return offer.

I also just got accepted to GT's OMSCS program. I can probably finish a year later, call it Summer 2023, by taking mostly 1 class per term and maybe 2 classes one or two terms. I have read through all the BS vs. MS threads here. I am aware that it likely won't make a difference at most companies which you have. However, that being said, obviously OMSCS is 1/4 the cost, I will probably learn more, it allows me to teach later on at junior college if I wish, and it's a top 10 school which may matter to some people looking at resume.

The conundrum though is I think OMSCS locks me out of internships because no one is hiring a summer 2021 intern who doesn't finish until 2023. All the apps I've filled out have 2021-2022 terms as potential graduation date ranges. It also takes me a year longer. I'm aware of the opportunity cost of that extra year but that of course is predicated on the notion that I could get a job and work as a SWE in the meantime. In this economy, I am not very confident of that, and I have been looking but been shot down so far for not having years and years of experience.

So...if you're working as a SWE already, ideally if you interview and hire SWEs, which do you think is the better option? Stay in OSU BSCS or jump to GT OMSCS?"

While I'm specifically looking for resources to improve my R skills and to start learning Python and SQL, I know there's absolutely no harm in learning others. My struggle is just finding online resources to start learning. While I am willing to pay for programs (like Codeacademy or DataCamp or whatever), I just want to make sure that the money is worth it and that the program will leave me, at the very least, more comfortable with creating and using code. And anything free is a bonus; I'm between jobs right now and hoping that having some more experience will help me land a student job at my university or an internship somewhere.

iht861,2,2020-08-27,Advertising my skills,digbicks845,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iht861/advertising_my_skills/,"Hey, 

I’m going to be a senior in college this year which means I’m gonna start applying for actual jobs instead of summer internships. 

Programming skills aside, one of my biggest selling points is that I can work extremely fast. I was always one of the first people to finish exams and homework and this skills translated to coding as well. For example, at the company I’m currently interning at, they gave me a week deadline on a task that I finished in around 3 hours. 

I should also mention that I’m not just blitzing through everything, I’ve found a good balance of speed and accuracy and I’ve had no complaints so far. 

My questions is whether this I should actually advertise this skill. It’s definitely valuable but I feel like companies will just use that as an excuse to give me a lot more work. This pretty much happened in the example above since the company gave me a lot more work and expected me to finish it all. 

I like doing challenging and engaging work but I don’t want work to be dumped onto me just because I can do it fast. Thoughts?"

I know it’s said that you’ll never feel ready so you should just go for it and start applying. But I know there are concrete things I’m lacking. My degree exposed me to python, c#, javascript, a bit of java, html and css. I know enough to build a website from scratch. Around the start of my senior year, I started looking at what getting a dev job would take and realized I wouldn’t be prepared. I didn’t learn data structures or algorithms or any of the CS fundamentals that seem important for getting through an interview and being a good developer. If you want to ask me why I didn’t start learning then - I was both working and doing school full-time. I couldn’t. 

I met a guy who did a nearby bootcamp and had since been working as a software engineer. I looked into it and after a couple of weeks, I decided I would start saving to do a bootcamp after graduation if need be. The one I planned to enroll in actually does cover the CS fundamentals I’m lacking. I know it wouldn’t be exactly what I’d get from a CS degree but it would be better than nothing, right? My thought process was:

Slightly related degree + projects + coding bootcamp (required networking)  &gt; slightly related degree + projects

So now I’m sitting on nearly $11k trying to decide what to do. I looked at the bootcamp’s website to find out they effectively raised the price so I’ll need an extra grand if I want to enroll, which is what’s causing my doubt. My job doesn’t pay me enough to make this extra grand in time, so I’d be taking it out of my car &amp; moving out savings. I know it's possible to learn this stuff on my own, but I’m worried I won’t learn it right or well without that “classroom” setting. I’m also worried I won’t look as good on paper. 

I feel that my IT degree is a disadvantage and given the circumstances the world is in, I am not confident I’ll be able to get an entry level job in the near future. Should I go for the bootcamp or try learning this stuff on my own?

Tldr:  I have an IT degree, no internship experience.  I’m worried that my degree plus projects won’t help me get a job. Last year I discovered a full stack bootcamp that would fill in some of the missing CS fundamentals I need and started saving for it. Now I’m unsure if I should actually spend the money and go through with it."
ihvcg3,15,2020-08-27,What is lost by not Majoring in CS?,Spookins,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ihvcg3/what_is_lost_by_not_majoring_in_cs/,"So I'm an electrical engineering student at an internship right now and so far my favorite project has been a programming project using pywin32 to automate the creation of test documents. Ironically,  I have just as much if not more experience programming as I have done hardware related tasks. Initially, I had so-so experiences with the software but now I realize that was mostly due to external factors. So I'm pretty sure now, after this internship experience, that I want to write software/firmware.

Now the question is how close to the hardware I want to be. I'm probably going to switch my major to computer engineering so that I can take more software courses ( systems and algorithms related), but I'm debating whether I should just switch to full on CS. I'm not sure if I'd like to be an app developer or do lower-level systems work, or perhaps embedded, but I get the impression that the important classes to take in school as a CS major are the algorithms and systems classes(compilers, networking, OS, etc), and the interface/higher level/front end programming can be self-taught. 

Majoring in Comp\_ENG, I would only be allowed count systems, programming languages, and algo courses towards my degree, and I would graduate early, leaving time for a quick &lt; 5 year bs/master if I wanted to take more courses. and I would take a digital design and comp architecture class.

Majoring in Comp\_sci, I would take classes from ""interfaces"", artificial intelligence, systems, software dev/programming languages, and ""algorithms"".

**The Verdict**: My question is, say, if I did want to just be an app developer, would I be behind my comp sci peers if I major in computer engineering?"

Intended Major: Information Sciences (or maybe something else related to cybersecurity), and I'm considering a second major in Political Science or something of the sort

ihw5s8,2,2020-08-27,Internship advice: getting frustrated of my HR contact.,aaaaaahidkwhattodo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ihw5s8/internship_advice_getting_frustrated_of_my_hr/,"Hello all, loooong post/rant here. If you take the time to read and help, thank you!!!

***(TL:DR: my HR takes ages to fill basic paperwork, and a situation came up where I need to be in contact with them but they don't answer me.)***

I (finally) found a Internship to continue my studies. (in my country, you switch one month at school and one month working for 3 years. Finding an Internship was a huge pain because of COVID, I only had one positive REPLY, which is the company I got hired into). 

I'll try to stay vague with details, as the company is known for being really punitive with employees that ""talk about work"" online soooo obviously, this is a throwaway account. 

Anyway, it's the perfect internship: pretty big company, the exact sector of industry I want to be in, the tasks are in my skill sets, I love every mission I will be having, great pay, great medical coverage, I get along great with the guy who will be supervising me for 3 years as he's an alumn, etc. 

However, the one thing I making me miserable/go mad is the HR contact I've been given, here it is:

**I was told ""you're hired"" in early June**. The engineering team gave me the info of the HR manager I was supposed to handle paperwork with. Within the hour, in the middle of the day, I send them all the preliminary documents signed, completed, the works. I send them a form the school gave us we were supposed to give the company, asking for it to be filled. Pretty basic: company name, ID numbers, etc. 

This is were it starts. **I am told NOTHING**, not even a ""ok, thanks, will check it later"" or something for like 2 weeks, after which I just recieve a ""dude the document you filled was outdated my bad here's the new one."". I reply, sending the completed new version, again, within the hour, and ask if they could take a look at the form I sent them. 

**Another 2 weeks or so pass, now it's early July**. I finally get the form after almost a month, and it is ridiculous: The form was printed, then filled, then scanned on the world's dirtiest scanner and somehow compressed to shit. I just thank them, and fill myself the form. (N.B: the form was a 2 page form, just to refer the company's ID numbers and such, nothing hard to fill). 

**We're the 15th of July**, the internship was promptly validated by my school and they told my I could start the actual paperwork: hours, salary, benefits, etc. On that day, the school sent an e-mail to the HR person, with the hiring contract. I immediatly send one to them, ""hey heads up, you recieved a mail from my school, it contains the contract. If it is not the case, here it is"", attaching the contract to my mail.  I get no response. I try again 5 days later. No reponse. Again 5 days later? No response. Now I figure the HR person is probably on holiday, but it's a big company, there's gotta be someone to replace that person, so I mail the whole HR dept. like ""hey dudes it's august, can I at least know where you're at with my paperwork?"", and no luck, I get a noreply type answer saying my message won't be seen blah blah blah. 

By then, after helping my dad fix/build stuff arround the house, **it's almost the end of August**. I kinda gave up at that point, I did not know when I would start, my pay, what I should do, etc, and just programmed a mail to be sent every week like ""hey, can you fill this, I'd really like an answer before September"", because if I sign my contract after september, even on the 1st or 2nd, I will loose one month's pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, 2 days ago**, HR sent a mass ""welcome"" email to all future interns, immediatly followed by my signed contract. I was extremly relieved, and really happy, sent a ""thank you"" mail with tons of ""!!!"" at the end, as it's been more than a month to fill a stupid single sheet of paper just asking the name of the company, and my salary (which is calculated according to my age, I cannot negociate it so it's not really a huge calculation), and I finally had a number for my pay which was quite high compared to my friends, so I kinda forgot about all the ""hate"" I had for the HR rep, and **was quite happy it ""was over""**

**It wasn't tho**. The 1st day I'm supposed to be at work, signing my name/signature on the security sheets, getting safety training, etc, is... on the same day I'm supposed to be in my first class of the year, in Sept. I don't want to be that guy who misses the first class for X or Y reason, as I will stick with the teacher as the ""dude who doesn't care even in the slightest to attend the first ever class of his actual engineering studies"" for the whole year. I'm really *fucking scared* now. What if the stupid HR rep did not bother asking my school for the calendar showing when students are at school and at work? What if they did not know I'm supposed to be starting in October but make me start in September? I asked by mail if it was possible to a: see if it was possible for me to postpone the administrative welcome/safety training and b: chat about that planning/calendar as I want to get things clear but hey.

Guess What?

**I've got no info**. And 1 working day left, then the week end. I don't know what to do. I mean, if there's a reason for such late replies, I understand, times are wierd rn, and, you know, life happens, but please: let me know if at least you acknowledge my shit? fuck. This was more of a Rant/letting pressure out, so yeah, sorry if it is not appropriate!"

I never turned in my homework, class work, tests, you name it. All from 1st to Senior year I’ve always hated doing school work! I don’t know why I decided to go straight into Community College thinking it’ll be the same as high school. Of course I was horrible mistaken. I took 4 classes 1 math, English, Psychology, and Speech. I was taking a very easy college math so I passed with a B. English, I did not take seriously and never turned in any essays so obviously I got an F. Psychology I really like because the teacher made it fun, but I never knew how to study properly for tests, so I got a D in that class. Speech SHOULD’VE been the easy class, but my dumb ass missed the final and made my A to an F. So Spring of 2015, I took a break and was just working at Albertsons. I decided in the Fall of 2015 to try at least one class to feel a little accomplished. I decided to retake English and one of my coworkers recommended me a professor who apparently was a really good and nice professor and that his class was easy! So I registered with him! The day arrived and suddenly it wasn’t the professor I asked for, everyone in that class was so confused because he was suppose to be an older gentleman, this guy was incredibly young. He then told us something about the system changed and now he was our professor! He had 30 students in that class and 20 dropped that class because he was unnecessarily tough!! I have no idea why I didn’t drop the class, I just stopped showing up like a dumb ass! So I was still stuck with an F and suspended for a semester. All of 2016 I took a break because I really had no goals and no plan about anything, I didn’t know what to do. Finally Spring of 2017 I decided to retake that English class again and just take a random class, I chose History. I ended up dropping History because it was, again, unnecessarily tough! I finally manage to pull off a C in English! (I’m not very good at essays) then I took the rest of 2017 off. It wasn’t until the end of May of 2018, I had enough of my shenanigans! My friend who’s two years younger than me, flew down from Boston to visit me and my other friends who are also younger than me. We all decided to visit our old choir director from high school and that’s when it hit me. I felt completely embarrassed because my choir director was praising my friends for doing so well in life, while I’m just there chillin. I finally decided enough is enough and my boyfriend helped me to look into what’s interesting (mind you, I was having a nervous breakdown at this point so, tears were involved) he started looking through the certifications that I can do and we scrolled upon American Sign Language a 2 year program. That caught my attention so much that the next day I went back to the community college and they were able to register me to American Sign Language 1 (ASL 1) in Summer 1. Of course because of my passed failed classes I had to retake them in order to get my GPA higher, so Summer 2 I retook Speech and managed to get a B (I got an A is ASL 1 BTW) then Fall of 2018 I took ASL 2 (got an A) and had to retake Psychology (got a B). Spring of 2019 I took a mandatory psychology class online (got an A) and took ASL 3 (got an A). Summer 1 I had to take a math courses (got an A) and Summer I had to take Philosophy (got an A) Fall of 2019 I did ASL 4 and Introduction to Deaf Community (got both A’s). And during the Fall I had to take 2 tests that would allow me to continue into the program. I had to take an English test which I passed the first time, but the reading test was kicking my ass. I retook it 4 times and it was $15 each time I took the test. Until luckily I finally passed and was able to continue in the interpreting program! Then Spring of 2020 I took Introduction to Interpreting and Deaf Culture (got both A’s). Of course this is when the pandemic struck so I had to take my Summer 1 class online Interpreting 1 and passed with an A. NOW (sorry I know this is long just bare with me!) Fall of 2020 I’ll be taking 4 classes! This is the first week and I’m incredibly overwhelmed! I’m starting to lose my interest in this field, but because the fact that I never really tried hard in school back in the day, it’s making me want to just at least complete this degree! This is the internship part of my classes and I’m already very confused. I don’t want to give up, but I do want to give up. After these 4 classes I just need 5 more classes to graduate! But I’m so desperately deeply overwhelmed! I’ve never had this much homework! 1 girl has already dropped and she’s been with me and my classmates since ASL 2 and she was a great sign language interpreter, so that makes me even more nervous! I don’t want to be an interpreter anymore, but the fact that I know American Sign Language is so cool that I want to at least use my skills somewhere else. I’m thinking of going into Cosmetology because I am good at makeup, and not just the everyday makeup, I’m pretty good at Halloween Face Painting! I always have people in my DM’s scheduling appointments with me to get their face done! I’m just conflicted because idk if I want to quit and never complete this and not reach my goal. Or just keep going and keep doing what I’m doing even if it’s wrong. What do you all think? Sorry if this was long, I just really need some sort of advice, pep talk, anything. Thanks for your time."

When I arrived at my university as a freshman I felt invincible, like I was about to embark on some journey that would create some amazing career for me. I started out as a pre-med student planning on majoring in biology. Throughout freshman and sophomore year I had all of these doubts about whether or not I was a good enough student to get in to med school. I had these fears that I would be back with my parents at home after I graduated with no job and rejection letters from med schools. I was and A and B student but somehow the pre-med culture and this idea that the biology degree meant nothing after I graduated made me switch to something safer. I am now an information science major only because I thought it was a safe option. However, I have no interest in having a career that is centered around computers. 

Its hard for me to get excited about software development and just about anything in the corporate world. Science and art have always been the most interesting subjects to me. I am now committed to this major and it’s probably too late for me too finish the medical school prerequisites or get a degree in a field I would enjoy more. 

I feel like I haven’t been true or honest with myself about what I enjoy and find interesting. I’m now at the point where I need to look for internships and work opportunities related to my major.

Hello all,

I hope you are all doing well. I figured this may be a good place to reach out and gather a very wide and non-biased set of opinions on something that’s been weighing very heavily on me recently.

First some background: In 2018 I landed an internship with a Fortune 300 with their network systems team in Atlanta, GA. At the time, I had just completed my freshman year of school at Louisiana State University. I interned for three months with the company, and made strides while I was there. They fairly quickly asked me to come back again the following summer and also started giving me actual projects that coincided with the level of work their full time engineers were completing. Nothing too crazy, new LAN’s, standards documentation, etc.

I come back the next summer following my sophomore year of college and a job opening comes up within their NetOps team. I talk to the manager of that team I’d they’d entertain hiring me to that role while I completed school online.

Long story short, I just finished my first year of being a full time network engineer with the company. It’s been an incredible and beyond fortunate opportunity and I wouldn’t trade for the world. As of this week, I was asked to move into their network architecture team. I don’t say any of this in arrogance; quite the opposite. I’m sure many of you on this forum have more experience and knowledge in networking that my department combined. But that’s the very reason I’m coming to you all.

My career is progressing quite quickly, and it’s had me thinking of the age old question... do I need this degree? That’s the question I’m posing to all of you.

As I start this fall semester at Penn State, the online school I transitioned to in order to take this job, I find myself seriously contemplating the necessity of this. It eats me up to be paying nearly $14,000/year out of pocket to be self-teaching classes like Spanish and programming. A very small amount of my coursework really assists or aids in the knowledge of my field. Eventually I’d love to transition to a sales roll within enterprise IT. What is the general consensus, is the degree worth the tens of thousands of dollars, extreme time requirements, and general effort required to get a piece of paper that I feel has little added value to my future."

Thank you to everyone for their responses. 

Edit edit: I resigned from the company. There is no mandatory severance pay in my country and my aunt in HR recommended that resignation is better than termination in my young resume.

After resigning, the small team talked to me and tried to persuade me to think twice and we discussed. After the meeting, they came back and apologize for hiring a jr dev when they know they do not have enough resources and manpower to nurture and allow a Jr dev to make mistakes and learn. They know that they're asking me to deal with 8 different repos using different technoloties while in companies, teams usually work on one or two repos each. They also admit that they themselves are struggling to keep up the pace they set, and that their environment has 0 test and 0 documentation, coupled with their incompleted onboarding handbook, was the reason why they feel in retrospect, my failure to keep up with them. They knew i wouldn't stay in the company as its the best for us both, but they tried to convince me to give coding another shot and not use them as an example of what life is like in every company.

OP:

Hi, Im 22 and Ive been placed under performance probation after 6months of work. If I do not improve, i will be terminated.

My background is environmental science, but i did a 3 months bootcamp and found a job in full-stack engineering startup.

The company told me that my problems are:
- i display carelessness with simple errors
- i display lack of understanding of code and integration with other repo with my solutions
- i ask for help without sufficiently reading up on documents
- my solutions often break on testing
- i neglect difficult tickets and work on simple ones
- i often pick the first solution that comes to my mind even if it doesn't work
- i do not describe my problems well
- i misinterpreted tickets and do not meet requirements of ticket
- i need to review other engineers ticket and push faster.

I know there are some things that are personally my fault, such as carelessness and picking the first solution that comes to my mind. This are areas I can and will absolutely improve. But what I'm concern is that I actually don't understand the code base (commenting is frown upon unless necessary) much and sometimes I cant think of other solutions other than the one on my mind. 

I've only met my team in real life for 2 months until quarantine hits and I have been working from home ever since. The only time I've paired programmed with was an intern who was more new at web development than me, and I was teaching him what i know about technologies and syntax and other basic stuff.

I feel quite lost with regards to my quality as an engineer. We work in a free for all ticket system and I feel that a lot of them are way beyond my league, using technologies Ive never heard of and are basically impossible for me on my own. Sometimes the ticket descriptions can be a single line description and when I address it on surface value, im told I didnt think deeper on what else is affected. Other times I am told I don't understand the requirements and added unnecessary features. I feel like I really dont understand the intricacies of the code base and what data are related to each other until it either crashes or someone more experience points it out to me. Even if I take my time to plan, read up on documents, i still get my tickets rejected. Taking my time to think things through stresses me as I can't keep up with the sprint velocity, but pushing what comes to my mind also is wrong. I feel like I cant pull my own weight quickly. Due to my lack of background, some times I also have no idea what the documents are saying and I would often just ask my colleague what it means. Sometimes i know some concepts exist but I don't know the technical terms for it, making me unable to google it.

All the engineers in my startup (they founded it together) have less than 3 years of experience and basically did the same bootcamp as me. I feel like if they can do it on their own and I can't, then something is wrong with me.

Even though I enjoy programming, after hours, I'm usually working and learning on something else other than coding because I feel tuckered out from doing CS for 8hours straight, and I want to do something else I am passionate about. I read that being an engineer means you need to dedicate your time outside of work and revolve your life around it... And that's something I really don't agree with because I feel that life shouldnt be that way and i have other things i want to persue. If the truth is that 8hrs a day at work is not enough to grow as a developer, i might consider doing something else.

I think the imposter syndrome is very real and I'm just not sure if I'm cut out for web development or coding... Could anyone give an advice?

Edit: it might come across as selfish but the reason why I'm not putting a lot of effort into programming after work hours is because I am trying to study for something else that would impact my life (not career related)."

ii1el8,1,2020-08-28,Value of Computer Science,Vlookup_reddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ii1el8/value_of_computer_science/,"Hi all,

I am a sophomore student in cs bachelor degree and worrying about my intern for next year's summer. Done some research and saw an opinion towards the CS degree: cs degree is insufficient for a successful developer.

Since I have invested 2 years already, my questions are as follow:

1. Should I take theoretical electives rather than trendy electives?Trendy electives refer to Big Data Mining, Machine Learning, Web Computing where the professors will teach ""prevailing"" methods, for example, CSS, HTML in web computing.I said ""prevailing"" since most of my seniors told me the content aren't that trendy after all.Theoretical electives are pretty much self-explanatory, for example, algorithm design, network infrastructure.I may want to be a full-stack/backend developer and I am studying PHP, mysql, nosql, mongodb myself either watching youtubes or reading open sources.
2. How should I position the CS degree?Aside from mentioning the fact that I am a degree holder, which imo is the least i can do, what should i mention? I got A in all theoretical courses, i.e., linear algebra, algorithms, database. Do employers value the theoretical stuff I learnt from school? If no, is mentioning degree holder the only edge I have over non-degree holders?

Edit 1: if my assumptions or inferences are wrong, please correct me. much appreciated."

I’m looking to build out a website that users can register to in order to receive an email every morning with web scraped data. The email would include the weather, sports scores from the night before, and headlines from their chosen news source (the user would specify their location, sports their interested in and favourite news source on the website itself).

What I’m looking for is an estimation onto how long something like this would take to be built? I’ve done web dev before, but never involving python, which is obviously what I’ll be using for the web scraping, so I’ll have to learn the basics of Flask or Django for that purpose. I’ve also never done web scraping before, so that’ll be something to figure out too.

Also, I tried finding something that I could use to present the web scraped data in a nice looking manner for emailing purposes, but wasn’t so lucky (or maybe I wasn’t looking in the right place). Is there something out there that would serve my purpose here? Also, this is simply a personal project, so I don’t need a paid service that sends mass emails; just something that can send a couple tens of emails a day should suffice.

Thanks and happy Friday!"

ii73sp,14783,2020-08-28,TIFU by going to the dentist right before a job interview,trench_wench,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ii73sp/tifu_by_going_to_the_dentist_right_before_a_job/,"Obligatory ""it didn't happen today"", but I was in the dentist yesterday for a long overdue cleaning (thanks COVID) and I told them about it and they got a kick out of it. So I figured I'd share it here as I'm new to this sub.

Late last year, I was shuffling between an internship and contract jobs, and was desperately in need of a full-time job. So when I received an inquiry about a job interview, I jumped on it so fast! While I was qualified for the job, it wasn't really what I wanted to do forever. It was as a story-teller and oral historian for a historical center near my area. But it sounded interesting and was full-time with benefits, so I was excited. The problem was the only time available they had was about 2 hours after my dentist appointment was scheduled to get a filling done. No problem, the septocaine would probably wear off quickly because it was only one filling.

The day comes and I get to the dentist. The dentist puts the septocaine needle into my gum and away we go....except it's not enough and I can feel the drill on my tooth. I quickly raise my hand so she knows to stop and I let her know that I can feel it. So she takes another dose of septocaine to my gum in a different area, and in about 20 minutes the entire left side of my jaw is numb. I can't feel anything, so they get the work done and I have about an hour to get to my job interview, which is perfect because it's about a 50 minute drive.

As I'm driving there, I'm realizing that my mouth is still entirely numb to the point that I can't speak clearly. I am salivating uncontrollably, my words are not forming in my mouth, and I am rubbing my jaw furiously trying to get feeling back. 

I pull up to where the job interview is, and I'm a little panicked, but I practice forming words and think that I can muddle through pretty well. I get into the interview and I realize I overestimated my abilities. I cannot control the salivation, I cannot make words fully, and for some reason I didn't want to admit that I just been to the dentist. Best case scenario, they thought I was having a medical emergency, and worst case scenario, they probably thought I was on drugs. 

Needless to say, I did not get the job as a storyteller/oral historian. I was thoroughly kicking myself at the time, because my contract jobs were ending and I had nothing full-time lined up. Luckily a few months later, I found a full-time job that's actually what I want to do more so than the one I was interviewing for. But lesson learned, don't go for an interview right after the dentist, especially when most of that job requires you to speak clearly and without spitting on people. 

UPDATE: Wow, I did not expect this to get as much attention as it did it! Trying to keep up with comments,  but it's hard to  with amount of responses.

For those of you saying that you've been in similar situations, glad to know I'm not the only one. 

For those of you saying it was stupid not to tell them the truth, you're absolutely right. That's why I posted it in ""today i f'ed up"", not ""today I made a rational decision"". I thought the septocaine would have worn off fast because it was only one filling. I was nervous and blew it. No arguments here about that being a silly reason not to tell.

And for those of you saying I should have said it was a medical emergency, that would not have been the truth. With my luck, lying about it would have made kharma roundhouse me in the teeth.


TL;DR: I went to the dentist 2 hours before a job interview for a storyteller position, and the septocain did not wear off before I got there. Ended up spitting uncontrollably and slurring my words, wasn't offered the job."

I have interned at a mid-stage startup and an enterprise company prior to this. Please let me know if I am just being whiny or if these are legitimate complaints:

* No real product before we started - 2 interns and I had to develop the first iteration of the main product on a tight deadline starting day 1
* No plans to hire a full-time developer anytime soon - just the interns and maybe one more intern 
* Since it's a small team, there is no-one besides the other interns to help with development/debugging - my manager is the ""Director of Software"" but she can't help with the tech stack we use since her background is purely in DevOps/IT
* Tight timeline for big projects (eg. SOA, setting up CI/CD, automated data pipeline on the cloud) with no existing infrastructure, despite interns' collective lack of experience with most of the technologies used for these
* No process to speak of (eg. JIRA tickets are blank except for the title) and so I routinely get stuck on the vagueness of tasks even if I ask about them
* Because there is no senior engineer to derive architecture from, we are working off of our fragile codebase that we made from scratch and do not see it being refactored anytime soon, which makes development even more difficult

I have raised concerns about these issues but am met with mostly disinterest.  I do understand a lot of the issues that crop up are due to the nature of early-stage startups, but I don't think all of them are excusable. I do believe however that I have a big opportunity to lead and beef up my resume for future opportunities but do not enjoy the stress that comes along with the unreasonable(?) expectations of interns coupled with the lack of help. I was thinking of either quitting before my official end date, or just taking it easy despite the deadlines and chaos until I end. Any thoughts would be appreciated, thanks!"

First off, sorry for this super long post, but I need some advice. 

Trying to get some perspective and thought this would be the best place to ask. I will be heading back to school shortly to pursue an engineering degree. I'm a 29 yo who went to college for a few semesters about 10 years ago but due to poor life decisions dropped out and started working. Since then I've gotten my shit together and managed to build a nice life. I will be pursuing a degree in the evening from an ABET accredited university, and have the choice between either EE or ME. Not working full-time is not an option, I'm a married home owner with responsibilities (no kids though). Best case scenario I will graduate in 5 years if I take evening classes year round. I'll be taking some remedial math the first couple semesters just to make sure I have a solid foundation there. I know I most definitely need to work on that and realize how challenging the course work can be so I want to be as prepared as possible.

So, for the last 5 years I've worked at a company that manufacturers products for environmental/civil engineering applications (think waste management, we make engineered polymer materials). I've managed to work my way up from a lab tech position to a project management/technical review/QA roll which I've been in for about 4 years. The day to day can get monotonous, but there are times when the work is interesting. I typically review project specifications and determine any engineering issues a customer may have, then help our sales engineers interface with and address customer needs and concerns from project inception to completion. I also interact directly with manufacturing and lab personnel to make sure we are producing to project specifications, so there is inherently some supervisory work in my job.

Most of my co-workers are ME's, Civil guys, or Chem. E's. But my interest has always tended towards EE. The subject matter is just so fascinating to me! My job is OK, but I really want to have a career where I can come into work actually excited about what the day will bring.

My question is, how feasible would it be for me to make the career switch into EE at age 34-35 as a newly minted BSEE? I most likely would not be able to do any internships since I would be working full time, and my current job duties have no technical aspects related to EE whatsoever. I realize that some of the project management experience could translate and look decent on a resume (especially since when I graduate I will have over 10 years experience doing that), but will the lack of technical EE related experience and internships (along with my age) stop me from getting my foot in the door somewhere? I don't make a ton of money now, so even taking an entry level EE position (which I fully expect) would most likely be a negligible pay cut (or hell, maybe even a small raise). I realize I'm not going to land a job at Apple designing the fricking T-1000 and making 200k/yr right out of the gate, and I'm cool with that. I would totally be down for relocating if I had to as well, so that's not an issue. My wife and I are both pretty adventurous so the prospect of moving away from everyone we know here is actually exciting rather than intimidating to us. 

Think I'd manage to land an interview? I will say that to my advantage, I have great interpersonal skills. I'm a pretty likable dude most days and I've never been turned down for a position that I've secured an interviewed for. I've also got some maturity and stability going for me, and my employer would probably give me a glowing recommendation if need be.

I could do ME and that would be applicable to what I'm doing now, and I would almost certainly walk from graduation straight into a decent raise. But man, EE is just what I really want to! You guys do everything from defense work to renewable energy to communications. That's some cool shit, and I want to do cool shit too.

So is this an unrealistic dream or should I go for it? BTW, sorry again for the long winded post but this is a pretty big decision I'm about to make and need some input, even its from internet strangers."
iialv4,1,2020-08-28,Careers based in making things with my hands,CabinBoy_Ryan,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/iialv4/careers_based_in_making_things_with_my_hands/,"TL;DR I think I finally realized that I want a career where I make things. I’ve been enamored with woodworking and blacksmithing for a few years and I frequently find more enjoyment out of building something than I do from using it. I built a gaming PC earlier this summer. I 100% enjoyed the process of finding the parts I wanted and putting it together than I do out of actually playing video games. Same thing with Magic: The Gathering (card game I really enjoy). I enjoy making new decks than I do with playing with the same deck over and over again. 

I have no experience in woodworking or blacksmithing or anything of that sort, so I’m looking for resources about how one starts out in a craft similar to that, what careers there are, lifestyle, etc... Honestly a dream would be to get good at woodworking and blacksmithing and make all sorts of crafts from trinkets to furniture to sell on Etsy or something. I want to be able to support my passion of mountain climbing/backpacking while also doing something that feels satisfying and enriching. I just don’t know where to start. 


Background: 

So I recently graduated college (May 2020). I got a degree in Kinesiology and minor in American Sign Language and I was dead set on becoming a sports medicine doctor. I had hundreds of hours of clinical and observational experience and I really enjoyed the time I spent in one of my internships, but I realized I enjoyed it for the wrong reasons. I didn’t want to be a physician, I just wanted to the mental challenge of diagnosing and coming up with a treatment plan. Studying for the MCAT, and even just thinking about my med school apps started giving me the closest things I’d ever had to anxiety attacks and I decided to not pursue it anymore. 

There’s a family construction business that I will always have a place in if I want it. I’ve been bouncing around The idea of accounting/finance and eventually taking over that aspect of the business one day, but I think deep down I know it’s not exactly what I want to do. 

I’m 22 years old and a large part of me just wants to live out of my truck and hike and climb mountains every day. I know that’s not realistic nor is it sustainable, but I’m certainly not ready to settle down in my hometown and work at the family business for the rest of my life. I want to move out west, but I also want to be able to reasonably support myself. I realize that I think I can do so with a career in some sort of craft: Woodworking, blacksmithing, etc... I have realized that, over the years, I’ve gotten much more enjoyment out of the process of building or making something that I have out of actually using it. 

I built a PC recently and enjoyed the process of acquiring the parts and assembling the thing (learning how to do so in the process) way more than I do out of playing any specific video game. I use it almost every day, but, man I spent literally all afternoon almost entranced while I was putting it together. 

I want to make things for the various hobbies I have. I love dungeons and dragons and I’ve always wanted to make a set of wooden dice. I know that once I do it’d be cool, and I’d use them if they turned out well, but the fun would lie in making them. 

I want to learn and pursue a career in making stuff out of wood and/or metal, but I don’t really want to do so in the context of a big commercial operation. A dream would be to make custom pieces or even stuff from little trinkets to furniture and then sell on Etsy it whatever. I honestly don’t care what would happen to the stuff after I made it, selling it just seems like the most reasonable way to support myself. It’s just the act of creating, of crafting, that I think I need to pursue. I think that was the appeal to medicine in a while. I could analyze and then create a plan that would heal the person, but I realized that’s all I liked about medicine, and that doesn’t make for a good physician. 

So does anyone know what various routes exist in the carpentry, blacksmithing, other crafting worlds and what it takes to get there?"

I am in my 1st year of studying physics at UCL and I need to start thinking about internships for next year. I honestly have no idea what I want to do but there's quite a few coding modules in my degree. Fortunately I have a great time doing it so I figured why not a coding job? Unfortunately, I don't think I'm very good and I don't feel at all confident about coding. Some of my compsci friends tell me that a lot of people feel that way and not to worry.

Anyway, my question is what coding jobs are there that don't require compsci degrees. People say there are quite a lot but every job I seem to find (like software developer, systems analyst, whatever all seem to require coding degrees). I found one Reddit post that mentioned working as an analyst in a bank involved 70-80% coding instead of 90%+ like most coding jobs and was not dominated by compsci grads. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm a senior in college and I finished my internship with this company's office located in location A, a couple of weeks ago. 

This company has multiple offices across the country, and during my exit interview, I said that my first preference for work was location A (the office I interned at), then Location B, and then Location C.

Without putting much thought into it, I emailed HR a few days later after my internship ended saying I wanted to change my location preference to B, A, and then C.

After a few more weeks of thinking about, I realized I was very hasty, and I regret changing my preferences as I'm happy with the location of office A.

Is it acceptable to email HR a second time to change my preferences back, or should I wait to see if I  even receive the offer from the company (with it potentially being located in office A) and find out where I'm assigned, and then be asked to be assigned in location A if at all possible? They did not give me a timeline as to when they would approach me with a potential return offer. It's been around 20 days since I sent that original email. Thanks!"

during the summer I have been doing a remote unpaid internship at a startup as a software engineer.

Well the boss had a call with me and told me he would like to start paying me in order to stay. I still have some school obligations to get my degree next summer but it's a nice opportunity since i will have time to do both. 

My only concern is about salary. We haven't discussed yet (probably he will call me next week) and was wandering how much money would be a fair amount for me to ask. I was thinking something around 400-500 euros (the company is located in Netherlands). What is your opinion?"

so far, I had gotten myself an A+ certification years ago but nothing ever happened from it, I am now looking to try and earn a security+ certification, and networking+ certification thereafter, but other than those two, I have no real ideas on what useful certifications to take given the fact that I neither have any experience (minus a 3-month internship as a computer refurbished for a company that then went belly-up per a theft of their required tools for me to do my job literally a day after a 10tv news crew interviewed us years ago, small-ish warehouse place doing data destruction in Dublin Ohio, miss that job, that was my dream job)

no college degree, and not much else to show on paper that can be validated outside of me telling an interviewer my qualifications...

any suggestions are welcome for useful things I should go for, because outside of these, I really don't have anything I can offer for credentials that can actually be validated outside of them quizzing my knowledge, and I don't really see that happening, given that there really isn't any verifiable way to confirm I know what I'm doing.

I'm 26 and got my BS in Mathematics and Statistics 3 years ago from a pretty good university. I wish I knew that you need a master's degree along with technical skills you must learn outside of college to land a suitable job (duh!). I was naive and green to think that my degree is great, and I could just get a job fresh out of college without internships. After a few months of frustrating job search, I had to take a clerk job at a tax firm (not where I wanted to be, but it's a job). Later, I got promoted to be a research analyst managing a sales tax database and doing client projects. I used Excel a lot and a tiny bit of SQL. After getting some experience and saving money, I quit and moved to a big city at the very beginning of 2020 without a job. Needless to say.... the pandemic put many companies into hiring freeze, and I've been unable to get a job since then. My questions:

1. My profile is all over the place. I was in a sales tax industry, but it's not where I want to work + not many jobs available. And I do not have professional experience with my BS degree (if mathematics counts, I'm good with numbers + Excel + briefly used R and SAS). **What jobs should I apply to?** I've been searching for entry-level jobs with titles Associate, Analyst, Assistant, etc... but many require a specific set of skills I do not have yet.
2. I would like to be a data analyst in the future, but it requires a master's degree and lots of technical skills. After (if) I get a job, I plan to start an online masters next year. I also signed up for Coursera and taking Python classes. **Is this a good plan?** **Would you recommend something else?** I don't have a job to get experience, and I don't have experience to get a job...."
iiemps,2,2020-08-28,Don't know what to do,rNbees,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/iiemps/dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm 26 yrs old and I graduated with a computer science degree in 2018 with a minor in mathematics. I made the mistake of not applying gor internships in college because I had very low self-esteem and didn't feel like my coding was up to par. I did well in the writing examinations but in the advanced coding assignments, not too much. I just didn't practice enough.  

So after I graduated I tried applying for jobs but I had no luck. I know people say to create projects to build up a portfolio but I have trouble figuring out what to create, and even if I start one I get overwhelmed.  

So 2 years later in Spring 2020, I decided to get a cert at my local college for computer tech support. The classes they offer help prepare a student for the A+, Network+, Security+, and the CCNA certs. I'm still preparing for the A+ cert and will be preparing for the Network+ cert after.  

My question is, will it be plausible to work in IT support and maybe a few years down the line move into software development because of my background in computer science?  

I'm currently working in supply chain right now in the meantime but I feel like I'm wasting my time here not earning a lot and not having a career from what I studied in college."

At night I used to pray for god to let me ""come back as a girl"" in another life. While I was never explicit about it, as if I knew it wasn't normal, through little things I said or did I think my parents could tell there was something wrong with me, and so they always pushed me to anything more masculine. 

It didn't affected me much through my childhood. At a certain point I even forgot about this wish, and when asked why I was so shy I didn't even know the answer myself. It wasn't until I was 14 that I begun to make sense of these feelings, figuring out at that age that I was different and doomed for a life of suffering was overwhelming and it's not a time I like to remember. Ever since, 10 years later, my life has been a mess. I have had no friends since, I never participated in any normal activities teenagers or young adults do like hanging out with friends, partying, going to the movies by themselves. I was always the perfect child to my parents, I had great grades and never gave them any reason to complain, but during the time I needed them the most they failed me. Back then, had I started hormone therapy, maybe I would've had a chance at life. 

Despite all of this, I still went to college because my parents wanted it. I choose a course I love, but due to depression I never could enjoy it. It was an extension of high school for me, I was the weirdo who barely talked. I saw normal girls experimenting with their styles, having fun, getting coveted internships while I had to keep still in my cocoon. I was so miserable, I didn't bothered getting connections or doing the most on each assignment. Despite graduating, it all felt like a waste, another experience I could not live to the fullest because I was disgusted with myself, because I wasn't the girl I saw myself as. 

On the final year of college I still had hopes and dreams. I thought for sure my parents would appreciate my effort, and maybe they would help me transition, and maybe a year later I would be able to finally start living my life. I remember looking at the Royal College of Arts website, imagining continuing my studies there as a girl, being able to be myself for the first time. I would also look at this famous office in my area based in the same city, can you imagine how amazing it would be to intern there while I studied? I had online friends who studied abroad and lived exciting lives, I thought I could finally be like them.

I did everything my parents wanted. I behaved, I never gave them trouble, I had good grades, I was respectful. Then I went to college and graduated. And again, when I needed them the most they failed me. That magical year filled with transformations before a daring move abroad never happened. It's been almost 4 years now, and those years are a blur, I have not worked, studied or did anything since. I gave up and did absolutely nothing during them, because I know that my life is over. 

By now my body and face have been ruined by puberty, if I tried to transition now I would never look like a woman, it would ruin my relationship with my parents, if not outright kill them with sorrow and disgust, and it would be like having a target on my back. I don't want to be trans, I want to be a normal woman. I want to be myself, have my own style and preferences, to have friends, experience love, have a beautiful wedding, start a family with children of my own.  

The guilt and shame of the wasted past 4 years kill me everyday. My parents are so worried I will not be able to take care of myself when they pass. I really wanted to make them proud, I really fucking did and I tried to get them to help me achieve that, but they wouldn't hear me. My father found me a therapist almost two years ago, but that didn't helped. He even sent me to this woman who does some kind of regression therapy with massages, which unsurprisingly didn't helped (though the massage felt really good). He just needs to put on a show so he can say he tried everything.

Right now I feel frozen with fear, as each path I follow will only lead me and my family into tragedy and suffering. I can suck it up, get a shitty job and be independent while accepting I'll never get to be myself, I'll always be an alien at the sidelines and leading a depressing unfulfilling life, which in turn will make my parents miserable and would likely end with me killing myself. Or I can transition and as I described be a failure, ruin my family and my life and either killing myself or being a victim of violence. Or I can just kill myself now, which would also destroy my family. What would you do? 

The more I think about it, the more I realize I was doomed from the start. Even if I transitioned early I would still not be normal like other girls, dating would be difficult and I would never be able to have children, which was always my dream. Why does anyone has to be born like this? I just hope the last few years of my posting history won't be completely to waste. I hope they can help someone who's going through a similar situation and help them get help before it's too late."

Now its application season and I know my interview skills and resume are not yet compelling enough to land me a job. However, I've been feeling conflicted as to whether or not to apply anyways for the experience and the small chance of getting a job. 

Is applying to jobs too early a bad idea? And more importantly, could applying early hurt my chance at landing a job with the same company in the future?

So I am set to graduate with a Bachelors in MIS with a minor in CyberSecurity by December. Throughout my time in school I wasn’t very involved with networking in my career and haven’t achieved any internships. It’s mainly due to working full time @ Best Buy to be able to pay for school. I worked my way from a part timer to being a supervisor there but alas that is not IT Experience. With Covid, my position was let go and I’ve been focusing a lot more on my schooling and career in IT. I’ve started to network more by creating and joining group chats within my MIS classes and joining our schools MIS club. 

My question is, should I further pursue my masters in MIS (deciding between cyber security or business analytics) and this time take networking seriously and get an internship between schooling and building a relationship with my professors seriously or jump into the field with my bachelors and try to get a help desk job and work my way up that way.

Thank you in advance for any advice."

Hello everyone,

I'm currently a rising junior in high school (15F). I have a very strong interest in CS and programming in general, and have been self learning for around 5 years now, since I was introduced to programming.

I used various outside resources such as blogs/websites, YouTube videos, books, textbooks from my cousins, Udemy courses, Stack Overflow, Leetcode, looked through and learnt from various projects posted to GitHub, read textbooks and class resources given to my cousins studying CS in college, to learn as much as I could about CS on my own. I realize this may appear to be, but it truly isn’t a satire. I am genuinely asking for advice.

Languages I’m well versed and fluent in include HTML, Java, Javascript, Python, C++, SQL, Python, Ruby, Pascal, Elixir, BASIC, C#, Rust, Perl, Q#, F#, Swift, Ballerina. I haven't created my own projects with them all but I have recreated various existing projects on my own to ensure I practiced the language and could understand what I was to do in various applications of it. (It may seem like I'm just listing languages and that I barely know them, but I could create many programs in all of them, I know them very well).

I know how to work my way around a system’s architecture and edit it to fit various different scenarios. Under the umbrella of computer science theory, I specifically have experience with DS&amp;A, theory of computation (specifically quantum computation, computability and complexity theory), coding theory, information theory (information representation), compiler design. I have learnt about different implementations of Machine Learning and practiced those concepts with public resources and with the guidance of senior programmers in two different companies and three different projects. I currently also have an internship in which I am implementing various ML concepts in different tasks and projects. It is a part time internship and limited. Under the umbrella of software engineering, I have experience with organizing and analyzing software. Although I don’t have as much practice with web development, I have experience working on class projects my cousins have worked on.

I also learnt ML through various bootcamps and online resources. I've covered everything modeling, classifications, Gaussian Process, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Neural Networks, all types of learning, etc. I consider myself to be generally well versed in that aspect as well and strong in creating abstract code to create programs and applications to implement ML concepts. Since I practiced with Leetcode(456 problems) as well as had the ability to write more abstract code because of my understanding and experience with ML and modeling datasets.

I’ve been able to practice ML and computer science through internships that I was able to get by talking to a head programmer that my father (works in the IT field) introduced me to. They would talk to me about what I knew and ask me questions to test what I knew, after which I would work with them for 3-6 months creating projects and programs that would support their project. I was able to practice various forms of modeling, classifications, voice recognition projects etc. There were various ML concepts incorporated in these projects.

Edit: Explained why I am eager to get a job and my situation with my parents.

I currently live with my parents (obviously), they aren't necessarily the most supportive when it comes to the amount of interest I take in programming and learning anything related to it. They understand the idea of taking an interest and learning to program, but didn’t and don’t want me to spend the time that I do on it.

They have always believed the only thing I needed to be successful in whatever field I wanted to go into is mathematics, which yes, it is definitely a large factor when it comes to more advanced programming.My parents believe the only two factors that lead to a successful future are getting into a top college and being strong in mathematics, I have been pushed to do math and participate in various tournaments since I was 7 and that is what they want me to continue to do. While also thinking that getting into a top college is necessary they think the only thing that will get me there is placing well in these tournaments.

Growing up I spent so much time on mathematics because of the pressure put on me that I’ve completed up to Multivariable Calculus, using resources that were given to my cousins who are currently studying Computer Science or some form of Engineering in India as well as AoPS for competition style mathematics.If I left my entire life to be designed by my parents it would simply be me doing math and school work until I graduate high school, be accepted into a top college, graduate with a degree in Computer Science, work for two years, get my masters, and then work in a stable job.Now in their minds to obtain this lifestyle they think while I’m still dependent on them financially I should be doing everything exactly the way they think is correct, whether they have actually thought what they are saying through or not. They don’t allow me to do anything else besides what they approve of during the day, which is just math, minuscule amounts of programming, and general housework. I have only ever been able to practice or learn anything I wanted to during the night(11pm - 5am, I was basically secretly learning). It is the best time for me to peacefully focus on learning programming.

If I were to summarize what my parents are like, they are like the parents people describe and post about on r/insaneparents, r/entitledparents, or r/asianparentstories.

My question is, since I do not currently have a college degree, or even a high school diploma as I am still in high school; What are my options to enter the workforce as a software engineer?  Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR: I am 15F, I have essentially learnt everything covered in the CS curriculum. I am fluent in various languages. Difficult parents make it difficult to take any steps in a direction I want to. I want to get a job as an SWE, what are my viable options?"

I currently don't work in a dev position, although I do work for IBM as a hardware technician and have been doing this for approximately the last year and a half.  I know a little bit of Java and Python and have web development skills, although I have never created a full hosted web application or anything like that.  All of my programming has just been console or creating small applications and running them locally

The question is what I should be doing in order to make a career leap and land a decent software development position.  From what I know, it is competitive and requirements for actual practical job experience can be upwards as much as 8 years.  I don't necessarily feel very confident in my coding skills, although this could just be my personality since I tend to be a perfectionist and like to fully understand everything that is going on.  Do positions for beginners exist?  I have considered internships (although they are unpaid), a remote part-time wouldn't be too bad to where I could juggle both jobs."

I always wanted to study computer engineering/electrical (&amp; electronic) engineering and maybe work in SoC or PCB design. But as a TCK with a French passport, French isn't my first language and even though I would call myself semi-fluent, for the past year, I've decided to distance myself from the idea of studying in French; hence I looked towards studying in the UK.

However, since the UK left the EU and I don't actually have plans to settle in the UK (don't forget COL and other fees), I became really hesitant on studying in the UK. Now, as I come from an Indonesian family who has also lived in Malaysia for a few years, my parents mentioned the idea of studying in Malaysia. So I did my research and found that I could do my engineering bachelor's in a UK university in a Malaysian campus. I do feel like Malaysia is a country that is the closest to my identity, is growing economically, and moving forward I do want to settle down there and get a PR.

But I have a feeling that I should have done my undergraduate degree in France and continued my master's degree in Malaysia (or the country one wants to work in, like most people). I'm not sure if I can come back to that decision now. I also have the desire to do internships during my undergrad which I want to do in Malaysia. There's also the situation where as parents grow older, they wish to move back to Malaysia or Indonesia to slowly retire. But if for any reason, I have to work in France or internationally, I'm not sure if this choice is right for me, I could have chosen the offer to study in France.

Do you think I made the right choice? Because I don't think I've thought it through and consulted enough people to make a firm decision, and the second thoughts are making me anxious."

I always wanted to study computer engineering/electrical (&amp; electronic) engineering and maybe work in SoC or PCB design. But as a TCK with a French passport, French isn't my first language and even though I would call myself semi-fluent, for the past year, I've decided to distance myself from the idea of studying in French; hence I looked towards studying in the UK or an English-speaking country.

However, since the UK left the EU and I don't actually have plans to settle in the UK (don't forget COL and other fees), I became really hesitant on studying in the UK. Now, as I come from an Indonesian family who has also lived in Malaysia for a few years, my parents mentioned the idea of studying in Malaysia. So I did my research and found that I could do my engineering bachelor's in a UK university in a Malaysian campus. I do feel like Malaysia is the country where I feel the most comfortable living in, is growing economically, and moving forward I do want to settle down there and get a PR.

But I have a feeling that I should have done my undergraduate degree in France and continued my master's degree in Malaysia (or the country one wants to work in, like most people). I'm not sure if I can come back to that decision now. I also have the desire to do internships during my undergrad which I want to do in Malaysia. There's also the situation where as parents grow older, they wish to move back to Malaysia or Indonesia to slowly retire. But if for any reason, I have to work in France or internationally, I'm not sure if this choice is right for me, I could have chosen the offer to study in France.

Do you think I made the right choice? Because I don't think I've thought it through and consulted enough people to make a firm decision, and the second thoughts are making me anxious."

I certainly can't for both. But I also know that I would want to be a TA for both classes at some point.

I have heard that it is tougher to rise to be on the Data8 course staff. However, I have a very intense academic course load this semester and I need good grades to declare my major(s) (I am a sophomore now). And since I took 61b with Hilfinger and Hug has different housework assignments and projects, interning for 61B may be more time-consuming.

So what would you guys suggest? Should I intern for data8 and have a potentially easier semester but risk not being able to be a TA in time? Or should I intern for 61b, have a potentially tougher semester, but be able to be a TA in time?

Also, I think I have a higher chance of TAing for both if I intern for Data8 rn. That's because, while I know it should take about 3 semesters of teaching 61B to be a TA, I need all the semesters of teaching data8 that I can get if I want to TA for that."

Short background: 23y/o CS Good Italian UNI Graduate and I have around 1year experience(more than that if we count 4month internship). 

I'm currently working as a counselor for a big european multinational corp with around 18k net yearly salary(salaries in Italy are quite low). I liked the initial projects that I were assigned to: Python Data science stuff. 

After a while, though, I've been assigned to really boring Java projects using very old technologies that aren't very useful for my personal growth and CV. 

Icing on the cake was being  assigned to a web development project when I clearly said that I had no skills for it(and... ofc they didn't really care about mentoring a junior developer). Right now I'm basically just trying to put pieces togheter in order to make stuff work for a PM that sets very short deadlines and I'm not really learning a lot. 

Giving these conditions I decided I want to look for another job, preferably in another EU country cuz I think I'm worth more than 18k/y and this is where I need some advice: 

* Which country should I aim for? I would like a country where the work-life balance is appreciated and I can have a decent living whilst saving some money on the side.
* How am I supposed to look for a job that I will enjoy? I think my dreamspot would be a Backend Python job (No FE stuff) where I'm kinda followed/mentored by a senior developer. Can someone recommend me some companies?
* How can I prepare for interviews given my very little experience and pretty poor English skills?

Thanks a lot for any kind of advice in advance."

I am a sophomore majoring in CS at a major public university. I am looking to get an internship for Summer 2021, but don’t really know how best to go about it. My college hosts a few large job fairs in the fall, but the main one is winter. I was kind of just thinking that I would go to the job fair and see if I could get an internship that way, but i’ve seen online (especially this thread + reddit in general) that people are really amping up and starting to apply online.

Will all internships be gone by the winter when the large career fair is? Is it unwise to wait so long? Should I be applying online right now? I do not have an advisor specifically assigned to me so I’m not quite sure where to ask these questions.  As far as experience I’m ahead in my major so I’ve taken some of the more upper mid level courses, but the only non school experience I have is some web design I did for a small company. I am really interested in machine learning but am obviously not picky.

Does anyone have any advice about this?"

I've looked to apply to a lot of the ones that have opened up mid-August but the problem is that I'm still developing additional projects that would help my resume. But i'm afraid that if I wait to complete these projects and just submit my current resume (which only has projects from college i've worked on and other relevant extracurriculars), I probably won't even hear back because of more experienced applicants. I was thinking that maybe if I do wait a week or two to apply then I can more confidently submit my resume and expect a response. However, the fear that there will already have been way too many more qualified applicants by that time if I wait a week or two is still getting to me and i'm not sure what to do.  Any advice would be immensely appreciated.

I'd like to ask some questions to clarify the things I've read and to help me make a more informed decision.

1. How bad is the workload? Do you really toil away in your rooms quietly every other night?
2. What prestige- if at all- does UNSW carry, and does it matter when finding a job locally? Since econ is under business school, is it much more reputable?
3. How bad are trimesters? I have really had my eye on UNSW, up until the trimesters. Is the workload during trimesters that stressful that it affects you social life/uni life outside of your degree? I want to get good grades, but obviously I wanna enjoy Uni for what it is as well
4. How are internship and student exchange opportunities?
5. Is the local job market really that saturated, as people say?
6. Are joining clubs any useful? I've seen people whine about how there are entrance fees.
7. Would a UNSW degree have any worth overseas? (e.g. London, US, Hong Kong, Singapore)?

ij0hp4,1,2020-08-29,Looking for College advice after taking a gap year,Gorgonoth,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ij0hp4/looking_for_college_advice_after_taking_a_gap_year/,"I am trying to take in as much advice as I can as I am quite overwhelmed by my future possibilities atm. Because of various circumstances, I haven't gotten a lot of coaching on how to navigate the college applications process and the financial side of it. For a lot of my high school, I thought I wouldn't be going to college. I was more interested in pursuing a trade or some form of work, but during my senior year and some reflection, I decided that I wanted to pursue college, particularly computer science.  

I perceived through that midway through Fall of senior year would be too late to try for Fall Semester 2020, as I was really uncertain of how anything worked. With COVID happening I'm really glad I decided on a gap year. I would like to attend college in 2021, with an aim for a university with a strong computer science program. 

Here is what I would consider my rough resume. 

* Good grades (3.8 unweighted GPA) but I think not impressive courses. School didn't offer any AP courses, even though many would be quite easy for me. Courses were more obscure, took latin and Spanish, computer science courses, art, and vocational training. 
* Academic extracurriculars. Won many history and speech competitions at state and national levels, competed in music (played the violin) and art at state level, won some chess events. Did a little bit of high school track.  
* SAT score 1400
* Random: Got accepted into an internship at the Naval Research Lab that was cancelled due to Covid, have done some community service, worked many jobs, did vocational type work my junior and senior years. Think I'm a pretty good writer. 

This is what I know.

1. I want to go to university and have that experience. 
2. I am interested in a CS major, as I have some interest in that field but also because I think it's a very practical and well paying major. From what I can tell from research, I *should* be able to get a good job with a CS degree and a good university will be helpful from a connections standpoint as well as internships. 
3. I love learning and would love the opportunity to study academic things: history, philosophy, other languages, etc. 
4. I want to avoid heavy student debt if at all possible and am trying to apply to every scholarship under the sun and research every avenue to avoid that. 

I am currently: 

1. Working full time in an unrelated job, just saving up money and getting on my feet financially.
2.  Spending lots of time going down rabbit holes trying to find scholarships often to find out I am not eligible for them.
3. Trying to navigate college applications, assembling a list of colleges, but very much lost.
4. Worried about the financial side of things. 

Other thoughts: I'd really like to travel and do adventurous things in my year between. I just don't know how this year will go or how the application process really goes throughout the year.

ij2m11,1,2020-08-29,Is it worth it?,semanijons,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ij2m11/is_it_worth_it/,"Hey everyone!

I've been studying sec+ for a couple of months. I haven't bought the voucher cause I'm saving my money for it. Being in a third world country, the cost is at a premium for me. The more time I spend studying on it the more prepared I feel. However, the thought that cross my mind is whether it was worth it because I know we have to maintain its status, if not it will not be valid in the future. This in return would require me more money in the future to go to events and things like that to have the certification validation to br prolonged. In addition to that, the certification is only theory and no real world practice. I understand that it's recognize by the department of defence and a lot of companies but don't all of them have their own methods for us to get promoted to a higher position? This summer I got into the BIG 5 for an internship without any certification. However, I did do coding and hacking projects in my free time (where I had to show them my portfolio) and I work as a tutor in cyber and compsci at my university, while being in related clubs to my major (cybersecurity). From what I learn from my internship and my peers at work, no one seems to have security+ only a few has CEH, CISSP, and higher ""rank"" certifications, but those people has been on the field 5+ years. I understand that its for beginners and it helps you get your foot in the door, but like for those who got into the company they want to be in without certifications but from practicing of doing projects, helping other students, and competitions. Would you recommend people like us still take security+?"

Had an offer lined up with an OEM automotive company. COVID hit and that offer has been put on hold. Been waiting since then for any update but nothing yet. I’ve always checked their website and no new positions have been posted.

I have experience in design and quality from internships but prefer design (which was my where that offer would’ve been in)

I landed an offer with a tier 1 automotive supplier but as a quality engineer. From the sounds of it, a lot of quality engineers dislike their job and I wasn’t to excited about it during my internship.

Because of COVID, should I seriously consider that QE job or wait it out until the previous automotive offer comes along?

I don’t need the money rn but I don’t want to be put on standby if something else crazy happens like a recession starts or this automotive OEM goes on a hiring freeze for 1+ year. 

I don’t desperately need the money but can obviously use it. My main concern is COVID a good reason to give up on my dream design job with that OEM and take a quality role... I’m torn with waiting for what I want vs starting my career.

And if I take this QE, I feel as though it would be hard to enter as a mid level engineer 3 years down the road into a design role...

Unfortunately am not in a COOP program like many of my friends who have all found multiple placements easily with their coop program. I have a personal website, numerous side projects in a couple different languages, some school projects as well, all on GitHub. Have remade my resume several times as well, I think my resume is quite good now for someone with no exp. The problem is, even though the whole experience thing on job postings is a meme sometimes.. even on some internship postings I am seeing things like 1-2 years of experience in Java, when the posting is for an internship, for a student still in school, which really boggles my mind. Everyone I know has so much experience from doing multiple coop placements and they usually are applying same times as me, and of course they all find placements because they have previous experience and I'm yet to get my first internship. I feel like I'm never going to get one  no matter how many projects and stuff I do because there will always be others who applied who already have experience and will get hired instead of me. Making me worried I'm going to be jobless after uni with a CS degree. Was wondering how some of you got your first internship or if there's anything that I can try differently? Maybe I just have some really bad luck

I love getting high to relax but since I obviously can’t hit a bong at home, I brought back a wax pen and two carts. 

Yesterday, my mom found everything and flipped out. She’s a super traditional asian parent with no understanding of weed. She’s literally been treating me like I’m a meth addict. She thinks I’m gonna OD on weed and she was even saying some shit about how it’s making me skinny (when I’m naturally thin and smoking’s actually HELPED me gain weight throughout college). 

The worst part was, she called me a failure and a disappointment for smoking. It’s such bullshit because I got straight A’s in my last two years AND held down a job - getting high didn’t affect any of that. Now that I’m home, she SEES how hard I’ve been busting my ass at my new internship while still applying for jobs. But weed overrides all that in her eyes and now she just sees me as a druggie. She even threatened to kick me out if I didnt throw everything away.

I just get so pissed off that she tries to control every facet of my life when I’m an ADULT and weed is legal in my state. I get it - her house, her rules - but she still yells at me and treats as if I’m 15. If I had the financial means, I would’ve definitely moved out by now. Honestly, my relationship with my mom was so much better when I was away in college and it makes me so mad that I’m stuck at home now. 

I truly hate it here. Anyone else been in this situation and have any advice on how to move forward after something like this?"

At my com college, I earned my associates degree in engineering.

I am having a little bit of a crisis, I am heavily invested in engineering and I don’t want to stop but my classes are giving me a lot of anxiety and stress

People say if your classes are giving you tons of stress/anxiety and you are doing poorly in them you should switch majors 

BUT here’s the dilemma, people tell me Engineering is hard for everyone, I’ve heard most students graduate with under a 3.0 GPA

I took a summer internship and when I was telling my managers about my courses, they seemed like they were in no hurry to do them again, it sounded like they really didn’t like the courses I was taking when they took them

I don’t understand how I’m supposed to feel bc I don’t like my classes atm they are so difficult but when I look at my peers I’m getting a similar feeling: in dynamics we have a class of about 30-40 and NOBODY seems to have any idea what’s going on except for one kid, when we solve problems in class only one student (the same student) even knows where to begin

In solid mechanics we just had our first exam and the whole class did awful! Like in the single digits and zeros 

My prof for dynamics and solid mechanics aren’t that great, dynamics prof sounds like he doesn’t care very much and solid mechanics prof doesn’t even seem to know what she is talking about

From what I have gathered, it seems like no one enjoys the engineering track and everyone says it’s really difficult for everyone, I don’t know if I should switch majors or if I should keep going

It also should be noted that my classes are all online now, and instead of a 16 week semester they shortened it to 13 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading

TL:DR It seems like no one is enjoying the classes I’m taking and I’m no exception what are some signs Engineering isn’t right for someone?"

Had a sudden shift of interests after doing a hardware internship; I really am only looking for software positions now. I graduate Spring ‘21, and I have some questions.


1) Due to my major’s course map, I could not take data structures until this semester, Fall 2020. It is almost September and I am seriously lacking on my knowledge on data structures due to this reason; am I fucked? From what I understand most coding/technical interviews would be in the next month or two; we haven’t even began the coursework yet in class. Leetcode’s involving any type of data structure are a foreign concept to me right now. My furthest current experience in programming is OOP.


2) Is getting a job at FAANG harder when you are in the industry for a year or two at another company, as opposed to trying to get at FAANG as a grad? As in, do they primarily try to get only new graduates as opposed to people with experience?


3) How bad would it be if I waited until November/December to start applying? My reason for this is that it gives me plenty of time to learn data structures, grind leetcodes, and build up my portfolio. As of now, my resume is garbage in terms of side projects. This also applies to the timeline dilemma; I need more time developing projects before applying. 


4) To refute my previous question, should I still apply even with a ‘crap’ resume and lack of DS/A experience? To give perspective, I’ve got one internship at a Fortune 500 doing more hardware engineering. No significant side projects, except for a small Python web scraper and a discord bot using node.js. 


5) Should I apply for internships as well?


Moving forward, my current plan is to seriously get some good projects going and buckle the f*** down doing Leetcode alongside my data structures course.

ijqvs8,172,2020-08-30,Thinking about a Northwestern Mutual internship? Well stop it right now.,airsoftlover05,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/ijqvs8/thinking_about_a_northwestern_mutual_internship/,"Hey you.

Yeah you. Stop what you're doing and listen to me.

You're probably panicking about getting internship experience in the midst of a world pandemic. You're thinking to yourself, ""I'd take literally anything! Even if it's unpaid, or the job sucks."" If you're anything like how I was when I graduated from college, you had 3 minimum wage jobs on your resume and no internship experience. I had just graduated summa cum laude from my honors college with my Bachelors in Economics, and I had graduate school to look forward to that upcoming fall semester. However, I was worried I'd be just another grad student who'd never had a real job. I was even in the running for a full-time assistantship with the Department of Economics where I was going to grad school, but somehow I felt like I was just another victim of the American education system that feeds off of people who never want to get a real job.

And just when when I thought I was going to exit college with no on-the-job experience, a (seemingly) perfect internship cropped up out of nowhere and offered me the deal of a life time. You speak to a recruiter, maybe at a job fair or a networking event, about an opportunity to become a ""financial advising intern"" with Northwestern Mutual, the ""top-rated financial institution in America for nearly 20 years.""

**Let me explain something to you about this internship. It is a scourge upon all finance, business, and economics students around the nation, and you should not even humor the idea of interning with this god-forsaken company.**

I know what you're thinking as you read this though. ""Psh, yeah whatever. If I don't like it, I'll just quit. It can't be that hard to do it, right? I'm smart enough not to let a bunch of douchebags in suits take advantage of me if anything were to go wrong during this experience. I mean look at the good employee reviews on Glassdoor and Indeed for Northwestern Mutual!""

You want to know why I know that's what you're thinking? Because I thought the exact same way when I started my internship with NM. I had just graduated as an economics major from my university, the most egotistical of all the finance and business-related fields might I mention. I knew what I was getting myself into, unlike all these business administration students from John Carroll (yes, that was a combined burn on John Carroll and business students).

But that's not how this internship works; it's an active brainwashing scheme. It all starts with what I'll call **The Grooming Phase**:

The recruiter you meet, whether it be at a job fair or some other networking opportunity, will text you about meeting up to discuss the internship in more depth, keeping the nature of the position intentionally vague, lest you do your own research about the company before they can introduce you to their favorite flavor of kool-aid they're going to have you drink later on (how does whole-life-flavored pouch sound to you?).

**Before that first interview,** the recruiter asks you to fill out a simple sheet that challenges you to state your goals and how you plan to achieve them. It even has you give a salary amount that would be required to reach these goals if they cost money. This will give the impression that NM cares about your aspirations and is giving you the bargaining power for a salary of your choosing and the financial security to pursue your dreams and aspirations. This is not actually the case like 96% of the time, but more on that later.

Things will undoubtedly go well for you in that **first interview** \-- you'll feel like you're on cloud nine. Throughout the interview, the recruiter will probably shower you with complements, telling you that they ""truly think you'll be a great fit for the company"" and that they ""can see you becoming one of the top performers in the near future."" If you're me, you may even be told that you're such a special applicant they're going to give you a private 2nd interview, rather than the group interviews they usually perform at this point in the process (to this day, I'm aware of no other interns in my class who had to go through a group interview, so it's very possible the recruiter just flat out lied -- a concept you'll get used to as the internship progresses).

They'll brag about all the money people make at Northwestern and all the vacations they're able to go on because you can work your own hours. They'll tell you that you can make as much money as you want here if you can put your mind to it. **Here's a little red flag that you might run across as well. The recruiter will make a point of telling you ""that this is not a pyramid scheme.""** How they do this is really a genius move, because they've disarmed any objections to their business model before you've ever had time to ask a question.

Anyway, it all sounds great otherwise. Granted, they didn't tell you anything about the position itself or what exactly Northwestern Mutual even does for their customers, but you think you read something on Glassdoor about insurance and investments, and their office has such a cool view of the lake. Oh well, they'll probably mention it in more detail at the next interview...

Which brings me to the 2nd interview. This one is where they pull out all the stops.

In this **second interview,** you'll notice a few things. Firstly, the people you're meeting with are usually pretty young, maybe at most middle-aged but more often than not this second interviewer will be a young and successful member of the Northwestern Mutual team called a College Unit Director (CUD). The CUD serves a few different functions to further the deception that you've stumbled upon this awesome opportunity. Firstly, they'll relate to you *a lot*, telling you they were just like you 5 years ago and look where they are now! **They're an idol to establish in your mind throughout the grooming process**. I mean they're wearing an NM pullover over a dress shirt and tie for goodness sake! They must be the real deal!

Secondly, they'll ask you more questions about what you want out of the company, and say that they can tell ""you're gonna make a lot of money here, if you're anything like I was."" Maybe they'll take you into one of their massive conference rooms to do the interview -- a conference room that almost always appears to be empty. But maybe you're just imagining things. This interview will also go uncannily well. I know *I* was weirded out about it, and I'm a pretty good interviewer as it is.

**Between the second and third interview**, the CUD will ask you to do ""a project"" for them. They'll email you a little packet with info about the sales cycle and different techniques for networking. Nothing too weird there. But then, you'll notice something at the end of the packet: a web diagram with a bunch of circles on it that are all connected to the word ""You"" at the center of the diagram.

They tell you that, like all successful entrepreneurs, you need to leverage your personal relationships to establish a network of clients. You think to yourself, ""okay a little weird, but I understand where they're coming from, and I can always just refuse to sell to my family if I'm uncomfortable with it.""

You finish this ""project"" for them and send it back. Almost immediately, the recruiter will schedule a **third interview** with you, alluding towards the fact that they think you'll be a good fit and they want to bring you on as an intern. *Yes! You did it! You're going to have job experience finally, and supposedly with a great company!*

Over the next few months, you'll do a bunch of prep courses and meetings to prepare you for what all your CUDs and trainers refer to as ""the summer of a lifetime."" They say this is a life-changing program. Eventually, once you've already said yes to the internship with about as much knowledge as you had before your first interview, they spill the beans -- you need to get your insurance license.

You'll start thinking, *but wait! They told me this was going to be investing and financial advising.* Maybe you even bring this objection to your CUD. Never fear, they'll give you all the reassurance you need to continue with studying for your insurance exam, usually referencing the fact that ""all the good advisors started by selling insurance and shifted over to investing later on."" They'll tell you that ""investments give you a salary, but insurance pays the bills.""

So you sink all your time into studying for the exam and partake in all the prep courses. For me, it took a lot of time away from my senior research and my mental health deteriorated from splitting my efforts between school and these stupid classes.

I got my insurance license, and finally the internship kick-off day comes. I've filled out form after form and been background checked a million times... and finally I can sit back and start to learn about the finance industry. This kickoff day is the start of what I'll call **The Hook Phase:**

Nothing close to finance is discussed in this kickoff day. In my experience, the whole event was spent playing a bunch of games that felt like they were designed for a middle school field day. They keep talking up the internship, yet they're reluctant to explain how exactly we're going to be paid. By this point, they've mostly revealed to you that it's just an insurance sales position.

**Note: I forgot to mention this, but I was told that I was going to be a graduate intern because I graduated college, only to find out later on that they were going to treat me like all the other unfortunate college freshman and sophomores that enter the internship.**

The reason I call this ""The Hook Phase"" is because you've sunk a lot of resources, time, and energy by this point, so they've basically hooked you on the internship.

Next comes the **Brainwash Phase (or more aptly named, the Kool-aid Phase):**

You're already hooked, so you might as well make the best of the internship, right? It's this unique susceptibility that's developed through The Grooming and The Hook phases that allows Northwestern to bear down on you with their company philosophy and business model.

In this phase, you'll hear from all kinds of successful advisors about their stories and reasons for becoming an advisor through NM. Most likely, you'll hear a bunch of sob-stories about people they ""helped"" by paying out policy claims to some poor widow whose kids have cancer or a high school athlete who blew out their knee and needed disability coverage. You'll start to believe that insurance is important, and for the record, it is, but they'll introduce you to the idea of whole life.

Whole life is *the worst financial instrument you could ever use*. It's incredibly expensive, you can't access its cash value for a long time, and it's ROI is abysmal compared to mutual funds, bonds, real estate -- you name it. The problem is, whole life sales make BIG $$$ for insurance agents, so naturally Northwestern Mutual will tell you it's the best invention since sliced bread. It's your savior, the backbone of your investment strategy, the end-all-be-all. By this point, your college unit director will largely ignore questions about investments because realistically, you're never going to actually use them in your ""financial planning process."" This then reveals the real kicker of the internship: it's all commission-based, aside from the $100 stipend they give you for working nearly a full-time job.

They'll also help envision a future for you and your business. They'll tell you to dream big, to believe in the system. Finally, **you start learning the phoning language.** This is the first of many aspects of the internship that give you an actual indication of the problems with the job. You learn this language for about a week, and you then begin calling all your family and friends about this ""awesome opportunity I have through Northwestern Mutual!"" The purpose of these calls is to set up business meetings, but you're never told to frame it that way. Instead, you tell your friends (who probably miss you and would love to reconnect) that you just want to catch up and grab some lunch together. In reality, all you're doing is setting up a meeting to gather information about their financial situation.

Let me tell you that the first time you see your friend's face after they realize all you're doing is roping them into a glorified pyramid scheme under false pretenses, it will make you want to up and quit the internship right then and there.

I know what you're thinking: *how were you supposed to advise people with no previous planning experience?* This is where the idea of a **joint work partner** comes into play, Your joint work partner is an experienced agent who shows up to the meetings with you, apparently to ""show you the ropes,"" but in all actuality **they're just coming along to extend their network by using your relationships to get new leads and take half your commission from any of the policies and investments you sell.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fast forward a few months into the internship.** You've called every person on your contact list, and you've resorted to rationing out any remaining contacts you could call. You're supposed to call at LEAST 40 people a day, but you can barely get to 10 dials by this point and most of those you've already left multiple voicemails for. You've come to the realization that your circle is a lot smaller that you originally thought, and with you constantly hounding friends to set up meetings with you, that circle is only getting smaller. You've messaged people on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn -- pretty much anything to get just a few more meetings set for the week, but no one ever answers back.

And those joint work partners? Surely you've gleaned some useful information from all those tag-team meetings, right? Think again. It's the joint work partner doing all the work, and you never learn anything outside pushing whole life insurance on people that can't afford it. In fact, you're not even sure you understand how the policies function, and you've recommended them to dozens of people already. In virtually all the meetings, you just sit there with a shit-eating grin because you know that if you had to run any part of it, you'd reveal just how ignorant you are about the policies themselves.

Given the fact that I like to be competent and knowledgeable in the jobs I take up, it was at this point I started to really read into the policies and business strategies of Northwestern Mutual. I grabbed ""Investing for Dummies"" by Eric Tyson (an INCREDIBLY useful book, might I mention) off of my bookshelf and read it cover-to-cover over a single weekend. Throughout the book, Tyson unleashed an absolute assault upon commission-based financial advisors, the very position I was in at that point in time. He mentioned all the commissions brokers take out of managing your investments and the financial infeasibility of whole life insurance (the holy grail of the commissioned agent). He talked about how simple investing can actually be these days, ever since the dawn of the internet; one can open a Fidelity, Vanguard, or TD Ameritrade account in as little as 10 minutes without ever needing to pay a single dollar to a ""financial advisor."" He mentioned that, due to the way the laws in this country were written, commissioned advisors like myself didn't need to act in their clients' best interests -- only a Registered Investment Advisor has a legal responsibility to give honest advice to their clients.

He talked to the reader like I wish I could talk to my clients.

I realized that all Northwestern Mutual taught me to do was trick people into thinking that investing was too much work for their busy lives, so they had to hand over all control of their finances to me so I can save them from their stupidity. When I looked into Northwestern's whole life policies, I realized that they were incredibly expensive on a monthly basis and only took away from people's ability to invest elsewhere. And our investment management? NM charges 5-10x the rate for that of a discount broker like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, TD Ameritrade, etc.

Sorry this was so long, but please stop giving Northwestern Mutual the power of your time, energy, and resources. You'll be better off for it."

And the past 2 years I had my ups and down and this is my story of it how I failed big time and if after all this can I get an internship.

Starting off 2nd semester of 1st year. Not to make it a sob story or undermine anyone else’s experience or hardships, but this is just my perspective and what happened to me. So my dad had a brain hemorrhage, my mom couldn’t be at the scene as much because her dad passed away and she just flew back half way across the earth from his funeral not even 2 weeks prior to me dads accident. She was in a state of mourning and shock. So I’m kinda running back and forth being at the hospital, being home to pick up siblings not really being at school and this happened a and 2 and a 1/2 month into the semester. Then a month goes by and I have to get surgery and this is a week before my finals I’m am ordered to bed rest, I can not get up, walk any movement below my chest, so basically I’m bed ridden (oh and after I healed from my surgery I got a hernia, so much fun if u didn’t know).I cant write my exams when there supposed to happen and even when I do write them later on, I failed 2/4 of the course that semester. I would say not attending classes after midterm really put a dent in my exam taking performance, yay! 

It was devastating, I was so lost, I never failed and a failure this early I was crushed. But I retook the courses again in the summer got an A- and carried on. I felt like I somehow pulled myself together and I’m finally on the right path, have all my courses done, set to graduate on time with the rest of my peers and I feel better.

Then came the 1st semester of second year. I felt good, confident, I made all the mistake and from now on I’m gonna do good. Wrong. So so wrong. So just a bit of back story I never took any computer science course in highschool. I took a intro to computer science + C programming and did good, it was the only source of coding I had. When I had to take my intro to java course even though I was attending the lectures and actively trying to listen and learn, I was just so confused. I couldn’t process how things worked and I was so lost. I failed every assessment before the final, but by the time I did understand it was too late I didn’t have enough time to learn everything before the final, so again I failed.


This time failure hurt more, because I failed course I was a year behind as it was a prerequisite for my other upper year course. I couldn’t manage making up for this failed course, I tried everything in my power. I still messed up and fail. I remember coming home that night in the rain crying my heart out, I felt I was the most awful person in the world I was a disappointment, a disgrace to my family and friends, I shouldn’t be given this chance there are better people who should be there not me. I failed.

After that semester, I was so determined to find the perfect formula for how to get an As in my courses. And when I did (after trial an error) I got my desired grade. Currently my CGPA is B- and I’m not complete 2 of my second year course and I won’t be able to do some of my third year but that my reality and I have to roll with it. I hope I use my formula tailored for me to get As and get my CGPA up, but my main worry is can I get an internship after all of this? I know failing these courses put me behind, but I also know retaking course I failed I can show I did better and do better, and I can come back from a hit. I also worked partime as a tutor and was involved in my university student grouped geared toward running charity event and raising mental health awareness. I wanna know from any of you folks if you were in my similar position and then were you able to get internships after 3 year of university. If you also reside in the province of Ontario with the scenario I stated above I would really love to have you input.

If you have made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope you can let fill me in on any knowledge you have. Thanks!"

As the title says in a nutshell, I'd like to get a job in the USA, and I'd like to pick your mind how to raise my chances to get a job there - preferably California state.

A little bit about me:  
I'm 25 yo (male), from a smaller country in the EU - completed my BSc in computer science 3 years ago, currently doing my second full time job (the first one lasted for a year, in my current position I had my second anniversary a month ago). Before that I had a couple of internships (2 to be precise). That boiles down to 3+ years of professional experience.

I worked mostly  with C++, and the last year with Python, but I dipped my toes into the waters of DevOps, and web development as well.

My motivation:  
I've been wanting to get a job there before, but either lack of experience, or cold feet got in the way. Applied only for my dream jobs, which of course did not work out. This time however it's somewhat different, since my SO got a full time offer there, and I'd like to go with her.

So, I'd like to get a job that helps me get a work visa to move there. Preferably C++, since that's what I have the most experience in, but any job would suffice. I believe that once I'm there, it'll be much easier to move between jobs and find the one that suits me best.

I know that in the current situation (COVID-19 and all) it's much more difficult then before, but I'd like to try nonetheless.

I guess what I'm looking for is some directions and pointers where to look for jobs, and what to do/how to prepare best for the technical interviews to increase my chances.

How unrealistic my goals are? I'd like to get a job by the start of next year/summer next year (girlfriend's deadline is one of those two, depending on how the pandemic goes). Until then, I'm willing to grind some knowledge in my free time (which I have a lot of if I want it to), get back into the interview game, may that be leetcode/hackerrank, what have you.

Thanks for reading, every little bit of help is appreciated!

TL;DR:

25 yo guy with 3+ years of XP looking for a job in CA, USA. Looking for advice how to best prepare, what jobs are feasible, and how unrealistic this goal is considering the pandemic and all."

ijvsuw,2,2020-08-31,Quitting Advertising,lemondrops07,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ijvsuw/quitting_advertising/,"Hey everyone, I know there are quite a few ""quitting advertising"" threads going on about already. But I was also hoping to get your advice for my own situation.

I do apologize that some parts may seem insensitive as I know of the struggles that people are experiencing due to Covid. 

-------
My profession: I'm on my seventh year of advertising as an Account Director for a big agency. Doing both digital and trad campaigns.

My Woes:
I'm really looking into quitting advertising, because it sucks my entire being. The long hours and the pay don't seem to match. I am handling about 15 brands—all big brands and with no help whatsoever. Tired of how management parade mental health by encouraging taking a leave, yet they force you to join x number of pitches and increase revenue by x%. Sorry to the creatives who'll read this (and know that this doesn't apply to all), but I am also sick and tired of their egos and the fact that you have to baby them every step of the way. Sometimes I feel like they're worse than clients.

My other woes:
I'm normally a calm yet hardy person. I don't normally bend my back for clients unless I really need to. But somehow the past few months had been riddled with anxiety and breakdown.

I've been asking management for any some sort of help (even just interns), but cut to 1 year of asking, still haven't gotten any help. Even my officemates would SOS for me (God bless them)

I just stare at the other account teams who have 3 to 4 members. I mean yes, they're all probably tired as hell, but not nearly as hellish as me.

Although I know this isn't a unique case, but what adds salt to injury, is that I'm an Account Director who's been doing a lot of senior stuff. It's quite painful to see the other business account heads probably having the same level of responsibilities as I am, but less in volume.

My sitch:
- Been thinking of quitting advertising since my 1st year, but I learned that I was quite good at it and I felt that it would have been such a loss if I just quit. To this day, I still feel this way.

- Have gotten my feet wet on freelancing for two years now, and have solid relationships with 3 regular clients. I do digital marketing consultancy, social media management, copywriting, and light creative work. I do enjoy it but am quite scared of its instability. I also feel that there's really no progression. Whereas in an agency, you get to become a Business Head, then a Client Services Director, then a VP, etc.

- on the flip side, I do quite enjoy freelancing and despite just doing it on the side, I do get to earn as much, or even more versus my agency pay check.

- been looking at client side but doesnt really spark joy in me (was once in the client side). And my clients don't seem any more well-rested than I am.

- thinking of looking into start ups that I could probably do with my freelancing.

What do you guys think? Are there any success stories out there when it comes to switching from agency to full time freelancing?

Sorry just realized how long and ranty this whole post is!"

Anyway, I'm a complete rookie, I don't know anything about programming besides from the 3 weeks of trying python that I did as a preparation course and python doesn't seem to be included in the original program. I've read through the course plan and I'm overwhelmed and scared shitless. I'm not a math head AT ALL, I know the basic and that's about it. I don't know if I'm fit for programming or if I'll even like it but I'm prepared to try it out. I live in europe if that's  relevant information. 


The course involves the basics for HTML, CSS and Javascript. We're also going to learn C#, SQL-Azure, Entity framework, ASP.NET MVC, project methods with scrum, Web.API against frontend, CMS and have a lot of internships. 


Can anyone tell me what I'm in for? (And please refrain for leaving any negative comments)"

I really didn't learn much and it was at least partly my fault for not taking more initiative and becoming complacent. 

I want to fix those mistakes before starting my first full time role. Has anyone been in a similar situation and were you able to turn it around?"
ijwp26,21,2020-08-31,I think I just need to vent!,EscapedSmoggy,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ijwp26/i_think_i_just_need_to_vent/,"So back in October, after 6 months of applying for jobs and 5 months unemployed after I finished uni, I finally got my first ever paid job. It wasn't exactly what I wanted to do, but it was full time, it was permanent and it was regular office hours. It was also a small business - two open plan offices in different parts of the country. I don't think the pay was great considering it was a job that unofficially required a degree, but the contract itself was what I needed to get a mortgage so I could buy a house with my partner. 

I thought to begin with the culture was a little bit odd, but then I hadn't had much experience in offices before. I'd done a 10 month internship between two offices and that was it. For example, there was a thing called a ""capacity planner"" which was basically a big spreadsheet where everyone had their own tab. They had to put in each project they were working on each month in advance and how many days on each project which would give a percentage of their ""capacity"". It was seen as normal for people to be working above 100% capacity. Apart from that being unhealthy, I didn't know how to create my own tab (the formulas on it etc) and I kept asking for help. One of the managers just said that I'll figure it out. I didn't. If I had 10 minutes to spare, I'd have a go, but never succeeded. Eventually, the second most junior member of staff came to help me - it took him 5 minutes (if that). I had months of stress over it because no one would give me 5 minutes of their time.

But then there were lots of little things that I didn't think were quite right - culture-wise.
For example, the member of staff who did the admin wasn't the best at her job (I'll leave it there) and she worked in the other office the other end of the country. The way that the staff would talk about her was just unnecessary and management were absolutely fine with it, sometimes they would chip in. I started to worry that's how they talked about me when I wasn't in the room. 

When I started my job I was given a laptop that had belonged to a previous member of staff (so not a new laptop). It was really slow and just got slower as the months went on, which I repeatedly mentioned to management. It got to the point where I was using my own phone to work from - online research and anything I could do on Google Docs to copy and paste over when the laptop had sped up. I mentioned what I was doing to colleagues I sat next to. 

A few weeks before my annual review, I had a less formal chat with a manager I had known before getting the job. He said people had mentioned I was on my phone a lot. I said what I was using it for (he knew my laptop was slow - he had even walked past as it completely crashed once). He said that maybe for a bit I just keep my phone in my bag or drawer so people don't get the wrong impression. I did and so the amount of work I was actually managing to do decreased - not ideal as my review was approaching. 

The day of my review came, which was the same day as I finally got a new laptop (I say new, it was one set aside for kids on work experience that had barely been used and which didn't actually have the memory space for all the shared documents - but it functioned so that was progress). My annual review wasn't great, I'm not sure my boss believed that I had been doing work on my phone. It was just a case of checking where I am at my 6 month point. 

While all this is going on, my house sale was going through. Then Covid happened. We were sent home to work, which I did for about a fortnight. At the start of the second week lockdown happened and then my house sale went through at the end of that week and we managed to move in. On the Tuesday, I got an email from the boss that I was being put on furlough - I couldn't work, I'd be paid 80% of my salary, but I could join in with weekly zooms to keep in touch if I wanted to (which I did most weeks). 

The timing of my furlough couldn't be more perfect. I'd just moved house so there was loads of unpacking and organising to do, and also lots of wallpaper to strip and walls to paint. It also took pressure off, if my boss was only having to pay the people who they absolutely needed for the reduced workload, then there would be a job the other side of all of this. 

Then it was July and more people nationally were heading back to work. In our weekly zoom my boss said that furlough rules have changed so it's possible to bring people back part time, so that was likely what was going to happen that week and the week after for everyone, but only a few people would be able to work from the office so anyone who still wanted to work from home vouldm

I was getting prepared to go back, I dug out my work laptop, I cleared a space on the  dining table, I read through some of the projects I had been working on to refresh my memory. Then I got a very cold email on the Tuesday (the day after he told everyone they'd be back soon) from my boss saying due to the effects of Covid, I was no longer needed and could I return my laptop and key to the office. No ""thank you for your work"" or ""I'm really sorry we're having to let you go"" or ""good luck for the future and let me know if you need a reference"". Just a cold corporate email. In normal circumstances, this would have been a meeting, wouldn't it? Obviously that wasn't possible, but there was no Zoom call, no actual phonecall, just an email.

Having a new mortgage and suddenly being unemployed was quite scary, but given the culture, I'm glad of it. But given how they told me I no longer had a job in the middle of a pandemic resulting in mass unemployment, I'm very very glad! Who wants to work for an employer like that? I am so much happier now."

She yelled at me a lot for no reason. (Not trying to say this to get emotional points, only to provide some context into this fear)

I got some practice communicating with parents during my internship but only through email, never calls. I was going to make calls but then we got shut down. The email interactions were mostly positive. 

I know communication is inevitable and it’s not that I don’t want to communicate with parents, but I am just scared of being yelled at for some reason. I do not do well with people yelling at me. 

I have heard and read some horror stories about parents and I don’t want to have any of my own. Which I know is an impossible request. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can get over this fear and feel more confident about interacting with parents?"
ijx6fd,1,2020-08-31,I had a bad interview but I still want to work at the company. Advice on making a counter offer for part-time or intership work in light of a rejection for the initial role?,Shamding,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ijx6fd/i_had_a_bad_interview_but_i_still_want_to_work_at/,"So I was invited to a second round of interviews for a small company that's very R&amp;D focused (medical technology). Things went less than ideal; while some parts of the interview were good there was a part based on solving a handful of problems live in front of them. I wasn't aware that this was going to happen prior to the interview so I had a bit of panic and really tripped over myself and my words as I tried to answer their questions. Other parts of the interview went quite well as I began to calm down but overall I feel like I had already made a bad impression and was playing catch up.

&amp;#x200B;

So I know I was one of about 5 other people that were invited to the second round. I also know that they intend to hire 3 - 5 more people between now and the end of next year. Its the technology they're developing that has really attracted me to the company and the potential it has.

Since I think it is quite likely that I will be rejected for the position I interviewed for I want to guarantee as best as I possibly can that I will get the upcoming jobs. My idea is if I receive a rejection that I will thank them for considering me, state I am still very interested in working with them and I'd be very eager for any other opportunity there such as a part-time, or an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really unsure how well this will work if at all. I'd rather not sound desperate but the reality is I am a little desperate.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on my situation or if anyone has experienced something similar?"

Background: recent MA graduate in computational linguistics, 1½ years experience in NLP and TTS (text-to-speech). Former experience in teaching and translation. Currently in Sweden on a job-seeker 'visa'. 

Goal: Find a fixed term job eligible for work permit before June 2021 in NLP,  Data Science, or ML. 

Swedish Job Market: pretty tough, most entry positions demand some sort of experience. After 130+ applications, mostly getting rejections after 2-14 days after applying. My field was possibly mildly affected by COVID19. 

At this point, I have one of two paths I can take:

Path A: Accept an internship at good Swedish company

- very friendly to foreigners
- internship only broadly related to data science
- chance to improve my Swedish (raises my chances for a better job)
- good for personal growth, fast growth industry
- chance for independent work
- possibility of getting permanent employment after. 
- Social Insurance Agency compensates by paying a little money for this unpaid internships (norm in Sweden)

B: Accept a job at big company in another European country

- good pay and visa sponsorship
- wanted for a niche expertise with a new project
- bad services (tried their crowdsourcing website which never worked, very bad reviews of it)
- AWFUL glassdoor reviews of the company itself (I can PM the company name if you want to have a look) with mentions of a bad CEO and terrible office politics.

ik0ydw,3,2020-08-31,TIFU by letting a car go without paying the insurance deductible,HellSphinx,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ik0ydw/tifu_by_letting_a_car_go_without_paying_the/,"
So I work as car garage receptionist, and we had a car accident repair on our hands. We were too full so it was delegated to another workshop, which was incompetent, did shoddy work and made us hand in the car late by a day. The customer was already livid by all this, so I let her go because she was furious enough and I couldn’t receive the payment yet due to the lack of an company document, that the other workshop hadn’t given us yet.

Of course since the work was badly done, she brought it back and we gave her a free rental car to make up for the time the additional repair would take. Now I had said company document and was going to close the insurance file and noticed the amount she had to pay. All things considered it’s not large for these types of things. 

However given how the process has gone on, I’m not sure that the insurance company informed her of the deductible. I’ll tell her when I call her to say her car is ready, but best case scenario she will berate me and pay up, or pay and file a complaint against me/our company or worst case, refuse to pay up since she already picked up the car once, it’s not her problem anymore. 

Either way, I fucked up and don’t really know the best course of action right now, besides being honest and taking what punches she decides to throw at me. Not excusing myself, but for context this is my first job, am 24 and as an intern my job is to run the garage and parts section, plus handle insurance repairs. So I’m constantly anxious and overwhelmed, which leads to honest to god mistakes. 

Maybe this time I’ll actually learn if I have to cough up actual money as punishment.

TL;DR: Let an insured car go without paying insurance deductible, client was already pissed. Now I risk getting a complaint filed against me or having to pay her bill due to her already having picked up the car. It came back to fix a mistake, and can still charge it when she comes to pick it up again, but this will probably jeopardize my job anyway.

Stay safe and have a nice day everyone."

ik28eu,6,2020-08-31,"32 years old. 7 classes short of my degree. Stuck in a career I hate because of being a college dropout. Disillusioned, jaded and don’t know which steps to take to get back on track.",rhaegar-the-great,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ik28eu/32_years_old_7_classes_short_of_my_degree_stuck/,"I went to college late. I was 21 when I started. Stayed in school for five years. The first college I went to was 1,000 miles away from home but I got a 4.0 GPA. The distance became too much so I transferred to a new school closer to home the next year at 22 (you’ve heard of it).

Due to said 4.0 GPA, I was able to get a full scholarship to this school (was very much needed as it was a private university with a large tuition; will come back to this later). I stayed at this school for four years. I basically repeated my freshman year because all my credits didn’t transfer. My grades slipped. I had a 4.0 GPA my repeat freshman year, 3.5 GPA my sophomore year, 3.4ish GPA my junior year, and I became very depressed my senior year after realizing I wouldn’t be able to graduate and ended up with a 3.0 GPA. I was 7 classes short. My scholarship ended. In hindsight it was my fault. My scholarship had GPA requirements to be renewed and I was so scared of losing it that I dropped classes out of fear of not being able to get a A or B (which was really stupid) and by the end it caught up with me when I was 7 classes short and now I was staring another year of college in the face with no way to pay $40,000.00 out of pocket or even $20,000.00 for half a semester. I was completing 12 credits a semester when I should’ve been completing 15-18 credits a semester. At my first school where I had no worries about paying tuition as it was a cheap affordable school, I easily finished 30 credits. I wish I did the same at my new school.

After leaving my life unraveled. During my internship search in school those four years, I interviewed with Goldman Sachs, Google, BOA Merrill Lynch, the Federal Reserve Bank, a slew of small investment banks, etc. I took an internship in NYC one summer with one of them. After dropping out, I was a pariah. Suddenly I was worthless. I had to take a retail job. I was 26 then. Everyday it ate at me being there after where I was on track to be. From interning at a big bank to working a job for teenagers. I’d laugh if it didn’t hurt so much.

I tried to go back to my school two years later at 28. I had some contact in the area who was supposed to help me get money for school. I went back to school blindly trusting him. It didn’t work out. I was now on the hook for almost $8,000 that I didn’t have. 

I was forced to leave school again. For the next two years I tried applying everywhere. Mortgage sales jobs. Real estate jobs. Finance jobs. No degree. Got rejected everytime. I once made it through 9 interviews at this finance related job. Small office company. Everyone liked me. It was a great paying job. Made it to the CEO and he rejected me for not finishing school. This was a job I wouldn’t have even wasted my time looking at five years ago and now I wasn’t good enough to work there.

Eventually I got a job at a bank where I currently work but it’s a far far cry from what I thought I would be doing ten years ago. It’s a glorified call center job. I make about $45K but I can’t bear it anymore. It’s not what I wanted to do in life. It’s only been two years but this job has changed me mentally and emotionally. You’re on the phone with customers berating you, being verbally abusive and screaming at you everyday and you have to deal with it. I look at my old college friends and they’re working on Wall Street doing what I should’ve been doing and what I did on my summer internship yet somehow I ended up at a bullshit call center job. 

This issue I’m having now is I finally paid off my debt to my college. I can now go back to school. The debt of $8,000.00 I owed kept me from being able to finish or transfer to a cheaper university but it’s paid off. I only have 7 classes remaining. 7 classes keeping me from being a “college dropout”. I did reapply to be reinstated. My school gave me about $15,000.00 in aid. Not really enough. But my job (I really hate it there) has a tuition reimbursement program that offers up to $8,000.00 a year. And with my savings, credit cards and maybe a small personal loan, I can afford to go back to school. Of course it would have to be part-time, online and while working. 

Another option is to go to a cheaper school and start over. This would be better for me financially but it take much longer which is irritating whereas my first school would be much faster to finish but it’s a long shot financially.

I also considered going to a coding boot camp. I taught myself front end development somewhat during the last four years. I can make really gorgeous web pages but I don’t know back end programming and not enough JavaScript either. I’m just very proficient in HTML and CSS. A novice in JavaScript and can’t code server side to save my life. I thought about doing this route but after investing so much time and getting nowhere I’m not as interested as I was before. And I don’t know if it’s my calling. I wanted to work in finance, not technology. If I did learn coding all the way I would try to get a coding job with a financial company.

I’m even considering doing a trade. That’s how desperate I am. I can’t stand my job. I’m looking at another 2-3 years in school if I go that route and go back which means I have to stay in my current position that I hate for the tuition reimbursement. If I go to a coding boot camp, I’m not sure if it will work out and I’m so disillusioned about life right now I don’t have the motivation I had five years ago. If I do a trade (thinking about getting my CDL), I can be out of my job almost immediately but that would be me closing the door on having a professional career indefinitely. I don’t know what to do."

I have a a 3.98 GPA, and already have one internship experience at a well known company and research experience. I am getting interviews fine, but I either get too much anxiety that I will fail to follow through coding challenges, or I outright fail the first interview. I keep on assuming that interviews will be too hard, so that stops me from trying in the first place.

For the past few months, I’ve been trying to pick up leet code or CTCI, but all the motivation left me. I am scared to eventually end up with no job. I’m scared to fail because the stakes are too high.

So far, I avoided posting this because I assumed I could just force myself to be motivated, but i can’t. How do you get motivated? I’m psyching myself out before I can even start."

On one hand, if possible I would like to avoid going through that (not saying that I couldn't but y'know) , on the other, the exposure and learning opportunities in audit is probably good for experience in the long run.

So I guess I am evaluating my options while I still can.

1. For those who got into audit, how was it and are you still in? And is it worth starting out in audit?
2. For those who chose other routes, where did you go to and how are you faring to your audit counterparts? Do you regret not going into audit?

I am a freshman starting tomorrow and I am planning to major in ITI. So far, I'm thinking of pursuing Data Analysis (DMAIV) and I've seen the ITI guided pathways and its recommendations. Furthermore, I pretty much read most of the Reddit posts regarding ITI topics and what really stands out to me is that many are saying it is ""easy"" or ""fluff"". Thus, I want to plan ahead to secure my career, so I asked a few current grads and alumni for recommendations.

Most of them said that either double major or minor at something. Now I do get that since it is mostly around 40 credits only, I am required to major or minor at something else. However, I have no clue what to major or minor. One recent grad suggested doing a double major of Stats/ITI. Some are suggesting CS/ITI. Now I want more opinions regarding these:

""What do you recommend for me to do?""

""Should I double major or just minor at something?""

""Also, what good courses do you recommend that will really benefit me?"" (both tech and non-tech courses are fine)

I've also seen that many recommend applying for internships because they will really help and I am planning to do that. Right now, I just want to know what you guys recommend or think.

Recently, I interviewed for a particularly big company and believed the interview went really well. I got along well with the team and was able to answer most of the technical questions. A week later, I get a call from the hiring manager and he tells me that I got the job. However, he also mentions that he will need to get final approval from upper management before sending the written offer, as it is the new protocol due to the COVID-19 situation. We discuss a start date and lets me know that he will contact me as soon as he can.

On Monday of the next week, I sent him an email asking for an update and he replies mentioning that he is still waiting for the approval. I patiently wait the whole week, until I email him again on Friday of that same week because the proposed start date was getting really close. He calls me back, and lets me know that the approval did not go through and that the position has been withdrawn. I obviously felt really sad and disappointed, as I have been trying to get a job since the pandemic started and nothing seems to come through. I have plenty of internship experience, and find it hard to believe the lack of entry level positions available. I feel very discouraged to keep applying if, after thinking I was done with the struggle of job hunting, I have to start all over again. I am aware that I shouldn't stop applying until I have a written offer, but I did not expect something like this to occur.

As a recently graduated student, I can't help but wonder if this is a common situation. Is it normal for companies to let you know you got a job and then a week later they completely withdraw the position?"

I am 23 years old and I will be finishing Electrical and Computer Engineering school in Greece soon. I really enjoy coding, I (think that I) have great analytical skills and a great problem solving ability. I have never worked before.

I would like to move abroad to a central or northern EU country and find a job there. I have searched a lot but there is too much information out there and I am really lost. I have also noticed that most jobs have as prerequisite the ""work experience"", which I lack.

Right now, I know how to code in C, Java, Python, Matlab, PostgreSQL, I know about data structures, algorithms etc. Jobs out there require many more technologies than the above. I assume that I have to start with an internship in order to gain some experience and after that enter a permanent position.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Which countries have the most opportunities for juniors? I have heard that Poland and Czech republic offer the most, and the need for developers is huge there. Also, what is the situation in the Netherlands and Denmark for inexperienced juniors?

2)  What fields of software developing/engineering have the best proscepts in the future? I like Web Developing, I am also interested in data management...

3)  How to search for a job? Where to look? When I search online, I see so many different information and I get really lost

4) I only speak English expect my mother language, will it be a problem?

5) What about getting a remote programming job? Is it hard? Do you suggest it for inexperienced juniors?

With my schooling all being online, I haven't created any relationships with anyone in the field. I was planning on joining networking groups last year, found out I was pregnant and with that, on top of school, had no energy to go. 

Add on top of all of this I am an introvert (even posting to this forum is a little uncomfortable for me) and I refuse to not respect work/life balance even while I'm in school. I've lived enough to know I can't kill myself for a career.

So the questions are- what is the number one item you think is needed to get a job in computer science? 
Internship? 
Projects? 
GPA?(I have a good one so it'd be nice if it mattered)
Plus, how do I network in an online degree especially in the time of Covid?

I guess this is half rant/half seeking advice. I'm a full time student doing a 3-month unpaid internships. 

When I first applied, I got an email from the boss (let's call him G) at 5pm on Friday, asking me to do a Zoom interview 9am on Monday. I thought it was weird, but agreed. He never sent me a link over the weekend despite me following up on it. I thought surely I'll get a link on Monday, but by 9am I still got nothing despite emailing him several times. Sat at my laptop for a full hour without hearing from him. Later that day, I get an email from G saying he 'had an urgent meeting' and that the interview was to be rescheduled to the next day. It seemed BS to me, but I agreed.

Anyway, I'm 2 months in now, and I've never been so frustrated. On day 1, I was sent a 2 page Google Doc which had some instructions for tasks, and that was the closest thing to training that I got. From looking at the edit history, I found out that the entire thing was written by past interns. My tasks are so repetitive - after a week I am no longer learning anything new. I am to message G regarding my tasks for the day at 9am, work independently, send it back to him, get new tasks, repeat until 5pm. Everything I do is by myself. No teamwork, no collaboration with other interns (I do talk to them, but strictly outside of work).

There's more. Once he messaged me with a task to do at 8PM on a day I wasn't even working. Despite that, I dropped everything to get it done. Sent it back to him ASAP. He didn't reply or acknowledge it in any way. When I followed up, he said, ""Oh that was for someone else, you shouldn't have done it"". WTF?? On several other occasions, he would send me documents with no accompanying text, and don't reply to my messages when I asked him about it. Once I finally had enough called him to ask, and he said ""I'm just sending it to someone random so that I can access it later, don't worry about it"". Again, WTF?? I get that you're my boss but this is just straight up rude??

Anyway today I got a new task (first time in a month) so I was determined to do it well. G didn't give me initial instructions so I messaged him asking him to clarify things, and when he didn't reply I called him via Zoom. Over Zoom he said I was to write \~300 words of descriptions for a massive list of items separated into categories, then quickly hung up. The list had over 50 items. It took me almost 7 hours to finish. But after I sent it to him, G calls me and told me I did everything wrong, that he can't use anything I sent him, that I didn't follow his instructions. He said he didn't want 300 words for each item, only the categories, and he said I had missed a bunch of other tasks.

Here's the thing - I had the Zoom recorded, and I had followed his instructions perfectly. Over Zoom I had asked him again and again to clarify, and I had repeated each of his instructions back to him to make sure I got everything down. But when I tried to explain myself over the phone, he just said ""No no no, you're wrong. That's not what I said.""

This whole thing today made me feel quite deflated, like all my effort is going to waste. So I decided to do more research into the company. Through some LinkedIn stalking, I found that about 75%+ of the previous 'employees' at this company were unpaid interns. I talked to some of the other interns and we all agreed that we're doing the same repetitive stuff everyday. I really believe this company is hiring interns for free labour. If the most 'training' I've gotten so far is a 2-page document written by previous unpaid interns, I'm not sure if I want to continue. I've already had bad feelings about this company from the start, with the whole ghosting-me-at-the-interview thing, but what happened today really made me mad. 

In my moment of anger I wrote an email attaching the Zoom recording telling him I quit, but didn't end up sending it. After all, this internship is 3 months and I am already 2 months in, if I quit now all my effort for the last two months would've be wasted. At the same time, I do not know if I want to continue. Am I just going to waste another month? 

This isn't a rant against unpaid internships. I've done an unpaid internship before and it was one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. I left with so much industry knowledge and skills. But this? I guess I'm learning anger management. I just feel so frustrated and I don't know if I am making the right choice by continuing with this internship.

I'd love some advice on what I can do. Should I quit? Should I talk to him? Should I just keep a lid on my thoughts and persevere through the final month? What can I do in the future to avoid this? Is it NORMAL for bosses to act like this (eg. No acknowledgement of things that I do outside my hours, constantly sending interns irrelevant documents, not giving instructions for tasks etc)?"

I am in 3rd year of comp sci major and will be applying for co-op's and internships soon. I was wondering if it is okay to write a personal project that I intend to start or work on?
